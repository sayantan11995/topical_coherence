       " ' It was hoped to secure a judicial pronouncement which would enable the Government to deal with the further spread of Communism and to prevent the movement recovering from the blow which it had been dealt by the arrest of its leaders; and there might also be the political advantage of convincing the general public that Communism was not the kind of move¬ ment that should receive the sympathy of nationalists',\n",

       " \"” ^ \\n\\nIf this standpoint is once appreciated then one begins to \\nunderstand a little Gandhiji's attitude to sex, extraordinary as \\nthat seems to the average person to-day\",\n",
       " ' The Roman Catholics have also \\nvigorously opposed birth-control, but they have not carried their \\nargument to the logical limit as Gandhiji has done',\n",
       " '^ But Gandhiji has gone to the extreme limit of \\nhis argument and does not recognise the validity or necessity \\nof the sexual act at any time except for the sake of children; \\nhe refuses to recognise any natural sex attraction between man \\nand woman',\n",
       " ' For my part I think Gandhiji \\nis absolutely wrong in this matter',\n",
       " ' Sexual restraint is certainly desirable, but I doubt \\nif Gandhiji’s doctrine is likely to result in this to any wide- \\nspread extent',\n",
       " ' Evidently Gandhiji \\nthinks that birth-control methods necessarily mean inordinate \\nindulgence in the sex act, and that if the sexual affinity between \\nman and woman is admitted, every man will run after every \\nwoman, and vice versa',\n",
       " ' \\n\\nAnd now? Suddenly I felt very lonely in that cell of Alipore \\nGaol, Life seemed to be a dreary affair, a very wilderness of \\ndesolation',\n",
       " ' \\n\\nJust about that time in Aliporc Gaol, in April 1934, I read \\nBernard Shaw’s new plays, and the preface to On the Rocks, \\nwith its debate between Christ and Pilate, fascinated me',\n",
       " ' \\n\\nI have drifted to other topics, but in those distressful days in \\nAUpore Gaol all these ideas crowded in my mind, not in \\nlogical order or sequence, but in a wild jumble which confused \\nme and oppressed me',\n",
       " ' As Lenin has said somewhere: “Any and \\nevery political crisis is useful bccaysc it brings to the light what \\nwas hidden, reveals the actual forces involved in politics; it \\nexposes lies and deceptive phrases and fictions; it demonstrates \\ncomprehensively the facts, and forces on the people the under- \\nstanding of what is the reality',\n",
       " ' But to my dismay I found \\nthat the people who had been the backbone of Civil Dis- \\nobedience and efltective work in the Congress were receding into \\nthe background, and others, who had taken no such part, were \\ntaking command',\n",
       " ' What a wonderful man was Gandhiji \\nafter all, with his amazing and almost irresistible charm and \\nsubtle power over people',\n",
       " ' He had instilled courage and \\nmanhood in her people, and discipline and endurance, and the \\npower of joyful sacrifice for a cause, and, with all his humility, \\npride',\n",
       " ' \\n\\n* Pope Pius XI in his Encyclical on ChrisUan Marriage, issued on \\nDecember 31, 1931, says: “ Nor must married people be considered \\nto act against the order of nature if they make use of their rights \\naccording to sound and natural reason, even though no new life \\ncan thence arise on account of circumstance of time or the existence \\nof some defect,” The “ circumstance of time ” apparently refers to \\nthe so-called “ safe period ” when conception is unlikely',\n",
       " ' It is too extreme, and most people decide that \\nit is beyond their capacity and go their usual ways, or there \\nis friction between husband and wife',\n",
       " ' Why should we he tossed hither and \\nthither for, what seemed to me, metaphysical and mystical \\nreasons in which I was not interested? Was it conceivable to \\nhave any political movement on this basis? I had willingly \\naccepted the moral aspect of Satyagraha as I understood it \\n(within certain limits T admit)',\n",
       " ' It condemned the violence of the sword, but \\nwhat of the violence that comes quietly and often in peaceful \\ngarb and starves and kills; or worse still, without doing any \\noutward physical injury, outrages the mind and crushes the \\nspirit and breaks the heart? \\n\\nAnd then I thought of him again who was the cause of this \\ncommotion within me',\n",
       " ' To be in good moral condition \\nrequires at least as much training as to be in good physical \\ncondition',\n",
       " ' The very thing that is the glory and triumph of \\nman is decried and discouraged, and a physical environment \\nwhich will oppress the mind and prevent its growth is con- \\nsidered desirable',\n",
       " ' His advice may fit in with \\nsome cases, but as a general policy it can only lead to frustra- \\ntion, inhibition, neurosis, and all manner of physical and \\nnervous ills',\n",
       " ' I have almost a horror of it, and instead of \\nsubmitting to it myself I want to drag out even the peasantry \\nfrom it, not to urbanisation, but to the spread of urban cultural \\nfacilities to rural areas',\n",
       " ' During the five months \\nof my freedom outside prison I had tried to discourage this \\ntendency, for I thought it premature and likely to divert atten- \\ntion both from direct action and from the development of new \\nideas of social change which were fermenting in the Congress \\nranks',\n",
       " ' More especially is it due to a \\nrevealing information I got in the course of a conversation \\nabout a valued companion of long standing who was found \\nreluctant to perform the full prison task, preferring his private \\nstudies to the allotted task',\n",
       " ' His fasts and his con- \\ncentration on other issues during the continuance of Civil \\nDisobedience, when his comrades were in the grip of the \\nstruggle, his personal and selPcreated entanglements, which led \\nhim to the extraordinary position that, while out of prison, he \\nwas yet pledged to himself not to take part in the political \\nmovement, his new loyalties and pledges which put in the \\nshade the old loyalty and pledge and job, undertaken together \\nwith many colleagues, while yet that job was unfinished, had \\nall oppressed me',\n",
       " ' During my short period out of prison I had \\nfelt these and other differences more than ever',\n",
       " ' Far from this life giving me true happi- \\nness, it would be almost as bad as imprisonment for me',\n",
       " ' Inside the prison there was no such \\nrelief, and I spent some miserable days']"
