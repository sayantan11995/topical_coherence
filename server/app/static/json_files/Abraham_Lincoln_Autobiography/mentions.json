                "The people \u2014 when they rise in mass in behalf of the\nUnion and the liberties of their country, truly may it be\nsaid, \u201cThe gates of hell cannot prevail against them.\u201d In all\ntrying positions in which I shall be placed \u2014 and, doubtless,\n I shall be placed in many such \u2014 my reliance will be placed\nupon you and the people of the United States; and I wish\nyou to remember, now and forever, that it is your business,\nand not mine; that if the union of these States and the\nliberties of this people shall be lost, it is but little to any\none man of \ufb01fty-two years of age, but a great deal to the\nthirty millions of people who inhabit these United States,\nand to their posterity in all coming time.",
                "It is your business\nto rise up and preserve the Union and liberty for\nyourselves, and not for me.",
                "I, as\nalready intimated, am but an accidental instrument,\ntemporary, and to serve but for a limited time; and I appeal\nto you again to constantly bear in mind that with you, and\nnot with politicians, not with Presidents, not with o\ufb00ice-\nseekers, but with you is the question, Shall the Union and\nshall the liberties of this country be preserved to the latest\ngenerations?",
                "Do our\nprofessed lovers of the Union, who spitefully resolve that\nthey will resist coercion and invasion, understand that such\nthings as these, on the part of the United States, would be\ncoercion or invasion of a State?",
                "In\ntheir view, the Union, as a family relation, would seem to be\nno regular marriage, but rather a sort of \u201cfree-love\u201d\narrangement, to be maintained on passional attraction.",
                "I speak not of the position assigned to a State in the\nUnion by the Constitution, for that is a bond we all\nrecognize.",
                "That position, however, a State cannot carry out\nof the Union with it.",
                "When I do speak I hope I may say nothing\nin opposition to the spirit of the Constitution, contrary to\n the integrity of the Union, or which will prove inimical to\nthe liberties of the people, or to the peace of the whole\ncountry.",
                "You have assembled to testify your respect\nfor the Union, the Constitution, and the laws; and here let\nme say that it is with you, the people, to advance the great\ncause of the Union and the Constitution, and not with any\none man.",
                "You have assembled to testify your respect\nfor the Union, the Constitution, and the laws; and here let\nme say that it is with you, the people, to advance the great\ncause of the Union and the Constitution, and not with any\none man.",
                "In a community like\nthis, whose appearance testi\ufb01es to their intelligence, I am\nconvinced that the cause of liberty and the Union can never\nbe in danger.",
                "If all do not join now to save the good old ship of\nthe Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot\nher on another voyage.",
                "It is an evidence of the devotion\nof the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and the\nperpetuity of the liberties of this country.",
                "When I shall speak authoritatively, I hope to say nothing\ninconsistent with the Constitution, the Union, the rights of\nall the States, of each State, and of each section of the\ncountry, and not to disappoint the reasonable expectations\nof those who have con\ufb01ded to me their votes.",
                "If the election had fallen to any of\nthe more distinguished citizens who received the support of\nthe people, this same honor should have greeted him that\ngreets me this day, in testimony of the universal,\nunanimous \ndevotion \nof \nthe \nwhole \npeople \nto \nthe\nConstitution, the Union, and to the perpetual liberties of\nsucceeding generations in this country.",
                "As to my wisdom in conducting a\ufb00airs so as to tend\nto the preservation of the Union, I fear too great con\ufb01dence\nmay have been placed in me.",
                "I think little should be given to any man, but\nthat it should be a manifestation of adherence to the Union\nand the Constitution.",
                "This manifestation is therefore to be regarded\nby me as expressing their devotion to the Union, the\nConstitution, and the liberties of the people.",
                "I shall soon\nhave occasion to speak o\ufb00icially, and then I will endeavor to\nput my thoughts just as plain as I can express myself \u2014\ntrue to the Constitution and Union of all the States, and to\nthe perpetual liberty of all the people.",
                "I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the\nConstitution, the Union of these States is perpetual.",
                "Continue to execute all the express\n provisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will\nendure forever \u2014 it being impossible to destroy it except by\nsome action not provided for in the instrument itself.",
                "Descending from these general principles, we \ufb01nd the\nproposition that in legal contemplation the Union is\nperpetual con\ufb01rmed by the history of the Union itself.",
                "The\nUnion is much older than the Constitution.",
                "And, \ufb01nally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for\nordaining and establishing the Constitution was \u201cto form a\nmore perfect Union.\u201d\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part\nonly of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less\nperfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital\nelement of perpetuity.",
                "And, \ufb01nally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for\nordaining and establishing the Constitution was \u201cto form a\nmore perfect Union.\u201d\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part\nonly of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less\nperfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital\nelement of perpetuity.",
                "It follows from these views that no State upon its own\nmere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that\nresolves and ordinances to that e\ufb00ect are legally void; and\nthat acts of violence, within any State or States, against the\n authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.",
                "I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and\nthe laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my\nability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly\nenjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully\nexecuted in all the States.",
                "I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and\nthe laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my\nability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly\nenjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully\nexecuted in all the States.",
                "I trust this will\nnot be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared\npurpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and\nmaintain itself.",
                "The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished\nin all parts of the Union.",
                "That there are persons in one section or another who\nseek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any\npretext to do it, I will neither a\ufb00irm nor deny; but if there\nbe such, I need address no word to them.",
                "To those,\nhowever, who really love the Union may I not speak?",
                "All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional\nrights can be maintained.",
                "The mystic chords\nof memory, stretching from every battle-\ufb01eld and patriot\ngrave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this\nbroad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when\nagain touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels\nof our nature.",
                "Witness the temper manifested by the Republicans in the\nfree States, and even by the Union men in the South.",
                "Whereas the laws of the United States have been for\nsome time past and now are opposed, and the execution\nthereof obstructed, in the States of South Carolina,\nGeorgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and\nTexas, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by\nthe ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the\npowers vested in the marshals bylaw:\nNow, therefore, I, A. LINCOLN, President of the United\nStates, in virtue of the power in me vested by the\nConstitution and the laws, have thought \ufb01t to call forth, and\nhereby do call forth, the militia of the several States of the\nUnion, to the aggregate number of seventy-\ufb01ve thousand,\nin order to suppress said combinations, and to cause the\nlaws to be duly executed.",
                "I deem it proper to say that the \ufb01rst service assigned to\nthe forces hereby called forth will probably be to repossess\nthe forts, places, and property which have been seized from\nthe Union; and in every event the utmost care will be\nobserved, consistently with the objects aforesaid, to avoid\nany devastation, any destruction of or interference with\nproperty, or any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part\nof the country.",
                "I will not\nsay that all hope has yet gone; but if the alternative is\npresented whether the Union is to be broken in fragments\nand the liberties of the people lost, or blood be shed, you\nwill probably make the choice with which I shall not be\ndissatis\ufb01ed.",
                "Whereas existing exigencies demand immediate and\nadequate measures for the protection of the National\nConstitution and the preservation of the National Union by\nthe suppression of the insurrectionary combinations now\nexisting in several States for opposing the laws of the\nUnion and obstructing the execution thereof, to which end\na military force in addition to that called forth by my\nproclamation of the 15th day of April in the present year\nappears to be indispensably necessary:\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\nUnited States and Commander in Chief of the Army and\nNavy thereof and of the militia of the several States when\ncalled into actual service, do hereby call into the service of\nthe United States 42,034 volunteers to serve for the period\nof three years, unless sooner discharged, and to be\nmustered into service as infantry and cavalry.",
                "I repeat, I would like for Col. Bayles to raise a regiment of\ncavalry whenever the Union men of Kentucky desire or\nconsent to it.",
                "It was believed, however, that to so abandon that\nposition, under the circumstances, would be utterly\nruinous; that the necessity under which it was to be done\nwould not be fully understood; that by many it would be\nconstrued as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it\nwould discourage the friends of the Union, embolden its\nadversaries, and go far to insure to the latter a recognition\nabroad; that in fact, it would be our national destruction\nconsummated.",
                "They knew that this government desired to keep the\ngarrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to\nmaintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union\nfrom actual and immediate dissolution \u2014 trusting, as\nhereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box\nfor \ufb01nal adjustment; and they assailed and reduced the fort\nfor precisely the reverse object \u2014 to drive out the visible\nauthority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to\nimmediate dissolution.",
                "Of course the seceded States, so called (and to\nwhich Texas had been joined about the time of the\ninauguration), gave no troops to the cause of the Union.",
                "The border States, so called, were not uniform in their\naction, some of them being almost for the Union, while in\nothers \u2014 as Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\nArkansas \u2014 the Union sentiment was nearly repressed and\nsilenced.",
                "The border States, so called, were not uniform in their\naction, some of them being almost for the Union, while in\nothers \u2014 as Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\nArkansas \u2014 the Union sentiment was nearly repressed and\nsilenced.",
                "To this body\nthe people had chosen a large majority of professed Union\nmen.",
                "Almost immediately after the fall of Sumter, many\nmembers of that majority went over to the original disunion\nminority, and with them adopted an ordinance for\nwithdrawing the State from the Union.",
                "Although \nthey \nsubmitted \nthe \nordinance \nfor\nrati\ufb01cation to a vote of the people, to be taken on a day\nthen somewhat more than a month distant, the convention\nand the Legislature (which was also in session at the same\ntime and place), with leading men of the State not members\nof either, immediately commenced acting as if the State\nwere already out of the Union.",
                "In the border States, so called, \u2014 in fact, the middle\nStates, \u2014 there are those who favor a policy which they call\n\u201carmed neutrality\u201d; that is, an arming of those States to\nprevent the Union forces passing one way, or the disunion\nthe other, over their soil.",
                "Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an\nimpassable wall along the line of separation \u2014 and yet not\nquite an impassable one, for under the guise of neutrality it\nwould tie the hands of Union men and freely pass supplies\nfrom among them to the insurrectionists, which it could not\ndo as an open enemy.",
                "It recognizes no \ufb01delity to the Constitution, no\nobligation to maintain the Union; and while very many who\n have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens, it is,\nnevertheless, very injurious in e\ufb00ect.",
                "The forbearance of this government had been so\nextraordinary and so long continued as to lead some\nforeign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the\nearly destruction of our national Union was probable.",
                "They invented an ingenious sophism which, if\nconceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps, through\nall the incidents, to the complete destruction of the Union.",
                "The sophism itself is that any State of the Union may\nconsistently with the national Constitution, and therefore\nlawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without\nthe consent of the Union or of any other State.",
                "The sophism itself is that any State of the Union may\nconsistently with the national Constitution, and therefore\nlawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without\nthe consent of the Union or of any other State.",
                "The sophism itself is that any State of the Union may\nconsistently with the national Constitution, and therefore\nlawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without\nthe consent of the Union or of any other State.",
                "With rebellion thus sugar-coated they have been\ndrugging the public mind of their section for more than\nthirty years, and until at length they have brought many\ngood men to a willingness to take up arms against the\ngovernment the day after some assemblage of men have\nenacted the farcical pretense of taking their State out of\nthe Union, who could have been brought to no such thing\nthe day before.",
                "Our States have neither\nmore nor less power than that reserved to them in the\n Union by the Constitution \u2014 no one of them ever having\nbeen a State out of the Union.",
                "Our States have neither\nmore nor less power than that reserved to them in the\n Union by the Constitution \u2014 no one of them ever having\nbeen a State out of the Union.",
                "The original ones passed into\nthe Union even before they cast o\ufb00 their British colonial\ndependence; and the new ones each came into the Union\ndirectly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas.",
                "The original ones passed into\nthe Union even before they cast o\ufb00 their British colonial\ndependence; and the new ones each came into the Union\ndirectly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas.",
                "The new ones only took the designation\nof States on coming into the Union, while that name was\n\ufb01rst adopted for the old ones in and by the Declaration of\nIndependence.",
                "Therein \nthe \n\u201cUnited \nColonies\u201d \nwere\ndeclared to be \u201cfree and independent States\u201d; but even\nthen \nthe \nobject \nplainly \nwas \nnot \nto \ndeclare \ntheir\nindependence of one another or of the Union, but directly\nthe contrary, as their mutual pledge and their mutual action\nbefore, at the time, and afterward, abundantly show.",
                "The\nexpress plighting of faith by each and all of the original\nthirteen in the Articles of Confederation, two years later,\nthat the Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive.",
                "Having never been States either in substance or in name\noutside of the Union, whence this magical omnipotence of\n\u201cState rights,\u201d asserting a claim of power to lawfully\ndestroy the Union itself?",
                "And\neven Texas gave up the character on coming into the\n Union; by which act she acknowledged the Constitution of\nthe United States, and the laws and treaties of the United\nStates made in pursuance of the Constitution, to be for her\nthe supreme law of the land.",
                "The States have their status in\nthe Union, and they have no other legal status.",
                "The Union, and not themselves separately,\nprocured their independence and their liberty.",
                "By conquest\nor purchase the Union gave each of them whatever of\nindependence or liberty it has.",
                "The Union is older than any\nof the States, and, in fact, it created them as States.",
                "Originally some dependent colonies made the Union, and,\nin turn, the Union threw o\ufb00 their old dependence for them,\nand made them States, such as they are.",
                "Originally some dependent colonies made the Union, and,\nin turn, the Union threw o\ufb00 their old dependence for them,\nand made them States, such as they are.",
                "Not one of them\never had a State constitution independent of the Union.",
                "Of\ncourse, it is not forgotten that all the new States framed\ntheir \nconstitutions \nbefore \nthey \nentered \nthe \nUnion\nnevertheless, dependent upon and preparatory to coming\ninto the Union.",

                "If all the States save one should assert the power to drive\nthat one out of the Union, it is presumed the whole class of\nseceder politicians would at once deny the power and\ndenounce the act as the greatest outrage upon State rights.",
                "There is much\nreason to believe that the Union men are the majority in\nmany, if not in every other one, of the so-called seceded\nStates.",
