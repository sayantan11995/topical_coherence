                "He assumed that \u2018the refusal is more a symptom of the official mind than of your own conviction.\u2019 Another time, Gandhi wrote an extended complaint against one of Chamney\u2019s subordinates, a \u2018young man, rather impetuous\u2019, prone to \u2018roughly handle\u2019 permit-seekers by kicking them on their shins as they stood to have their height taken.",
                "For his part, Chamney was exasperated with the lawyer\u2019s persistence, complaining to a colleague that \u2018one of the Agents most affected [by the refusal of Permits] is Mr Gandhi himself, who has, I am informed, been accustomed to pledge himself to clients that after they have paid him his fees he will guarantee  the issue of permits in their favour.\u2019 This was very nearly libellous, but another charge laid by him at Gandhi\u2019s door was largely true.",
                "Gandhi, mindful of making a good impression on the rulers while the Indian community\u2019s fate in the Transvaal hung in the balance, told the readers of Indian Opinion that \u2018it is not for me to say whether the revolt of the Kaffirs is justified or not.",
                "It is therefore our duty to render whatever help we can \u2026 That is, if the Government so desires, we should raise an ambulance corps.\u2019 The \u2018nursing of the wounded,\u2019 said Gandhi, was \u2018just as honourable and necessary as the shouldering of a rifle\u2019.39 In the first week of June, twenty Indians were recruited as volunteers.",

                "In a verse Raychand composed when he was eighteen, and which Gandhi liked to quote, we may see the origins of the latter\u2019s decision to embrace celibacy in 1906: When shall I know that state supreme, When will the knots, outer and inner, snap?",
                "Withdrawing the mind from all interests, Using this body solely for self-control, He desires nothing to serve any ulterior end of his own, Seeing nothing in the body to bring on a trace of the darkness of ignorance.45 His teacher\u2019s example lay before Gandhi.",

                "This order is determined both by the essence of the thing and by the tradition of human wisdom.48 By tradition and upbringing Gandhi was not a \u2018glutton\u2019 \u2013 by which Tolstoy meant a man who feasts largely or exclusively on animal flesh \u2013 nor consumed by idleness."

M. Cachalia, who \u2018lost his whole fortune rather than break his solemn oath\u2019 (to go to jail); the Parsi, Rustamjee, who  would \u2018give all he could himself, in the cause of his country\u2019; and, not least, \u2018Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, saint and patriot, who would gladly allow his body to be torn asunder by wild horses rather than compromise his honour and that of his country.\u2019 The press reports of this meeting reached Gandhi in London, to cheer and console him after the failure to get the Imperial Government to see his point of view.",

                "Polak\u2019s pamphlet was deemed dangerous enough for the South African authorities to publicly denounce it.On the other hand, his publisher, G. A. Natesan, was so impressed that he now asked Polak to write a short life of Gandhi, in a series that had previously seen profiles of Dadabhai Naoroji, M. G. Ranade, G. K.

                "When an Anglo-Indian paper dismissed Polak as a \u2018paid agent\u2019 of the Transvaal Indians, Gandhi wrote a spirited rejoinder, praising his commitment and sacrifice, and saying, with uncharacteristic sharpness, that \u2018if a son in a joint family dying in the performance of his sonship may be described as a paid agent, because he is clothed and fed out of the family funds, then Mr Polak is undoubtedly a paid agent, but not until then.\u2019 The Government of India knew how important and effective Polak\u2019s work was.",

                "This was the first political organization in that territory, bringing together Indian migrants of all classes under one umbrella, and encouraging the native Burmese to found their own representative associations.However, the jeweller\u2019s political ambitions were not so much for himself as for his friend Gandhi, and for their country.",
                "In the autumn of 1909 he spent several weeks in London, arguing with Gandhi late into the night as to the most plausible route to self-government for India.",
                "Those conversations were to find their way into Hind Swaraj, written as a dialogue between the oracular Editor (Gandhi) and the questioning Reader (Mehta).",
                "Their friendship was consolidated by a shared language and culture \u2013 it mattered that Engels and Marx were both Germans, and that Mehta and Gandhi were both Gujaratis.",
                "There were differences: Engels believed Marx would redeem a class (the proletariat); Mehta believed Gandhi would save a nation, India.",
                "Mehta venerated Gandhi.",
                "Gandhi, he argued, had endowed his comrades with the three cardinal virtues of \u2018Truthfulness, Fearlessness, and Poverty\u2019.",
                "In fact, he practises himself first what he desires to preach to others.\u2019 Once Gandhi had decided upon a particular line of conduct, wrote his friend, \u2018no risk, nothing, will deter him from going on, on that path without in the least caring whether anyone else believes in it at all, or is prepared to follow him in his footsteps.\u2019 \u2018No earthly temptations,\u2019 continued Mehta, were \u2018too strong\u2019 for Gandhi, and \u2018none of them can make him swerve from the noble path that he has chalked out for himself.",

                "It is no exaggeration to say that in this age of materialism it is not possible to come across another man who lives the Ideal life he preaches.\u2019 Gandhi and Pranjivan Mehta corresponded regularly, and while we mostly have one side of the correspondence, it is revealing enough.",
                "Gandhi thus wrote to Mehta on 1 July 1911 that \u2018it would be a mistake if you imagined that we would get the young men we wanted the moment I got to India.",
                "Gandhi answered that \u2018I do not think Polak will become an Anglo-Indian out and out\u2019 (Mehta must have implied he would).",
                "Mehta had called Polak \u2018hot-tempered\u2019; Gandhi agreed, but added that \u2018his heart is absolutely frank and he is unswerving in his duty\u2019.",
                "Mehta had suggested that Polak was developing a swollen head; Gandhi answered that \u2018praise is everyone\u2019s enemy; how, then, can it be otherwise with him?",
                "He is as honest as he is frank.\u2019  Among the things Mehta and Polak had argued about was Gandhi\u2019s future.",
                "Polak thought Gandhi still had much work to do in South Africa.",
                "Polak replied angrily that no one could keep Gandhi from doing what he wanted; Gandhi\u2019s conscience was his own, and for the moment it told him that he was to remain in South Africa rather than return to India.",

                "Before he left, Gandhi made him take a vow that while he was away, he would not get married, would not \u2018look lustfully upon any woman\u2019, would not \u2018spend any money beyond necessaries befitting the position of a simple-living poor farmer\u2019, and would only travel third class by land or on sea.",
                "To soften the blow, Gandhi and Kasturba baked their friend several tins\u2019 worth of biscuits and cake for the journey.24 In Europe Kallenbach met Dr Mehta, and spent a day walking with him in the Ardennes.25 They got along well enough, but when he returned to England, Kallenbach, like Mehta, seems to have quarrelled with Henry Polak.",
                "He wrote to Gandhi giving his version of the disagreement.",
                "Gandhi replied that \u2018your analysis of Polak is in the main true.",
                "Still it bears repetition in order to enable us to exercise the virtue of charity.\u2019 Mehta, Polak and Kallenbach were all competing for Gandhi\u2019s friendship \u2013 and benediction.",
                "He thought Gandhi excessive in his praise of his European associates.",
                "Gandhi agreed that  it is likely that whites entertain more hatred towards us than we do towards them.",
                "In October Gandhi wrote to Mehta, \u2018I know you are very keen that I should leave for India at an early date, and stay there for good.",
                "\u2018Please do not think,\u2019 answered Gandhi, \u2018that I shall incur the sin of falling into the delusion that I should serve the entire world.",
                "I well realize that my work can only be in India.\u2019 Mehta, meanwhile, had sent a journalist named Manilal Doctor to work with Gandhi.",
                "Doctor had once run a newspaper in Mauritius; the hope was that he would take over Indian Opinion when Gandhi returned to India.",
                "Gandhi thought the young man \u2018pleasant and good-natured\u2019, but complained that he shirked physical labour.",

                "\u2018Since Mr Gandhi left Natal,\u2019 wrote the African Chronicle in June 1910, \u2018the Indian public work in this colony has not been conducted in that steady manner which predominates in him as one of the excellent qualities.\u2019 Slowly, however, the language became more bold.",
                "Gandhi was still praised, but his policies questioned.",
                "In March 1911, Aiyar called Gandhi \u2018our great leader\u2019, \u2018that noble soul\u2019, the \u2018originator and architect\u2019 of the Indian struggle, yet wondered why he asked only for the form rather than the substance of theoretical equality.",
                "Gandhi was urged to \u2018fight for our birthright of British citizenship to a finish in honour and glory of our motherland.\u2019 In September 1911 Aiyar got entangled in a bitter fight with Gandhi\u2019s former clerk and long-time devotee, Joseph Royeppen.",

                "Gandhi, in reply, advocated a more incrementalist approach.",
                "I know, too, that the thing is quite capable of being done, but one man at least must be prepared to devote the whole of his time to the matter.37 The letter concisely captures Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of non-violent resistance to unjust laws.",
                "In April 1912, Gandhi wrote to Ratan Tata, giving an account of the struggle he had so generously supported.",
                "These students were taught that \u2018they are first Indians and everything else after that, and that, while  they must remain absolutely true to their own faiths, they should regard with equal respect those of their fellow-pupils.\u2019 With his letter, Gandhi enclosed a statement of accounts.",

                "Still, there is no doubt that there was a family resemblance between what Seme sought to do with the Africans and what Gandhi had already done with the Indians \u2013 that is to help them overcome distinctions of sect and tribe, and present a united front to the rulers.",
                "Their Congress, said Seme, would \u2018together devise ways and means of forming our national union for the purpose of creating national unity and defending our rights and privileges.\u2019 The attorney noted that this was \u2018the first time that so many elements representing different tongues and tribes ever attempted to co-operate under one umbrella in one great house.\u2019 John Dube, the first president of the Native National Congress, was a neighbour and acquaintance of Gandhi\u2019s in Natal.",

                "Although Mehta mentioned no names, it is clear that he was comparing Gandhi to the medieval saints Nanak and Kabir, and, going further back, to Mahavira and Gautama Buddha, founders of Jainism and Buddhism respectively.",
                "He suggested that had Gandhi been born in the eighteenth century, India would not have been colonized by the British.",

                "The document transferred to these five others Gandhi\u2019s right, title and interest in the land and machinery of Phoenix, and listed eight aims by which the Farm would be run: namely, to earn a livelihood as far as possible by one\u2019s own labour; to promote better relations between Indians and Europeans; to \u2018follow and promote the ideas\u2019 set forth by Tolstoy and Ruskin; to promote \u2018purity of private life in individuals by living pure lives themselves\u2019; to start a school to educate children mainly in their own vernaculars; to establish a sanitation and hygiene institute; to \u2018train themselves generally for the service of humanity\u2019; and to publish Indian Opinion for the advancement of these ideals.",

                "\u2026 I do feel that the aims of Phoenix as well as the way of life there surpass those of the [Servants of India] Society.57 There is a clear sense here that, as a person, social worker and political activist, Gandhi had equalled, if not surpassed, Gokhale.",
                "A large crowd of Indians had gathered at the quayside, making what Kallenbach (who was present) called \u2018peculiar scenes\u2019, a reference to the raising of flags and the shouting of slogans.59 Gandhi and a senior Muslim cleric, Imam Bawazeer, boarded the ship to escort the visitor ashore.",

                "Gokhale had asked that Gandhi be allowed to come with him, but the request was refused.71 Meeting the ministers, he urged the abolition of the \u00a33 tax and the admission of a select number of educated Indians to the Transvaal.",
                "\u2018You must return to India in a year,\u2019 he told Gandhi.",
                "But \u2018if it has to be resumed,\u2019 said Gokhale, \u2018or if you have to enter on other struggles of a like nature for  justice denied or injustice forced on you, remember that the issue will largely turn on the character you show, on your capacity for combined action, on your readiness to suffer and sacrifice in a just cause.\u2019 Overlapping with Gokhale\u2019s trip to South Africa was the visit of a rather more obscure friend of Gandhi\u2019s.",
                "Gandhi himself was criss-crossing the country with his mentor, and appears to have hardly seen Maud at all.",
                "In London, Gokhale had been impressed by Maud Polak\u2019s commitment; now, in South Africa, he was even more impressed by Sonja Schlesin, a young woman who worked for Gandhi without having a romantic interest in him.",

                "The next day, Gandhi wrote to Gokhale that \u2018I want to be a worthy pupil of yours.",
                "Ample fasting, strict adherence to two meals, entire absence of condiments of all kinds from your food, omission of pulses, tea, coffee, etc., regular taking of Kuhne baths, regular and brisk walking in the country (not the pacing up and down for stimulating thought), ample allowance of olive oil and acid fruit and gradual elimination of cooked food \u2013 and you will get rid of your diabetes and add a few more years than you think to your life of service in your present body.81 In a month spent in each other\u2019s company, Gokhale and Gandhi must have made manifest their many differences of opinion \u2013 with regard to the respective merits of petitioning versus protest, modern versus traditional civilization, allopathic versus naturopathic systems of medicine.",
                "Speaking to Gandhi, watching him at work among his compatriots, Gokhale nonetheless came away with a distinctly elevated view of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s personality and achievements.",
                "In  a public meeting on his return to Bombay \u2013 held on 13 December \u2013 Gokhale said Gandhi was \u2018without doubt made of the stuff of which heroes and martyrs are made.",
                "He has in him the marvellous spiritual power to turn ordinary men around him into heroes and martyrs.\u2019 He told the assembled Indians of Gandhi\u2019s sacrfices, of how he built up the movement in South Africa, and how he inspired others to follow him.",
                "And yet these men braved the horrors of gaol-life in the Transvaal and some of them braved them again and again rather than submit to degrading legislation directed against their country \u2026 [T]hey were touched by Gandhi\u2019s spirit and that had wrought the transformation, thus illustrating the great power which the spirit of man can exercise over human minds and even over physical surroundings.",
                "Gokhale defended Gandhi against his critics at home and abroad.",
                "Some radicals thought Gandhi should have argued for an \u2018open door\u2019 policy, whereby Indians could freely migrate to South Africa.",
                "He claimed that the \u2018theoretical rights\u2019 that Gandhi had so valiantly fought for \u2018would no doubt steadily grow more and more into rights actually enjoyed in practice, but that was a matter of slow growth and it depended on a large measure upon the improvement of their position in India itself.\u2019 Saints, it appears, could or should be pragmatists as well.",

                "Seeking simultaneously to be a conscientious (by his lights) teacher, father, editor, opponent of racial injustice (whether suffered by hawkers, merchants, professionals, or labourers) and multi-purpose reformer (of diet, health, sexual attitudes, relations between religions), Gandhi would, from time to time, find the obligations of one calling competing with the demands of another, the clash leading to a loss of temper or loss of direction, this then recognized and, if possible, rectified.",
                "Gandhi crossed into Transvaal without being detained.",
                "The newspaper claimed that while Gandhi and his colleague A. M. Cachalia \u2013 chairman of the British Indian Association \u2013 were \u2018proclaiming the opening of hostilities, and urging their compatriots to fill the gaols, there are growls and curses from the rank and file, open defiance, and frank avowals of contentment with the present order of things\u2019.",
                "That the arrests so far had been of people from Natal showed, to the newspaper, that \u2018whatever measure of success Mr Gandhi achieves amongst the poorer and more ignorant of his countrymen, the wealthy Indian traders [of the Transvaal] \u2026 are making no secret of their antagonism to the passive resistance campaign.\u2019 The same day, Gandhi wrote to the Transvaal Leader disputing this story.",
                "Like the other resisters, he chose to go to jail rather than pay a fine.Two of the Gandhi boys were now in prison; perhaps the eldest, an experienced jailbird, could be summoned to join them.",

                "Smuts said \u2018Gandhi was suffering from one of his periodic attacks of mental derangement, and was, for the time being, attracted by the role of prophet and martyr.\u2019 The General \u2018doubted whether there was much real enthusiasm or financial support behind it [the passive resistance movement], and he rather expected that it would soon collapse.\u2019 Asked about specific grievances he said, with regard to the marriage question, that it was impossible to give \u2018legal recognition to a polygamous system\u2019.",

                "In the days after the contentious meeting, Gandhi\u2019s leadership was endorsed by the Hindustani Association of Durban and by a group of Muslim merchants.",
                "As Gandhi admiringly noted, \u2018the presence of these brave women who had never suffered hardship and had never spoken at public meetings acted like electricity, and the men left their work\u2019.",
                "In the second and third weeks of October, Gandhi addressed crowds of striking workers in Durban, Newcastle, Hatting Spruit and other towns in Natal.",
                "The gatherings were large and densely packed, with several thousand Indians come to support their leader.26 On 24 October, Gandhi wrote to Maganlal that \u2018great things are happening in Newcastle.",
                "There is a move to lead a march of 2,000 men to Transvaal.\u2019 The next day he told mine and plantation owners that their workers were on strike because of the Government\u2019s failure to honour their promise to Gokhale to abolish the \u00a33 tax.A Tamil poster circulated in the plantations quoted Gandhi as saying: \u2018I have no grievances against the employers \u2026 I ask [them] to assist in getting the tax repealed.",
                "Smuts wired the mineowners\u2019 association that to  repeal the tax now, under the pressure of Gandhi and company, \u2018would be [a] public disaster\u2019.",
                "He claimed that \u2018with Gandhi repeal of tax is an afterthought, and is intended to influence Natal Indians to whom the real grounds on which he has started passive resistance and which never included this tax, do not appeal.\u2019 The evidence on this question supports Gandhi rather than Smuts.",

                "\u2018Here he is,\u2019 wrote Polak of Gandhi, a slim-built man of middle height, the tanned cheeks a little sunken, bare-headed, somewhat close- cropped and grizzled, with a small moustache.",
                "You see him walking along the road in profound meditation or animatedly conversing with a companion, the shoulders bent, the head thrown slightly forward, his arms behind his back, the left wrist grasped in the right hand, the sandaled feet outspread \u2013 a not too gainly walk, rather rapid, for he is an accomplished pedestrian from long practice, preference, and force of circumstance.33 Gandhi liked walking, but this was a very long march, even by his standards.",
                "The procession was preceded by two men carrying black flags and all wore rosettes to mark the present sufferings of the community.35 The same day, Gandhi set out for the Transvaal border with some 200 men, women and children.Other batches followed.",
                "A journalist from the Natal Advertiser, visiting Charlestown on 5 November, reported that \u2018the whole appearance of the town resembled nothing but an Indian bazaar.\u2019 He found Gandhi \u2018at the back of an Indian store, in the yard, serving out curry and rice to his followers, who marched up, and each man received his quota.",
                "Till they reached the border, Gandhi was at the rear, but once they entered Volksrust he led from the front.",
                "He thought \u2018Mr Gandhi appeared to be in a position of much difficulty.",
                "Like Frankenstein, he found his monster an uncomfortable creation, and he would be glad to be relieved of further responsibility for its support.\u2019 If the Government arrested Gandhi, argued Smuts, then \u2018he would be able to disclaim responsibility for the maintenance of his array of strikers.\u2019 The longer the march continued, the more difficult it would be to feed them, at which point the strikers would themselves \u2018ask to be sent back to their work in Natal\u2019.",
                "The police, however, were pressing Smuts to arrest Gandhi.",
                "On the evening of the 6th, when the march had reached the town of Palmford, Gandhi was taken into custody.",
                "Gandhi appealed for bail, which \u2018was strongly opposed by the Public Prosecutor\u2019.",
                "No sooner was Gandhi granted bail than the two of them jumped into a car to rejoin the marchers.",
                "At Standerton they were stopped, and Gandhi was detained once more.",
                "He was taken to court, where he was released on bail and returned to the march.44 His antagonist Montford Chamney then came down from Johannesburg to stop Gandhi, accompanied by a posse of police.",
                "But every class of marcher seemed to carry something \u2013 a babe, a basket or perhaps a few household chattels.45 The police halted the column, and a warrant for Gandhi\u2019s arrest was executed.",
                "From there he wrote a remarkable letter to the magistrate, which, among other things, gives the lie to Smuts\u2019 charge that Gandhi was keen to wash his hands of the strikers: Sir, I have the honour to request you to lay before the Government by telegram the following facts: Whilst I was marching from Charlestown with nearly 2,000 men women and children to Tolstoy Farm Lawley, nearly 150 men women and children were footsore and otherwise disabled had to be left at Paarsdekop at the store of Mr M. C. Desai.",
                "\u2018The men appear in no way dispirited after their fruitless tramp,\u2019 reported one observer, \u2018and expressed their intention to further the passive resistance movement again when Mr Gandhi is at liberty.\u2019 On 11 November Gandhi was tried at Dundee, charged with inducing indentured labour to leave Natal.",
                "In his statement, Gandhi referred to himself as an old resident of Natal and a member of its Bar, who \u2018was in honour bound, in view of the position of things between Mr Smuts and Professor Gokhale, to produce a striking demonstration\u2019.",
                "Three days later Gandhi was tried at Volksrust, charged this time with bringing prohibited immigrants into Transvaal.",
                "The point made, Gandhi added that he was aware that the steps he had taken were fraught with the greatest risks and intense personal suffering by those who had accepted his advice, but after very mature consideration, based on twenty years experience in South Africa, he had come to the conclusion that nothing short of such suffering would move the conscience of the Government, as also of the [white] inhabitants of the Union, of which, in spite of the so-called breach of the statutory laws, he claimed to be a sane and law-abiding citizen.",
                "As the march swelled and its leader was arrested, released, arrested again, released again, Polak and Kallenbach supervised it in the periodic, enforced absences of Gandhi.",
                "Having tried and failed with these methods, their leader, Gandhi, then introduced what Kallenbach considered \u2018the only effective means of securing redress, viz., passive resistance, a means in which I, for many years a disciple of Tolstoy, thoroughly believe.\u2019 Polak spoke of his long association with the Indians of South Africa, and his work as editor of their weekly newspaper.",
                "Polak called the tax \u2018a relic of barbarism\u2019, whose \u2018direct effect is to drive the tax-payers back to conditions of servitude, dishonourable to British traditions of freedom, or to expel them from this country, which has reaped the fruits of their labour for a period of years.\u2019 These statements of Gandhi\u2019s closest colleagues were both deeply moving.",

                "At one major estate, Mount Edgecombe, the managers \u2018enrolled a corps of special police, and drew a cordon around the estate, with the idea of keeping out the agitators and apostles of Gandhi, and of protecting loyal Indians from intimidation.\u2019 The coercion failed, with an estimated 1,500 out of the 2,700 labourers at Mount Edgecombe downing tools and going off to join their fellows.",

                "At a well-attended meeting, the strikers were \u2018unanimous in their decision, which was a refusal to work until the \u00a33 tax had been repealed, and until Gandhi was released.\u2019 On Saturday, 15 November, 1,200 Indians gathered in Pietermaritzburg to discuss the state of their movement.",
                "One Ramsingh pointed out that \u2018Mr Gandhi had gone to prison for them all, and he wanted to know whether they were going to leave him to face the trouble alone,  or whether they were going to join forces with him.\u2019 A priest named Dhonduram Maharaj praised Gandhi for bringing Hindus and Muslims together.",

                "A \u2018profound impression was caused when Mr Andrews recited, with beautiful accent and effect, a Sanskrit mantra, which was given to him as a message to South African Indians by the poet Tagore.\u2019So reported the Natal Mercury, whereas Indian Opinion highlighted the songs sung in the visitor\u2019s honour by Gandhi\u2019s old schoolmate Sheikh Mehtab.",
                "The songs rendered at this Durban reception, reported Indian Opinion, had \u2018been specially composed by Mr Shaikh Mehtab as a tribute to the devotion of Messrs. Andrews and Pearson to the Indian cause\u2019.6 Also present at the meeting was Gandhi\u2019s friend from Cape Town, Betty Molteno.",
                "She, too, must play her God-appointed part \u2013 and in this 20th century her part will be a great one.7 The morning after the Durban meeting, the clergymen went off with Gandhi to Phoenix.",

                "Thus Gandhi\u2019s cable of 3 January, which Gokhale passed on to Harilal himself.",
                "We do not know why \u2013 whether Gokhale wrote again to Gandhi pleading on behalf of the boy, whether Gandhi himself chose not to press the point, whether Harilal decided to follow his own instincts rather than his father\u2019s command.",

                "On 6 January, \u2018much to his surprise\u2019, the General received a letter from Gandhi asking for an appointment.12 Smuts said he could meet Gandhi on either Friday the 9th or Saturday the 10th.",

                "Andrews was impressed by Gandhi\u2019s \u2018gentlemanly conduct\u2019, as he waited patiently while Smuts \u2018put him off again and again on account of the General Strike\u2019.",
                "They had a brief meeting on the 13th, when, as Andrews reported, Gandhi \u2018was so kindly and courteous that the old relation of respect between them gradually came back again\u2019.",
                "He reminded the  Governor-General of how, in Johannesburg in 1908, Gandhi had been assaulted and nearly killed \u2018because after taking a vow he had come to an agreement\u2019 with the Government.",
                "A capitulation on those two points would make Gandhi vulnerable to another attempt on his life.",
                "Gandhi met Smuts for a longer conversation on the 16th.",
                "Smuts was sympathetic, but requested Gandhi to state these issues in front of the Enquiry Commission, who, in turn, could then formally recommend these changes to the Government.",
                "Gandhi answered that they could not go back now on their boycott of the Commission.",
                "Nevertheless, a tolerably practical understanding has been reached.16 Gandhi and Andrews returned to Durban.",
                "Letters and phone calls passed between Phoenix and Pretoria, with Smuts assuring Gandhi that he need feel no serious apprehensions as to the probable nature of the Commission\u2019s recommendations on his four points and as to the Government\u2019s intentions, but he should promise not to revive passive resistance until the Commission had reported and the Government had been given an opportunity of acting on the report.17 Gandhi also had several long meetings with Sir Benjamin Robertson, which focused on the marriage question.",

                "Gandhi further asked that wives who were de facto monogamous be admitted into South Africa; and that existing plural wives of Indians who had rights of residence in South Africa be registered.",
                "Gandhi argued that an acceptance of his proposals \u2018as to legal recognition of de facto monogamous unions enables the State to popularise monogamy to an extent hitherto unknown\u2019 in South Africa.",
                "This stressed Gandhi\u2019s goodness of character, but also the fragility of his nerves, on edge as a consequence of the crises he had faced these past few months.",
                "When the General\u2019s letter outlining the settlement came, Gandhi was \u2018terribly excited and said that from first to last the letter was a studied insult\u2019.",

                "It lay in General Smuts not recognizing the honourableness of Mr Gandhi\u2019s motives.\u2019 The priest went up to meet Smuts once more, and had a clause inserted that satisfied Gandhi\u2019s honour.",
                "It had been a close-run thing, wrote Andrews to Gokhale, which he had recounted in detail as it bore on Gandhi\u2019s own future and the future of the Indians in South Africa.",
                "In a magisterial analysis of Gandhi\u2019s personality, Andrews observed, His work in S. Africa is done \u2013 and nobly done: and this time it was very near to a collapse.",

                "His month with Gandhi had inspired him to write a book on the comparative history of religion, on how the \u2018persistent voice of conscience\u2019 had \u2018become marvellously developed and expressed in the two great races which possessed religious genius, \u2013 the Semitic and the Indo-Aryan\u2019.",
                "The writing of this book would mean \u2018a lonely pilgrimage\u2019, because \u2013 no doubt under the influence of his new Hindu friend \u2013 it would mean \u2018giving up claims for the Christian position which everyone in the West whom I know and love \u2026 could not conceive of doing\u2019.24 Shortly after his new friend had left, a letter arrived for Gandhi from his oldest friend, Pranjivan Mehta.",
                "This asked for a receipt for Mehta\u2019s contributions in 1913 \u2013 amounting to the considerable sum of Rs 32,000 \u2013 and added: \u2018I hope the [proposed] new Bill [embodying the agreement between Gandhi and Smuts] has mitigated your hardships.\u2019Left unspoken was the other (and greater) hope, so long and so passionately held by Mehta, that his friend would now move back to India and prepare to take charge of the political movement there.",
                "There had been several occasions in the past when Gandhi had been on the verge of returning home.",
                "Had this been accepted, Gandhi would have rejoined Kasturba and the children, and had a third try at establishing himself in the Bombay High Court.",

                "I hope to do better in the Motherland if I am accepted.\u2019 Gandhi was still in Cape Town, in part because he wished to be at hand while the report of the Enquiry Commission was finalized, and in part because Kasturba was very ill. She could not sit without support, and could not eat solid food either.",
                "Gandhi was anxious about the settlement, and anxious about his wife\u2019s health.",
                "She was claiming Gandhi\u2019s \u2018undivided attention\u2019; she wanted him \u2018by her side the whole day\u2019.",

                "This statement sounds very harsh, but I see extreme insincerity in your letters.\u2019 Gandhi sent Harilal\u2019s letter to Manilal.",
                "Once they returned, said Gandhi to Manilal, \u2018It is my desire to see you esteemed in India as a brahmachari of a high order, your conduct so naturally well-disciplined that it cannot but produce an impression on others.",
                "Gandhi attributed the recovery to his own methods of healing.",
                "Gandhi believed that cancer \u2018never yields to medical treatment but it must yield to fasting treatment if the patient has stamina\u2019.32 He put his wife on an extended fast, feeding her only with neem leaves in water.",

                "Gandhi\u2019s other brother, Karsandas, had died the previous June.",
                "On 11 March, Gandhi wrote to his nephew Chhaganlal that he had heard that \u2018they are plotting again in Johannesburg to take my life.",
                "That would indeed be welcome and a fit end to my work.\u2019 In case he was killed, Gandhi left instructions on what the family must do.",
                "Gandhi had to provide for five widows, these being his sister, the wives of his two dead brothers, and two other family members.",
                "If Gandhi was now murdered by his enemies, the money for this could be taken from Pranjivan Mehta.",
                "Gandhi had often spoken here to appreciative and even admiring crowds.",
                "It was ambivalent about Gandhi, acknowledging that he was \u2018the recognised leader of the Indian community\u2019, but regretting that he and his followers chose \u2018entirely to ignore the Commission\u2019, so that no witnesses came forward to substantiate the allegations of the excessive use of force against the strikers.",
                "Gandhi was pleased with the report, whose promptness justified his boycott.",
                "Sadhva, a Kannada weekly published in Mysore, published a striking paean to the distinctiveness of Gandhi\u2019s political method.",

                "Gandhi dismissed the speculation.",
                "Kasturba then accused Gandhi of shielding Jeki.",
                "Otherwise he might have remained in her asleep and unnoticed.42 As with Harilal, Gandhi\u2019s relations with his wife were tested again and again by his tendency to place career and cause above family and marriage.",
                "Gandhi was more even-handed, seeing the son as equally responsible for the transgression.",
                "In his reflections on their relationship, Gandhi is detached and (to a degree) balanced.",
                "Two weeks after Kasturba and Gandhi quarrelled, Jeki Mehta was found making sexual overtures to another man, not Manilal.",
                "Gandhi was hurt and angry.",
                "He decided to send her back to join her husband Manilal Doctor in Fiji.43 To atone for Jeki\u2019s new lapse, and his own inadequate supervision, Gandhi decided to go on a two-week fast.",

                "All he would ask for the Indian community was that, on the basis of the rights now conceded to them, they should be suffered to live with dignity and honour on the soil of South Africa.47 As the bill was making its progress through Parliament, Gandhi wrote to Gokhale that Kallenbach would accompany Kasturba and him to London.",
                "After Gandhi had consulted with Gokhale in London, and Kallenbach said goodbye to his family in Europe, they would carry on to India.",

                "The hosts had presented an address to Gandhi, and a set of books to Sonja Schlesin.",

                "Anglia had recently started a newspaper that regularly ran articles critical of Gandhi, complaining in particular that the settlement with the Government prohibited polygamy.51 Notably, while Gandhi sought to mend fences with Anglia he did not do the same with P.

                "Gandhi was born and raised a Hindu, and he avowed that denominational label all his life.",

                "Nonetheless, Gandhi believed that in time such equality would come, that (as he put it in a speech of May 1908) the rulers would one day recognize the need to raise subject peoples \u2018to equality with themselves, to give them absolutely free institutions and make them absolutely free men\u2019.",
