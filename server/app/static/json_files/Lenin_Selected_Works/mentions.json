                "If we take the eight gubernias of Kherson, Bessarabia, Taurida, Don, Ekaterinoslav, Saratov, Samara and Orenburg, we shall find that in 1883-1887 the net crop of cereals (not including oats) for a population of 13,877,000 amounted to 41.3 million chetverts, i.e., more than one-fourth of the total net yield of the 50 gubernias of European Russia.",
                "[1] Agriculture develops here fastest of all (by comparison with the other areas of Russia), and these gubernias relegate the central black-earth gubernias, formerly in the lead, to the background:\n\nNet per-capita cereal crop.",
                "This interesting fact of the enormous growth of agricultural production in the area described is to be explained by the circumstance that in the post-Reform period the outer steppe regions have been colonies of the central, long-settled part of European Russia.",
                "[3] The extensive development of commercial crops was possible only because of the close economic ties of these colonies with central Russia, on the one hand, and the European grain importing countries, on the other.",
                "The development of industry in central Russia and the development of commercial farming in the outer regions are inseparably connected and create a market for each other.",
                "These colonies, having developed with the greatest freedom, show us what relations could and should have developed in the rest of Russia, had not the numerous survivals of pre-Reform life retarded the development of capitalism.",

                "It is very difficult by the use of statistics to describe the various regions of Russia in this respect, because it is not the total number of horned cattle that is here important, but the number of dairy cattle and their quality.",
                "If we take the total number of animals per hundred inhabitants, we shall find that it is biggest in the outer steppe regions of Russia and smallest in the non-black-earth belt (Agriculture and Forestry, 274); we shall find that as time goes on the number diminishes (Productive Forces, III, 6.",
                "We are compelled, therefore, to confine ourselves to the approximate computation made by the authors of the above-mentioned, Sketch, without claiming to make an exact estimate of the phenomenon; such a computation clearly illustrates the relative positions of the various regions of Russia as to degree of dairy-farm development.",
                "This industry arose in Russia at the very end of the 18th century (1795); cheese making on landlords\u2019 estates began to develop in the 19th century, but suffered a severe crisis in the 1860s, which opened the period of cheese making by peasants and merchants.",

                "\u201cIn the sphere of cheese making,\u201d we read, for example, in Agriculture and Forestry, \u201cmore has been done in Russia during the last 25 years than perhaps in any other country\u201d (301).",

                "It proves more convincingly than do any calculations or arguments that the standard of living and the conditions of the working people in the central black-earth gubernias, the least capitalist ones, are incomparably lower and worse than in the industrial gubernias, the most capitalist ones; it proves that in Russia, too, the following has become a universal fact, namely, the phenomenon characteristic of all capitalist countries, that the conditions of the workers in industry are better than those of the workers in agriculture (because in agriculture oppression by capitalism is supplemented by the oppression of pre-capitalist forms of exploitation).",
                "And so a new solution of the problem is naturally arising and increasingly maturing.\u201d\n\nThe position of the peasant in capitalist society is indeed hopeless, and in Russia with its village communities, as in France with its smallholders, leads \u201cnaturally\u201d not to an unnatural .",
                "Thus, at opposite ends of Russia, in the most varying localities, in St. Petersburg and, say, Taurida gubernias, the social and economic relations within the \u201cvillage community,\u201d prove to be absolutely identical.",

                "The point is not that Comrade Plekhanov made a personal concession in order to avert a split (that was very praiseworthy), but that, though fully realising the need to join issue with the inconsistent revisionists and anarchistic individualists, he chose instead to join issue with the majority, with whom he parted company over the extent of the possible practical concessions to anarchism.",

                "It goes without saying that, such being Skaldin\u2019s opinion of the Reform, he could not possibly sentimentally idealise it in the way the Narodniks did, and still do, when they say that it sanctioned people\u2019s production, that it was superior to the West-European peasant reforms, that it made a tabula rasa of Russia, and so on.",
                "Skaldin did not and could not say anything of the kind; further, he said plainly that in our country peasant Reform was less advantageous, less beneficial to the peasants than in the West.",
                "Let us now pass from the economic to the legal aspect of the Reform, as Skaldin sees it.",
                "Skaldin is a bitter foe of collective responsibility, of the passport system, and of the patriarchal power of the peasant \u201ccommunity\u201d (and of the urban community) over its members.",
                "Skaldin is disposed to attribute the differentiation of the peasantry, which was already to be observed at that time, to the personal qualities of those who get on or go under.",
                "Skaldin very accurately and aptly calls our peasant a \u201csettled proletarian\u201d (231).",
                "Skaldin, consequently, regards these aspects of peasant life from the purely bourgeois standpoint, but in spite of that (and, perhaps, because of it), his assessment of the harm caused to all social development and to the peasants themselves by the fact that the latter are tied down is very accurate.",
                "Skaldin says very aptly: \u201cthe concern of the law that the peasants shall not remain without land is admirable; but it should not be forgotten that the concern of the peasants themselves on this score is incomparably greater than that of any legislator\u201d (286).",
                "Here Skaldin is expressing a wish that runs sharply counter to the Narodnik projects, which all tend in the very opposite direction, namely, to perpetuate the village community, to make the allotments inalienable, etc.",
                "There has been ample evidence since then to show that Skaldin was perfectly right: the fact that the peasant remains tied to the land, and that the peasant community is an exclusive social estate only worsens the position of the rural proletariat and retards the country\u2019s economic development, while being unable in any degree to protect the \u201csettled proletarian\u201d from the worst forms of bondage and subjection, or from the decline of his wages and living standards to the very lowest level.",
                "The reader may have already seen from the above-quoted excerpts that Skaldin is a foe of the village community.",
                "To the defenders of the village community Skaldin retorts that \u201cthe ancient common law\u201d has outlived its day.",
                "In Skaldin\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe patriarchal family, communal ownership of the land and common law\u201d have been irrevocably condemned by history.",
                "this correct observation Skaldin adds hot Manchester School philippics.",
                "Therefore, Skaldin\u2019s unreserved hostility to the village community from the purely bourgeois standpoint is combined with his consistent defence of the peasants\u2019 interests.",
                "Hostile though he is to the village community, Skaldin does not advance foolish projects for forcibly abolishing the community and forcibly introducing some other, similar system of land ownership, such as are usually concocted by the present-day opponents of the village community, who favour gross interferences in the peasants\u2019 life and attack the village community from anything but the standpoint of the peasants\u2019 interests.",
                "Skaldin, on the contrary, strongly protests against being classed with the believers in \u201cforcible abolition of communal Land tenure\u201d (144).",
                "Indeed, none but the peasants themselves can properly decide the best time for such passage.\u201d Consequently, Skaldin is opposed to the village community only for the reason that it hampers economic development, prevents the peasant from withdrawing from the community and giving up his land, that is, for the same reason that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d are opposed to it today; this hostility has nothing in common with defence of the selfish interests of the landlords, with defence of the survivals and the spirit of serfdom, with advocacy of interference in the life of the peasants.",
                "Skaldin\u2019s general opinion about the causes of the peasants\u2019 distressed condition is that they are all survivals of serfdom.",
                "Skaldin heatedly refutes these views.",
                "It is absurd to attack the family division of the land: \u201cEven if divisions do injure the peasants\u2019 material interests for a while, they save their personal freedom and the moral dignity of the peasant family, that is, those higher human blessings without which no civil progress is possible\u201d (217), and Skaldin rightly points to the real reasons for the campaign against land divisions: \u201cmany landlords highly exaggerate the harm caused by divisions, blaming them, as well as drunkenness, for all the consequences of the various causes of the peasants\u2019 poverty, which the landlords are so unwilling to recognise\u201d (218).",
                "To those who say that much is being written today about the peasants\u2019 poverty, but that formerly it was not so and that therefore the peasants\u2019 conditions must have deteriorated, Skaldin replies that: \u201cIn order to form a judgement of the results of the peasants\u2019 emancipation from the landlords\u2019 power, by comparing the peasants\u2019 present with their former condition, it would have been necessary, while serfdom still prevailed, to trim down the peasants\u2019 allotments as they have been now trimmed down, and to tax the peasants with all the duties which have appeared since the emancipation, and then see how the peasant serfs would have borne such conditions\u201d (219).",
                "It is a supremely characteristic and important feature of Skaldin\u2019s views that\u2019 he reduces all the causes of the deterioration in the peasants\u2019 condition to survivals of serfdom, to its legacy of labour service, quit-rent, cut-off land, and the peasants\u2019 lack of rights, and immobility.",
                "Skaldin not only does not see that the causes of the peasants\u2019 impoverishment might be found in the very structure of the new socio-economic relations, in the very structure of the post-Reform economy; he absolutely refuses to entertain the thought, being profoundly convinced that the complete abolition of all these survivals of serfdom would usher in an era of universal well-being.",
                "Skaldin writes: \u201cHere\u201d (i. e., in relation to the peasantry) \u201cthere is only one course the government can follow: to eliminate steadily and unflaggingly the causes which have reduced our peasants to their present state of dullness and poverty and which do not allow them to rise to their feet\u201d (224, my italics).",
                "Highly characteristic in this respect is the reply given by Skaldin to those who defend the \u201ccommunity\u201d (that is, binding the peasants to the village communities and allotments) on the ground that, without it, \u201ca rural proletariat will emerge.\u201d \u201cThis objection,\u201d Skaldin says, \u201cfalls to the ground when we remember what boundless tracts of land lie idle in our country from lack of hands to cultivate them.",
                "Highly characteristic in this respect is the reply given by Skaldin to those who defend the \u201ccommunity\u201d (that is, binding the peasants to the village communities and allotments) on the ground that, without it, \u201ca rural proletariat will emerge.\u201d \u201cThis objection,\u201d Skaldin says, \u201cfalls to the ground when we remember what boundless tracts of land lie idle in our country from lack of hands to cultivate them.",
                "The Narodnik would no doubt look down on Skaldin with disdain and say that he was simply a bourgeois.",
                "Yes, of course, Skaldin was a bourgeois, but he was a representative of the progressive bourgeois ideology which the Narodniks have replaced by one that is petty-bourgeois and, on a whole number of points, reactionary.",
                "[5]\nTo complete our account of Skaldin\u2019s views, let us add that he is opposed to the system of social estates, advocates a single court of justice for all of them, sympathises \u201ctheoretically\u201d with the idea that the volost authorities should not be constituted on the basis of social estates, is an ardent advocate of public education, especially general education, favours local self-government and Zemstvo institutions, and believes that land credits, especially small, should be widely available, for there is a strong desire among the peasants to buy land.",
                "Here, too, Skaldin is a true \u201cMancunian\u201d: he says, for instance, that Zemstvo and municipal banks are \u201ca patriarchal or primitive form of bank\u201d and should give way to private banks, which are \u201cvastly superior\u201d (80).",
                "In outlook, Skaldin may be called a bourgeois enlightener.",
                "Like the West-European enlighteners and the majority of the literary representatives of the sixties, Skaldin was imbued with a violent hostility to serfdom and all its economic, social and legal products.",
                "We have taken Skaldin[6] as an example precisely because, while he was undoubtedly a representative of the \u201cheritage,\u201d he was at the same time a confirmed enemy of those ancient institutions which the Narodniks have taken under their protection.",
                "We have said that Skaldin was a bourgeois.",
                "It is not for nothing that Skaldin in one part of his book quotes Adam Smith: we have seen that both his views and the character of his arguments in many respects repeat the theses of that great ideologist of the progressive bourgeoisie.",
                "And so, if we compare Skaldin\u2019s practical suggestions with the views of the present-day Narodniks, on the one hand, and with the attitude to them of the \u201cRussian disciples,\u201d on the other, we shall find that the \u201cdisciples\u201d will always support Skaldin\u2019s suggestions, since the latter reflect the interests of the progressive social classes, and the vital interests of social development generally along the present, i. e., capitalist, path.",
                "And so, if we compare Skaldin\u2019s practical suggestions with the views of the present-day Narodniks, on the one hand, and with the attitude to them of the \u201cRussian disciples,\u201d on the other, we shall find that the \u201cdisciples\u201d will always support Skaldin\u2019s suggestions, since the latter reflect the interests of the progressive social classes, and the vital interests of social development generally along the present, i. e., capitalist, path.",
                "The things that the Narodniks have changed in Skaldin\u2019s practical wishes, or in his presentation of problems, are a change for the worse, and are rejected by the \u201cdisciples.\u201d It is not against the \u201cheritage\u201d that the disciples \u201churl themselves\u201d (that is an absurd fabrication), but against the romantic and petty-bourgeois additions to the heritage made by the Narodniks.",
                "His Letters from the Countryside are likewise essays on the social aspects of rural life, so that in substance and even in form his book very much resembles that of Skaldin\u2019s.",
                "Engelhardt is much more talented than Skaldin, and his letters from the country are incomparably more lively and imaginative.",
                "It is not surprising that Engelhardt\u2019s book enjoys the steady sympathy of the reading public, and only recently appeared in a fresh edition, while Skaldin\u2019s book is almost completely forgotten, although it was only two years after its publication that Otechestvenniye Zapiski began printing Engelhardt\u2019s letters.",
                "There is therefore no need for us to acquaint the reader with the contents of Engelhardt\u2019s book, and we shall confine ourselves to a brief exposition of two aspects of his views: first, views that are characteristic of the \u201cheritage\u201d in general, and common to Engelhardt and Skaldin in particular; and, second, views that are specifically Narodnik.",
                "Having set himself the aim of conducting his farm on rational lines, Engelhardt was compelled, by virtue of surrounding circumstances, to strive for this by purely capitalistic methods and to leave aside all his theoretical and abstract misgivings concerning the \u201cemployment of farm labourers.\u201d In the field of theory Skaldin argued like a typical member of the Manchester School, completely failing to realise both that his arguments were of just this character, and that they corresponded to the needs of Russia\u2019s capitalist evolution."

                "What first of all strikes the contemporary reader, who is accustomed to the Narodniks\u2019 sickly gushing over the peasant Reform, is the extreme sobriety of Skaldin\u2019s views on the subject.",

                "It goes without saying that, such being Skaldin\u2019s opinion of the Reform, he could not possibly sentimentally idealise it in the way the Narodniks did, and still do, when they say that it sanctioned people\u2019s production, that it was superior to the West-European peasant reforms, that it made a tabula rasa of Russia, and so on.",

                "We have taken Skaldin[6] as an example precisely because, while he was undoubtedly a representative of the \u201cheritage,\u201d he was at the same time a confirmed enemy of those ancient institutions which the Narodniks have taken under their protection.",

V. to Mr. Mikhailovsky, have given full rein to this effort to idealise and embellish the \u201ccommunity.\u201d There is not the slightest trace of such embellishment in Engelhardt.",

                "Very soon after the problem of capitalism in Russia had been posed, it became clear that our economic development was capitalistic, and the Narodniks proclaimed this development a retrogression, a mistake, a deviation from the path supposedly prescribed by the whole history of the nation\u2019s life, from the path supposedly hallowed by age-old foundations, and so on and so forth.",
                "Carried away by their desire to retard and stop the break-up of the age-old foundations by capitalism, the Narodniks display an amazing lack of historical tact, they forget that antecedent to this capitalism there was nothing but the same exploitation combined with countless forms of bondage and personal dependence, which burdened the position of the labourer, nothing but routine and stagnation in social production and, hence, in all spheres of social life.",
                "Contending against capitalism from their romantic, petty-bourgeois angle, the Narodniks throw all historical realism overboard and always compare the reality of capitalism with a fiction of the pre-capitalist order.",
                "The doctrine of Russia\u2019s exceptionalism induced the Narodniks to seize upon out-dated West-European theories, prompted them to regard many of the achievements of West-European culture with amazing levity: the Narodniks reassured themselves with the thought that, if we lacked some of the features of civilised humanity, \u201cwe are destined,\u201d on the other hand, to show the world new modes of economy, etc.",

                "The wider and more deeply capitalism developed, the more distinctly did the countryside display the contradictions common to every commodity-capitalist society, the more and more glaringly did the antithesis stand out between the Narodniks\u2019 honeyed talk about the peasant\u2019s \u201ccommunity spirit,\u201d \u201cartel spirit,\u201d etc., on the one hand, and the actual division of the peasantry into a rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat on the other; and the more rapidly did the Narodniks, who continued to look upon things with the eyes of the peasant, change from sentimental romanticists into ideologists of the petty bourgeoisie, because in modern society the small producer changes into a commodity producer.",

                "In addition to the highly important error of the Narodniks mentioned above, their lack of sociological realism impels them to a specific manner of thinking and reasoning about social affairs and problems which might be called narrow intellectual self-conceit or, perhaps, the bureaucratic mentality.",

                "Consequently, Narodism\u2019s contradictory attitude to the \u201cheritage\u201d is not accidental, but is a necessary result of the very nature of the Narodnik views: we have seen that one of the basic features of the enlighteners\u2019 views was the ardent desire to Europeanise Russia, but the Narodniks cannot possibly share this desire fully without ceasing to be Narodniks.",

Beltov, for instance, \u201cconfused\u201d Mr. N. Mikhailovsky with Mr. V. V., or even for that matter with Mr. Yuzhakov; that is, they did not gloss over the differences between them, or ascribe the views of one to the other.",

                "13 To this we say:\nHad the polemics with Iskra and Zarya resulted in nothing more than causing Rabocheye\nDyelo to hit upon these \u201cgeneral disagreements\u201d, that alone would give us considerable\nsatisfaction, so significant is this thesis and so clear is the light it sheds on the quintessence\nof the present-day theoretical and political differences that exist among Russian SocialDemocrats.",
                "Thus,\ntowards the end of 1895, the St. Petersburg group of Social-Democrats, which founded\nthe League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, prepared the first issue\nof a newspaper called Rabocheye Dyelo.",
                "This issue was ready to go to press when it was\nseized by the gendarmes, on the night of December 8, 1895, in a raid on the house of one\nof the members of the group, Anatoly Alexeyevich Vaneyey,15 so that the first edition of\nRabocheye Dyelo was not destined to see the light of day.",

                "Secondly, in the very first literary expression of Economism we observe the exceedingly\ncurious phenomenon \u2013 highly characteristic for an understanding of all the differences prevailing among presentday Social Democrats \u2013 that the adherents of the \u201clabour movement\npure and simple\u201d, worshippers of the closest \u201corganic\u201d contacts (Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s term)\nwith the proletarian struggle, opponents of any non-worker intelligentsia (even a socialist\nintelligentsia), are compelled, in order to defend their positions, to resort to the arguments\nof the bourgeois \u201cpure trade-unionists\u201d.",
                "This shows\n(something Rabocheye Dyelo cannot grasp) that all worship of the spontaneity of the working class movement, all belittling of the role of \u201cthe conscious element\u201d, of the role of\nSocial-Democracy, means, quite independently of whether he who belittles that role desires\nit or not, a strengthening of the influence of bourgeois ideology upon the workers.",
                "The authors of the Economist letter, in unison with Rabocheye\nDyelo, inveigh against the intolerance that is characteristic of the infancy of the movement.",
                "Rabochaya Mysl believes, however, that \u201cpolitics always obediently follows economics\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo varies this thesis when it asserts in its programme that\n25\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\n\u201cin Russia more than in any other country, the economic struggle is inseparable from the\npolitical struggle\u201d).",

                "In reality this accusation was completely\njustified, and Rabocheye Dyelo knew perfectly well that, among others, it applied also to\nV. I., a member of its Editorial Board.",

                "The source of this confusion is to be found in the ambiguity of\nthe interpretation given to the following thesis of the Rabocheye Dyelo programme: \u201cWe\nconsider that the most important phenomenon of Russian life, the one that will mainly determine the tasks [our italics] and the character of the publication activity of the Union, is\nthe mass working-class movement [Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s italics] which has arisen in recent\nyears.\u201d That the mass movement is a most important phenomenon is a fact not to be disputed.",
                "We need only point out that Rabocheye\nDyelo considered that it was impossible to set the overthrow of the autocracy as the first\ntask of the mass working-class movement, and that it degraded this task (in the name of the\nmass movement) to that of a struggle for immediate political demands (Reply, p. 25).",
                "We shall pass over the article by B. Krichevsky, editor of Rabocheye Dyelo, entitled\n\u201cThe Economic and the Political Struggle in the Russian Movement\u201d, published in No.",

                "The point is, however, that Rabocheye Dyelo, itself the victim of a disease which we have called bowing to\nspontaneity, refuses to recognise any \u201cmethod of treatment\u201d for that disease.",

                "Apparently, in addition to the anti-Iskra-ists (eight), nearly the entire \"Centre\" (ten) voted with Comrade Egorov (the total vote was forty-two, so that a large number abstained or were absent, as often happened during votes which were uninteresting or whose result was a foregone conclusion ).",

                "We have already seen, when speaking of the significance of the groupings at the Congress in general, how falsely this matter is put in the official account of the official Iskra;, which (through the mouth of Comrade Martov) slurs and glosses over the difference between the Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d, between consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats and opportunists, by citing cases when the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists, too, voted with us!",

                "The way the individual delegates voted can only be established\u2014but with a very high degree of probability\u2014by two sets of evidence: 1) in the debate the speakers of both groups of Iskra-ists spoke in favour those of the anti-Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d against; 2) the number of votes cast in favour was always very close to thirty-three.",
                "Nor should it be forgotten that when analysing the Congress debates we pointed out, quite apart from the voting, a number of cases when the \u201cCentre\u201d sided with the anti-Iskra-ists (the opportunists) against us.",
                "The \u201cdivisions\u201d of this type bring out with graphic clarity that on a number of issues involving the practical application of our principles, the Centre joined forces with the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists, displaying a much greater kinship with them than with us, a much greater leaning in practice towards the opportunist than towards the revolutionary wing of Social-Democracy.",
                "All the anti-Iskra-ists and the whole Centre stand solid against us; from the Iskra-ists a part of the majority and a part of the minority break away.",
                "\u2014Lenin: all the Iskra-ists of the minority are now on the side of Akimov and Lieber, but only a very small number of Iskra-ists of the majority, these counterbalancing three of the \u201cCentre\u201d and one anti-Iskra-ist who have come over to our side.",
                "The last vote (E\u2014elections to the Central Organ, the Central Committee, and the Party Council), which in fact represents the final division into majority and minority, clearly reveals the complete fusion of the Iskra-ist minority with the entire \u201cCentre\u201d and the remnants of the anti-Iskra-ists.",
                "We began to wait and see what would happen next: whether Martov would adhere to the loyal stand he had taken up at the Congress (against Comrade Popov, the representative of the Centre), or whether the unstable elements who inclined towards a split, and in whose wake he had followed, would gain the upper hand.",

Supan, [1] the geographer, gives the following brief summary of this development at the end of the nineteenth century:\n\nPERCENTAGE OF TERRITORY BELONGING TO THE EUROPEAN\nCOLONIAL POWERS\n(Including the United States)\n \t1876\t1900\tIncrease or\ndecrease\nAfrica..........\t10.8\t90.4\t+79.6\nPolynesia....\t56.8\t98.9\t+42.1\nAsia............\t51.5\t56.6\t+5.1\nAustralia.....\t100.0\t100.0\t\u2014\nAmerica......\t27.5\t27.2\t-0.3\n\u201cThe characteristic feature of this period,\u201d he concludes, \u201cis, therefore, the division of Africa and Polynesia.\u201d As there are no unoccupied territories\u2014that is, territories that do not belong to any state in Asia and America, it is necessary to amplify Supan\u2019s conclusion and say that the characteristic feature of the period under review is the final partitioning of the globe\u2014final, not in the sense that repartition is impossible; on the contrary, repartitions are possible and inevitable\u2014but in the sense that the colonial policy of the capitalist countries has completed the seizure of the unoccupied territories on our planet.",
                "Cecil Rhodes was a somewhat more honest social-chauvinist....\n\nTo present as precise a picture as possible of the territorial division of the world and of the changes which have occurred during the last decades in this respect, I shall utilise the data furnished by Supan in the work already quoted on the colonial possessions of all the powers of the world.",
                "Supan takes the years 1876 and 1900; I shall take the year 1876\u2014a year very aptly selected, for it is precisely by that time that the pre-monopolist stage of development of West-European capitalism can be said to have been, in the main, completed\u2014and the year 1914, and instead of Supan\u2019s figures I shall quote the more recent statistics of H\u00fcbner\u2019s Geographical and Statistical Tables.",

                "Supan gives figures only for colonies; I think it useful, in order to present a complete picture of the division of the world, to add brief data on non-colonial and semi-colonial countries, in which category I place Persia, China and Turkey: the first of these countries is already almost completely a colony, the second and third are becoming such."

                "Hobson, in his work on imperialism, marks the years 1884-1900 as the epoch of intensified \u201cexpansion\u201d of the chief European states.",
                "We take up the work by the English writer Hobson, Imperialism, which appeared in 1902, and there we read:\n\n\u201cThe new imperialism differs from the older, first, in substituting for the ambition of a single growing empire the theory and the practice of competing empires, each motivated by similar lusts of political aggrandisement and commercial gain; secondly, in the dominance of financial or investing over mercantile interests.\u201d [2]\n\nWe see that Kautsky is absolutely wrong in referring to English writers generally (unless lie meant the vulgar English imperialists, or the avowed apologists for imperialism).",
                "We see that Kautsky, while claiming that he continues to advocate Marxism, as a matter of fact takes a step backward compared with the social-liberal Hobson, who more correctly takes into account two \u201chistorically concrete\u201d (Kautsky\u2019s definition is a mockery of historical concreteness!)",
                "One of the shortcomings of the Marxist Hilferding is that on this point he has taken a step backward compared with the non-Marxist Hobson.",
                "\u201cIn 1893,\u201d writes Hobson, \u201cthe British capital invested abroad represented about 15 per cent of the total wealth of the United Kingdom.\u201d [1] Let me remind the reader that by 1915 this capital had increased about two and a half times.",
                "\u201cAggressive imperialism,\u201d says Hobson further on, \u201cwhich costs the tax-payer so dear, which is of so little value to the manufacturer and trader ... is a source of great gain to the investor....",
                "To demonstrate this in the clearest possible manner let me quote Hobson, who is a most reliable witness, since he cannot be suspected of leaning towards Marxist orthodoxy; on the other hand, he is an Englishman who is very well acquainted with the situation in the country which is richest in colonies, in finance capital, and in imperialist experience.",
                "With the Anglo-Boer War fresh in his mind, Hobson describes the connection between imperialism and the interests of the \u201cfinanciers\u201d, their growing profits from contracts, supplies, etc., and writes: \u201cWhile the directors of this definitely parasitic policy are capitalists, the same motives appeal to special classes of the workers.",
                "As for the second circumstance, Hobson writes: \u201cOne of the strangest symptoms of the blindness of imperialism is the reckless indifference with which Great Britain, France and other imperial nations are embarking on this perilous dependence.",
                "Most of the fighting by which we have won our Indian Empire has been done by natives; in India, as more recently in Egypt, great standing armies are placed under British commanders; almost all the fighting associated with our African dominions, except in the southern part, has been done for us by natives.\u201d\n\nHobson gives the following economic appraisal of the prospect of the partitioning of China: \u201cThe greater part of Western Europe might then assume the appearance and character already exhibited by tracts of country in the South of England, in the Riviera and in the tourist-ridden or residential parts of Italy and Switzerland, little clusters of wealthy aristocrats drawing dividends and pensions from the Far East, with a somewhat larger group of professional retainers and tradesmen and a larger body of personal servants and workers in the transport trade and in the final stages of production of the more perishable goods; all the main arterial industries would have disappeared, the staple foods and manufactures flowing in as tribute from Asia and Africa.",
                "We must not, however, lose sight of the forces which counteract imperialism in general, and opportunism in particular, and which, naturally, the social-liberal Hobson is unable to perceive.",
                "The German opportunist, Gerhard Hildebrand, who was once expelled from the Party for defending imperialism, and who could today be a leader of the so-called \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d Party of Germany, supplements Hobson well by his advocacy of a \u201cUnited States of Western Europe\u201d (without Russia) for the purpose of \u201cjoint\u201d action ... against the African Negroes, against the \u201cgreat Islamic movement\u201d, for the maintenance of a \u201cpowerful army and navy\u201d, against a \u201cSino-Japanese coalition\u201d, [8] etc.",
                "As Hobson observes, emigration from Great Britain has been declining since 1884.",
                "The leaders of the present-day, so-called, \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d Party of Germany are justly called \u201csocial-imperialists\u201d, that is, socialists in words and imperialists in deeds; but as early as 1902, Hobson noted the existence in Britain of \u201cFabian imperialists\u201d who belonged to the opportunist Fabian Society.",
                "This is also the main attitude taken by Hobson in his critique of imperialism.",
                "Hobson anticipated Kautsky in protesting against the \u201cinevitability of imperialism\u201d argument, and in urging the necessity of \u201cincreasing the consuming capacity\u201d of the people (under capitalism!).",
                "Compare his arguments on this subject in 1915, with Hobson\u2019s arguments in 1902.",
                "Sufficient premises are still lacking to enable us to answer this question.\u201d [7]\n\nHobson: \u201cChristendom thus laid out in a few great federal empires, each with a retinue of uncivilised dependencies, seems to many the most legitimate development of present tendencies, and one which would offer the best hope of permanent peace on an assured basis of inter-Imperialism.\u201d\n\nKautsky called ultra-imperialism or super-imperialism what Hobson, thirteen years earlier, described as inter- imperialism.",

                "Except for coining a new and clever catchword, replacing one Latin prefix by another, the only progress Kautsky has made in the sphere of \u201cscientific\u201d thought is that he gave out as Marxism what Hobson, in effect, described as the cant of English parsons."

                "[5] In the preceding chapter we have seen how capitalist relations are manifested in peasant renting of land; here we see \u201crenting\u201d which is simply a survival of Corv\u00e9e economy,[6] and which sometimes passes imperceptibly into the capitalist system of providing the estate with agricultural workers by alloting patches of land to them.",

                "The whole point is that the peasant knows from bitter experience the real value of the labour-service idealised by the agrarians and the Narodniks, and he knows how much better are purely capitalist relations.\u2014Lenin\n\nV. The Narodnik Attitude to the Problem\nThe point that the labour-service system is simply a survival of Corv\u00e9e economy is not denied even by the Narodniks.",

                "60-61), \u2013 which does not prevent Messrs. the Narodniks from regarding them as \u201csound\u201d peasants \u2013 and rent these grounds, for which they pay the proprietress in work, performing \u201call the jobs on her estate ... thoroughly, punctually and promptly.\u201d[1]\n\nThat is the limit in idealising an economic system which is a direct survival of Corv\u00e9e service!",
                "The methods employed in all such Narodnik reasoning are very simple; we have only to forget that the allotment of land to the peasant is one of the conditions of Corv\u00e9e or labour-service economy, we have only to omit the circumstance that this allegedly \u201cindependent\u201d cultivator must render labour-rent, rent in kind or money rent, \u2013 and we get the \u201cpure\u201d idea of \u201cthe tie between the producer and the means of production.\u201d But the actual relation between capitalism and pre-capitalist forms of exploitation does not change in the least from the fact of simply omitting these forms."
