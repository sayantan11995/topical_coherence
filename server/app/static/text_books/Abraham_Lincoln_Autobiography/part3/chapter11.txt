SPRINGFIELD, July 31, 1858. HON. S. A. DOUGLAS: 
DEAR SIR, â€” Yours of yesterday, naming places, times, and
terms for joint discussions between us, was received this
morning. Although, by the terms, as you propose, you take
four openings and closes, to my three, I accede, and thus
close the arrangement. I direct this to you at Hillsborough,
and shall try to have both your letter and this appear in the
Journal and Register of Monday morning.
Your obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.
