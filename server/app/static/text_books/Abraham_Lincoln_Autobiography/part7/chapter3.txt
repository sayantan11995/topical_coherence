TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
UNITED STATES:
I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it
originated, a “joint resolution to correct certain clerical
errors in the internal revenue act,” without my approval.
My reason for so doing is that I am informed that this
joint resolution was prepared during the last moments of
the last session of Congress for the purpose of correcting
certain errors of reference in the internal revenue act,
which were discovered on an examination of an oﬀicial
copy procured from the State Department a few hours only
before the adjournment. It passed the House and went to
the Senate, where a vote was taken upon it, but by some
accident it was not presented to the President of the Senate
for his signature.
Since the adjournment of the last session of Congress,
other errors of a kind similar to those which this resolution
was designed to correct, have been discovered in the law,
and it is now thought most expedient to include all the
necessary corrections in one act or resolution.
The attention of the proper committee of the House has,
I am informed, been already directed to the preparation of
 a bill for this purpose.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA:
A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas the act of Congress of the twenty-eighth of
September, 1850, entitled “An act to create additional
collection districts in the State of California, and to change
the existing districts therein, and to modify the existing
collection districts in the United States,” extends to
merchandise warehoused under bond the privilege of being
exported to the British North American provinces adjoining
the United States, in the manner prescribed in the act of
Congress of the third of March, 1845, which designates
certain frontier ports through which merchandise may be
exported, and further provides “that such other ports
situated on the frontiers of the United States, adjoining the
British North American provinces, as may hereafter be
found expedient, may have extended to them the like
privileges on the recommendation of the Secretary of the
Treasury, and proclamation duly made by the President of
the United States, specially designating the ports to which
the aforesaid privileges are to be extended;”
 Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States of America, in accordance with the
recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, do
hereby declare and proclaim that the port of St. Albans, in
the State of Vermont, is, and shall be, entitled to all the
privileges in regard to the exportation of merchandise in
bond to the British North American provinces adjoining the
United States, which are extended to the ports enumerated
in the seventh section of the act of Congress of the third of
March, 1845, aforesaid, from and after the date of this
proclamation.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be aﬀixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this tenth day of January,
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred-and
sixty-ﬁve, and of the independence of the United States of
America the eighty-ninth.

will, of course, expect that I acknowledge it. So much has
been said about Gettysburg and so well, that for me to
attempt to say more may perhaps only serve to weaken the
force of that which has already been said. A most graceful
and eloquent tribute was paid to the patriotism and self-
denying labors of the American ladies, on the occasion of
the consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg,
by our illustrious friend, Edward Everett, now, alas!
departed from earth. His life was a truly great one, and I
think the greatest part of it was that which crowned its
closing years, I wish you to read, if you have not already
done so, the eloquent and truthful words which he then
spoke of the women of America. Truly, the services they
have rendered to the defenders of our country in this
perilous time, and are yet rendering, can never be
estimated as they ought to be. For your kind wishes to me
personally, I beg leave to render you likewise my sincerest
thanks. I assure you they are reciprocated. And now,

PASSAGE 
THROUGH 
CONGRESS 
OF 
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE ABOLISHING
OF SLAVERY
RESPONSE TO A SERENADE, JANUARY 31, 1865.
He supposed the passage through Congress of the
Constitutional amendment for the abolishing of slavery
throughout the United States was the occasion to which he
was indebted for the honor of this call.
The occasion was one of congratulation to the country,
and to the whole world. But there is a task yet before us —
to go forward and consummate by the votes of the States
that which Congress so nobly began yesterday. He had the
honor to inform those present that Illinois had already done
the work. Maryland was about half through, but he felt
proud that Illinois was a little ahead.
He thought this measure was a very ﬁtting if not an
indispensable adjunct to the winding up of the great
diﬀiculty. He wished the reunion of all the States perfected,
and so eﬀected as to remove all causes of disturbance in
the future; and, to attain this end, it was necessary that the
original disturbing cause should, if possible, be rooted out.
He thought all would bear him witness that he had never
shirked from doing all that he could to eradicate slavery, by
 issuing 
an 
Emancipation 
Proclamation. 
But 
that
proclamation falls short of what the amendment will be
when fully consummated. A question might be raised
whether the proclamation was legally valid. It might be
added, that it only aided those who came into our lines, and
that it was inoperative as to those who did not give
themselves up; or that it would have no eﬀect upon the
children of the slaves born hereafter; in fact, it would be
urged that it did not meet the evil. But this amendment is a
king’s cure for all evils. It winds the whole thing up. He
would repeat, that it was the ﬁtting if not the indispensable
adjunct to the consummation of the great game we are
playing. He could not but congratulate all present —
himself, the country, and the whole world upon this great
moral victory.

E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 8, 1865.
HIS E CELLENCY GOVERNOR SMITH, of Vermont:
Complaint is made to me, by Vermont, that the
assignment of her quota for the draft on the pending call is
intrinsically 
unjust, 
and 
also 
in 
bad 
faith 
of 
the
Government’s promise to fairly allow credits for men
previously furnished. To illustrate, a supposed case is
stated as follows:
Vermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish
six thousand men on the pending call; and being equal,
each must furnish as many as the other in the long run. But
the Government ﬁnds that on former calls Vermont
furnished a surplus of ﬁve hundred, and New Hampshire a
surplus, of ﬁfteen hundred. These two surpluses making
two thousand and added to the six thousand, making eight
thousand to be furnished by the two States, or four
thousand each less, by fair credits. Then subtract
Vermont’s surplus of ﬁve hundred from her four thousand,
leaves three thousand ﬁve hundred as her quota on the
pending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire’s
surplus of ﬁfteen hundred from her four thousand, leaves
two thousand ﬁve hundred as her quota on the pending
call. These three thousand ﬁve hundred and two thousand
 ﬁve hundred make precisely six thousand, which the
supposed case requires from the two States, and it is just
equal for Vermont to furnish one thousand more now than
New Hampshire, because New Hampshire has heretofore
furnished one thousand more than Vermont, which
equalizes the burdens of the two in the long run. And this
result, so far from being bad faith to Vermont, is
indispensable to keeping good faith with New Hampshire.
By no other result can the six thousand men be obtained
from the two States, and, at the same time deal justly and
keep faith with both, and we do but confuse ourselves in
questioning the process by which the right result is
reached. The supposed case is perfect as an illustration.
The pending call is not for three hundred thousand men
subject to fair credits, but is for three hundred thousand
remaining after all fair credits have been deducted, and it
is impossible to concede what Vermont asks without
coming out short of three hundred thousand men, or
making other localities pay for the partiality shown her.
This upon the case stated. If there be diﬀerent reasons
for making an allowance to Vermont, let them be presented
and considered.
Yours truly,
A. LINCOLN.

the Executive in deference to the view of Congress implied
in its passage and presentation to him. In his own view,
however, the two Houses of Congress, convened under the

exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them
to be illegal, and it is not competent for the Executive to
defeat or obstruct that power by a veto, as would be the
case if his action were at all essential in the matter. He
disclaims all right of the Executive to interfere in any way

SIR: I have deemed it proper, and probably desirable to
you, to give you in this for in the substance of remarks
 made by me, to be repeated by you to President Lincoln,
etc., etc.
I have no disposition to ﬁnd obstacles in forms, and am
willing, now as heretofore, to enter into negotiations for the
restoration of peace, and am ready to send a commission
whenever I have reason to suppose it will be received, or to
receive a commission if the United States Government shall
choose to send one. That notwithstanding the rejection of
our former oﬀers, I would, if you could promise that a
commissioner, minister, or other agent would be received,
appoint one immediately, and renew the eﬀort to enter into
conference with a view to secure peace to the two
countries.
Yours, etc., JEFFERSON DAVIS.
Afterwards, and with the view that it should be shown to
Mr. Davis, I wrote and delivered to Mr. Blair a letter, as
follows, to wit: WASHINGTON, January 18, 1865.
P. P. BLAIR, ESQ.
SIR: — Your having shown me Mr. Davis’s letter to you of
the twelfth instant, you may say to him that I have
constantly been, am now, and shall continue ready to
receive any agent whom he or any other inﬂuential person
now resisting the national authority may informally send to
me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one
common country.
Yours, etc.,
A. LINCOLN.

if you choose to pass on such understanding, and so notify
me in writing, I will procure the commanding general to
pass you through the lines and to Fortress Monroe under
such military precautions as he may deem prudent, and at
which place you will be met in due time by some person or
persons for the purpose of such informal conference; and,
further, that you shall have protection, safe conduct, and

 Afterwards, but before Major Eckert had departed, the
following dispatch was received from General Grant:
OFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH, WAR

The following telegram received at Washington January
30, 1865, from City Point, Va., 10.30 A.M., January 30,
1865: “His E CELLENCY
A. LINCOLN,
President of the United States:
“The following communication was received here last
evening:

President Lincoln upon the subject of the existing war, and
with a view of ascertaining upon what terms it may be

his letter to Mr. Blair of January 18, 1865, of which we

‘Very respectfully, yours,

 “I have sent directions to receive these gentlemen, and
expect to have them at my quarters this evening, awaiting
your 
instructions. 
U.S. 
GRANT, 
Lieutenant-General,
Commanding Armies United States.”
This, it will be perceived, transferred General Ord’s
agency in the matter to General Grant. I resolved, however,
to send Major Eckert forward with his message, and
accordingly telegraphed General Grant as follows, to wit:
E ECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, January 13, 1865
(Sent at 1.30 P.M.) LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City

A messenger is coming to you on the business contained
in your despatch. Detain the gentlemen in comfortable
quarters until he arrives, and then act upon the message he
brings as far as applicable, it having been made up to pass
through General Ord’s hands, and when the gentlemen
were supposed to be beyond our lines.
A. LINCOLN.
When Major Eckert departed, he bore with him a letter
of the Secretary of War to General Grant, as follows, to wit:
WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., January 30,
1865.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, Commanding, etc.
GENERAL: — The President desires that you will please
procure for the bearer, Major Thomas T. Eckert, an
interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell,
and if on his return to you he requests it pass them through
our lines to Fortress Monroe by such route and under such
military precautions as you may deem prudent, giving them
 protection and comfortable quarters while there, and that
you let none of this have any eﬀect upon your movements
or plans.
By order of the President: EDWIN M. STANTON,
Secretary of War.
Supposing the proper point to be then reached, I
dispatched the Secretary of State with the following
instructions, Major Eckert, however, going ahead of him:
E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 31, 1865.
HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State:
You will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Va., there to meet
and informally confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and
Campbell on the basis of my letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of
January 18, 1865, a copy of which you have.
You will make known to them that three things are
indispensable, to Wit: 1. The restoration of the national
authority throughout all the States.
2. No receding by the Executive of the United States on
the slavery question from the position assumed thereon in
the late annual message to Congress and in preceding
documents.
3. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war
and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.
You will inform them that all propositions of theirs not
inconsistent with the above will be considered and passed
upon in a spirit of sincere liberality. You will hear all they
may choose to say and report it to me.
You will not assume to deﬁnitely consummate anything.

 A. LINCOLN.
On the day of its date the following telegram was sent to
General Grant: WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.,

To notify Major Eckert that the Secretary of State would
be at Fortress Monroe, and to put them in communication,
the following despatch was sent: WAR DEPARTMENT,

was received: CITY POINT, VA., February 1, 1865
“LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.
“SIR: — We desire to go to Washington City to confer

At 9.30 P.M. I notiﬁed them that they could not proceed
further unless they complied with the terms expressed in
my letter. The point of meeting designated in the above
note would not, in my opinion, be insisted upon. Think Fort
Monroe would be acceptable. Having complied with my
 instructions, I will return to Washington to-morrow unless
otherwise ordered.
THOS. T. ECKERT, Major, etc.
On reading this despatch of Major Eckert I was about to
recall him and the Secretary of State, when the following
telegram of General Grant to the Secretary of War was
shown 
me:

The following telegram received at Washington 4.35
A.M., February 2, 1865, from City Point, Va., February 1,
10.30 P.M., 1865: “HON. EDWIN M. STANTON, “Secretary
of War:
“Now that the interview between Major Eckert, under his
written instructions, and Mr. Stephens and party has
ended, I will state conﬁdentially, but not oﬀicially to
become a matter of record, that I am convinced upon
conversation with Messrs. Stephens and Hunter that their
intentions are good and their desire sincere to restore
peace and union. I have not felt myself at liberty to express
even views of my own or to account for my reticency. This
has placed me in an awkward position, which I could have
avoided by not seeing them in the ﬁrst instance. I fear now
their going back without any expression from anyone in
authority will have a bad inﬂuence. At the same time, I
recognize the diﬀiculties in the way of receiving these
informal commissioners at this time, and do not know what
to recommend. I am sorry, however, that Mr. Lincoln can
not have an interview with the two named in this despatch,
if not all three now within our lines. Their letter to me was
 all that the President’s instructions contemplated to secure
their safe conduct if they had used the same language to
Major Eckert.
“U.S. GRANT “Lieutenant-General.”
This despatch of General Grant changed my purpose, and
accordingly I telegraphed him and the Secretary of State,
respectively, 
as 
follows:

(Copy to HON. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War,
Washington.) On the night of the 2nd I reached Hampton
 Roads, found the Secretary of State and Major Eckert on a
steamer anchored oﬀshore, and learned of them that the
Richmond gentlemen were on another steamer also
anchored oﬀshore, in the Roads, and that the Secretary of
State had not yet seen or communicated with them. I
ascertained that Major Eckert had literally complied with
his instructions, and I saw for the ﬁrst time the answer of
the Richmond gentlemen to him, which in his despatch to
me of the 1st he characterizes as “not satisfactory.” That
answer is as follows, to wit: CITY POINT, VA., February 1,
1865. THOMAS T. ECKERT, Major and Aid-de-Camp.
MAJOR:-Your note, delivered by yourself this day, has been
considered. In reply we have to say that we were furnished
with a copy of the letter of President Lincoln to Francis P.
Blair, Esq., of the 18th of January ultimo, another copy of
which is appended to your note. Our instructions are
contained in a letter of which the following is a copy:
“RICHMOND, January 28, 1865. “In conformity with the
letter of Mr. Lincoln, of which the foregoing is a copy, you
are to proceed to Washington City for informal conference
with him upon the issues involved in the existing war, and
for the purpose of securing peace to the two countries.
“With great respect, your obedient servant, “JEFFERSON
DAVIS.”
The substantial object to be obtained by the informal
conference is to ascertain upon what terms the existing war
can be terminated honorably.
Our instructions contemplate a personal interview
between President Lincoln and ourselves at Washington
 City, but with this explanation we are ready to meet any
person or persons that President Lincoln may appoint at
such place as he may designate.
Our earnest desire is that a just and honorable peace
may be agreed upon, and we are prepared to receive or to
submit propositions which may possibly lead to the
attainment of that end.
Very respectfully, yours,
ALE ANDER H. STEPHENS.
R. M. T. HUNTER.
JOHN A. CAMPBELL.
A note of these gentlemen, subsequently addressed to
General Grant, has already been given in Major Eckert’s
despatch of the 1st instant.
I also here saw, for the ﬁrst time, the following note,
addressed by the Richmond gentlemen to Major Eckert:
CITY POINT, VA., February 2, 1865. THOMAS T. ECKERT,
Major and Aid-de-Camp. MAJOR: — In reply to your verbal
statement that your instructions did not allow you to alter
the conditions upon which a passport could be given to us,
we say that we are willing to proceed to Fortress Monroe
and there to have an informal conference with any person
or persons that President Lincoln may appoint on the basis
of his letter to Francis P. Blair of the 18th of January ultimo,
or upon any other terms or conditions that he may
hereafter propose not inconsistent with the essential
principles of self-government and popular rights, upon
which our institutions are founded.
 It is our earnest wish to ascertain, after a free
interchange of ideas and information, upon what principles
and terms, if any, a just and honorable peace can be
established without the further eﬀusion of blood, and to
contribute our utmost eﬀorts to accomplish such a result.
We think it better to add that in accepting your passport
we are not to be understood as committing ourselves to
anything but to carry to this informal conference the views
and feelings above expressed.
Very respectfully, yours, etc.,
ALE ANDER H. STEPHENS, J. A. CAMPBELL, R. M. T.
HUNTER.
Note.-The above communication was delivered to me at
Fort Monroe at 4.30 P.M. February 2 by Lieutenant-Colonel
Babcock, of General Grant’s staﬀ.
THOMAS T. ECKERT Major and Aid-de-Camp.
On the morning of the third the three gentlemen, Messrs.
Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, came aboard of our
steamer and had an interview with the Secretary of State
and myself of several hours’ duration. No question of
preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or
mentioned; no other person was present; no papers were
exchanged or produced; and it was in advance agreed that
the conversation was to be informal and verbal merely. On
our part the whole substance of the instructions to the
Secretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and
insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith;
while by the other party it was not said that in any event or
on any condition they ever would consent to reunion, and
 yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would
consent. They seemed to desire a postponement of that
question and the adoption of some other course ﬁrst,
which, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might
not lead to reunion, but which course we thought would
amount to an indeﬁnite postponement. The conference
ended without result.
The foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the
information sought is respectfully submitted.

(Extract.) No. 1258.
DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February
7,1865
On the morning of the 3d, the President, attended by the
Secretary, 
received 
Messrs. 
Stephens, 
Hunter, 
and
Campbell on board the United States steam transport River
Queen in Hampton Roads. The conference was altogether
informal. There was no attendance of secretaries, clerks, or
other witnesses. Nothing was written or read. The
conversation, although earnest and free, was calm, and
courteous, and kind on both sides. The Richmond party
approached the discussion rather indirectly, and at no time
did they either make categorical demands, or tender formal
stipulations or absolute refusals. Nevertheless, during the
conference, which lasted four hours, the several points at
issue between the Government and the insurgents were
distinctly raised, and discussed fully, intelligently, and in an
amicable spirit. What the insurgent party seemed chieﬂy to
favor was a postponement of the question of separation,
upon which the war is waged, and a mutual direction of
eﬀorts of the Government, as well as those of the
insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season
during which passions might be expected to subside, and
 the armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse between
the people of both sections resumed. It was suggested by
them that through such postponement we might now have
immediate peace, with some not very certain prospect of an
ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations
between this Government and the States, section, or people
now engaged in conﬂict with it.
This suggestion, though deliberately considered, was
nevertheless regarded by the President as one of armistice
or truce, and he announced that we can agree to no
cessation or suspension of hostilities, except on the basis of
the 
disbandment 
of 
the 
insurgent 
forces, 
and 
the
restoration of the national authority throughout all the
States in the Union. Collaterally, and in subordination to
the proposition which was thus announced, the antislavery
policy of the United States was reviewed in all its bearings,
and the President announced that he must not be expected
to depart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in
his proclamation of emancipation and other documents, as
these positions were reiterated in his last annual message.
It was further declared by the President that the complete
restoration of the national authority was an indispensable
condition of any assent on our part to whatever form of
peace might be proposed. The President assured the other
party that, while he must adhere to these positions, he
would be prepared, so far as power is lodged with the
Executive, to exercise liberality. His power, however, is
limited by the Constitution; and when peace should be
made, Congress must necessarily act in regard to
 appropriations 
of 
money 
and 
to 
the 
admission 
of
representatives from the insurrectionary States. The
Richmond party were then informed that Congress had, on
the 31st ultimo, adopted by a constitutional majority a joint
resolution submitting to the several States the proposition
to abolish slavery throughout the Union, and that there is
every reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by
three fourths of the States, so as to become a part of the
national organic law.
The conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence,
without producing an agreement of views upon the several
matters discussed, or any of them. Nevertheless, it is
perhaps of some importance that we have been able to
submit our opinions and views directly to prominent
insurgents, and to hear them in answer in a courteous and
not unfriendly manner.
I am, sir, your obedient servant, WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

I
understand that provost-marshals in diﬀerent parts of
Missouri are assuming to decide that the conditions of
bonds are forfeited, and therefore are seizing and selling
property to pay damages. This, if true, is both outrageous
and ridiculous. Do not allow it. The courts, and not provost-
marshals, are to decide such questions unless when
military necessity makes an exception. Also excuse John
Eaton, of Clay County, and Wesley Martin, of Platte, from
being sent South, and let them go East if anywhere.

Whereas objects of interest to the United States require
that the Senate should be convened at twelve o’clock on
the fourth of March next to receive and act upon such
communications as may be made to it on the part of the
Executive; Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of
the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue
this, my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary
occasion requires the Senate of the United States to
convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in
the city of Washington, on the fourth day of March next, at
twelve o’clock at noon on that day, of which all who shall at
that time be entitled to act as members of that body are
hereby required to take notice.

LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, CITY Point, Virginia: I
am in a little perplexity. I was induced to authorize a
gentleman to bring Roger A. Pryor here with a view of
eﬀecting an exchange of him; but since then I have seen a
despatch of yours showing that you specially object to his
exchange. Meantime he has reached here and reported to
me. It is an ungracious thing for me to send him back to
prison, and yet inadmissible for him to remain here long.
Cannot you help me out with it? I can conceive that there
may be diﬀerence to you in days, and I can keep him a few
days to accommodate on that point. I have not heard of my

FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN: — AT this second appearing
to take the oath of the presidential oﬀice there is less
occasion for an extended address than there was at the
ﬁrst. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be
pursued seemed ﬁtting and proper. Now, at the expiration
of four years, during which public declarations have been
constantly called forth on every point and phase of the
great contest which still absorbs the attention and
engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could
be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else
chieﬂy depends, is as well known to the public as to myself,
and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to
all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to
it is ventured.
On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all
thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.
All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural
address was being delivered from this place, devoted
altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent
agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war
seeking to dissolve the Union and divide eﬀects by
negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them
would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the
 other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the
war came.
One eighth of the whole population was colored slaves,
not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in
the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar
and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was
somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate,
and extend this interest was the object for which the
insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the
Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict
the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for
the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already
attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conﬂict
might cease with or even before the conﬂict itself should
cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less
fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and
pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the
other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask
a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the
sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be
not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered.
That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has
His own purposes. “Woe unto the world because of
oﬀenses; for it must needs be that oﬀenses come, but woe
to that man by whom the oﬀense cometh.” If we shall
suppose that American slavery is one of those oﬀenses
which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but
which, having continued through His appointed time, He
now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and
 South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom
the oﬀense came, shall we discern therein any departure
from those divine attributes which the believers in a living
God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently
do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily
pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the
wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and ﬁfty years
of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of
blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn
with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so
still it must be said, “The judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous altogether.”
With malice toward none, with charity for all, with
ﬁrmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us
strive on to ﬁnish the work we are in, to bind up the
nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the
battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which
may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among
ourselves and with all nations.

LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va: 
YOUR TWO DESPATCHES to the Secretary of War, one
relating to supplies for the enemy going by the Blackwater,
and the other to General Singleton and Judge Hughes, have
been laid before me by him. As to Singleton and Hughes, I
think they are not in Richmond by any authority, unless it
be from you. I remember nothing from me which could aid
them in getting there, except a letter to you, as follows, to
wit: E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, February
7, 1865. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:
General Singleton, who bears you this, claims that he
already has arrangements made, if you consent, to bring a
large amount of Southern produce through your lines. For
its bearing on our ﬁnances, I would be glad for this to be
done, if it can be, without injuriously disturbing your
military operations, or supplying the enemy. I wish you to
be judge and master on these points. Please see and hear
him fully, and decide whether anything, and, if anything,
what, can be done in the premises. Yours truly, A.
LINCOLN.
I believe I gave Hughes a card putting him with
Singleton on the same letter. However this may be, I now
authorize you to get Singleton and Hughes away from
 Richmond, if you choose, and can. I also authorize you, by
an order, or in what form you choose, to suspend all
operations on the Treasury trade permits, in all places
southeastward of the Alleghenies. If you make such order,
notify me of it, giving a copy, so that I can give
corresponding direction to the Navy.

of the act of Congress, approved on the 3d instant, entitled
“An Act to amend the several acts heretofore passed to
provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces
and for other purposes,” requires that in addition to the
other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion from the
military or naval service, all persons who have deserted the
military or naval service of the United States who shall not
return to said service or report themselves to a provost-
marshal 
within 
sixty 
days 
after

hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed and taken to have
voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their citizenship and
their right to become citizens, and such deserters shall be
forever incapable of holding any oﬀice of trust or proﬁt
under the United States, or of exercising any rights of
citizens thereof; and all persons who shall hereafter desert
the military or naval service, and all persons who, being
duly enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of the district in
which they are enrolled, or go beyond the limits of the
United States with intent to avoid any draft into the
 military or naval service duly ordered, shall be liable to the
penalties of this section; and the President is hereby
authorized and required forthwith, on the passage of this
act, to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of
this section, in which proclamation the President is
requested to notify all deserters returning within sixty days
as aforesaid that they shall be pardoned on condition of
returning to their regiments and companies, or to such
other organizations as they may be assigned to, until they
shall have served for a period of time equal to their original
term of enlistment: Now, therefore, be it known that I,
Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do issue
this my proclamation as required by said act, ordering and
requiring all deserters to return to their proper posts; and I
do hereby notify them that all deserters who shall within
sixty days from the date of this proclamation, viz., on or
before the 10th day of May, 1865, return to service or
report themselves to a provost-marshal, shall be pardoned
on condition that they return to their regiments or
companies or to such other organization as they may be
assigned to, and serve the remainder of their original terms
of enlistment, and in addition thereto a period equal to the
time lost by desertion.

DEAR Mr. WEED: Every one likes a compliment. Thank
you for yours on my little notiﬁcation speech and on the
recent inaugural address. I expect the latter to wear as well
as perhaps better than — anything I have produced; but I
believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not ﬂattered
by being shown that there has been a diﬀerence of purpose
between the Almighty and them. To deny it, however, in this
case, is to deny that there is a God governing the world. It
is a truth which I thought needed to be told, and, as
whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most directly on
myself, I thought others might aﬀord for me to tell it.
Truly yours, A. LINCOLN.

FELLOW-CITIZENS: — IT will be but a very few words
that I shall undertake to say. I was born in Kentucky, raised
in Indiana, and lived in Illinois; and now I am here, where it
is my business to care equally for the good people of all the
States. I am glad to see an Indiana regiment on this day
able to present the captured ﬂag to the Governor of
Indiana. I am not disposed, in saying this, to make a
distinction between the States, for all have done equally
well.
There are but few views or aspects of this great war
upon which I have not said or written something whereby
my own opinions might be known. But there is one — the
recent attempt of our erring brethren, as they are
sometimes called, to employ the negro to ﬁght for them. I
have neither written nor made a speech on that subject,
because that was their business, not mine, and if I had a
wish on the subject, I had not the power to introduce it, or
make it eﬀective. The great question with them was
whether the negro, being put into the army, will ﬁght for
them. I do not know, and therefore cannot decide. They
ought to know better than me. I have in my lifetime heard
many arguments why the negroes ought to be slaves; but if
 they ﬁght for those who would keep them in slavery, it will
be a better argument than any I have yet heard. He who
will ﬁght for that, ought to be a slave. They have concluded,
at last, to take one out of four of the slaves and put them in
the army, and that one out of the four who will ﬁght to keep
the others in slavery, ought to be a slave himself, unless he
is killed in a ﬁght. While I have often said that all men
ought to be free, yet would I allow those colored persons to
be slaves who want to be, and next to them those white
people who argue in favor of making other people slaves. I
am in favor of giving an appointment to such white men to
try it on for these slaves. I will say one thing in regard to
the negroes being employed to ﬁght for them. I do know he
cannot ﬁght and stay at home and make bread too. And as
one is about as important as the other to them, I don’t care
which they do. I am rather in favor of having them try them
as soldiers. They lack one vote of doing that, and I wish I
could send my vote over the river so that I might cast it in
favor of allowing the negro to ﬁght. But they cannot ﬁght
and work both. We must now see the bottom of the enemy’s
resources. They will stand out as long as they can, and if
the negro will ﬁght for them they must allow him to ﬁght.
They have drawn upon their last branch of resources, and
we can now see the bottom. I am glad to see the end so
near at hand. I have said now more than I intended, and
will therefore bid you good-by.

AGAINST BENJAMIN G. SMITH AND FRANKLIN W.
SMITH, 
MARCH 18, 1865.
I am unwilling for the sentence to stand, and be
executed, to any extent in this case. In the absence of a
more adequate motive than the evidence discloses, I am
wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or
fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well
established good character. If the evidence went as far to
establish a guilty proﬁt of one or two hundred thousand
dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars, the case
would, on the question of guilt, bear a far diﬀerent aspect.
That on this contract, involving some twelve hundred
thousand dollars, the contractors would plan, and attempt
to execute a fraud which, at the most, could proﬁt them
only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is
to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they
did not, in such a case, make far greater gains, proves that
they did not, with guilty or fraudulent intent, make at all.
The judgment and sentence are disapproved, and declared
null, and the defendants are fully discharged.

Grant does not seem to know very much about Yeatman,
but thinks very well of him so far as he does know.
I like Mr. Whiting very much, and hence would wish him
to remain or resign as best suits himself. Hearing this much
from me, do as you think best in the matter. General Lee
has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as I

their receiving the document from us. Robert just now tells

HON. SECRETARY OF WAR: I begin to feel that I ought
to be at home and yet I dislike to leave without seeing
nearer to the end of General Grant’s present movement. He
has now been out since yesterday morning and although he
has not been diverted from his programme no considerable
eﬀort has yet been produced so far as we know here. Last
night at 10.15 P. M. when it was dark as a rainy night
without a moon could be, a furious cannonade soon joined
in by a heavy musketry ﬁre opened near Petersburg and
lasted about two hours. The sound was very distinct here as
also were the ﬂashes of the guns up the clouds. It seemed
to me a great battle, but the older hands here scarcely
noticed it and sure enough this morning it was found that
very little had been done.

CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 31, 1865. 3 P.M.
SECRETARY STANTON: At 12.30 P.M. to-day General
Grant telegraphed me as follows: “There has been much
hard ﬁghting this morning. The enemy drove our left from
near Dabney’s house back well toward the Boydton plank
road. We are now about to take the oﬀensive at that point,
and I hope will more than recover the lost ground.”
Later he telegraphed again as follows: “Our troops, after
being driven back to the Boydton plank road, turned and
drove the enemy in turn, and took the White Oak road,
which we now have. This gives us the ground occupied by
the enemy this morning. I will send you a rebel ﬂag
captured by our troops in driving the enemy back. There
have been four ﬂags captured to-day.”
Judging by the two points from which General Grant
telegraphs, I infer that he moved his headquarters about
one mile since he sent the ﬁrst of the two despatches.

CITY POINT, April 1, 1865. 12.50 P.M.
HON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D.C.: I have
had two despatches from General Grant since my last to
you, but they contain little additional, except that Sheridan
also had pretty hot work yesterday, that infantry was sent
to his support during the night, and that he (Grant) has not
since heard from Sheridan.
Mrs. Lincoln has started home, and I will thank you to
see that our coachman is at the Arsenal wharf at eight
o’clock to-morrow morning, there to wait until she arrives.
A. LINCOLN. TELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.
CITY POINT, VA., April, 1865. 5.30?.M.
HON. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Fort Monroe:
Despatch just received, showing that Sheridan, aided by
Warren, had, at 2 P.M., pushed the enemy back, so as to
retake the Five Forks and bring his own headquarters up to
J. Boisseau’s. The Five Forks were barricaded by the enemy
and carried by Devin’s division of cavalry. This part of the
enemy seem to now be trying to work along the White Oak
road, to join the main force in front of Grant, while
Sheridan and Warren are pressing them as closely as
possible.

Last night General Grant telegraphed that General
Sheridan, with his cavalry and the Fifth Corps, had
captured three brigades of infantry, a train of wagons, and
several batteries; the prisoners amounting to several
thousand.
This morning General Grant, having ordered an attack
along the whole line, telegraphs as follows: “Both Wright
and Parke got through the enemy’s lines. The battle now
rages furiously. General Sheridan, with his cavalry, the
Fifth corps, and Miles’s Division of the Second Corps,
which was sent to him this morning, is now sweeping down
from the west.
“All now looks highly favorable. General Ord is engaged,
but I have not yet heard the result in his front.”
A. LINCOLN.
CITY POINT, April 1. 11.00 A.M.
Despatches are frequently coming in. All is going on
ﬁnely. Generals Parke, Wright, and Ord’s lines are
extending from the Appomattox to Hatcher’s Run. They
have all broken through the enemy’s intrenched lines,
taking some forts, guns, and prisoners. Sheridan, with his
 own cavalry, the Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is
coming in from the west on the enemy’s ﬂank. Wright is
already tearing up the Southside Railroad.
A. LINCOLN
CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2. 2 P.M.
At 10.45 A.M. General Grant telegraphs as follows:
“Everything has been carried from the left of the Ninth
Corps. The Sixth Corps alone captured more than three
thousand prisoners. The Second and Twenty-fourth Corps
captured forts, guns, and prisoners from the enemy, but I
cannot tell the numbers. We are now closing around the
works of the line immediately enveloping Petersburg. All
looks remarkably well. I have not yet heard from Sheridan.
His headquarters have been moved up to Banks’s house,
near the Boydton road, about three miles southwest of
Petersburg.”
A. LINCOLN.
CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2. 8.30 P.M.
At 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs as follows:
“We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and
in a few hours will be intrenched from the Appomattox
below Petersburg to the river above. The whole captures
since the army started out will not amount to less than
twelve thousand men, and probably ﬁfty pieces of artillery.
I do not know the number of men and guns accurately,
however. A portion of Foster’s Division, Twenty Fourth
Corps, made a most gallant charge this afternoon, and
captured a very important fort from the enemy, with its
 entire garrison. All seems well with us, and everything is
quiet just now.”

Petersburg completely enveloped from river below to river

about twelve thousand prisoners and ﬁfty guns. He
suggests that I shall go out and see him in the morning,

ten miles from Petersburg toward Burkevllle, telegraphs as
follows: “General Sheridan picked up twelve hundred

more have been gathered by other troops. The majority of
the arms that were left in the hands of the remnant of Lee’s
army are now scattered between Richmond and where his

HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, CITY
POINT, April 6, 1865.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, IN the Field:
Secretary 
Seward 
was 
thrown 
from 
his 
carriage
yesterday and seriously injured. This, with other matters,
will take me to Washington soon. I was at Richmond
yesterday and the day before, when and where Judge
Campbell, who was with Messrs. Hunter and Stephens in
February, called on me, and made such representations as
induced me to put in his hands an informal paper, repeating
the propositions in my letter of instructions to Mr. Seward,
which you remember, and adding that if the war be now
further persisted in by the rebels, conﬁscated property
shall at the least bear the additional cost, and that
conﬁscation shall be remitted to the people of any State
which will now promptly and in good faith withdraw its
troops 
and 
other 
support 
from 
resistance 
to 
the
Government.
Judge Campbell thought it not impossible that the rebel
legislature of Virginia would do the latter if permitted; and
accordingly I addressed a private letter to General Weitzel,
with permission to Judge Campbell to see it, telling him
(General Weitzel) that if they attempt this, to permit and
 protect them, unless they attempt something hostile to the
United States, in which case to give them notice and time
to leave, and to arrest any remaining after such time.
I do not think it very probable that anything win come of
this, but I have thought best to notify you so that if you
should see signs you may understand them.
From your recent despatches it seems that you are pretty
eﬀectually withdrawing the Virginia troops from opposition
to the Government. Nothing that I have done, or probably
shall do, is to delay, hinder, or interfere with your work.
Yours truly,
A. LINCOLN.

the Burks Station road with the road upon which they were

cavalry and infantry. Up to the present time we have

repeat what he then said, namely, he supposed owing to the
great, good news, there would be some demonstration. He
would prefer to-morrow evening, when he should be quite
willing, and he hoped ready, to say something. He desired
to be particular, because every thing he said got into print.
Occupying the position he did, a mistake would produce

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA:
A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas by my proclamations of the 19th and 27th days
of April, A.D. 1861, the ports of the United States in the
States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were
declared to be subject to blockade; but
Whereas the said blockade has, in consequence of actual
military occupation by this Government, since been
conditionally set aside or relaxed in respect to the ports of
Norfolk and Alexandria, in the State of Virginia; Beaufort,
in the State of North Carolina; Port Royal, in the State of
South Carolina; Pensacola and Fernandina, in the State of
Florida; and New Orleans, in the State of Louisiana; and
Whereas by the fourth section of the act of Congress
approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled “An act further
to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for
other purposes,” the President, for the reasons therein set
forth, is authorized to close certain ports of entry:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln.
President of the United States, do hereby proclaim that the
 ports of Richmond, Tappahannock, Cherrystone, Yorktown,
and Petersburg, in Virginia; of Camden (Elizabeth City),
Edenton, Plymouth, Washington, Newbern, Ocracoke, and
Wilmington in North Carolina; of Charleston, Georgetown,
and Beaufort, in South Carolina; of Savannah, St. Marys,
and Brunswick (Darien), in Georgia; of Mobile, in Alabama;
of Pearl River (Shieldsboro), Natchez and Vicksburg, in
Mississippi; of St. Augustine, Key West, St. Marks (Port
Leon), St. Johns (Jacksonville), and Apalachicola, in Florida;
of Teche (Franklin), in Louisiana; of Galveston, La Salle,
Brazos de Santiago (Point Isabel), and Brownsville, in
Texas, are hereby closed, and all right of importation,
warehousing, and other privileges shall, in respect to the
ports aforesaid, cease until they shall have again been
opened by order of the President; and if while said parts
are so closed any ship or vessel from beyond the United
States or having on board any articles subject to duties
shall attempt to enter any such port, the same, together
with its tackle, apparel, furniture, and cargo, shall be
forfeited to the United States.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be aﬀixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this eleventh day of April,
A.D., 1865, and of the independence of the United States of
America, the eighty-ninth.

Whereas by my proclamation of this date the port of Key
West, in the State of Florida, was inadvertently included
among those which are not open to commerce: Now,
therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of
the United States, do hereby declare and make known that
the said port of Key West is and shall remain open to
foreign and domestic commerce upon the same conditions
by which that commerce has there hitherto been governed.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA: A Proclamation.
Whereas for some time past vessels of war of the United
States have been refused in certain foreign ports,
privileges and immunities to which they were entitled by
treaty, public law, or the community of nations, at the same
time that vessels of war of the country wherein the said
privileges and immunities have been withheld have enjoyed
them fully and uninterruptedly in ports of the United
States, which condition of things has not always been
forcibly resisted by the United States, although, on the
other hand, they have not at any time failed to protest
against and declare their dissatisfaction with the same. In
the view of the United States, no condition any longer
exists which can be claimed to justify the denial to them by
any one of such nations of customary naval rights as has
heretofore been so unnecessarily persisted in.......
Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, do hereby make known that if, after a
reasonable time shall have elapsed for intelligence of this
proclamation to have reached any foreign country in whose
 ports the said privileges and immunities shall have been
refused as aforesaid, they shall continue to be so refused,
then and thenceforth the same privileges and immunities
shall be refused to the vessels of war of that country in the
ports of the United States, and this refusal shall continue
until war vessels of the United States shall have been
placed upon an entire equality in the foreign ports
aforesaid with similar vessels of other countries. The
United States, whatever claim or pretense may have
existed heretofore, are now, at least, entitled to claim and
concede an entire and friendly equality of rights and
hospitalities with all maritime nations.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused 
the 
seal 
of 
the 
United

APRIL 11, 1865
FELLOW-CITIZENS — WE meet this evening not in
sorrow, but in gladness of heart. The evacuation of
Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the
principal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and
speedy 
peace, 
whose 
joyous 
expression 
cannot 
be
restrained. In the midst of this, however, He from whom
blessings ﬂow must not be forgotten.
A call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared, and
will be duly promulgated. Nor must those whose harder
part gives us the cause of rejoicing be overlooked. Their
honors must not be parceled out with others. I myself was
near the front, and had the pleasure of transmitting much
of the good news to you. But no part of the honor for plan
or execution is mine. To General Grant, his skillful oﬀicers,
and brave men, all belongs. The gallant navy stood ready,
but was not in reach to take active part. By these recent
successes, the reinauguration of the national authority —
reconstruction which has had a large share of thought from
the ﬁrst, is pressed much more closely upon our attention.
It is fraught with great diﬀiculty. Unlike a case of war
between independent nations, there is no authorized organ
for us to treat with — no one man has authority to give up
 the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with
and mould from disorganized and discordant elements. Nor
is it a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal
people, diﬀer among ourselves as to the mode, manner, and
measure of reconstruction. As a general rule, I abstain from
reading the reports of attacks upon myself, Wishing not to
be provoked by that to which I cannot properly oﬀer an
answer. In spite of this precaution, however, it comes to my
knowledge that I am much censured for some supposed
agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new State
government of Louisiana. In this I have done just so much
and no more than the public knows. In the Annual Message
of December, 1863, and the accompanying proclamation, I
presented a plan of reconstruction, as the phrase goes,
which I promised, if adopted by any State, would be
acceptable to and sustained by the Executive Government
of the nation. I distinctly stated that this was not the only
plan that might possibly be acceptable, and I also distinctly
protested that the Executive claimed no right to say when
or whether members should be admitted to seats in
Congress from such States. This plan was in advance
submitted to the then Cabinet, and approved by every
member of it. One of them suggested that I should then and
in that connection apply the Emancipation Proclamation to
the theretofore excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana;
that I should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for
freed people, and that I should omit the protest against my
own power in regard to the admission of members of
Congress. But even he approved every part and parcel of
 the plan which has since been employed or touched by the
action of Louisiana. The new constitution of Louisiana,
declaring emancipation for the whole State, practically
applies the proclamation to the part previously excepted. It
does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people, and is
silent, as it could not well be otherwise, about the
admission of members to Congress. So that, as it applied to
Louisiana, every member of the Cabinet fully approved the
plan. The message went to Congress, and I received many
commendations of the plan, written and verbal, and not a
single objection to it from any professed emancipationist
came to my knowledge until after the news reached
Washington that the people of Louisiana had begun to move
in accordance with it. From about July, 1862, I had
corresponded with diﬀerent persons supposed to be
interested 
in 
seeking 
a 
reconstruction 
of 
a 
State
government for Louisiana. When the message of 1863, with
the plan before mentioned, reached New Orleans, General
Banks wrote me that he was conﬁdent that the people, with
his military co-operation, would reconstruct substantially
on that plan. I wrote to him and some of them to try it. They
tried it, and the result is known. Such has been my only
agency in getting up the Louisiana government. As to
sustaining it my promise is out, as before stated. But, as
bad promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this
as a bad promise and break it, whenever I shall be
convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest;
but I have not yet been so convinced. I have been shown a
letter on this subject, supposed to be an able one, in which
 the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to
be deﬁnitely ﬁxed upon the question whether the seceded
States, so called, are in the Union or out of it. It would
perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn
that since I have found professed Union men endeavoring
to answer that question, I have purposely forborne any
public expression upon it. As appears to me, that question
has not been nor yet is a practically material one, and that
any discussion of it, while it thus remains practically
immaterial, could have no eﬀect other than the mischievous
one of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may
become, that question is bad as the basis of a controversy,
and good for nothing at all — a merely pernicious
abstraction. We all agree that the seceded States, so called,
are out of their proper practical relation with the Union,
and that the sole object of the Government, civil and
military, in regard to those States, is to again get them into
their proper practical relation. I believe that it is not only
possible, but in fact easier, to do this without deciding or
even considering whether those States have ever been out
of the Union, than with it. Finding themselves safely at
home, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had
been abroad. Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to
restore the proper practical relations between these States
and the Union, and each forever after innocently indulge
his own opinion whether, in doing the acts he brought the
States from without into the Union, or only gave them
proper assistance, they never having been out of it. The
amount of constituency, so to speak, on which the Louisiana
 government rests, would be more satisfactory to all if it
contained ﬁfty thousand, or thirty thousand, or even twenty
thousand, instead of twelve thousand, as it does. It is also
unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not
given to the colored man. I would myself prefer that it were
now conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who
serve our cause as soldiers. Still, the question is not
whether the Louisiana government, as it stands, is quite all
that is desirable. The question is, Will it be wiser to take it
as it is and help to improve it, or to reject and disperse?
Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation
with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her
new State government? Some twelve thousand voters in the
heretofore Slave State of Louisiana have sworn allegiance
to the Union, assumed to be the rightful political power of
the State, held elections, organized a State government,
adopted a Free State constitution, giving the beneﬁt of
public schools equally to black and white, and empowering
the Legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the
colored man. This Legislature has already voted to ratify
the 
Constitutional 
Amendment 
recently 
passed 
by
Congress, abolishing slavery throughout the nation. These
twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the
Union and to perpetuate freedom in the State — committed
to the very things, and nearly all things, the nation wants —
and they ask the nation’s recognition and its assistance to
make good this committal. Now, if we reject and spurn
them, we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them.
We, in fact, say to the white man: You are worthless or
 worse; we will neither help you nor be helped by you. To
the blacks we say: This cup of liberty which these, your old
masters, held to your lips, we will dash from you, and leave
you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered
contents in some vague and undeﬁned when, where, and
how. If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white
and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper
practical relations with the Union, I have so far been
unable to perceive it. If, on the contrary, we recognize and
sustain the new government of Louisiana, the converse of
all this is made true. We encourage the hearts and nerve
the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and
argue for it, and proselyte for it, and ﬁght for it, and feed it,
and grow it, and ripen it to a complete success. The colored
man, too, in seeing all united for him, is inspired with
vigilance, and energy, and daring to the same end. Grant
that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it
sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it,
than by running backward over them? Concede that the
new government of Louisiana is only to what it should be as
the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by
hatching the egg than by smashing it. Again, if we reject
Louisiana, we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed
amendment to the National Constitution. To meet this
proposition, it has been argued that no more than three
fourths of those States which have not attempted secession
are necessary to validly ratify the amendment. I do not
commit myself against this, further than to say that such a
ratiﬁcation would be questionable, and sure to be
 persistently questioned, while a ratiﬁcation by three
fourths of all the States would be unquestioned and
unquestionable. I repeat the question, Can Louisiana be
brought into proper practical relation with the Union
sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State
government? What has been said of Louisiana will apply to
other States. And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each
State, and such important and sudden changes occur in the
same State, and withal so new and unprecedented is the
whole case, that no exclusive and inﬂexible plan can safely
be prescribed as to details and collaterals. Such exclusive
and 
inﬂexible 
plan 
would 
surely 
become 
a 
new
entanglement. Important principles may and must be
inﬂexible. In the present situation as the phrase goes, it
may be my duty to make some new announcement to the
people of the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to
act, when satisﬁed that action will be proper.

temper manifested by me while there. Is there any sign of
the rebel legislature coming together on the understanding
of my letter to you? If there is any such sign, inform me
what it is; if there is no such sign, you may withdraw the
oﬀer.

MAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.: 
I HAVE JUST seen Judge Campbell’s letter to you of the 7th.
He assumes, as appears to me, that I have called the
insurgent legislature of Virginia together, as the rightful
legislature of the State, to settle all diﬀerences with the
United States. I have done no such thing. I spoke of them,
not as a legislature, but as “the gentlemen who have acted
as the legislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion.” I
did this on purpose to exclude the assumption that I was
recognizing them as a rightful body. I deal with them as
men having power de facto to do a speciﬁc thing, to wit:
“To withdraw the Virginia troops and other support from
resistance to the General Government,” for which, in the
paper handed Judge Campbell, I promised a speciﬁc
equivalent, to wit: a remission to the people of the State,
except in certain cases, of the conﬁscation of their
property. I meant this, and no more. Inasmuch, however, as
Judge Campbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for
an armistice, contrary to the explicit statement of the paper
I gave him, and particularly as General Grant has since
captured the Virginia troops, so that giving a consideration
for their withdrawal is no longer applicable, let my letter to
you and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn, or
 countermanded, and he be notiﬁed of it. Do not now allow
them to assemble, but if any have come, allow them safe
return to their homes.
A. LINCOLN.

MR. COLFA , I want you to take a message from me to the
miners whom you visit. I have very large ideas of the
mineral wealth of our nation. I believe it practically
inexhaustible. It abounds all over the Western country, from
the Rocky Mountains to the Paciﬁc, and its development
has scarcely commenced. During the war, when we were
adding a couple of millions of dollars every day to our
national debt, I did not care about encouraging the
increase in the volume of our precious metals. We had the
country to save ﬁrst. But now that the rebellion is
overthrown, and we know pretty nearly the amount of our
national debt, the more gold and silver we mine, we make
the payment of that debt so much the easier. “Now,” said
he, speaking with more emphasis, “I am going to encourage
that in every possible way. We shall have hundreds of
thousands of disbanded soldiers, and many have feared
that their return home in such great numbers might
paralyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply
of labor than there will be demand for. I am going to try to
attract them to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges,
where there is room enough for all. Immigration, which
even the war has not stopped, will land upon our shores
hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded
 Europe. I intend to point them to the gold and silver that
wait for them in the West. Tell the miners for me, that I
shall promote their interests to the utmost of my ability;
because their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation;
and,” said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, “we shall
prove, in a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury
of the world.”

E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 14, 1865
GENERAL VAN ALLEN: I intend to adopt the advice of
my friends and use due precaution.... I thank you for the
assurance you give me that I shall be supported by
conservative men like yourself, in the eﬀorts I may make to
restore the Union, so as to make it, to use your language, a
Union of hearts and hands as well as of States.
Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.
