Before writing further about Christian contacts, I must record other  experiences of the same period. Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad had in Pretoria the same position as  was enjoyed by Dada Abdulla in Natal. There was no public movement  that could be conducted without him. I made his acquaintance the  very first week and told him of my intention to get in touch with  every Indian in Pretoria. I expressed a desire to study the  conditions of Indians there, and asked for his help in my work,  which he gladly agreed to give. My first step was to call a meeting of all the Indians in Pretoria  and to present to them a picture of their condition in the  Transvaal. The meeting was held at the house of Sheth Haji Muhammad  Haji Joosab, to whom I had a letter of introduction. It was  principally attended by Meman merchants, though there was a  sprinkling of Hindus as well. The Hindu population in Pretoria was,  as a matter of fact, very small. My speech at this meeting may be said to have been the first public  speech in my life. I went fairly prepared with my subject, which was  about observing truthfulness in business. I had always heard the  merchants say that truth was not possible in business. I did not  think so then, nor do I now. Even today there are merchant friends  who contend that truth is inconsistent with business. Business, they  say, is a very practical affair, and truth a matter of religion; and  they argue that practical affairs are one thing, while religion is quite another.  Pure truth, they hold, is out of the question in business, one can  speak it only so far as is suitable. I strongly contested the  position in my speech and awakened the merchants to a sense of their  duty, which was two-fold. Their responsibility to be truthful was  all the greater in a foreign land, because the conduct of a few  Indians was the measure of that of the millions of their  fellow-countrymen. I had found our peoples' habits to be insanitary, as compared with  those of the Englishmen around them, and drew their attention to it.  I laid stress on the necessity of forgetting all distinctions such  as Hindus, Musalmans, Parsis, Christians, Gujaratis, Madrasis,  Punjabis, Sindhis, Kachchhis, Surtis and so on. I suggested, in conclusion, the formation of an association to make  representations to the authorities concerned in respect of the  hardships of the Indian settlers, and offered to place at its  disposal as much of my time and service as was possible. I saw that I made a considerable impression on the meeting. My speech was followed by discussion. Some offered to supply me with  facts. I felt encouraged. I saw that very few amongst my audience  knew English. As I felt that knowledge of English would be useful in  that country, I advised those who had leisure to learn English. I told  them that it was possible to learn a language even at an advanced  age, and cited cases of people who had done so. I undertook,  besides, to teach a class, if one was started, or personally to  instruct individuals desiring to learn the language. The class was not started, but three young men expressed their  readiness to learn at their convenience, and on condition that I  went to their places to teach them. Of these, two were Musalmans – one of them a barber and the other a clerk –  and the third was a Hindu, a  petty shopkeeper. I agreed to suit them all. I had no misgivings  regarding my capacity to teach. My pupils might become tired, but  not I. Sometimes it happened that I would go to their places only to  find them engaged in their business. But I did not lose patience.  None of the three desired a deep study of English, but two may be  said to have made fairly good progress in about eight months. Two  learnt enough to keep accounts and write ordinary business letters.  The barber's ambition was confined to acquiring just enough English  for dealing with his customers. As a result of their studies, two of  the pupils were equipped for making a fair income. I was satisfied with the result of the meeting. It was decided to  hold such meetings, as far as I remember, once a week or, maybe,  once a month. These were held more or less regularly, and on these  occasions there was a free exchange of ideas. The result was that  there was now in Pretoria no Indian I did not know, or whose  condition I was not acquainted with. This prompted me in turn to  make the acquaintance of the British Agent in Pretoria, Mr. Jacobus  de Wet. He had sympathy for the Indians, but he had very little  influence. However, he agreed to help us as best he could, and  invited me to meet him whenever I wished. I now communicated with the railway authorities and told them that,  even under their own regulations, the disabilities about travelling  under which the Indians laboured could not be justified. I got a  letter in reply to the effect that first and second class tickets  would be issued to Indians who were properly dressed. This was far  from giving adequate relief, as it rested with the station master to  decide who was 'properly dressed'.  The British Agent showed me some papers dealing with Indian affairs.  Tyeb Sheth had also given me similar papers. I learnt from them how  cruelly the Indians were hounded out from the Orange Free State. In short, my stay in Pretoria enabled me to make a deep study of the  social, economic and political condition of the Indians in the  Transvaal and the Orange Free State. I had no idea that this study  was to be of invaluable service to me in the future. For I had  thought of returning home by the end of the year, or even earlier,  if the case was finished before the year was out. But God disposed otherwise.
