It would be out of place here to describe fully the  condition of Indians in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.  I would suggest that those who wish to have a full idea of it may turn to my  History of Satyagraha in South Africa.  It is, however, necessary to give here a brief outline. In the Orange Free State the Indians were deprived of all their  rights by a special law enacted in 1888 or even earlier. If they  chose to stay there, they could do so only to serve as waiters in  hotels or to pursue some other such menial calling. The traders were  driven away with a nominal compensation. They made representations  and petitions, but in vain. A very stringent enactment was passed in the Transvaal in 1885. It  was slightly amended in 1886, and it was provided under the amended  law that all Indians should pay a poll tax of £3 as fee for entry  into the Transvaal. They might not own land except in locations set  apart for them, and in practice even that was not to be ownership.  They had no franchise. All this was under the special law for Asiatics, to whom the laws for the coloured people were also  applied. Under these latter, Indians might not walk on public  footpaths, and might not move out of doors after 9 p.m. without a  permit. The enforcement of this last regulation was elastic so far  as the Indians were concerned. Those who passed as 'Arabs' were, as  a matter of favour, exempted from it. The exemption thus naturally  depended on the sweet will of the police. I had to experience the effect of both these regulations. I often  went out at night for a walk with Mr. Coates, and we rarely got back  home much before ten o'clock. What if the police arrested me? Mr.  Coates was more concerned about this than I. He had to issue passes  to his Negro servants. But how could he give one to me? Only a  master might issue a permit to a servant. If I had wanted one, and  even if Mr. Coates had been ready to give it, he could not have done  so, for it would have been fraud. So Mr. Coates or some friend of his took me to the State Attorney,  Dr. Krause. We turned out to be barristers of the same Inn. The fact  that I needed a pass to enable me to be out of doors after 9 p.m.  was too much for him. He expressed sympathy for me. Instead of  ordering for me a pass, he gave me a letter authorizing me to be out  of doors at all hours without police interference. I always kept  this letter on me whenever I went out. The fact that I never had to  make use of it was a mere accident. Dr. Krause invited me to his place, and we may be said to have  become friends. I occasionally called on him, and it was through him  that I was introduced to his more famous brother, who was public  Prosecutor in Johannesburg. During the Boer War he was  court-martialled for conspiring to murder an English officer, and  was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years. He was also disbarred  by the Benchers. On the termination of hostilities he was released  and being honourably readmitted to the Transvaal bar, resumed  practice. These connections were useful to me later on in my public  life, and simplified much of my work. The consequences of the regulation regarding the use of footpaths  were rather serious for me. I always went out for a walk through  President Street to an open plain. President Kruger's house was in  this street – a  very modest, unostentatious building, without a  garden, and not distinguishable from other houses in its neighbourhood.  The houses of many of the millionaires in Pretoria  were far more pretentious, and were surrounded by gardens. Indeed  President Kruger's simplicity was proverbial. Only the presence of a  police patrol before the house indicated that it belonged to some  official. I nearly always went along the footpath past this patrol  without the slightest hitch or hindrance. Now the man on duty used to be changed from time to time. Once one  of these men, without giving me the slightest warning, without even  asking me to leave the footpath, pushed and kicked me into the  street. I was dismayed. Before I could question him as to his  behaviour, Mr. Coates, who happened to be passing the spot on  horseback, hailed me and said: 'Gandhi, I have seen everything. I shall gladly be your witness in  court if you proceed against the man. I am very sorry you have been  so rudely assaulted.' 'You need not be sorry', I said. 'What does the poor man know?  All coloured people are the same to him. He no doubt treats Negroes just  as he has treated me. I have made it a rule not go to court in  respect of any personal grievance. So I do not intend to proceed  against him.' 'That is just like you,' said Mr. Coates, but do think it over  again. We must teach such men a lesson.' He then spoke to the  policeman and reprimanded him. I could not follow their talk, as it  was in Dutch, the policeman being a Boer. But he apologized to me,  for which there was no need. I had already forgiven him. But I never again went through this street. There would be other men  coming in this man's place and, ignorant of the incident, they would  behave likewise. Why should I unnecessarily court another kick? I  therefore selected a different walk. The incident deepened my feeling for the Indian settlers. I  discussed with them the advisability of making a test case, if it  were found necessary to do so, after having seen the British Agent  in the matter of these regulations. I thus made an intimate study of the hard condition of the Indian  settlers, not only by reading and hearing about it, but by personal  experience. I saw that South Africa was no country for a self-respecting Indian, and my mind became more and more occupied with the question as to how this state of thing might be improved. But my principal duty for the moment was to attend to the case of  Dada Abdulla.
