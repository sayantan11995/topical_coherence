From Madras I proceeded to Calcutta where I found myself hemmed by  difficulties. I knew no one there. So I took a room in the Great  Eastern Hotel. Here I became acquainted with Mr. Ellerthorpe, a  representative of The Daily Telegraph.  He invited me to the Bengal Club, where he was staying. He did not  then realize that an Indian could not be taken to the drawing-room  of the club. Having discovered the restriction, he took me to his  room. He expressed his sorrow regarding this prejudice of the local  Englishmen and apologized to me for not having been able to take me  to the drawing-room.  I had of course to see Surendranath Banerji, the 'Idol of Bengal'.  When I met him, he was surrounded by a number of friends. He said:  'I am afraid people will not take interest in your work. As you  know, our difficulties here are by no means few. But you must try as  best you can. You will have to enlist the sympathy of Maharajas.  Mind you meet the representatives of the British Indian  Association. You should meet Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji and  Maharaja Tagore. Both are liberal-minded and take a fair share in  public work.'  I met these gentlemen, but without success. Both gave me a cold  reception and said it was no easy thing to call a public in Calcutta, and if anything could be done, it would  practically all depend on Surendranath Banerji.  I saw that my task was becoming more and more difficult. I called at the office of The Amrita Bazar Patrika.  The gentleman whom I met there took me to be a wandering Jew.  The Bangabasi went even one better. The editor kept me waiting for an hour. He had  evidently many interviewers, but he would not so much as look at me,  even when he had disposed of the rest. On my venturing to broach my  subject after the long wait, he said: 'Don't you see our hands are  full? There is no end to the number of visitors like you. You had  better go. I am not disposed to listen to you.' For a moment I felt  offended, but I quickly understood the editor's position. I had  heard of the fame of The Bangabasi.  I could see that there was a regular stream of visitors there. And  they were all people acquainted with him. His paper had no lack of  topics to discuss, and South Africa was hardly known at that time. However serious a grievance may be in the eyes of the man who  suffers from it, he will be but one of the numerous people invading  the editor's office, each with a grievance of his own. How is the  editor to meet them all? Moreover, the aggrieved party imagines that  the editor is a power in the land. Only he knows that his powers can  hardly travel beyond the threshold of his office. But I was not  discouraged. I kept on seeing editors of other papers. As usual I  met the Anglo-Indian editors also.  The Statesman and The Englishman  realized the importance of the question. I gave them long  interviews, and they published them in full.  Mr. Saunders, editor of The Englishman,  claimed me as his own. He placed his office and paper at my  disposal. He even allowed me the liberty of making whatever changes  I liked in the leading article he had written on the situation, the  proof of which he sent me in advance. It is no exaggeration to say  that a friendship grew up between us. He promised to render me all  the help he could, carried out the promise to the letter, and kept  on his correspondence with me until the time when he was seriously  ill.  Throughout my life I have had the privilege of many such  friendships, which have sprung up quite unexpectedly. What Mr.  Saunders liked in me was my freedom from exaggeration and my  devotion to truth. He subjected me to a searching cross-examination  before he began to sympathize with my cause, and he saw that I had  spared neither will nor pains to place before him an impartial  statement of the case even of the white man in South Africa and also  to appreciate it.  My experience has shown me that we win justice quickest by rendering  justice to the other party.  The unexpected help of Mr. Saunders had begun to encourage me to  think that I might succeed after all in holding a public meeting in  Calcutta, when I received the following cable from Durban:  'Parliament opens January. Return soon.'  So I addressed a letter to the press, in which I explained why I had  to leave Calcutta so abruptly, and set off for Bombay. Before  starting I wired to the Bombay agent of Dada Abdulla & Co., to  arrange for my passage by the first possible boat to South Africa.  Dada Abdulla had just then purchased the steamship Courland  and insisted on my travelling on that boat, offering to take me and  my family free of charge. I gratefully accepted the offer, and in  the beginning of December set sail a second time for South Africa,  now with my wife and two sons and the only son of my widowed sister.  Another steamship Naderi also sailed for Durban at the same time. The agents of the Company  were Dada Abdulla & Co. The total number of passengers these boats  carried must have been about eight hundred, half of whom were bound  for the Transvaal.
