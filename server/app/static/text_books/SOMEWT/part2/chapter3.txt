While in Bombay, I began, on the one hand, my study of Indian law and, on  the other, my experiments in dietetics in which Virchand Gandhi, a friend, joined me. My brother, for his part, was trying his best to get me briefs.The study of Indian law was a tedious business. The Civil Procedure Code I  could in no way get on with. Not so however, with the Evidence Act.  Virchand Gandhi was reading for the solicitor's examination and  would tell me all sorts of stories about barristers and vakils. 'Sir  Pherozeshah's ability,' he would say, 'lies in his profound  knowledge of law. He has the Evidence Act by heart and knows all the  cases on the thirty-second section. Badruddin Tyabji's wonderful  power of argument inspires the judges with awe.'The stories of stalwarts such as these would unnerve me. 'It is not unusual', he would add, 'for a barrister to vegetate for five or  seven years. That's why I have signed the articles for solicitorship.  You should count yourself lucky if you can paddle your own canoe in  three years' time.'Expenses were mounting up every month. To have a barrister's board outside  the house, whilst still preparing for the barrister's profession  inside, was a thing to which I could not reconcile myself. Hence I  could not give undivided attention to my studies. I developed some  liking for the Evidence Act and read Mayne's Hindu Law with deep  interest, but I had not the courage to conduct a case. I was  helpless beyond words, even as the bride come fresh to her  father-in- law's house!About  this time, I took up the case of one Mamibai. It was a 'small  cause.' 'You will have to pay some commission to the tout,' I was  told. I emphatically declined.'But even  that great criminal lawyer Mr. So-and-So, who makes three to four  thousand a month, pays commission!''I do not  need to emulate him,' I rejoined. 'I should be content with Rs. 300  a month. Father did not get more.''But  those days are gone. Expenses in Bombay have gone up frightfully.  You must be business-like.'I was  adamant. I gave no commission, but got Mamibai's case all the same.  It was an easy case. I charged Rs. 30 for my fees. The case was not  likely to last longer than a day.......This was  my d√©but in the Small Causes Court. I appeared for the defendant and had thus to  cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses. I stood up, but my heart  sank into my boots. My head was reeling and I felt as though the  whole court was doing likewise. I could think of no question to ask.  The judge must have laughed, and the vakils no doubt enjoyed the  spectacle. But I was past seeing anything. I sat down and told the  agent that I could not conduct the case, that he had better engage  Patel and have the fee back from me. Mr. Patel was duly engaged for  Rs. 51. To him, of course, the case was child's play. I hastened from the Court, not knowing whether my client won or lost  her case, but I was ashamed of myself, and decided not to take up  any more cases until I had courage enough to conduct them. Indeed I  did not go to Court again until I went to South Africa. There was no  virtue in my decision. I had simply made a virtue of necessity.  There would be no one so foolish as to entrust his case to me, only  to lose it!But there was another case in store for me at Bombay. It was a memorial  to be drafted. A poor Mussalman's land was confiscated in Porbandar.  He approached me as the worthy son of a worthy father. His case  appeared to be weak, but I consented to draft a memorial for him,  the cost of printing to be borne by him. I drafted it and read it  out to friends. They approved of it, and that to some extent made me  feel confident that I was qualified enough to draft a memorial, as  indeed I really was. My business could flourish if I drafted memorials without any fees. But  that would being no grist to the mill. So I thought I might take up  a teacher's job. My knowledge of English was good enough, and I  should have loved to teach English to Matriculation boys in some  school. In this way I could have met part at least of the expenses.  I came across an advertisement in the papers: 'Wanted, an English  teacher to teach one hour daily. Salary Rs 75.' The advertisement  was from a famous high school. I applied for the post and was called  for an interview. I went there in high spirits, but when the  principal found that I was not a graduate, he regretfully refused  me.'But I have passed the London Matriculation with Latin as my second  language.''True but we want a graduate.'There was  no help for it. I wrung my hands in despair. My brother also felt  much worried. We both came to the conclusion that it was no use  spending more time in Bombay. I should settle in Rajkot where my  brother, himself a petty pleader, could give me some work in the  shape of drafting applications and memorials. And then as there was  already a household at Rajkot, the breaking up of the one at Bombay  meant a considerable saving. I liked the suggestion. My little  establishment was thus closed after a stay of six months in Bombay. I used to attend High Court daily whilst in Bombay, but I cannot say that I  learnt anything there. I had not sufficient knowledge to learn much.  Often I could not follow the cases and dozed off. There were others  also who kept me company in this, and thus lightened my load of  shame. After a time, I even lost the sense of shame, as I learnt to  think that it was fashionable to doze in the High Court. If the present generation has also its briefless barristers like me in  Bombay, I would commend them a little practical precept about  living. Although I lived in Girgaum I hardly ever took a carriage or  a tram-car. I had made it a rule to walk to the High Court. It took  me quite forty-five minutes, and of course I invariably returned  home on foot. I had inured myself to the heat of the sun. This walk  to and from the Court saved a fair amount of money, and when many of  my friends in Bombay used to fall ill, I do not remember having once  had an illness. Even when I began to earn money, I kept up the  practice of walking to and from the office, and I am still reaping  the benefits of that practice.
