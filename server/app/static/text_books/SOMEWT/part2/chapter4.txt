Disappointed, I left Bombay and went to Rajkot where I set up my own office. Here  I got along moderately well. Drafting applications and memorials  brought me in, on an average, Rs 300 a month. For this work I had to  thank influence rather than my own ability, for my brother's partner  had a settled practice. All applications etc. which were, really or  to his mind, of an important character, he sent to big barristers.  To my lot fell the applications to be drafted on behalf of his poor  clients. I must confess that here I had to compromise the principle of giving no  commission, which in Bombay I had so scrupulously observed. I was  told that conditions in the two cases were different; that whilst in  Bombay commissions had to be paid to touts, here they had to be paid  to vakils who briefed you; and that here as in Bombay all  barristers, without exception, paid a percentage of their fees as  commission. The argument of my brother was, for me, unanswerable.  'You see,' said he, 'that I am in partnership with another vakil. I  shall always be inclined to make over to you all our cases with  which you can possibly deal, and if you refuse to pay a commission  to my partner, you are sure to embarrass me. As you and I have a  joint establishment, your fee comes to our common purse, and I  automatically get a share. But what about my partner? Supposing he  gave the same case to some other barrister he would certainly get  his commission from him.' I was taken in by this plea, and felt  that, if I was to practise as a barrister, I could not press my  principle regarding commissions in such cases. That is how I argued  with myself, or to put it bluntly, how I deceived myself. Let me  add, however, that I do not remember ever to have given commission  in respect of any other case. Though I thus began to make both ends meet, I got the first shock of my life  about this time. I had heard what a British officer was like, but up  to now had never been face to face with one. My brother had been secretary and adviser to the late Ranasaheb of  Porbandar before he was installed on his gadi1,  and hanging over his head at this time was the charge of having  given wrong advice when in that office. The matter had gone to the  Political Agent who was prejudiced against my brother. Now I had  known this officer when in England, and he may be said to have been  fairly friendly to me. My brother thought that I should avail myself  of the friendship and, putting in a good word on his behalf, try to  disabuse the Political Agent of his prejudice. I did not at all like  this idea. I should not, I thought, try to take advantage of a  trifling acquaintance in England. If my brother was really at fault,  what use was my recommendation? If he was innocent, he should submit  a petition in the proper course and, confident of his innocence,  face the result. My brother did not relish this advice. 'You do not  know Kathiawad', he said, 'and you have yet to know the world. Only  influence counts here. It is not proper for you, a brother, to shirk  your duty, when you can clearly put in a good word about me to an  officer you know.' I could not refuse him, so I went to the officer much against my will. I  knew I had no right to approach him and was fully conscious that I  was compromising my self-respect. But I sought an appointment and  got it. I reminded him of the old acquaintance, but I immediately  saw that Kathiawad was different from England; that an officer on  leave was not the same as an officer on duty. The political Agent  owned the acquaintance, but the reminder seemed to stiffen him.  'Surely you have not come here to abuse that acquaintance, have  you?' appeared to be the meaning of that stiffness, and seemed to be  written on his brow. Nevertheless I opened my case. The sahib was  impatient. 'Your brother is an intriguer. I want to hear nothing  more from you. I have no time. If your brother has anything to say,  let him apply through the proper channel.' The answer was enough,  was perhaps deserved. But selfishness is blind. I went on with my  story. The sahib got up and said: 'You must go now.' 'But please hear me out,' said I. That made him more angry. He called his  peon and ordered him to show me the door. I was still hesitating  when the peon came in, placed his hands on my shoulders and put me  out of the room. The sahib went away as also the peon, and I departed, fretting and fuming. I at once  wrote out and sent over a note to this effect: 'You have insulted  me. You have assaulted me through your peon. If you make no amends,  I shall have to proceed against you.' Quick came the answer through his sowar: 'You were rude to me. I asked you to go and you would not. I had no option but  to order my peon to show you the door. Even after he asked you to  leave the office, you did not do so. He therefore had to use just  enough force to send you out. You are at liberty to proceed as you  wish.' With this answer in my pocket, I came home crest-fallen, and told my brother  all that had happened. He was grieved, but was at a loss as to how  to console me. He spoke to his vakil friends. For I did not know how  to proceed against the sahib.  Sir Pherozeshah Mehta happened to be in Rajkot at this time, having  come down from Bombay for some case. But how could a junior  barrister like me dare to see him? So I sent him the papers of my  case, through the vakil who had engaged him, and begged for his  advice. 'Tell Gandhi,' he said, 'such things are the common  experience of many vakils and barristers. He is still fresh from  England, and hot-blooded. He does not know British officers. If he  would earn something and have an easy time here, let him tear up the  note and pocket the insult. He will gain nothing by proceeding  against the sahib, and on the contrary will very likely ruin himself. Tell him he has  yet to know life.' The advice was as bitter as poison to me, but I had to swallow it. I  pocketed the insult, but also profited by it. 'Never again shall I  place myself in such a false position, never again shall I try to  exploit friendship in this way,' said I to myself, and since then I  have never been guilty of a breach of that determination. This shock  changed the course of my life.
