I soon came in contact with the Christian Indians living in Durban.  The Court Interpreter, Mr. Paul, was a Roman Catholic. I made his  acquaintance, as also that of the late Mr. Subhan Godfrey, then a  teacher under the Protestant Mission, and father of James Godfery,  who, as a member of the South African Deputation, visited India in  1924. I likewise met the late Parsi Rustomji and the late Adamji  Miyakhan about the same time. All these friends, who up to then had  never met one another except on business, came ultimately into close  contact, as we shall see later. Whilst I was thus widening the circle of my acquaintance, the firm  received a letter from their lawyer saying that preparations should  be made for the case, and that Abdulla Sheth should go to Pretoria  himself or send a representative. Abdulla Sheth gave me this letter to read, and asked me if I would  go to Pretoria. 'I can only say after I have understood the case  from you,' said I. 'At present I am at a loss to know what I have to  do there.' He thereupon asked his clerks to explain the case to me. As I began to study the case, I felt as though I ought to begin from  the A B C of the subject. During the few days I had had at Zanzibar,  I had been to the court to see the work there. A Parsi lawyer was  examining a witness and asking him questions regarding credit and  debit entries in account books. It was all Greek to me. Book-keeping  I had learnt neither at school nor during my stay in England. And  the case for which I had come to South Africa was mainly about  accounts. Only one who knew accounts could understand and explain  it. The clerk went on talking about this debited and that credited,  and I felt more and more confused. I did not know what a P. Note  meant. I failed to find the word in the dictionary. I revealed my  ignorance to the clerk, and I learnt from him that a P. Note meant a promisory note. I purchased a book on book-keeping and studied it.  That gave me some confidence. I understood the case. I saw that  Abdulla Sheth, who did not know how to keep accounts, had so much  practical knowledge that he could quickly solve intricacies of  book-keeping. I told him that I was prepared to go to Pretoria. 'Where will you put up?' asked the Sheth. 'Wherever you want me to,'  said I. 'Then I shall write to our lawyer. He will arrange for your  lodgings. I shall also write to my Meman friends there, but I would  not advise you to stay with them. The other party has great  influence in Pretoria. Should any one of them manage to read our  private correspondence, it might do us much harm. The more you avoid  familiarity with them, the better for us.' 'I shall stay where your lawyer puts me up, or I shall find out  independent lodgings. Pray don't worry. Not a soul shall know  anything that is confidential between us. But I do intend  cultivating the acquaintance of the other party. I should like to be  friends with them. I would try, if possible, to settle the case out  of court. After all Tyeb Sheth is a relative of yours.' Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad was a near relative of Abdulla Sheth. The mention of a probable settlement somewhat startled the Sheth, I  could see. But I had already been six or seven days in Durban, and  we now knew and understood each other. I was no longer a 'white  elephant.' So he said: 'Y...es, I see. There would be nothing better than a settlement out  of court. But we are all relatives and know one another very well  indeed. Tyeb Sheth is not a man to consent to a settlement easily.  With the slightest unwariness on our part, he would screw all sorts  of things out of us, and do us down in the end. So please think  twice before you do anything.' 'Don't be anxious about that,' said I. 'I need not talk to Tyeb  Sheth, or for that matter to anyone else, about the case. I would  only suggest to him to come to an understanding, and so save a lot  of unnecessary litigation.' On the seventh or eighth day after my arrival, I left Durban. A  first class seat was booked for me. It was usual there to pay five  shillings extra, if one needed a bedding. Abdulla Sheth insisted  that I should book one bedding but, out of obstinacy and pride and  with a view to saving five shillings, I declined. Abdulla Sheth  warned me. 'Look, now,' said he, 'this is a different country from  India. Thank God, we have enough and to spare. Please do not stint  yourself in anything that you may need.' I thanked him and asked him not to be anxious. The train reached Maritzburg, the capital of Natal, at about 9 p.m.  Beddings used to be provided at this station. A railway servant came  and asked me if I wanted one. 'No,' said I, 'I have one with me.' He  went away. But a passenger came next, and looked me up and down. He  saw that I was a 'coloured' man. This disturbed him. Out he went and  came in again with one or two officials. They all kept quiet, when  another official came to me and said, 'Come along, you must go to  the van compartment.' 'But I have a first class ticket,' said I. 'That doesn't matter,' rejoined the other. 'I tell you, you must go  to the van compartment.' 'I tell you, I was permitted to travel in this compartment at  Durban, and I insist on going on in it.' 'No, you won't,' said the official. 'You must leave this  compartment, or else I shall have to call a police constable to push  you out.' 'Yes, you may. I refuse to get out voluntarily.' The constable came. He took me by the hand and pushed me out. My  luggage was also taken out. I refused to go to the other compartment  and the train steamed away. I went and sat in the waiting room,  keeping my hand-bag with me, and leaving the other luggage where it  was. The railway authorities had taken charge of it.  It was winter, and winter in the higher regions of South Africa is severely cold. Maritzburg being at a high altitude,  the cold was extremely bitter.  My over-coat was in my luggage, but I did not dare to ask for it  lest I should be insulted again, so I sat and shivered. There was no  light in the room. A passenger came in at about midnight and  possibly wanted to talk to me. But I was in no mood to talk.  I began to think of my duty. Should I fight for my rights or go back  to India, or should I go on to Pretoria without minding the insults,  and return to India after finishing the case? It would be cowardice  to run back to India without fulfilling my obligation. The hardship  to which I was subjected was superficial â€“ only a symptom of the deep  disease of colour prejudice. I should try, if possible, to root out  the disease and suffer hardships in the process. Redress for wrongs  I should seek only to the extent that would be necessary for the  removal of the colour prejudice. So I decided to take the next available train to Pretoria. The following morning I sent a long telegram to the General Manager  of the Railway and also informed Abdulla Sheth, who immediately met  the General Manager. The Manager justified the conduct of the  railway authorities, but informed him that he had already instructed  the Station Master to see that I reached my destination safely.  Abdulla Sheth wired to the Indian merchants in Maritzburg and to  friends in other places to meet me and look after me. The merchants  came to see me at the station and tried to comfort me by narrating  their own hardships and explaining that what had happened to me was  nothing unusual. They also said that Indians traveling first or  second class had to expect trouble from railway officials and white  passengers. The day was thus spent in listening to these tales of  woe. The evening train arrived. There was a reserved berth for me. I  now purchased at Maritzburg the bedding ticket I had refused to book  at Durban. The train took me to Charlestown.
