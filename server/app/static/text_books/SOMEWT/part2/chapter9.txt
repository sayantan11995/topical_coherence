The train reached Charlestown in the morning. There was no railway, in  those days, between Charlestown and Johannesburg, but only a stage-coach, which halted at Standerton for the night  en route. I possessed a ticket for the coach, which was not cancelled by the  break of the journey at Maritzburg for a day; besides, Abdulla Sheth  had sent a wire to the coach agent at Charlestown. But the agent only needed a pretext for putting me off, and so, when  he discovered me to be a stranger, he said, 'Your ticket is  cancelled.' I gave him the proper reply. The reason at the back of  his mind was not want of accommodation, but quite another.  Passengers had to be accommodated inside the coach, but as I was  regarded as a 'coolie' and looked a stranger, it would be proper,  thought the 'leader', as the white man in charge of the coach was  called, not to seat me with the white passengers. There were seats  on either side of the coachbox. The leader sat on one of these as a  rule. Today he sat inside and gave me his seat. I knew it was sheer  injustice and an insult, but I thought it better to pocket it. I  could not have forced myself inside, and if I had raised a protest,  the coach would have gone off without me. This would have meant the  loss of another day, and Heaven only knows what would have happened  the next day. So, much as I fretted within myself, I prudently sat  next the coachman. At about three o'clock the coach reached Pardekoph. Now the leader  desired to sit where I was seated, as he wanted to smoke and  possibly to have some fresh air. So he took a piece of dirty  sack-cloth from the driver, spread it on the footboard and,  addressing me, said, 'Sami, you sit on this, I want to sit near the driver.' The insult was  more than I could bear. In fear and trembling I said to him, 'It was  you who seated me here, though I should have been accommodated  inside. I put up with the insult. Now that you want to sit outside  and smoke, you would have me sit at your feet. I will not do so, but  I am prepared to sit inside.' As I was struggling through these sentences, the man came down upon  me and began heavily to box my ears. He seized me by the arm and  tried to drag me down. I clung to the brass rails of the coachbox  and was determined to keep my hold even at the risk of breaking my  wrist bones. The passengers were witnessing the scene - the man  swearing at me, dragging and belabouring me, and I remaining still.  He was strong and I was weak. Some of the passengers were moved to  pity and exclaimed: 'Man, let him alone. Don't beat him. He is not  to blame. He is right. If he can't stay there, let him come and sit  with us.' 'No fear,' cried the man, but he seemed somewhat  crestfallen and stopped beating me. He let go my arm, swore at me a  little more, and asking the Hottentot servant who was sitting on the  other side of the coachbox to sit on the footboard, took the seat so  vacated. The passengers took their seats and, the whistle given, the coach  rattled away. My heart was beating fast within my breast, and I was  wondering whether I should ever reach my destination alive. The man  cast an angry look at me now and then and, pointing his finger at  me, growled: 'Take care, let me once get to Standerton and I shall  show you what I do.' I sat speechless and prayed to God to help me. After dark we reached Standerton and I heaved a sigh of relief on  seeing some Indian faces. As soon as I got down, these friends said:  'We are hereto receive you and take you to Isa Sheth's shop. We have  had a telegram from Dada Abdulla.' I was very glad, and we went to  Sheth Isa Haji Sumar's shop. The Sheth and his clerks gathered round  me. I told them all that I had gone through. They were very sorry to  hear it and comforted me by relating to me their own bitter  experiences. I wanted to inform the agent of the Coach Company of the whole  affair. So I wrote him a letter, narrating everything that had  happened, and drawing his attention to the threat his man had held  out. I also asked for an assurance that he would accommodate me with  the other passengers inside the coach when we started the next  morning. To which the agent replied to this effect: 'From Standerton  we have a bigger coach with different men in charge. The man  complained of will not be there tomorrow, and you will have a seat  with the other passengers.' This somewhat relieved me. I had, of  course, no intention of proceeding against the man who had assaulted  me, and so the chapter of the assault closed there. In the morning Isa Sheth's man took me to the coach, I got a good  seat and reached Johannesburg quite safely that night. Standerton is a small village and Johannesburg a big city. Abdulla  Sheth had wired to Johannesburg also, and given me the name and  address of Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin's firm there. Their man had come  to receive me at the stage, but neither did I see him nor did he  recognize me. So I decided to go to a hotel. I knew the names of  several. Taking a cab I asked to be driven to the Grand National  Hotel. I saw the Manager and asked for a room. He eyed me for a  moment, and politely saying, 'I am very sorry, we are full up,' bade  me good-bye. So I asked the cabman to drive to Muhammad Kasam  Kamruddin's shop. Here I found Abdul Gani Sheth expecting me, and he  gave me a cordial greeting. He had a hearty laugh over the story of  my experience at the hotel. 'How ever did you expect to be admitted  to a hotel?' he said. 'Why not?' I asked. 'You will come to know after you have stayed here a few days,' said  he. 'Only we can live in a land like this, because, for making  money, we do not mind pocketing insults, and here we are.' With this  he narrated to me the story of the hardships of Indians in South  Africa. Of Sheth Abdul Gani we shall know more as we proceed. He said: 'This country is not for men like you. Look now, you have  to go to Pretoria tomorrow. You will have to travel third class.  Conditions in the Transvaal are worse than in Natal. First and  second class tickets are never issued to Indians.' 'You cannot have made persistent efforts in this direction.' 'We have sent representations, but I confess our own men too do not  want as a rule to travel first or second. I sent for the railway regulations and read them. There was a  loophole. The language of the old Transvaal enactments was not very  exact or precise; that of the railway regulations was even less so. I said to the Sheth: 'I wish to go first class, and if I cannot, I  shall prefer to take a cab to Pretoria, a matter of only  thirty-seven miles.' Sheth Abdul Gani drew my attention to the extra time and money this  would mean, but agreed to my proposal to travel first, and  accordingly we sent a note to the Station Master. I mentioned in my  note that I was a barrister and that I always travelled first, I  also stated in the letter that I needed to reach Pretoria as early  as possible, that as there was no time to await his reply I would  receive it in person at the station, and that I should expect to get  a first class ticket. There was of course a purpose behind asking  for the reply in person. I thought that if the Station master gave a  written reply, he would certainly say 'no', especially because he  would have his own notion of a 'coolie' barrister. I would therefore  appear before him in faultless English dress, talk to him and  possibly persuade him to issue a first class ticket. So I went to  the station in a frock-coat and necktie, placed a sovereign for my  fare on the counter and asked for a first class ticket. 'You sent me that note?' he asked. 'That is so. I shall be much obliged if you will give me a ticket. I  must reach Pretoria today.' He smiled and, moved to pity, said: 'I am not a Transvaaler. I am a  Hollander. I appreciate your feelings, and you have my sympathy. I  do want to give you a ticket â€“ on one condition, however, that, if the  guard should ask you to shift to the third class, you will not  involve me in the affair, by which I mean that you should not  proceed against the railway company. I wish you a safe journey. I  can see you are a gentleman.' With these words he booked the ticket. I thanked him and gave him  the necessary assurance. Sheth Abdul Gani had come to see me off at the station. The incident  gave him an agreeable surprise, but he warned me saying: 'I shall be  thankful if you reach Pretoria all right. I am afraid the guard will  not leave you in peace in the first class and even if he does, the  passengers will not.' I took my seat in a first class compartment and the train started.  At Germiston the guard came to examine the tickets. He was angry to  find me there, and signaled to me with his finger to go to the  third class. I showed him my first class ticket. 'That doesn't  matter,' said he, 'remove to the third class.' There was only one English passenger in the compartment. He took the  guard to task. 'What do you mena by troubling the gentleman?' he  said. 'Don't you see he has a first class ticket? I do not  mind in the least his travelling with me.' Addressing me, he said,  'You should make yourself comfortable where you are.' The guard muttered: 'If you want to travel with a coolie, what do I  care?' and went away. At about eight o'clock in the evening the train reached Pretoria.
