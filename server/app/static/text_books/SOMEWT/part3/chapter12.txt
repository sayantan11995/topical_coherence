On my relief from war-duty I felt that my work was no longer in South  Africa but in India. Not that there was nothing to be done in South  Africa, but I was afraid that my main business might become merely  money-making.  Friends at home were also pressing me to return, and I  felt that I should be of more service in India. And for the work  in South Africa, there were, of course, Messrs Khan and Mansukhlal  Naazar. So I requested my co-workers to relieve me. After very great  difficulty my request was conditionally accepted, the condition  being that I should be ready to go back to South Africa if, within a  year, the community should need me. I thought it was a difficult  condition but the love that bound me to the community made me accept  it.
