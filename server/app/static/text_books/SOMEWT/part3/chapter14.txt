There were yet two days for the Congress session to begin. I had made up  my mind to offer my services to the Congress office in order to gain  some experience. So as soon as I had finished the daily ablutions on  arrival at Calcutta, I proceeded to the Congress office.  Babu Bhupendranath Basu and Sjt. Ghosal were the secretaries. I went  to Bhupenbabu and offered my services. He looked at me, and said: 'I  have no work, but possibly Ghosalbabu might have something to give  you. Please go to him.'  So I went to him. He scanned me and said with a smile: 'I can give  you only clerical work. Will you do it?'  'Certainly', said I. 'I am here to do anything that is not beyond  my capacity.'  'That is the right spirit, young man', he said. Addressing the  volunteers who surrounded him, he added, 'Do you hear what this  young man says?'  Then turning to me he proceeded: 'Well then, here is a heap of  letters for disposal. Take that chair and begin. As you see,  hundreds of people come to see me. What am I to do? Am I to meet  them, or am I to answer these busybodies inundating me with letters?  I have no clerks to whom I can entrust this work. Most of these  letters have nothing in them, but you will please look them through.  Acknowledge those that are worth it, and refer to me those that need  a considered reply.'  I was delighted at the confidence reposed in me.  Sjt. Ghosal did not know me when he gave me the work. Only later did  he enquire about my credentials.  I found my work very easy – the disposal of that heap of  correspondence. I had done with it in no time, and Sjt. Ghosal was  very glad. He was talkative. He would talk away for hours together.  When he learnt something from me about my history, he felt rather  sorry to have given me clerical work. But I reassured him: 'Please  don't worry. What am I before you? You have grown gray in the  service of the Congress, and are as an elder to me. I am but an  inexperienced youth. You have put me under a debt of obligation by  entrusting me with this work. For I want to do Congress work, and  you have given me the rare opportunity of understanding the  details.'  'To tell you the truth,' said Sjt. Ghosal, 'that is the proper  spirit. But young men of today do not realize it. Of course I have  known the Congress since its birth. In fact I may claim a certain  share with Mr. Hume in bringing the Congress into being.'  And thus we became good friends. He insisted on my having lunch with  him.  Sjt. Ghosal used to get his shirt buttoned by his bearer. I  volunteered to do the bearer's duty, and I loved to do it, as my  regard for elders was always great. When he came to know this, he  did not mind my doing little acts of personal service for him. In  fact he was delighted. Asking me to button his shirt, he would say,  'You see, now, the Congress secretary has no time even to button his  shirt. He has always some work to do.' Sjt. Ghosal's naiveté amused  me, but did not create any dislike in me for service of that nature.  The benefit I received from this service in incalculable.  In a few days I came to know the working of the Congress. I met most  of the leaders, I observed the movements of stalwarts like Gokhale  and Surendranath. I also noticed the huge waste of time there. I  observed too, with sorrow even then, the prominent place that the  English language occupied in our affairs. There was little regard  for economy of energy. More than one did the work of one, and many  an important thing was no one's business at all.  Critical as my mind was in observing these things, there was enough  charity in me, and so I always thought that it might, after all, be  impossible to do better in the circumstances, and that saved me from  undervaluing any work.
