From the very first day of my stay with him Gokhale made me feel  completely at home. He treated me as though I were his younger  brother; he acquainted himself with all my requirements and arranged  to see that I got all I needed. Fortunately my wants were few, and  as I had cultivated the habit of self-help, I needed very little personal  attendance. He was deeply impressed with my habit of fending for  myself, my personal cleanliness, perseverance and regularity, and  would often overwhelm me with praise.  He seemed to keep nothing private from me. He would introduce me to  all the important people that called on him. Of these the one who  stands foremost in my memory is Dr. (now Sir) P. C. Ray. He lived  practically next door and was a very frequent visitor.  This is how he introduced Dr. Ray: 'This is Professor Ray, who, having a  monthly salary of Rs. 800, keeps just Rs. 40 for himself and devotes  the balance to public purposes. He is not, and does not want to get,  married.  I see little difference between Dr. Ray as he is today and as he  used to be then. His dress used to be nearly as simple as it is,  with this difference of course, that whereas it is Khadi now, it used  to be Indian mill-cloth in those days. I felt I could never hear too  much of the talks between Gokhale and Dr. Ray, as they all pertained  to public good or were of educative value. At times they were  painful too, containing, as they did, strictures on public men. As a  result, some of those whom I had regarded as stalwart fighters began  to look quite puny.  To see Gokhale at work was as much a joy as an education. He never  wasted a minute. His private relations and friendships were all for  public good. All his talks had reference only to the good of the  country and were absolutely free from any trace of untruth or  insincerity. India's poverty and subjection were matters of constant  and intense concern to him. Various people sought to interest him in  different things. But he gave every one of them the same reply: 'You  do the thing yourself. Let me do my own work. What I want is freedom  for my country. After that is won, we can think of other things.  Today that one thing is enough to engage all my time and energy.' His reverence for Ranade could be seen every moment. Ranade's  authority was final in every matter, and he would cite it at every  step. The anniversary of Ranade's death (or birth, I forget which)  occurred during my stay with Gokhale, who observed it regularly.  There were with him then, besides myself, his friends Professor  Kathavate and a Sub-Judge. He invited us to take part in the  celebration, and in his speech he gave us his reminiscences of  Ranade. He compared incidentally Ranade, Telang and Mandlik. He  eulogized Telang's charming style and Mandlik's greatness as a  reformer. Citing an instance of Mandlik's solicitude for his  clients, he told us an anecdote as to how once, having missed his  usual train, he engaged a special train so as to be able to attend the court in the interest of his client. But Ranade,  he said, towered above them all, as a versatile genius. He was not  only a great judge, he was an equally great historian, economist  and reformer. Although he was a judge, he fearlessly attended the  Congress, and everyone had such confidence in his sagacity that they  unquestioningly accepted his decisions. Gokhale's joy knew no  bounds, as he described these qualities of head and heart which were  all combined in his master.  Gokhale used to have a horse-carriage in those days. I did not know  the circumstances that had made a horse-carriage a necessity for  him, and so I remonstrated with him: 'Can't you make use of the  tramcar in going about from place to place? Is it derogatory to a  leader's dignity?'  Slightly pained he said, 'So you also have failed to understand me!  I do not use my Council allowances for my own personal comforts. I  envy your liberty to go about in tramcars, but I am sorry I cannot  do likewise. When you are the victim of as wide a publicity as I am,  it will be difficult, if not impossible, for you to go about in a  tramcar. There is no reason to suppose that everything that the  leaders do is with a view to personal comfort. I love your simple  habits. I live as simply as I can, but some expense is almost  inevitable for a man like myself.'  He thus satisfactorily disposed of one of my complaints, but there  was another which he could not dispose of to my satisfaction. 'But you do not even go out for walks,' said I. 'Is it surprising  that you should be always ailing? Should public work leave no time  for physical exercise?'  'When do you ever find me free to go out for a walk?' he replied. I had such a great regard for Gokhale that I never strove with him.  Though this reply was far from satisfying me, I remained silent. I  believed then, and I believe even now, that, no matter what amount of  work one has, one should always find some time for exercise, just as one  does for one's meals. It is my humble opinion that, far from taking  away from one's capacity for work, it adds to it.
