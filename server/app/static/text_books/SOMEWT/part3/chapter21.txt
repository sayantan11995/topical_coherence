Gokhale was very anxious that I should settle down in Bombay, practise at  the bar and help him in public work. Public work in those days meant  Congress work, and the chief work of the institution which he had  assisted to found was carrying on the Congress administration. I liked Gokhale's advice, but I was not overconfident of success as  a barrister. The unpleasant memories of past failure were yet with  me, and I still hated as poison the use of flattery for getting  briefs. I therefore decided to start work first at Rajkot. Kevalram Mavji  Dave, my old well-wisher, who had induced me to go to England, was  there, and he started me straightaway with three briefs. Two of them  were appeals before the Judicial Assistant to the Political Agent in  Kathiawad and one was an original case in Jamnagar. This last was  rather important. On my saying that I could not trust myself to do  it justice, Kevalram Dave exclaimed: 'Winning or losing is no  concern of yours. You will simply try your best, and I am of course  there to assist you.' The counsel on the other side was the late Sjt. Samarth. I was  fairly well prepared. Not that I knew much of Indian law, but  Kevalram Dave had instructed me very thoroughly. I had heard friends  say, before I went out to South Africa, that Sir Pherozeshah Mehta  had the law of evidence at his finger-tips and that was the secret  of his success. I had borne this in mind, and during the voyage had  carefully studied the Indian Evidence Act with commentaries thereon.  There was of course also the advantage of my legal experience in  South Africa. I won the case and gained some confidence. I had no fear about the  appeals, which were successful. All this inspired a hope in me that  after all I might not fail even in Bombay. But before I set forth the circumstances in which I decided to go to  Bombay, I shall narrate my experience of the inconsiderateness and  ignorance of English officials. The Judicial Assistant's court was  peripatetic. He was constantly touring, and vakils and their clients  had to follow him wherever he moved his camp. The vakils would  charge more whenever they had to go out of headquarters, and so the  clients had naturally to incur double the expenses. The  inconvenience was no concern of the judge. The appeal of which I am talking was to be heard at Veraval where  plague was raging. I have a recollection that there were as many as  fifty cases daily in the place with a population of 5,500. It was  practically deserted, and I put up in a deserted dharmashala at  some distance from the town. But where were the clients to stay? If they  were poor, they had simply to trust themselves to God's mercy. A friend who also had cases before the court had wired that I should  put in an application for the camp to be moved to some other station  because of the plague at Veraval. On my submitting the application,  the sahib asked me. 'Are you afraid?' I answered: 'It is not a question of my being afraid. I think I can  shift for myself, but what about the clients?' 'The plague has come to stay in India,' replied the sahib. 'Why  fear it? The climate of Veraval is lovely. (The sahib lived far away from  the town in a palatial tent pitched on the seashore.) Surely people  must learn to live thus in the open.' It was no use arguing against this philosophy. The sahib told his shirastedar: 'Make a note of what Mr. Gandhi says, and let me know  if it is very inconvenient for the vakils or the clients.' The sahib of course had honestly done what he thought was the right  thing. But how could the man have an idea of the hardships of poor  India? How was he to understand the needs, habits, idiosyncrasies  and customs of the people? How was one, accustomed to measure things  in gold sovereigns, all at once to make calculations in tiny bits of  copper? As the elephant is powerless to think in the terms of the  ant, in spite of the best intentions in the world, even so is the  Englishman powerless to think in the terms of, or legislate for, the  Indian. But to resume the thread of story. In spite of my successes, I had  been thinking of staying on in Rajkot for some time longer, when one  day Kevalram Dave came to me and said: 'Gandhi, we will not suffer  you to vegetate here. You must settle in Bombay.' 'But who will find work for me there?' I asked. 'Will you find the  expenses?' 'Yes, yes, I will,' said he. 'We shall bring you down here sometimes  as a big barrister from Bombay, and drafting work we shall send you  there. It lies with us vakils to make or mar a barrister. You have  proved your worth in Jamnagar and Veraval, and I have therefore not  the least anxiety about you. You are destined to do public work, and  we will not allow you to be buried in Kathiawad. So tell me, then,  when you will go to Bombay.' 'I am expecting a remittance from Natal. As soon as I get it I will  go,' I replied. The money came in about two weeks, and I went to Bombay. I took  chambers in Payne, Gilbert and Sayani's offices, and it looked as  though I had settled down.
