Though I had hired chambers in the Fort and a house in Girgaum, God would  not let me settle down. Scarcely had I moved into my new house when  my second son Manilal, who had already been through an acute attack  of smallpox some years back, had a severe attack of typhoid,  combined with pneumonia and signs of delirium at night. The doctor was called in. He said medicine would have little effect, but eggs  and chicken broth might be given with profit.  Manilal was only ten years old. To consult his wishes was out of the  question. Being his guardian I had to decide. The doctor was a very  good Parsi. I told him that we were all vegetarians and that I could  not possibly give either of the two things to my son. Would he  therefore recommend something else?  'Your son's life is in danger,' said the good doctor. 'We could give  him milk diluted with water, but that will not give him enough  nourishment. As you know, I am called in by many Hindu families, and  they do not object to anything I prescribe. I think you will be well  advised not to be so hard on your son.'  'What you say is quite right,' said I. 'As a doctor you could not do  otherwise. But my responsibility is very great. If the boy had been  grown up, I should certainly have tried to ascertain his wishes and  respected them. But here I have to think and decide for him. To my  mind it is only on such occasions that a man's faith is truly  tested. Rightly or wrongly it is part of my religious conviction that  man may not eat meat, eggs, and the like. There should be a limit  even to the means of keeping ourselves alive. Even for itself we may not so  certain things. Religion, as I understand it, does not permit me to  use meat or eggs for me or mine even on occasions like this, and I  must therefore take the risk that you say is likely. But I beg of  you one thing. As I cannot avail myself of your treatment, I propose  to try some hydropathic remedies which I happen to know. But I shall  not know how to examine the boy's pulse, chest, lungs, etc. If you  will kindly look in from time to time to examine him and keep me  informed of his condition, I shall be grateful to you.'  The good doctor appreciated my difficulty and agreed to my request.  Though Manilal could not have made his choice, I told him what had  passed between the doctor and myself and asked him his opinion.  'Do try your hydropathic treatment,' he said. 'I will not have eggs  or chicken broth.'  This made me glad, though I realized that, if I had given him either  of these, he would have taken it.  I knew Kuhne's treatment and had tried it too. I knew as well that  fasting also could be tried with profit. So I began to give Manilal  hip baths according to Kuhne, never keeping him in the tub for more  than three minutes, and kept him on orange juice mixed with water  for three days.  But the temperature persisted, going up to 104. At night he would be  delirious. I began to get anxious. What would people say of me? What  would my elder brother think of me? Could we not call in another  doctor? Why not have an Ayurvedic physician? What right had the  parents to inflict their fads on their children?  I was haunted by thoughts like these. Then a contrary current would  start. God would surely be pleased to see that I was giving the same  treatment to my son as I would give myself. I had faith in  hydropathy, and little faith in allopathy. The doctors could not  guarantee recovery. At best they could experiment. The thread of life  was in the hands of God. Why not trust it to Him and in His name go  on with what I thought was the right treatment?  My mind was torn between these conflicting thoughts. It was night. I  was in Manilal's bed lying by his side. I decided to give him a wet  sheet pack. I got up, wetted a sheet, wrung the water out of it and  wrapped it about Manilal, keeping only his head out, and then covered  him with two blankets. To the head I applied a wet towel. The whole  body was burning like hot iron, and quite parched. There was  absolutely no perspiration.  I was sorely tired. I left Manilal in  the charge of his mother, and went out for a walk on Chaupati to  refresh myself. It was about ten o'clock. Very few pedestrians were  out. Plunged in deep thought, I scarcely looked at them. 'My honour  is in Thy keeping, oh Lord, in this hour of trial,' I repeated to  myself. Ramanama was on my lips. After a short time I returned, my  heart beating within my breast.  No sooner had I entered the room than Manilal said, 'You have  returned, Bapu?'  'Yes, darling.'  'Do please pull me out. I am burning.'  'Are you perspiring, my boy?'  'I am simply soaked. Do please take me out.'  I felt his forehead. It was covered with beads of perspiration. The  temperature was going down. I thanked God.  'Manilal, your fever is sure to go now. A little more perspiration  and then I will take you out.'  'Pray, no. Do deliver me from this furnace. Wrap me some other time  if you like.'  I just managed to keep him under the pack for a few minutes more by  diverting him. The perspiration streamed down his forehead. I undid  the pack and dried his body. Father and son fell asleep in the same  bed.  And each slept like a log. Next morning Manilal had much less fever.  He went on thus for forty days on diluted milk and fruit juices. I  had no fear now. It was an obstinate type of fever, but it had been  got under control.  Today Manilal is the healthiest of my boys. Who can say whether his  recovery was due to God's grace, or to hydropathy, or to careful  dietary and nursing? Let everyone decide according to his own faith.  For my part I was sure that God had saved my honour, and that belief  remains unaltered to this day.
