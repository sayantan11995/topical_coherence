I had not yet left the police station, when, after two days, I was  taken to see Mr. Escombe. Two constables were sent to protect me,  though no such precaution was then needed.  On the day of landing, as soon as the yellow flag was lowered, a  representative of The Natal Advertiser  had come to interview me. He had asked me a number of questions, and  in reply I had been able to refute everyone of the charges that had  been leveled against me. Thanks to Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, I had  delivered only written speeches in India, and I had copies of them  all, as well as of my other writings. I had given the interviewer  all this literature and showed him that in India I had said nothing  which I had not already said in South Africa in stronger language. I  had also shown him that I had had no hand in bringing the passengers  of the Courland and Naderi to South Africa.  Many of them were old residents, and most of them,  far from wanting to stay in Natal, meant to go to the Transvaal. In  those days the Transvaal offered better prospects than Natal to  those coming in search of wealth, and most Indians, therefore,  preferred to go there.  This interview and my refusal to prosecute  the assailants produced such a profound impression that the  Europeans of Durban were ashamed of their conduct. The press  declared me to be innocent and condemned the mob. Thus the lynching  ultimately proved to be a blessing for me, that is, for the cause.  It enhanced the prestige of the Indian community in South Africa and  made my work easier.  In three or four days I went to my house, and  it was not long before I settled down again. The incident added also  to my professional practice.  But if it enhanced the prestige of the community, it also fanned the flame of prejudice against it. As soon  as it was proved that the Indian could put up a manly fight, he came  to be regarded as a danger. Two bills were introduced in the Natal  Legislative Assembly, one of them calculated to affect the Indian  trader adversely, and the other to impose a stringent restriction on  Indian immigration. Fortunately the fight for the franchise had  resulted in a decision to the effect that no enactment might be  passed against the Indians as such, that is say, that the law should  make no distinctions of colour or race. The language of the bills  above mentioned made them applicable to all, but their object  undoubtedly was to impose further restrictions on the Indian  residents of Natal.  The bills considerably increased my public work and made the community more alive then ever to their sense of duty.  They were translated into Indian languages and fully explained, so  as to bring home to the community their subtle implications. We  appealed to the Colonial Secretary, but he refused to interfere and  the bills became law.  Public work now began to absorb most of my time. Sjt. Mansukhlal Naazar, who, as I have said, was already in  Durban, came to stay with me, and as he gave his time to public  work, he lightened my burden to some extent.  Sheth Adamji Miyakhan had, in my absence, discharged his duty with great credit. He had  increased the membership and added about £1,000 to the coffers of  the Natal Indian Congress. The awakening caused by the bills and the  demonstration against the passengers I turned to good account by  making an appeal for membership and funds, which now amounted to  £5,000. My desire was to secure for the Congress a permanent fund,  so that it might procure property of its own and then carry on its  work out of the rent of the property. This was my first experience  of managing a public institution. I placed my proposal before my co-workers,  and they welcomed it. The property that was purchased was  leased out, and the rent was enough to meet the current expenses of  the Congress. The property was vested in a strong body of trustees  and is still there today, but it has become the source of much  internecine quarrelling with the result that the rent of the  property now accumulates in the court.  This sad situation developed after my departure from South Africa, but my idea of having  permanent funds for public institutions underwent a change long  before this difference arose. And now after considerable experience  with the many public institutions which I have managed, it has  become my firm conviction that it is not good to run public  institutions on permanent funds. A permanent fund carries in itself  the seed of the moral fall of the institution. A public institution  means an institution conducted with the approval, and from the  funds, of the public. When such an institution ceases to have public  support, it forfeits its right to exist. Institutions maintained on  permanent funds are often found to ignore public opinion, and are  frequently responsible for acts contrary to it. In our country we  experience this at every step. Some of the so-called religious  trusts have ceased to render any accounts. The trustees have become  the owners and are responsible to none. I have no doubt that the  ideal is for public institutions to live, like nature, from day to  day. The institution that fails to win public support has no right  to exist as such. The subscriptions that an institution annually  receives are a test of its popularity and the honesty of its  management; and I am of opinion that every institution should submit  to that test. But let no one misunderstand me. My remarks do not  apply to the bodies which cannot, by their very nature, be conducted  without permanent buildings. What I mean to say is that the current  expenditure should be found from subscriptions voluntarily received  from year to year.  These views were confirmed during the days of the Satyagraha  in South Africa. That magnificent campaign extending over  six years was carried on without permanent funds, though lakhs of  rupees were necessary for it. I can recollect times when I did not  know what would happen the next day if no subscriptions came in. But  I shall not anticipate future events. The reader will find the  opinion expressed above amply borne out in the coming narrative.
