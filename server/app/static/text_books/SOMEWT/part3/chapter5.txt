When I landed at Durban in January 1897, I had three children with me, my  sister's son ten years old, and my own sons nine and five years of  age. Where was I to educate them ?  I could have sent them to the  schools for European children, but only as a matter of favour and  exception. No other Indian children were allowed to attend them. For  these there were schools established by Christian missions, but I  was not prepared to send my children there, as I did not like the  education imparted in those schools. For one thing, the medium of  instruction would be only English, or perhaps incorrect Tamil or  Hindi; this too could only have been arranged with difficulty. I  could not possibly put up with this and other disadvantages. In the  meantime I was making my own attempt to teach them. But that was at  best irregular, and I could not get hold of a suitable Gujarati  teacher.  I was at my wits' end. I advertised for an English teacher who  should teach the children under my direction. Some regular  instruction was to be given them by this teacher, and for the rest  they should be satisfied with what little I could give them  irregularly. So I engaged an English governess at £7 pounds a month.  This went on for some time, but not to my satisfaction. The boys  acquired some knowledge of Gujarati through my conversation and  intercourse with them, which was strictly in the mother-tongue. I  was loath to send them back to India, for I believed even then that  young children should not be separated from their parents. The  education that children naturally imbibe in a well-ordered household  is impossible to obtain in hostels. I therefore kept my children  with me. I did send my nephew and elder son to be educated at  residential schools in India for a few months, but I soon had to  recall them. Later, the eldest son, long after he had come of age,  broke away from me, and went to India to join a high school in Ahmedabad. I have an impression that the nephew was satisfied with  what I could give him. Unfortunately he died in the prime of youth  after a brief illness. The other three of my sons have never been at  a public school, though they did get some regular schooling in an  improvised school which I started for the children of Satyagrahi  parents in South Africa.  These experiments were all inadequate. I could not devote to the  children all the time I had wanted to give them. My inability to  give them enough attention and other unavoidable causes prevented me  from providing them with the literary education I had desired, and  all my sons have had complaints to make against me in this matter.  Whenever they come across an M.A. or a B.A., or even a matriculate,  they seem to feel the handicap of a want of school education. Nevertheless I am of opinion that, if I had insisted on their being  educated somehow at public schools, they would have been deprived of  the training that can be had only at the school of experience, or  from constant contact with the parents. I should never have been  free, as I am today, from anxiety on their score, and the artificial  education that they could have had in England or South Africa, torn  from me, would never have taught them the simplicity and the spirit  of service that they show in their lives today, while their  artificial ways of living might have been a serious handicap in my  public work. Therefore, though I have not been able to give them a  literary education either to their or to my satisfaction, I am not  quite sure, as I look back on my past years, that I have not done my  duty by them to the best of my capacity. Nor do I regret not having  sent them to public schools. I have always felt that the undesirable  traits I see today in my eldest son are an echo of my own  undisciplined and unformulated early life. I regard that time as a  period of half-baked knowledge and indulgence. It coincided with the  most impressionable years of my eldest son, and naturally he has  refused to regard it as my time of indulgence and inexperience. He  has on the contrary believed that that was the brightest period of  my life, and the changes, effected later, have been due to delusion  miscalled enlightenment. And well he might. Why should he not think  that my earlier years represented a period of awakening, and the  later years of radical change, years of delusion and egotism ? Often  have I been confronted with various posers from friends: What harm  had there been, if I had given my boys an academical education?  What right had I thus to clip their wings? Why should I have come  in the way of their taking degrees and choosing their own careers?  I do not think that there is much point in these questions. I have  come in contact with numerous students. I have tried myself or  through others to impose my educational 'fads' on other children too  and have seen the results thereof. There are within my knowledge a  number of young men today contemporaneous with my sons. I do not  think that man to man they are any better that my sons, or that my  sons have much to learn from them.  But the ultimate result of my experiments is in the womb of the  future. My object in discussing this subject here is that a student  of the history of civilization may have some measure of the  difference between disciplined home education and school education,  and so of the effect produced on children through changes introduced  by parents in their lives. The purpose of this chapter is also to  show the lengths to which a votary of truth is driven by his  experiments with truth as also to show the votary of liberty how  many are the sacrifices demanded by that stern goddess. Had I been  without a sense of self-respect and satisfied myself with having  for my children the education that other children could not get, I  should have deprived them of the object-lesson in liberty and  self-respect that I gave them at the cost of the literary training.  And where a choice has to be made between liberty and learning, who  will not say that the former has to be preferred a thousand times to  the latter?  The youths whom I called out in 1920 from those citadels of  slavery – their schools and colleges – and whom I advised that it was far  better to remain unlettered and break stones for the sake of liberty  than to go in for a literary education in the chains of slaves will  probably be able now to trace my advice to its source.
