We now reach the stage in this story when I began seriously to think of  taking the brahmacharya vow. I had been wedded to a monogamous ideal ever since my marriage,  faithfulness to my wife being part of the love of truth. But it was  in South Africa that I came to realize the importance of observing brahmacharya even with respect to my wife. I cannot definitely say what  circumstance or what book it was, that set my thoughts in that  direction, but I have a recollection that the predominant factor was  the influence of Raychandbhai, of whom I have already written, I can  still recall a conversation that I had with him. On one occasion I  spoke to him in high praise of Mrs. Gladstone's devotion to her  husband. I had read some where that Mrs. Gladstone insisted on  preparing tea for Mr. Gladstone even in the House of Commons, and  that this had become a rule in the life of this illustrious couple,  whose actions were governed by regularity. I spoke of this to the  poet, and incidentally eulogized conjugal love. 'Which of the two do  you prize more,' asked Raychandbhai, 'the love of Mrs. Gladstone for  her husband as his wife, or her devoted service irrespective of her  relation to Mr. Gladstone? Supposing she had been his sister, or his  devoted servant, and ministered to him with the same attention, what  would you have said? Do we not have instances of such devoted  sisters or servants? Supposing you had found the same loving  devotion in a male servant, would you have been pleased in the same  way as in Mrs. Gladstone's case? Just examine the view-point  suggested by me.'  Raychandbhai was himself married. I have an impression that at the  moment his words sounded harsh, but they gripped me irresistibly.  The devotion of a servant was, I felt, a thousand times more  praiseworthy than that of a wife to her husband. There was nothing  surprising in the wife's devotion to her husband, as there was an  indissoluble bond between them. The devotion was perfectly natural.  But it required a special effort to cultivate equal devotion  between master and servant. The poet's point of view began gradually  to grow upon me.  What then, I asked myself, should be my relation  with my wife? Did my faithfulness consist in making my wife the  instrument of my lust? So long as I was the slave of lust, my  faithfulness was worth nothing. To be fair to my wife, I must say  that she was never the temptress. It was therefore the easiest thing  for me to take the vow of brahmacharya, if only I willed it. It was my weak will or lustful attachment  that was the obstacle.  Even after my conscience had been roused in  the matter, I failed twice. I failed because the motive that  actuated the effort was none the highest. My main object was to  escape having more children. Whilst in England I had read something  about contraceptives. I have already referred to Dr. Allinson's  birth control propaganda in the chapter on Vegetarianism. If it had  some temporary effect on me, Mr. Hill's opposition to those methods  and his advocacy of internal efforts as opposed to outward means, in  a word, of self-control, had a far greater effect, which in due time  came to be abiding. Seeing, therefore, that I did not desire more  children I began to strive after self-control. There was endless  difficulty in the task. We began to sleep in separate beds. I  decided to retire to bed only after the day's work had left me  completely exhausted. All these efforts did not seem to bear much  fruit, but when I look back upon the past, I feel that the final  resolution was the cumulative effect of those unsuccessful  strivings.  The final resolution could only be made as late as 1906. Satyagraha  had not then been started. I had not the least notion of its coming.  I was practising in Johannesburg at the time of the Zulu 'Rebellion'  in Natal, which came soon after the Boer War. I felt that I must  offer my services to the Natal Government on that occasion. The  offer was accepted, as we shall see in another chapter. But the work  set me furiously thinking in the direction of self-control, and  according to my wont I discussed my thoughts with my co-workers. It  became my conviction that procreation and the consequent care of  children were inconsistent with public service. I had to break up  my household at Johannesburg to be able to serve during the  'Rebellion'. Within one month of offering my services, I had to give  up the house I had so carefully furnished. I took my wife and  children to Phoenix and led the Indian ambulance corps attached to  the Natal forces. During the difficult marches that had then to be  performed, the idea flashed upon me that, if I wanted to devote  myself to the service of the community in this manner I must  relinquish the desire for children and wealth and live the life of a vanaprastha - of one retired from household cares.  The 'Rebellion' did not occupy  me for more than six weeks, but this brief period proved to be a  very important epoch in my life. The importance of vows grew upon me  more clearly than ever before. I realized that a vow, far from  closing the door to real freedom, opened it. Up to this time I had  not met with success because the will had been lacking, because I  had had no faith in myself, no faith in the grace of God, and  therefore my mind had been tossed on the boisterous sea of doubt. I  realized that in refusing to take a vow man was drawn into  temptation, and that to be bound by a vow was like a passage from  libertinism to a real monogamous marriage. 'I believe in effort, I  do not want to bind myself with vows' is the mentality of weakness  and betrays a subtle desire for the thing to be avoided. Or where  can be the difficulty in making a final decision? I vow to flee  from the serpent which I know will bite me, I do not simply make an  effort to flee from him. I know that mere effort may mean certain  death. Mere effort means ignorance of the certain fact that the  serpent is bound to kill me. The fact, therefore, that I could rest  content with an effort only means that I have not yet clearly  realized the necessity of definite action. 'But supposing my views  are changed in the future, how can I bind myself by a vow?' Such a  doubt often deters us. But that doubt also betrays a lack of clear  perception that a particular thing must be renounced. That is why Nishkulanand has sung:  'Renunciaton without aversion is not lasting.'  Where therefore the desire is gone, a vow of renunciation is the  natural and inevitable fruit.
