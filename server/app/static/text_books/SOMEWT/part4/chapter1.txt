Mr. Chamberlain had come to get a gift of 35 million pounds from South  Africa, and to win the hearts of Englishmen and Boers. So he gave a  cold shoulder to the Indian deputation.  'You know,' he said 'that the Imperial Government has little control  over self-governing Colonies. Your grievances seem to be genuine. I  shall do what I can, but you must try your best to placate the  Europeans, if you wish to live in their midst.'  The reply cast a chill over the members of the deputation. I was  also disappointed. It was an eye-opener for us all, and I saw that  we should start with our work de novo.  I explained the situation to my colleagues.  As a matter of fact there was nothing wrong about Mr. Chamberlain's  reply. It was well that he did not mince matters. He had brought  home to us in a rather gentle way the rule of might being right or  the law of the sword.  But sword we had none. We scarcely had the nerve and the muscle even  to receive sword-cuts.  Mr. Chamberlain had given only a short time to the sub-continent. If  Shrinagar to Cape Comorin is 1,900 miles, Durban to Capetown is not  less than 1,100 miles, and Mr. Chamberlain had to cover the long  distance at hurricane speed.  From Natal he hastened to the Transvaal. I had to prepare the case  for the Indians there as well and submit it to him. But how was I  to get to Pretoria? Our people there were not in a position to procure  the necessary legal facilities for my getting to them in time. The  War had reduced the Transvaal to a howling wilderness. There were  neither provisions nor clothing available. Empty or closed shops  were there, waiting to be replenished or opened, but that was a  matter of time. Even refugees could not be allowed to return until  the shops were ready with provisions. Every Transvaaller had  therefore to obtain a permit. The European had no difficulty in  getting one, but the Indian found it very hard.  During the War many officers and soldiers had come to South Africa  from India and Ceylon, and it was considered to be the duty of the  British authorities to provide for such of them as decided to settle  there. They had in any event to appoint new officers, and these  experienced men came in quite handy. The quick ingenuity of some of  them created a new department. It showed their resourcefulness.  There was a special department for the negroes. Why then should  there not be one for the Asiatics? The argument seemed to be quite  plausible. When I reached the Transvaal, this new department had  already been opened and was gradually spreading its tentacles. The  officers who issued permits to the returning refugees might issue  them to all, but how could they do so in respect of the Asiatics  without the intervention of the new department? And if the permits  were to be issued on the recommendation of the new department, some  of the responsibility and burden of the permit officers could thus  be lessened. This was how they had argued. The fact, however, was  that the new department wanted some apology for work, and the men  wanted money. If there had been no work, the department would have  been unnecessary and would have been discontinued. So they found  this work for themselves.  The Indians had to apply to this department. A reply would be  vouchsafed many days after. And as there were large numbers wishing  to return to the Transvaal, there grew up an army of intermediaries  or touts, who with the officers, looted the poor Indians to the tune  of thousands. I was told that no permit could be had without  influence, and that in some cases one had to pay up to a hundred pounds  in spite of the influence which one might bring to  bear. Thus there seemed to me no way open to me. I went to my old friend,  the Police Superintendent of Durban, and said to him: 'Please  introduce me to the Permit Officer and help me to obtain a permit.  You know that I have been a resident of the Transvaal.' He  immediately put on his hat, came out and secured me a permit. There  was hardly an hour left before my train was to start. I had kept my  luggage ready. I thanked Superintendent Alexander and started for  Pretoria.  I now had a fair idea of the difficulties ahead. On reaching  Pretoria I drafted the memorial. In Durban I do not recollect the  Indians having been asked to submit in advance the names of their  representatives, but here there was the new department and it asked  to do so. The Pretoria Indians had already come to know that the  officers wanted to exclude me.  But another chapter is necessary for this painful though amusing  incident.
