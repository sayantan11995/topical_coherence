This chapter has brought me to a stage where it becomes necessary for me  to explain to the reader how this story is written from week to  week.  When I began writing it, I had no definite plan before me. I have no  diary or documents on which to base the story of my experiments. I  write just as the Spirit moves me at the time of writing. I do not  claim to know definitely that all conscious thought and action on my  part is directed by the Spirit. But on an examination of the  greatest steps that I have taken in my life, as also of those that  may be regarded as the least, I think it will not be improper to say  that all of them were directed by the Spirit.  I have not seen Him, neither have I known Him. I have made the  world's faith in God my own, and as my faith is ineffaceable, I  regard that faith as amounting to experience. However, as it may be  said that to describe faith as experience is to tamper with truth,  it may perhaps be more correct to say that I have no word for  characterizing my belief in God.  It is perhaps now somewhat easy to understand why I believe that I am writing this story as the Spirit  prompts me. When I began the last chapter I gave it the heading I  have given to this, but as I was writing it, I realized that before  I narrated my experiences with Europeans, I must write something by  way of a preface. This I did and altered the heading. Now again, as I start on this chapter, I find myself confronted with  a fresh problem. What things to mention and what to omit regarding  the English friends of whom I am about to write is a serious  problem. If things that are relevant are omitted, truth will be  dimmed. And it is difficult to decide straightway what is relevant,  when I am not even sure about the relevancy of writing this story. I understand more clearly today what I read long ago about the  inadequacy of all autobiography as history. I know that I do not set  down in this story all that I remember. Who can say how much I must  give and how much omit in the interests of truth? And what would be  the value in a court of law of the inadequate ex parte  evidence being tendered by me of certain events in my life? If some busybody were to cross-examine me on the chapters already written,  he could probably shed much more light on them, and if it were a  hostile critic's cross-examination, he might even flatter himself  for having shown up 'the hollowness of many of my pretensions.' I, therefore, wonder for a moment whether it might not be proper to  stop writing these chapters. But so long as there is no prohibition  from the voice within, I must continue the writing. I must follow  the sage maxim that nothing once begun should be abandoned unless it  is proved to be morally wrong.  I am not writing the autobiography to please critics. Writing it is  itself one of the experiments with truth. One of its objects is  certainly to provide some comfort and food for reflection for my co-  workers. Indeed I started writing it in compliance with their  wishes. It might not have been written, if Jeramdas and Swami Anand  had not persisted in their suggestion. If, therefore, I am wrong in  writing the autobiography, they must share the blame.  But to take up the subject indicated in the heading. Just as I had  Indians living with me as members of my family, so had I English  friends living with me in Durban. Not that all who lived with me  liked it. But I persisted in having them. Nor was I wise in every  case. I had some bitter experiences, but these included both Indians  and Europeans. And I do not regret the experiences. In spite of  them, and in spite of the inconvenience and worry that I have often  caused to friends, I have not altered my conduct and friends have  kindly borne with me. Whenever my contacts with strangers have been  painful to friends, I have not hesitated to blame them. I hold that  believers who have to see the same God in others that they see in  themselves, must be able to live amongst all with sufficient  detachment. And the ability to live thus can be cultivated, not by  fighting shy of unsought opportunities for such contacts, but by  hailing them in a spirit of service and withal keeping oneself  unaffected by them.  Though, therefore, my house was full when the Boer War broke out, I  received two Englishmen who had come from Johannesburg. Both were  theosophists, one of them being Mr. Kitchin, of whom we shall have  occasion to know more later. These friends often cost my wife bitter  tears. Unfortunately she has had many such trials on my account.  This was the first time that I had English friends to live with me  as intimately as members of my family. I had stayed in English  houses during my days in England, but there I conformed to their  ways of living, and it was more or less like living in a boarding  house. Here it was quite the contrary. The English friends became  members of the family. They adopted the Indian style in many  matters. Though the appointments in the house were in the Western  fashion, the internal life was mostly Indian. I do remember having  had some difficulty in keeping them as members of the family, but I  can certainly say that they had no difficulty in making themselves  perfectly at home under my roof. In Johannesburg these contacts  developed further than in Durban.
