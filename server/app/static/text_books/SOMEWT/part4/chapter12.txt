In Johannesburg I had at one time as many as four Indian clerks, who  were perhaps more like my sons than clerks. But even these were not  enough for my work. It was impossible to do without typewriting,  which, among us, if at all, only I knew. I taught it to two of the  clerks, but they never came up to the mark because of their poor  English. And then one of these I wanted to train as an accountant. I  could not get anyone from Natal, for nobody could enter the  Transvaal without a permit, and for my own personal convenience I  was not prepared to ask a favour of the Permit Officer. I was at my wits' end. Arrears were fast mounting up, so much so  that it seemed impossible for me, however much I might try, to cope  with professional and public work. I was quite willing to engage a  European clerk, but I was not sure to get a white man or woman to  serve a coloured man like myself. However I decided to try. I  approached a typewriting agent whom I knew, and asked him to get me  a stenographer. There were girls available, and he promised to try  to secure the services of one. He came across a Scots girl called  Miss Dick, who had just come fresh from Scotland. She had no  objection to earning an honest livelihood, wherever available, and  she was in need. So the agent sent her on to me. She immediately  prepossessed me.  'Don't you mind serving under an Indian?' I asked her.  'Not at all,' was her firm reply.  'What salary do you expect?'  'Would £ 17 10s be too much?'  'Not too much if you will give me the work I want from you. When can  you join?'  'This moment, if you wish.'  I was very pleased and straightaway started dictating letters to  her.  Before very long she became more a daughter or a sister to me than a  mere stenotypist. I had scarcely any reason to find fault with her  work. She was often entrusted with the management of funds amounting  to thousands of pounds, and she was in charge of account books. She  won my complete confidence, but what was perhaps more, she confided  to me her innermost thoughts and feelings. She sought my advice in  the final choice of her husband, and I had the privilege to give her  away in marriage. As soon as Miss Dick became Mrs. Macdonald, she  had to leave me, but even after her marriage she did not fail to  respond, whenever under pressure I made a call upon her. But a permanent stenotypist was now needed in her place, and I was  fortunate in getting another girl. She was Miss Schlesin, introduced  to me by Mr. Kallenbach, whom the reader will know in due course.  She is at present a teacher in one of the High Schools in the  Transvaal. She was about seventeen when she came to me. Some of her  idiosyncrasies were at times too much for Mr. Kallenbach and me. She  had come less to work as a stenotypist than to gain experience.  Colour prejudice was foreign to her temperament. She seemed to mind  neither age nor experience. She would not hesitate even to the point  of insulting a man and telling him to his face what she thought of  him. Her impetuosity often landed me in difficulties, but her open  and guileless temperament removed them as soon as they were created.  I have often signed without revision letters typed by her, as I  considered her English to be better than mine, and had the fullest  confidence in her loyalty.  Her sacrifice was great. For a considerable period she did not draw  more than £6, and refused ever to receive more than £10 a month.  When I urged her to take more, she would give me a scolding and say,  'I am not here to draw a salary from you. I am here because I like to  work with you and I like your ideals.'  She had once an occasion to take £40 from me, but she insisted on  having it as a loan, and repaid the full amount last year. Her  courage was equal to her sacrifice. She is one of the few women I  have been privileged to come across, with a character as clear as  crystal and courage that would shame a warrior. She is a grown up  woman now. I do not know her mind quite as well as when she was with  me, but my contact with this young lady will ever be for me a sacred  recollection. I would therefore be false to truth if I kept back  what I know about her.  She knew neither night nor day in toiling for the cause. She  ventured out on errands in the darkness of the night all by herself,  and angrily scouted any suggestion of an escort. Thousands of  stalwart Indians looked up to her for guidance. When during the  Satyagraha days almost every one of the leaders was in jail, she led  the movement single-handed. She had the management of thousands, a  tremendous amount of correspondence, and Indian Opinion  in her hands, but she never wearied.  I could go on without end writing thus about Miss Schlesin, but I  shall conclude this chapter with citing Gokhale's estimate of her.  Gokhale knew every one of my co-workers. He was pleased with many of  them, and would often give his opinion of them. He gave the first  place to Miss Schlesin amongst all the Indian and European  co-workers. 'I have rarely met with the sacrifice, the purity and  the fearlessness I have seen in Miss Schlesin,' said he. 'Amongst  your co-workers, she takes the first place in my estimation.'
