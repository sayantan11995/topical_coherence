Before I proceed with the other intimate European contacts, I must note two  or three items of importance. One of the contacts, however, should  be mentioned at once. The appointment of Miss Dick was not enough  for my purpose. I needed more assistance. I have in the earlier  chapters referred to Mr. Ritch. I knew him very well. He was manager in a  commercial firm. He approved my suggestion of leaving the firm and  getting articled under me, and he considerably lightened my burden. About this time Sjt. Madanjit approached me with a proposal to start Indian Opinion and sought my advice. He had already been conducting a press, and I  approved of his proposal. The journal was launched in 1904, and Sjt.  Mansukhlal Nazar became the first editor. But I had to bear the  brunt of the work, having for most of the time to be practically in  charge of the journal. Not that Sjt. Mansukhlal could not carry it  on. He had been doing a fair amount of journalism whilst in India,  but he would never venture to write on intricate South African  problems so long as I was there. He had the greatest confidence in  my discernment, and therefore threw on me the responsibility of  attending to the editorial columns. The journal has been until this  day a weekly. In the beginning it used to be issued in Gujarati,  Hindi, Tamil and English. I saw, however, that the Tamil and Hindi  sections were a make-believe. They did not serve the purpose for  which they were intended, so I discontinued them as I even felt that  there would be a certain amount of deception involved in their  continuance.  I had no notion that I should have to invest any money in this  journal, but I soon discovered that it could not go on without my  financial help. The Indians and the Europeans both knew that, though  I was not avowedly the editor of Indian Opinion,  I was virtually responsible for its conduct. It would not have  mattered if the journal had never been started, but to stop it after  it had once been launched would have been both a loss and a  disgrace. So I kept on pouring out my money, until ultimately I was  practically sinking all my savings in it. I remember a time when I  had to remit Â£75 each month.  But after all these years I feel that the journal has served the  community well. It was never intended to be a commercial concern. So  long as it was under my control, the changes in the journal were  indicative of changes in my life.  Indian Opinion in those days, like Young India  and Navajivan today, was a mirror of part of my life. Week after week I poured out  my soul in its columns, and expounded the principles and practice of  Satyagraha as I understood it. During ten years, that is, until  1914, excepting the intervals of my enforced rest in prison, there  was hardly an issue of Indian Opinion  without an article from me. I cannot recall a word in those articles  set down without thought or deliberation, or a word of conscious  exaggeration, or anything merely to please. Indeed the journal  became for me a training in self-restraint, and for friends a medium  through which to keep in touch with my thoughts. The critic found  very little to which he could object. In fact the tone of  Indian Opinion compelled the critic to put a curb on his own pen. Satyagraha would  probably have been impossible without Indian Opinion.  The readers looked forward to it for a trustworthy account of the  Satyagraha campaign as also of the real condition of Indians in  South Africa. For me it became a means for the study of human nature  in all its casts and shades, as I always aimed at establishing an  intimate and clean bond between the editor and the readers. I was  inundated with letters containing the outpourings of my  correspondents' hearts. They were friendly, critical or bitter,  according to the temper of the writer. It was a fine education for me  to study, digest and answer all this correspondence. It was as  though the community thought audibly through this correspondence  with me. It made me thoroughly understand the responsibility of a  journalist, and the hold I secured in this way over the community  made the future campaign workable, dignified and irresistible. In the very first month of Indian Opinion,  I realized that the sole aim of journalism should be service. The  newspaper press is a great power, but just as an unchained torrent  of water submerges whole countrysides and devastates crops, even so  an uncontrolled pen serves but to destroy. If the control is from  without, it proves more poisonous than want of control. It can be  profitable only when exercised from within. If this line of  reasoning is correct, how many of the journals in the world would  stand the test? But who would stop those that are useless? And who  should be the judge? The useful and the useless must, like good and  evil generally, go on together, and man must make his choice.
