Indians were not removed from the location as soon as the  Municipality secured its ownership. It was necessary to find the  residents suitable new quarters before dislodging them, but as the  Municipality could not easily do this, the Indians were suffered to  stay in the same 'dirty' location, with this difference, that their  condition became worse than before. Having ceased to be proprietors  they became tenants of the Municipality, with the result that their  surroundings became more insanitary than ever. When they were  proprietors, they had to maintain some sort of cleanliness, if only  for fear of the law. The Municipality had no such fear! The number  of tenants increased, and with them the squalor and the disorder. While the Indians were fretting over this state of things, there was  a sudden outbreak of the black plague, also called the pneumonic  plague, more terrible and fatal than the bubonic.  Fortunately it was not the location but one of the gold mines in the  vicinity of Johannesburg that was responsible for the outbreak. The  workers in this mine were for the most part negroes, for whose  cleanliness their white employers were solely responsible. There  were a few Indians also working in connection with the mine,  twenty-three of whom suddenly caught the infection, and returned one  evening to their quarters in the location with an acute attack of  the plague. Sjt. Madanjit, who was then canvassing subscribers for Indian Opinion and realizing subscriptions, happened to be in the location at this  moment. He was a remarkably fearless man. His heart wept to see  these victims of the scourge, and he sent a pencil-note to me to  the following effect: 'There has been a sudden outbreak of the black  plague. You must come immediately and take prompt measures,  otherwise we must be prepared for dire consequences. Please come  immediately.' Sjt. Madanjit bravely broke open the lock of a vacant  house, and put all the patients there. I cycled to the location, and  wrote to the Town Clerk to inform him of the circumstances in which  we had taken possession of the house. Dr. William Godfrey, who was practising in Johannesburg, ran to the  rescue as soon as he got the news, and became both nurse and doctor  to the patients. But twenty-three patients were more than three of  us could cope with. It is my faith, based on experience, that if one's heart is pure,  calamity brings in its train men and measures to fight it. I had at  that time four Indians in my office – Sjts. Kalyandas, Maneklal,  Gunvantrai Desai and another whose name I cannot recollect.  Kalyandas had been entrusted to me by his father. In South Africa I  have rarely come across anyone more obliging and willing to render  implicit obedience than Kalyandas. Fortunately he was unmarried  then, and I did not hesitate to impose on him duties involving  risks, however great. Maneklal I had secured in Johannesburg. He too,  so far as I can remember, was unmarried. So I decided to sacrifice  all four – call them clerks, co-workers or sons. There was no need  at all to consult Kalyandas. The others expressed their readiness as  soon as they were asked. 'Where you are, we will also be,' was their  short and sweet reply. Mr. Ritch had a large family. He was ready to take the plunge, but I  prevented him. I had not the heart to expose him to the risk. So he  attended to the work outside the danger zone. It was a terrible night  – that night of vigil and nursing. I had  nursed a number of patients before, but never any attacked by the  black plague. Dr. Godfrey's pluck proved infectious. There was not  much nursing required. To give them their doses of medicine, to  attend to their wants, to keep them and their beds clean and tidy,  and to cheer them up was all that we had to do. The indefatigable zeal and fearlessness with which the youths worked  rejoiced me beyond measure. One could understand the bravery of Dr.  Godfrey and of an experienced man like Sjt. Madanjit. But the spirit  of these callow youths! So far as I can recollect, we pulled all the patients through that  night. But the whole incident, apart from its pathos, is of such absorbing  interest and, for me, of such religious value, that I must devote to  it at least two more chapters.
