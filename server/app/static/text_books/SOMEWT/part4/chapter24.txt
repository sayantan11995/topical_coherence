Even after I thought I had settled down in Johannesburg, there was to be  no settled life for me. Just when I felt that I should be breathing  in peace, an unexpected event happened. The papers brought the news  of the out break of the Zulu 'rebellion' in Natal. I bore no grudge  against the Zulus, they had harmed no Indian. I had doubts about the  'rebellion' itself. But I then believed that the British Empire  existed for the welfare of the world. A genuine sense of loyalty  prevented me from even wishing ill to the Empire. The rightness or  otherwise of the 'rebellion' was therefore not likely to affect my  decision. Natal had a Volunteer Defence Force, and it was open to it  to recruit more men. I read that this force had already been  mobilized to quell the 'rebellion'.  I considered myself a citizen of Natal, being intimately connected  with it. So I wrote to the Governor, expressing my readiness, if  necessary, to form an Indian Ambulance Corps. He replied immediately  accepting the offer.  I had not expected such prompt acceptance. Fortunately I had made  all the necessary arrangements even before writing the letter. If my  offer was accepted, I had decided to break up the Johannesburg home.  Polak was to have a smaller house, and my wife was to go and settle  at Phoenix. I had her full consent to this decision. I do not  remember her having ever stood in my way in matters like this. As  soon, therefore, as I got the reply from the Governor, I gave the  landlord the usual month's notice of vacating the house, sent some  of the things to Phoenix and left some with Polak.  I went to Durban and appealed for men. A big contingent was not  necessary. We were a party of twenty-four, of whom, besides me, four  were Gujaratis. The rest were ex-indentured men from South India,  excepting one who was a free Pathan.  In order to give me a status and to facilitate work, as also in  accordance with the existing convention, the Chief Medical Officer  appointed me to the temporary rank of Sergeant Major and three men  selected by me to the rank of sergeants and one to that of corporal.  We also received our uniforms from the Government. Our Corps was on  active service for nearly six weeks. On reaching the scene of the  'rebellion', I saw that there was nothing there to justify the name  of 'rebellion'. There was no resistance that one could see. The  reason why the disturbance had been magnified into a rebellion was  that a Zulu chief had advised non-payment of a new tax imposed on  his people, and had assagaied a sergeant who had gone to collect the  tax. At any rate my heart was with the Zulus, and I was delighted,  on reaching headquarters, to hear that our main work was to be the  nursing of the wounded Zulus. The Medical Officer in charge welcomed  us. He said the white people were not willing nurses for the wounded  Zulus, that their wounds were festering, and that he was at his  wits' end. He hailed our arrival as a godsend for those innocent  people, and he equipped us with bandages, disinfectants, etc., and  took us to the improvised hospital. The Zulus were delighted to see  us. The white soldiers used to peep through the railings that  separated us from them and tried to dissuade us from attending to  the wounds. And as we would not heed them, they became enraged and  poured unspeakable abuse on the Zulus.  Gradually I came into closer touch with these soldiers, and they  ceased to interfere. Among the commanding officers were Colonel Sparks  and Colonel Wylie, who had bitterly opposed me in 1896. They were  surprised at my attitude and specially called and thanked me. They  introduced me to General Mackenzie. Let not the reader think that  these were professional soldiers. Colonel Wylie was a well-known Durban  lawyer. Colonel Sparks was well-known as the owner of a butcher's shop  in Durban. General Mackenzie was a noted Natal farmer. All these  gentlemen were volunteers, and as such had received military  training and experience.  The wounded in our charge were not wounded in battle. A section of  them had been taken prisoners as suspects. The General had sentenced  them to be flogged. The flogging had caused severe sores. These,  being unattended to, were festering. The others were Zulu friendlies.  Although these had badges given them to distinguish them from the  'enemy', they had been shot at by the soldiers by mistake.  Besides this work I had to compound and dispense prescriptions for  the white soldiers. This was easy enough for me as I had received a  year's training in Dr. Booth's little hospital. This work brought me  in close contact with many Europeans.  We were attached to a swift-moving column. It had orders to march  wherever danger was reported. It was for the most part mounted  infantry. As soon as our camp was moved, we had to follow on foot  with our stretchers on our shoulders. Twice or thrice we had to  march forty miles a day. But wherever we went, I am thankful that we  had God's good work to do, having to carry to the camp on our  stretchers those Zulu friendlies who had been inadvertently wounded,  and to attend upon them as nurses.
