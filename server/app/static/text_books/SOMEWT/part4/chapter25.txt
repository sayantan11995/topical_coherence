The Zulu 'rebellion' was full of new experiences and gave me much food  for thought. The Boer War had not brought home to me the horrors of  war with anything like the vividness that the 'rebellion' did. This  was no war but a man-hunt, not only in my opinion, but also in that  of many Englishmen with whom I had occasion to talk. To hear every  morning reports of the soldiers' rifles exploding like crackers in  innocent hamlets, and to live in the midst of them was a trial. But  I swallowed the bitter draught, especially as the work of my Corps  consisted only in nursing the wounded Zulus. I could see that but  for us the Zulus would have been uncared for. This work, therefore,  eased my conscience.  But there was much else to set one thinking. It  was a sparsely populated part of the country. Few and far between in  hills and dales were the scattered Kraals of the simple and  so-called 'uncivilized' Zulus. Marching, with or without the  wounded, through these solemn solitudes, I often fell into deep  thought.  I pondered over brahmacharya and its implications, and my convictions took deep root. I discussed  it with my co-workers. I had not realized then how indispensable it  was for self-realization, but I clearly saw that one aspiring to  serve humanity with his whole soul could not do without it. It was  borne in upon me that I should have more and more occasions for  service of the kind I was rendering, and that I should find myself  unequal to my task if I were engaged in the pleasures of family life  and in the propagation and rearing of children.  In a word, I could not live both after the flesh and the spirit. On  the present occasion, for instance, I should not have been able to  throw myself into the fray, had my wife been expecting a baby.  Without the observance of brahmacharya service of the family would be inconsistent with service of the  community. With brahmacharya they would be perfectly consistent.  So thinking, I became somewhat impatient to take a final vow. The  prospect of the vow brought a certain kind of exultation.  Imagination also found free play and opened out limitless vistas of  service.  Whilst I was thus in the midst of strenuous physical and mental  work, a report came to the effect that the work of suppressing the  'rebellion' was nearly over, and that we should soon be discharged.  A day or two after this our discharge came and in a few days we got  back to our homes.  After a short while I got a letter from the Governor specially  thanking the Ambulance Corps for its services.  On my arrival at Phoenix I eagerly broached the subject of brahmacharya  with Chhaganlal, Maganlal, West and others. They liked the idea and  accepted the necessity of taking the vow, but they also represented  the difficulties of the task. Some of them set themselves bravely to  observe it, and some, I know, succeeded also.  I too took the plunge â€“ the vow to observe brahmacharya  for life. I must confess that I had not then fully realized the  magnitude and immensity of the task I undertook. The difficulties  are even today staring me in the face. The importance of the vow is  being more and more borne in upon me. Life without brahmacharya  appears to me to be insipid and animal-like. The brute by nature  knows no self-restraint. Man is man because he is capable of, and  only in so far as he exercises, self-restraint. What formerly  appeared to me to be extravagant praise of brahmacharya  in our religious books seems now, with increasing clearness every  day, to be absolutely proper and founded on experience. I saw that brahmacharya, which is so full of wonderful potency, is by no means an easy  affair, and certainly not a mere matter of the body. It begins with  bodily restraint, but does not end there. The perfection of it  precludes even an impure thought. A true brahmachari  will not even dream of satisfying the fleshly appetite, and until he  is in that condition, he has a great deal of ground to cover. For me the observance of even bodily brahmacharya  has been full of difficulties. Today I may say that I feel myself  fairly safe, but I had yet to achieve complete mastery over thought,  which is so essential. Not that the will or effort is lacking, but  it is yet a problem to me wherefrom undesirable thoughts spring  their insidious invasions. I have no doubt that there is a key to  lock out undesirable thoughts, but every one has to find it out for  himself. Saints and seers have left their experiences for us, but  they have given us no infallible and universal prescription. For  perfection or freedom from error comes only from grace, and so  seekers after God have left us mantras, such as Ramanama,  hallowed by their own austerities and charged with their purity.  Without an unreserved surrender to His grace, complete mastery over  thought is impossible. This is the teaching of every great book of  religion, and I am realizing the truth of it every moment of my  striving after that perfect brahmacharya. But part of the history of that striving and struggle will be told  in chapters to follow. I shall conclude this chapter with an  indication of how I set about the task. In the first flush of  enthusiasm, I found the observance quite easy. The very first change  I made in my mode of life was to stop sharing the same bed with my  wife or seeking privacy with her.  Thus brahmacharya which I had been observing willy-nilly since 1900, was sealed with a  vow in the middle of 1906.
