The spiritual training of the boys was a much more difficult matter than  their physical and mental training. I relied little on religious  books for the training of the spirit. Of course I believed that  every student should be acquainted with the elements of his own  religion and have a general knowledge of his own scriptures, and  therefore I provided for such knowledge as best I could. But that,  to my mind, was part of the intellectual training. Long before I  undertook the education of the youngsters of the Tolstoy Farm I had  realized that the training of the spirit was a thing by itself. To  develop the spirit is to build character and to enable one to work  towards a knowledge of God and self-realization. And I held that  this was an essential part of the training of the young, and that  all training without culture of the spirit was of no use, and might  be even harmful.  I am familiar with the superstition that self-realization is  possible only in the fourth stage of life, i.e., sannyasa  (renunciation). But it is a matter of common knowledge that those  who defer preparation for this invaluable experience until the last  stage of life attain not self-realization but old age amounting to a  second and pitiable childhood, living as a burden on this earth. I  have a full recollection that I held these views even whilst I was  teaching i.e., in 1911-12, though I might not then have expressed  them in identical language.  How then was this spiritual training to be given? I made the  children memorize and recite hymns, and read to them from books on  moral training. But that was far from satisfying me. As I came into  closer contact with them I saw that it was not through books that  one could impart training of the spirit. Just as physical training  was to be imparted through physical exercise, and intellectual  through intellectual exercise, even so the training of  the spirit was possible only through the exercise of the spirit. And  the exercise of the spirit entirely depended on the life and  character of the teacher. The teacher had always to be mindful of  his p's and q's, whether he was in the midst of his boys or not. It is possible for a teacher situated miles away to affect the  spirit of the pupils by his way of living. It would be idle for me,  if I were a liar, to teach boys to tell the truth. A cowardly  teacher would never succeed in making his boys valiant, and a  stranger to self-restraint could never teach his pupils the value of self-restraint.  I saw, therefore, that I must be an eternal  object-lesson to the boys and girls living with me. They thus became  my teachers, and I learnt I must be good and live straight, if only  for their sakes. I may say that the increasing discipline and  restraint I imposed on myself at Tolstoy Farm was mostly due to  those wards of mine.  One of them was wild, unruly, given to lying, and quarrelsome. On  one occasion he broke out most violently. I was exasperated. I never  punished my boys, but this time I was very angry. I tried to reason  with him. But he was adamant and even tried to overreach me. At last  I picked up a ruler lying at hand and delivered a blow on his arm. I  trembled as I struck him. I dare say he noticed it. This was an  entirely novel experience for them all. The boy cried out and begged  to be forgiven. He cried not because the beating was painful to him;  he could, if he had been so minded, have paid me back in the same  coin, being a stoutly built youth of seventeen; but he realized my  pain in being driven to this violent resource. Never again after  this incident did he disobey me. But I still repent that violence. I  am afraid I exhibited before him that day not the spirit, but the  brute, in me.  I have always been opposed to corporal punishment. I remember only  one occasion on which I physically punished one of my sons. I have  therefore never until this day been able to decide whether I was  right or wrong in using the ruler. Probably it was improper, for it  was prompted by anger and a desire to punish. Had it been an  expression only of my distress, I should have considered it  justified. But the motive in this case was mixed.  This incident set me thinking and taught me a better method of  correcting students. I do not know whether that method would have  availed on the occasion in question. The youngster soon forgot the  incident, and I do not think he ever showed great improvement. But  the incident made me understand better the duty of a teacher towards  his pupils.  Cases of misconduct on the part of the boys often occurred after  this, but I never resorted to corporal punishment. Thus in my  endeavour to impart spiritual training to the boys and girls under  me, I came to understand better and better the power of the spirit.
