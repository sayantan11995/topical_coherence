On arrival in England I learned that Gokhale had been stranded in Paris  where he had gone for reasons of health, and as communication  between Paris and London had been cut off, there was no knowing when  he would return. I did not want to go home without having seen him,  but no one could say definitely when he would arrive.  What then was I to do in the meanwhile? What was my duty as regards  the war? Sorabji Adajania, my comrade in jail and a Satyagrahi, was  then reading for the bar in London. As one of the best Satyagrahis  he had been sent to England to qualify himself as a barrister, so  that he might take my place on return to South Africa. Dr.  Pranjivandas Mehta was paying his expenses. With him, and through  him, I had conferences with Dr. Jivraj Mehta and others who were  persuing their studies in England. In consultation with them, a  meeting of the Indian residents in Great Britain and Ireland was  called. I placed my views before them.  I felt that Indians residing  in England ought to do their bit in the war. English students had  volunteered to serve in the army, and Indians might do no less. A  number of objections were taken to this line of argument. There was,  it was contended, a world of difference between the Indians and the  English. We were slaves and they were masters. How could a slave  co-operate with the master in the hour of the latter's need? Was it  not the duty of the slave, seeking to be free, to make the master's  need his opportunity? This argument failed to appeal to me then. I  knew the difference of status between an Indian and an Englishman,  but I did not believe that we had been quite reduced to slavery. I  felt then that it was more the fault of individual British officials  than of the British system, and that we could convert them by love.  If we would improve our status through the help and co-operation of  the British, it was our duty to win their help by standing by them  in their hour of need. Though the system was faulty, it did not seem  to me to be intolerable, as it does today. But if, having lost my  faith in the system, I refuse to co-operate with the British  Government today, how could those friends do so, having lost  their faith not only in the system but in the officials as well? The opposing friends felt that that was the hour for making a bold  declaration of Indian demands and for improving the status of Indians.  I thought that England's need should not be turned into our  opportunity, and that it was more becoming and far-sighted not to  press our demands while the war lasted. I therefore adhered to my  advice and invited those who would to enlist as volunteers. There  was a good response, practically all the provinces and all the  religions being represented among the volunteers.  I wrote a letter to Lord Crewe, acquainting him with these facts,  and expressing our readiness to be trained for ambulance work, if  that should be considered a condition precedent to the acceptance of  our offer.  Lord Crewe accepted the offer after some hesitation, and thanked us  for having tendered our services to the Empire at that critical  hour.  The volunteers began their preliminary training in first aid to the  wounded under the well-known Dr.Cantlie. It was a short course of  six weeks, but it covered the whole course of first aid.  We were a class of about eighty. In six weeks we were examined, and all  except one passed. For these the Government now provided military  drill and other training. Colonel Baker was placed in charge of this  work.  London in these days was a sight worth seeing. There was no panic,  but all were busy helping to the best of their ability. Able-bodied  adults began training as combatants, but what were the old, the  infirm and the women to do? There was enough work for them, if they  wanted. So they employed themselves in cutting and making clothes  and dressings for the wounded.  The Lyceum, a ladies' club, undertook to make as many clothes for  the soldiers as they could. Shrimati Sarojini Naidu was a member of  this club, and threw herself whole-heartedly into the work. This was  my first acquaintance with her. She placed before me a heap of  clothes which had been cut to pattern, and asked me to get them all  sewn up and return them to her. I welcomed her demand and with the  assistance of friends got as many clothes made as I could manage  during my training for first aid.
