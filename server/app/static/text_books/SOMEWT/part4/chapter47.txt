The reader, by now, will be quite familiar with Parsi Rustomji's name.  He was one who became at once my client and co-worker, or perhaps it  would be truer to say that he first became co-worker and then  client. I won his confidence to such an extent that he sought and  followed my advice also in private domestic matters. Even when he  was ill, he would seek my aid, and though there was much difference  between our ways of living, he did not hesitate to accept my quack  treatment.  This friend once got into a very bad scrape. Though he kept me  informed of most of his affairs, he had studiously kept back one  thing. He was a large importer of goods from Bombay and Calcutta,  and not infrequently he resorted to smuggling. But as he was on the  best terms with customs officials, no one was inclined to suspect  him. In charging duty, they used to take his invoices on trust. Some  might even have connived at the smuggling.  But to use the telling simile of the Gujarati poet Akho, theft like  quicksilver won't be suppressed, and Parsi Rustomji's proved no  exception. The good friend ran post haste to me, the tears rolling  down his cheeks as he said: 'Bhai, I have deceived you. My guilt has  been discovered today. I have smuggled and I am doomed. I must go to  jail and be ruined. You alone may be able to save me from this  predicament. I have kept back nothing else from you, but I thought I  ought not to bother you with such tricks of the trade, and so I  never told you about this smuggling. But now, how much I repent it!' I calmed him and said: 'To save or not to save you is in His hands.  As to me you know my way. I can but try to save you by means of  confession.'  The good Parsi felt deeply mortified.  'But is not my confession before you enough?' he asked. 'You have wronged not me but Government. How will the confession  made before me avail you?' I replied gently.  'Of course I will do just as you advise, but will you not consult  with my old counsel Mr. _____? He is a friend too,' said Parsi  Rustomji.  Inquiry revealed that the smuggling had been going on for a long  time, but the actual offence detected involved a trifling sum. We  went to his counsel. He perused the papers, and said: 'The case will  be tried by a jury, and a Natal jury will be the last to acquit an  Indian. But I will not give up hope.'  I did not know this counsel intimately. Parsi Rustomji intercepted:  'I thank you, but I should like to be guided by Mr. Gandhi's advice  in this case. He knows me intimately. Of course you will advise him  whenever necessary.'  Having thus shelved the counsel's question, we went to Parsi  Rustomji's shop.  And now explaining my view I said to him: 'I don't think this case  should be taken to court at all. It rests with the Customs Officer  to prosecute you or to let you go, and he in turn will have to be  guided by the Attorney General. I am prepared to meet both. I  propose that you should offer to pay the penalty they fix, and the  odds are that they will be agreeable. But if they are not, you must  be prepared to go to jail. I am of opinion that the shame lies not  so much in going to jail as in committing the offence. The deed of  shame has already been done. Imprisonment you should regard as a  penance. The real penance lies in resolving never to smuggle again.' I cannot say that Parsi Rustomji took all this quite well. He was a  brave man, but his courage failed him for the moment. His name and  fame were at stake, and where would he be if the edifice he had  reared with such care and labour should go to pieces?  'Well, I have told you,' he said, 'that I am entirely in your hands.  You may do just as you like.'  I brought to bear on this case all my powers of persuasion. I met  the Customs Officer and fearlessly apprised him of the whole affair.  I also promised to place all the books at his disposal and told him  how penitent Parsi Rustomji was feeling. The Customs Officer said: 'I  like the old Parsi. I am sorry he has made a fool of himself. You  know where my duty lies. I must be guided by the Attorney General  and so I would advise you to use all your persuasion with him.' 'I shall be thankful,' said I, 'if you do not insist on dragging him  into court.'  Having got him to promise this, I entered into correspondence with  the Attorney General and also met him. I am glad to say that he  appreciated my complete frankness and was convinced that I had kept  back nothing.  I now forget whether it was in connection with this or with some  other case that my persistence and frankness extorted from him the  remark: 'I see you will never take a no for an answer.' The case against Parsi Rustomji was compromised. He was to pay a  penalty equal to twice the amount he had confessed to having  smuggled. Rustomji reduced to writing the facts of the whole case,  got the paper framed and hung it up in his office to serve as a  perpetual reminder to his heirs and fellow merchants.  These friends of Rustomji warned me not to be taken in by this  transitory contrition. When I told Rustomji about this warning he  said: 'What would be my fate if I deceived you?'
