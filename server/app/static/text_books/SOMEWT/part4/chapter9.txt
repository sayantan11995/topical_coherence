To turn now to the Asiatic Department.  Johannesburg was the stronghold of the Asiatic officers. I had been  observing that, far from protecting the Indians, Chinese and others,  these officers were grinding them down. Every day I had complaints  like this: 'The rightful ones are not admitted, whilst those who  have no right are smuggled in on payment of Â£ 100. If you will not  remedy this state of things, who will?' I shared the feeling. If I  did not succeed in stamping out this evil, I should be living in the  Transvaal in vain.  So I began to collect evidence, and as soon as I had gathered a fair  Amount, I approached the Police Commissioner. He appeared to be a  just man. Far from giving me the cold shoulder, he listened to me  patiently and asked me to show him all the evidence in my  possession. He examined the witnesses himself and was satisfied, but  he knew as well as I that it was difficult in South Africa to get a  white jury to convict a white offender against coloured men. 'But,'  said he, 'let us try at any rate. It is not proper, either, to let  such criminals go scot-free for fear of the jury acquitting them. I  must get them arrested. I assure you I shall leave no stone  unturned.'  I did not need the assurance. I suspected quite a number of  officers, but as I had no unchallengeable evidence against them all,  warrants of arrest were issued against the two about whose guilt I  had not the slightest doubt.  My movements could never be kept secret. Many knew that I was going  to the Police Commissioner practically daily. The two officers  against whom warrants had been issued had spies more or less  efficient. They used to patrol my office and report my movements to  the officers. I must admit, however, that these officers were so bad  that they could not have had many spies. Had the Indians and the  Chinese not helped me, they would never have been arrested.  One of these absconded. The Police Commissioner obtained an  extradition warrant against him and got him arrested and brought to  the Transvaal. They were tried, and although there was strong  evidence against them, and in spite of the fact that the jury had  evidence of one of them having absconded, both were declared to be  not guilty and acquitted.  I was sorely disappointed. The Police Commissioner also was very  sorry. I was disgusted with the legal profession. The very intellect  became an abomination to me inasmuch as it could be prostituted for  screening crime.  However, the guilt of both these officers was so patent that in  spite of their acquittal the Government could not harbour them. Both  were cashiered, and the Asiatic department became comparatively  clean, and the Indian community was somewhat reassured.  The event enhanced my prestige and brought me more business. The  bulk, though not all, of the hundreds of pounds that the community  was monthly squandering in peculation, was saved. All could not be  saved, for the dishonest still plied their trade. But it was now  possible for the honest man to preserve his honesty.  I must say that, though these officers were so bad, I had nothing  against them personally. They were aware of this themselves, and  when in their straits they approached me, I helped them too. They  had a chance of getting employed by the Johannesburg Municipality in  case I did not oppose the proposal. A friend of theirs saw me in  this connection and I agreed not to thwart them, and they succeeded. This attitude of mine put the officials with whom I came in contact  perfectly at ease, and though I had often to fight with their  department and use strong language, they remained quite friendly  with me. I was not then quite conscious that such behaviour was part  of my nature. I learnt later that it was an essential part of  Satyagraha, and an attribute of ahimsa. Man and his deed are two distinct things. Whereas a good deed should  call forth approbation and a wicked deed disapprobation, the doer of  the deed, whether good or wicked always deserves respect or pity as  the case may be. 'Hate the sin and not the sinner' is a precept  which, though easy enough to understand, is rarely practised, and  that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world. This ahimsa is the basis of the search for truth. I am realizing every day that  the search is in vain unless it is founded on ahimsa  as the basis. It is quite proper to resist and attack a system, but  to resist and attack its author is tantamount to resisting and  attacking oneself. For we are all tarred with the same brush, and  are children of one and the same Creator, and as such the divine  powers within us are infinite. To slight a single human being is to  slight those divine powers, and thus to harm not only that being but  with him the whole world.
