We shall, for a moment, take leave of the Ashram, which in the very  beginning had to weather internal and external storms, and briefly  advert to a matter that engaged my attention.  Indentured labourers were those who had emigrated from India to  labour under an indenture for five years or less. Under the  Smuts-Gandhi settlement of 1914, the Â£3 tax in respect of the  indentured emigrants to Natal had been abolished, but the general  emigration from India still needed treatment.  In March 1916 Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji moved a resolution in  the Imperial Legislative Council for the abolition of the indenture  system. In accepting the motion Lord Hardinge announced that he had  'obtained from His Majesty's Government the promise of the abolition  in due course' of the system. I felt, however, that India could not  be satisfied with so very vague an assurance, but ought to agitate  for immediate abolition. India had tolerated the system through   sheer negligence, and I believed the time had come when people could  successfully agitate for this redress. I met some of the leaders,  wrote in the press, and saw that public opinion was solidly in favour of  immediate abolition. Might this be a fit subject for  Satyagraha? I had no doubt that it was, but I did not know the  modus operandi. In the meantime the Viceroy had made no secret of the meaning of  'the eventual abolition', which, as he said, was abolition 'within  such reasonable time as will allow of alternative arrangements  introduced.'  So in February 1917, Pandit Malaviyaji asked for leave to introduce  a bill for the immediate abolition of the system. Lord Chelmsford  refused permission. It was time for me to tour the country for an  all-India agitation.  Before I started the agitation I thought it proper to wait upon the  Viceroy. So I applied for an interview. He immediately granted it.  Mr. Maffey, now Sir John Maffey, was his private secretary. I came  in close contact with him. I had a satisfactory talk with Lord  Chelmsford who, without being definite, promised to be a helpful. I began my tour from Bombay. Mr. Jehangir Petit undertook to convene  the meeting under the auspices of the Imperial Citizenship  Association. The Executive Committee of the Association met first  for framing the resolutions to be moved at the meeting. Dr. Stanley  Reed, Sjt. (now Sir) Lallubhai Samaldas, Sjt. Natarajan and Mr.  Petit were present at the Committee meeting. The discussion centred  round the fixing of the period within which the Government was to be  asked to abolish the system. There were three proposals, viz, for  abolition 'as soon as possible', abolition 'by the 31st July', and  'immediate abolition'. I was for a definite date, as we could then  decide what to do if the Government failed to accede to our request  within the time limit. Sjt. Lallubhai was for 'immediate' abolition.  He said 'immediate' indicated a shorter period than the 31st July. I  explained that the people would not understand the word 'immediate'.  If we wanted to get them to do something, they must have a more  definite word. Everyone would interpret 'immediate' in his own way -  Government one way, the people another way. There was no question of  misunderstanding 'the 31st of July', and if nothing was done by that  date, we could proceed further. Dr. Reed saw the force of the  argument, and ultimately Sjt. Lallubhai also agreed. We adopted the  31st July as the latest date by which the abolition should be  announced, a resolution to that effect was passed at the public  meeting, and meetings throughout India resolved accordingly.  Mrs. Jaiji Petit put all her energies into the organization of a  ladies' deputation to the Viceroy. Amongst the ladies from Bombay  who formed the deputation, I remember the names of Lady Tata and the  late Dilshad Begam. The deputation had a great effect. The Viceroy  gave an encouraging reply.  I visited Karachi, Calcutta and various other places. There were  fine meetings everywhere, and there was unbounded enthusiasm. I had  not expected anything like it when the agitation was launched. In those days I used to travel alone, and had therefore wonderful  experiences. The C.I.D. men were always after me. But as I had nothing  to conceal, they did not molest me, nor did I cause them any  trouble. Fortunately I had not then received the stamp of Mahatmaship,  though the shout of that name was quite common where people knew me.  On one occasion the detectives disturbed me at several stations,  asked for my ticket and took down the number. I, of course, readily  replied to all questions they asked. My fellow passengers had taken  me to be a sadhu or a fakir. When they saw that I was being  molested at every station, they were exasperated and swore at the  detectives. 'Why are you worrying the poor sadhu for nothing?' they  protested. 'Don't you show these scoundrels your ticket,' they said,  addressing me.  I said to them gently: 'It is no trouble to show them my ticket.  They are doing their duty.' The passengers were not satisfied, they  evinced more and more sympathy, and strongly objected to this sort  of ill- treatment of innocent men.  But the detectives were nothing. The real hardship was the third  class travelling. My bitterest experience was from Lahore to Delhi.  I was going to Calcutta from Karachi via  Lahore where I had to change trains. It was impossible to find a  place in the train. It was full, and those who  could get in did so by sheer force, often sneaking through windows  if the doors were locked. I had to reach Calcutta on the date fixed  for the meeting, and if I missed this train I could not arrive in  time. I had almost given up hope of getting in. No one was willing  to accept me, when a porter discovering my plight came to me and said,  'Give me twelve annas and I'll get you a seat.' 'Yes,' said I, 'you  shall have twelve annas if you do procure me a seat.' The young man  went from carriage to carriage entreating passengers but no one  heeded him. As the train was about to start, some passengers said,  'There is no room here, but you can shove him in if you like. He  will have to stand.' 'Well?' asked the young porter. I readily  agreed, and he shoved me in bodily through the window. Thus I got  in and the porter earned his twelve annas.  The night was a trial. The other passengers were sitting somehow. I  stood two hours, holding the chain of the upper bunk. Meanwhile some  of the passengers kept worrying me incessantly. 'Why will you not  sit down?' they asked. I tried to reason with them saying there was  no room, but they could not tolerate my standing, though they were  lying full length on the upper bunks. They did not tire of worrying  me, neither did I tire of gently replying to them. This at last  mollified them. Some of them asked me my name, and made room for me.  Patience was thus rewarded. I was dead tired, and my head was  reeling. God sent help when it was most needed.  In that way I somehow reached Delhi and thence Calcutta. The  Maharaja of Cassimbazar, the president of the Calcutta meeting, was  my host. Just as in Karachi, here also there was unbounded  enthusiasm. The meeting was attended by several Englishmen. Before the 31st July the Government announced that indentured  emigration from India was stopped.  It was in 1894 that I drafted the first petition protesting against  the system, and I had then hoped that this 'semi-slavery,' as Sir W.  W. Hunter used to call the system, would some day be brought to an  end.  There were many who aided in the agitation which was started in  1894, but I cannot help saying that potential Satyagraha hastened  the end.  For further details of that agitation and of those who took part in  it, I refer the reader to my Satyagraha in South Africa.
