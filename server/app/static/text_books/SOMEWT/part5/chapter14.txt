My object was to inquire into the condition of the Champaran  agriculturists and understand their grievances against the indigo  planters. For this purpose it was necessary that I should meet  thousands of the ryots. But I deemed it essential, before starting  on my inquiry, to know the planters' side of the case and see the  Commissioner of the Division. I sought and was granted appointments  with both.  The Secretary of the Planters' Association told me  plainly that I was an outsider and that I had no business to come  between the planters and their tenants, but if I had any  representation to make, I might submit it in writing. I politely  told him that I did not regard myself as an outsider, and that I had  every right to inquire into the condition of the tenants if they  desired me to do so.  The Commissioner, on whom I called, proceeded to bully me, and  advised me forthwith to leave Tirhut. I acquainted my co-workers with all this, and told them that there  was a likelihood of Government stopping me from proceeding further,  and that I might have to go to jail earlier than I had expected, and  that, if I was to be arrested, it would be best that the arrest  should take place in Motihari or if possible in Bettiah. It was  advisable, therefore, that I should go to those place as early as  possible.  Champaran is a district of the Tirhut division and Motihari is its  headquarters. Rajkumar Shukla's place was in the vicinity of Bettiah,  and the tenants belonging to the kothis in its neighbourhood were  the poorest in the district. Rajkumar Shukla wanted me to see them  and I was equally anxious to do so.  So I started with my co-workers for Motihari the same day. Babu  Gorakh Prasad harboured us in his home, which became a caravanserai.  It could hardly contain us all. The very same day we heard that  about five miles from Motihari a tenant had been ill-treated. It was  decided that, in company with Babu Dharanidhar Prasad, I should go  and see him the next morning, and we accordingly set off for the  place on elephant's back. An elephant, by the way, is about as  common in Champaran as a bullock-cart in Gujarat. We had scarcely  gone half when a messenger from the Police Superintendent overtook  us and said that the latter had sent his compliments. I saw what he  meant. Having left Dharanidharbabu to proceed to the original  destination, I got into the hired carriage which the messenger had  brought. He then served on me a notice to leave Champaran, and drove  me to my place. On his asking me to acknowledge the service of the  notice, I wrote to the effect that I did not propose to comply with  it and leave Champaran till my inquiry was finished. Thereupon I  received a summons to take my trial the next day for disobeying the  order to leave Champaran.  I kept awake that whole night writing letters and giving necessary  instructions to Babu Brajkishore Prasad.  The news of the notice and the summons spread like wildfire, and I  was told that Motihari that day witnessed unprecedented scenes.  Gorakhbabu's house and the court house overflowed with men.  Fortunately I had finished all my work during the night and so was  able to cope with the crowds. My companions proved the greatest help.  They occupied themselves with regulating the crowds, for the latter  followed me wherever I went.  A sort of friendliness sprang up between the officials – Collector,  Magistrate, Police Superintendent – and myself. I might have legally  resisted the notices served on me. Instead I accepted them all, and  my conduct towards the officials was correct. They thus saw that I  did not want to offend them personally, but that I wanted to offer  civil resistance to their orders. In this way they were put at ease,  and instead of harassing me they gladly availed themselves of my and  my co-workers' co-operation in regulating the crowds. But it was an  ocular demonstration to them of the fact that their authority was  shaken. The people had for the moment lost all fear of punishment  and yielded obedience to the power of love which their new friend  exercised.  It should be remembered that no one knew me in Champaran. The  peasants were all ignorant. Champaran, being far up north of the  Ganges, and right at the foot of the Himalayas in close proximity to  Nepal, was cut off from the rest of India. The Congress was  practically unknown in those parts. Even those who had heard the  name of the Congress shrank from joining it or even mentioning it.  And now the Congress and its members had entered this land, though  not in the name of the Congress, yet in a far more real sense.   In consultation with my co-workers I had decided that nothing should  be done in the name of the Congress. What we wanted was work and not  name, substance and not shadow. For the name of the Congress was the  bête noire of the Government and their controllers – the planters.  To them the Congress was a byword for lawyers' wrangles, evasion of  law through legal loopholes, a byword for bomb and anarchical crime  and for diplomacy and hypocrisy. We had to disillusion them both.  Therefore we had decided not to mention the name of the Congress and  not to acquaint the peasants with the organization  called the Congress. It was enough, we thought, if they understood  and followed the spirit of the Congress instead of its letter.  No emissaries had therefore been sent there, openly or secretly, on  behalf of the Congress to prepare the ground for our arrival.  Rajkumar Shukla was incapable of reaching the thousands of peasants.  No political work had yet been done amongst them. The world outside  Champaran was not known to them. And yet they received me as though  we had been age-long friends. It is no exaggeration, but the literal  truth, to say that in this meeting with the peasants I was face to  face with God, Ahimsa and Truth.  When I come to examine my title to this realization, I find nothing  but my love for the people. And this in turn is nothing but an  expression of my unshakable faith in Ahimsa.  That day in Champaran was an unforgettable event in my life and a  red-letter day for the peasants and for me.  According to the law, I was to be on my trial, but truly speaking  Government was to be on its trial. The Commissioner only succeeded  in trapping Government in the net which he had spread for me.
