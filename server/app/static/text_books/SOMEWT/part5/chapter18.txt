As far as was possible we placed each school in charge of one man and  one woman. These volunteers had to look after medical relief and  sanitation. The womenfolk had to be approached through women.  Medical relief was a very simple affair. Castor oil, quinine and  sulphur ointment were the only drugs provided to the volunteers. If  the patient showed a furred tongue or complained of constipation,  castor oil was administered, in case of fever quinine was given  after an opening dose of castor oil, and the sulphur ointment was  applied in case of boils and itch after thoroughly washing the  affected parts. No patient was permitted to take home any medicine.  Wherever there was some complication Dr. Dev was consulted. Dr. Dev used to visit each  centre on certain fixed days in the week.  Quite a number of people availed themselves of this simple relief.  This plan of work will not seem strange when it is remembered that  the prevailing ailments were few and amenable to simple treatment,  by no means requiring expert help. As for the people the arrangement  answered excellently.  Sanitation was a difficult affair. The people were not prepared to  do anything themselves. Even the field labourers were not ready to  do their own scavenging. But Dr. Dev was not a man easily to lose  heart. He and the volunteers concentrated their energies on making a  village ideally clean. They swept the roads and the courtyards,  cleaned out the wells, filled up the pools near by, and lovingly  persuaded the villagers to raise volunteers from amongst  themselves. In some villages they shamed people into taking up the  work, and in others the people were so enthusiastic that they even  prepared roads to enable my car to go from place to place. These  sweet experiences were not unmixed with bitter ones of people's  apathy. I remember some villagers frankly expressing their dislike  for this work.  It may not be out of place here to narrate an experience that I have  described before now at many meetings. Bhitiharva was a small  village in which was one of our schools. I happened to visit a  smaller village in its vicinity and found some of the women dressed  very dirtily. So I told my wife to ask them why they did not wash  their clothes. She spoke to them. One of the women took her into her  hut and said: 'Look now, there is no box or cupboard here containing  other clothes. The sari I am wearing is the only one I have. How  am I to wash it? Tell Mahatmaji to get me another sari, and I  shall then promise to bathe and put on clean clothes every day.'  This cottage was not an exception, but a type to be found in many  Indian villages. In countless cottages in India people live without  any furniture, and without a change of clothes, merely with a rag to  cover their shame.  One more experience I will note. In Champaran there is no lack of  bamboo and grass. The school hut they had put up at Bhitiharva was  made of these materials. Someone – possibly some of the neighbouring  planters' men – set fire to it one night. It was not thought advisable  to build another hut of bamboo and grass. The school was in charge  of Sjt. Soman and Kasturbai. Sjt. Soman decided to build a pukka  house, and thanks to his infectious labour, many co-operated with  him, and a brick house was soon made ready. There was no fear now of  this building being burnt down.  Thus the volunteers with their schools, sanitation work and medical  relief gained the confidence and respect of the village folk, and  were able to bring good influence to bear upon them.  But I must  confess with regret that my hope of putting this constructive work  on a permanent footing was not fulfilled. The volunteers had come  for temporary periods, I could not secure any more from outside, and  permanent honorary workers from Bihar were not available. As soon as  my work in Champaran was finished, work outside, which had been  preparing in the meantime, drew me away. The few months' work in  Champaran, however, took such deep root that its influence in one  form or another is to be observed there even today.
