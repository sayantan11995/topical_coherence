The moment I reached Bombay Gokhale sent me word that the Governor was  desirous of seeing me, and that it might be proper for me to respond  before I left for Poona. Accordingly I called on His Excellency.  After the usual inquiries, he said:  'I ask one thing of you. I would like you to come and see me  whenever you propose to take any steps concerning Government.' I replied:  'I can very easily give the promise, inasmuch as it is my rule, as a  Satyagrahi, to understand the viewpoint of the party I propose to  deal with, and to try to agree with him as far as may be possible. I  strictly observed the rule in South Africa and I mean to do the same  here.'  Lord Willingdon thanked me and said:  'You may come to me whenever you like, and you will see that my Government do not willfully do  anything wrong.'  To which I replied: 'It is that faith which sustains me.' After this I went to Poona. It is impossible for me to set down all  the reminiscences of this precious time. Gokhale and the members of  the Servants of India Society overwhelmed me with affection. So far  as I recollect, Gokhale had summoned all of them to meet me. I had a  frank talk with them all on every sort of subject.  Gokhale was very keen that I should join the Society and so was I.  But the members felt that, as there was a great difference between  my ideals and methods of work and theirs, it might not be proper for  me to join the Society. Gokhale believed that, in spite of my  insistence on my own principles, I was equally ready and able to  tolerate theirs.  'But,' he said, 'the members of the Society have not yet understood  your readiness for compromise. They are tenacious of their  principles, and quite independent. I am hoping that they will accept  you, but if they don't, you will not for a moment think that they are  lacking in respect or love for you. They are hesitating to take any  risk lest their high regard for you should be jeopardized. But  whether you are formally admitted as a member or not, I am going to  look upon you as one.'  I informed Gokhale of my intentions. Whether I was admitted as a  member or not, I wanted to have an Ashram where I could settle down  with my Phoenix family, preferably somewhere in Gujarat, as, being a  Gujarati, I thought I was best fitted to serve the country through  serving Gujarat. Gokhale liked the idea. He said: 'You should  certainly do so. Whatever may be the result of your talks with the  members, you must look to me for the expenses of the Ashram, which I  will regard as my own.'  My heart overflowed with joy. It was a pleasure to feel free from  the responsibility of raising funds, and to realize that I should  not be obliged to set about the work all on my own, but that I  should be able to count on a sure guide whenever I was in  difficulty. This took a great load off my mind.  So the late Dr. Dev was summoned and told to open an account for me  in the Society's books and to give me whatever I might require for  the Ashram and for public expenses.  I now prepared to go to Shantiniketan. On the eve of my departure  Gokhale arranged a party of selected friends, taking good care to  order refreshments of my liking, i.e., fruits and nuts. The party  was held just a few paces from his room, and yet he was hardly in a  condition to walk across and attend it. But his affection for me got  the better of him and he insisted on coming. He came, but fainted  and had to be carried away. Such fainting was not a new thing with  him and so when he came to, he sent word that we must go on with the  party.  This party was of course no more than a conversazione in the open  space opposite the Society's guesthouse, during which friends had  heart-to-heart chats over light refreshments of groundnuts, dates  and fresh fruits of the season.  But the fainting fit was to be no common event in my life.
