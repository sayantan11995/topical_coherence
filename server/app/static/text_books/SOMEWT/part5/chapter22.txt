For the first two weeks the mill-hands exhibited great courage and  self-restraint and daily held monster meetings. On these occasions I  used to remind them of their pledge, and they would shout back to me  the assurance that they would rather die than break their word. But at last they began to show signs of flagging. Just as physical  weakness in men manifests itself in irascibility, their attitude  towards the blacklegs became more and more menacing as the strike  seemed to weaken, and I began to fear an outbreak of rowdyism on  their part. The attendance at their daily meetings began to  dwindle by degrees, and despondency and despair were writ large on  the faces of those who did attend. Finally the information was  brought to me that the strikers had begun to totter. I felt deeply  troubled and set to thinking furiously as to what my duty was in the  circumstances. I had had experience of a gigantic strike in South  Africa, but the situation that confronted me here was different. The  mill-hands had taken the pledge at my suggestion. They had repeated  it before me day after day, and the very idea that they might now go  back upon it was to me inconceivable. Was it pride or was it my love  for the labourers and my passionate regard for truth that was at the  back of this feeling – who can say?  One morning –it was at a mill-hands' meeting – while I was still  groping and unable to see my way clearly, the light came to me.  Unbidden and all by themselves the words came to my lips: 'Unless  the strikers rally,' I declared to the meeting, 'and continue the  strike till a settlement is reached, or till they leave the mills  altogether, I will not touch any food.'  The labourers were thunderstruck. Tears began to course down  Anasuyabehn's cheeks. The labourers broke out, 'Not you but we shall  fast. It would be monstrous if you were to fast. Please forgive us  for our lapse, we will now remain faithful to our pledge to the  end.'  'There is no need for you to fast,' I replied. 'It would be enough  if you could remain true to your pledge. As you know we are without  funds, and we do not want to continue our strike by living on public  charity. You should therefore try to eke out a bare existence by  some kind of labour, so that you may be able to remain unconcerned,  no matter how long the strike may continue. As for my fast, it will  be broken only after the strike is settled.'  In the meantime Vallabhbhai was trying to find some employment for  the strikers under the Municipality, but there was not much hope of  success there. Maganlal Gandhi suggested that, as we needed sand for  filling the foundation of our weaving school in the Ashram, a number  of them might be employed for that purpose. The labourers welcomed  the proposal. Anasuyabehn led the way with a basket on her head and  soon an endless stream of labourers carrying baskets of sand on  their heads could be seen issuing out of the hollow of the  river-bed. It was a sight worth seeing. The labourers felt  themselves infused with a new strength, and it became difficult to  cope with the task of paying out wages to them.  My fast was not free from a grave defect. For as I have already  mentioned in a previous chapter. I enjoyed very close and cordial  relations with the mill-owners, and my fast could not but affect  their decision. As a Satyagrahi I knew that I might not fast against  them, but ought to leave them free to be influenced by the  mill-hands' strike alone. My fast was undertaken not on account of  lapse of the mill-owners, but on account of that of the labourers in which,  as their representative, I felt I had a share. With  the mill-owners, I could only plead; to fast against them would  amount to coercion. Yet in spite of my knowledge that my fast was  bound to put pressure upon them, as in fact it did, I felt I could  not help it. The duty to undertake it seemed to me to be clear. I tried to set the mill-owners at ease. 'There is not the slightest  necessity for you to withdraw from your position,' I said to them.  But they received my words coldly and even flung keen, delicate bits  of sarcasm at me, as indeed they had a perfect right to do. The principal man at the back of the mill-owners' unbending attitude  towards the strike was Sheth Ambalal. His resolute will and  transparent sincerity were wonderful and captured my heart. It was a  pleasure to be pitched against him. The strain produced by my fast  upon the opposition, of which he was the head, cut me, therefore, to  the quick. And then, Sarladevi, his wife, was attached to me with  the affection of a blood-sister, and I could not bear to see her  anguish on account of my action.  Anasuyabhen and a number of other friends and labourers shared the  fast with me on the first day. But after some difficulty I was able  to dissuade them from continuing it further.  The net result of it was that an atmosphere of goodwill was created  all round. The hearts of the mill-owners were touched, and they set  about discovering some means for a settlement. Anasuyabehn's house  became the venue of their discussions. Sjt. Anandshankar Dhruva  intervened and was in the end appointed arbitrator, and the strike  was called off after I had fasted only for three days. The  mill-owners commemorated the event by distributing sweets among the  labourers, and thus a settlement was reached after twenty-one days' strike. At the meeting held to celebrate the settlement, both the  mill-owners and the Commissioner were present. The advice which the  latter gave to the mill-hands on this occasion was: 'You should  always act as Mr. Gandhi advises you.' Almost immediately after  these events I had to engage in a tussle with this very gentleman.  But circumstances were changed, and he had changed with the  circumstances. He then set about warning the Patidars of Kheda  against following my advice!  I must not close this chapter without noting here an incident, as  amusing as it was pathetic. It happened in connection with the  distribution of sweets. The mill-owners had ordered a very large  quantity, and it was a problem how to distribute it among the  thousands of labourers. It was decided that it would be the fittest  thing to distribute it in the open, beneath the very tree under  which the pledge had been taken, especially as it would have been  extremely inconvenient to assemble them all together in any other  place.  I had taken it for granted that the men who had observed strict  discipline for full twenty-one days would without any difficulty be able to  remain standing in an orderly manner while the sweets were being  distributed, and not make an impatient scramble for them. But when  it came to the test, all the methods that were tried for making the  distribution failed. Again and again their ranks would break into  confusion after distribution had proceeded for a couple of minutes.  The leaders of the mill-hands tried their best to restore order, but  in vain. The confusion, the crush and the scramble at last became so  great that quite a number of the sweets were spoiled by being  trampled under foot, and the attempt to distribute them in the open  had finally to be given up. With difficulty we succeeded in taking  the remaining sweets to Sheth Ambalal's bungalow in Mirzapur.  Sweets were distributed comfortably the next day within the compound  of that bungalow.  The comic side of this incident is obvious, but the pathetic side  bears mention. Subsequent inquiry revealed the fact that the beggar  population of Ahmedabad, having got scent of the fact that sweets  were to be distributed under the Ek-Tek tree, had gone there in  large numbers, and it was their hungry scramble for the sweets that  had created all the confusion and disorder.  The grinding poverty and starvation with which our country is  afflicted is such that it drives more and more men every year into  the ranks of the beggars, whose desperate struggle for bread renders  them insensible to all feelings of decency and self-respect. And our  philanthropists, instead of providing work for them and insisting on  their working for bread, give them alms.
