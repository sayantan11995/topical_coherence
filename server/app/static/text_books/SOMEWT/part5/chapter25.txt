The campaign came to an unexpected end. It was clear that the people  were exhausted, and I hesitated to let the unbending be driven to  utter ruin. I was casting about for some graceful way of terminating  the struggle which would be acceptable to a Satyagrahi. Such a one  appeared quite unexpectedly. The Mamlatdar of the Nadiad Taluka sent  me word that, if well-to-do Patidars paid up, the poorer ones would  be granted suspension. I asked for a written undertaking to that  effect, which was given. But as a Mamlatdar could be responsible  only for his Taluka, I inquired of the Collector, who alone could  give an undertaking in respect of the whole district, whether the  Mamlatdar's undertaking was true for the whole district. He replied  that orders declaring suspension in terms of the Mamlatdar's letter  had been already issued. I was not aware of it, but if it was a  fact, the people's pledge had been fulfilled. The pledge, it will be  remembered, had the same things for its object, and so we expressed  ourselves satisfied with the orders.  However, the end was far from making me feel happy, inasmuch as it  lacked the grace with which the termination of every Satyagraha  campaign ought to be accompanied. The Collector carried on as though  he had done nothing by way of a settlement. The poor were to be  granted suspension, but hardly any got the benefit of it. It was the  people's right to determine who was poor, but they could not  exercise it. I was sad that they had not the strength to exercise  the right. Although, therefore, the termination was celebrated as a  triumph of Satyagraha, I could not enthuse over it, as it lacked the  essentials of a complete triumph.  The end of a Satyagraha campaign can be described as worthy, only  when, it leaves the Satyagrahis stronger and more spirited than they  are in the beginning.  The campaign was not, however, without its indirect results which we  can see today and the benefit of which we are reaping. The Kheda Satyagraha marks the beginning of an awakening among the peasants of  Gujarat, the beginning of their true political education.  Dr. Besant's brilliant Home Rule agitation had certainly touched the  peasants, but it was the Kheda campaign that compelled the educated  public workers to establish contact with the actual life of the  peasants. They learnt to identify themselves with the latter. They  found their proper sphere of work, their capacity for sacrifice  increased. That Vallabhbhai found himself during this campaign was  by itself no small achievement. We could realize its measure during  the flood relief operations last year and the Bardoli Satyagraha  this year. Public life in Gujarat became instinct with a new energy  and a new vigour. The Patidar peasant came to an unforgettable  consciousness of his strength. The lesson was indelibly imprinted on  the public mind that the salvation of the people depends upon  themselves, upon their capacity for suffering and sacrifice. Through  the Kheda campaign Satyagraha took firm root in the soil of Gujarat.  Although, therefore, I found nothing to enthuse over in the  termination of the Satyagraha, the Kheda peasants were jubilant,  because they knew that what they had achieved was commensurate with  their effort, and they had found the true and infallible  method for a redress of their grievances. This knowledge was enough  justification for their jubilation.  Nevertheless the Kheda peasants had not fully understood the inner  meaning of Satyagraha, and they saw it to their cost, as we shall  see in the chapters to follow.
