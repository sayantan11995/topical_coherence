I very nearly ruined my constitution during the recruiting campaign.  In those days my food principally consisted of groundnut butter and  lemons. I knew that it was possible to eat too much butter and  injure one's health, and yet I allowed myself to do so. This gave me  a slight attack of dysentery. I did not take serious notice of this,  and went that evening to the Ashram, as was my wont every now and  then. I scarcely took any medicine in those days. I thought I should  get well if I skipped a meal, and indeed I felt fairly free from  trouble as I omitted the morning meal next day. I knew, however,  that to be entirely free I must prolong my fast and, if I ate  anything at all, I should have nothing but fruit juices. There was some festival that day, and although I had told Kasturbai  that I should have nothing for my midday meal, she tempted me and I  succumbed. As I was under a vow of taking no milk or milk products,  she had specially prepared for me a sweet wheaten porridge with oil  added to it instead of ghi. She had reserved too a bowlful of mung for me. I was fond of these things, and I readily took them,  hoping that without coming to grief I should eat just enough to  please Kasturbai and to satisfy my palate. But the devil had been  only waiting for an opportunity. Instead of eating very little I had  my fill of the meal. This was sufficient invitation to the angel of  death. Within an hour the dysentery appeared in acute form.  The same evening I had to go back to Nadiad. I walked with very  great difficulty to the Sabarmati station, a distance of only ten  furlongs. Sjt. Vallabhbhai, who joined me at Ahmedabad, saw that I  was unwell, but I did not allow him to guess how unbearable the pain  was.  We reached Nadiad at about ten o'clock. The Hindu Anathashram where  we had our headquarters was only half a mile from the station; but  it was as good as ten for me. I somehow managed to reach the  quarters, but the griping pain was steadily increasing. Instead of  using the usual latrine which was a long way off, I asked for a  commode to be placed in the adjoining room. I was ashamed to have to  ask for this, but there was no escape. Sjt. Fulchand immediately  procured a commode. All the friends surrounded me deeply concerned.  They were all love and attention, but they could not relieve my  pain. And my obstinacy added to their helplessness. I refused all  medical aid. I would take no medicine, but preferred to suffer the  penalty for my folly. So they looked on in helpless dismay. I must  have had thrity or forty motions in twenty-four hours. I fasted, not  taking even fruit juices in the beginning. The appetite had all  gone. I had thought all along that I had an iron frame, but I found  that my body had now become a lump of clay. It had lost all power of  resistance. Dr.Kanuga came and pleaded with me to take medicine. I  declined. He offered to give me an injection. I declined that too.  My ignorance about injections was in those days quite ridiculous. I  believed that an injection must be some kind of serum. Later I  discovered that the injection that the doctor suggested was a  vegetable substance, but the discovery was too late to be of use.  The motions still continued, leaving me completely exhausted. The  exhaustion brought on a delirious fever. The friends got more  nervous, and called in more doctors. But what could they do with a  patient who would not listen to them?  Sheth Ambalal with his good wife came down to Nadiad, conferred with  my co-workers and removed me with the greatest care to his Mirzapur  bungalow in Ahmedabad. It was impossible for anyone to receive more  loving and selfless service than I had the privilege of having  during this illness. But a sort of low fever persisted, wearing away  my body from day to day. I felt that the illness was bound to be  prolonged and possibly fatal. Surrounded as I was with all the love  and attention that could be showered on me under Sheth Ambalal's  roof, I began to get restless and urged him to remove me to the  Ashram. He had to yield to my importunity.  Whilst I was thus tossing on the bed of pain in the Ashram, Sjt.  Vallabhbhai brought the news that Germany had been completely  defeated, and that the Commissioner had sent word that recruiting  was no longer necessary. The news that I had no longer to worry  myself about recruiting came as a very great relief.  I had now been trying hydropathy which gave some relief, but it was  a hard job to build up the body. The many medical advisers  overwhelmed me with advice, but I could not persuade myself to take  anything. Two or three suggested meat broth as a way out of the milk  vow, and cited authorities from Ayurveda in support of their advice.  One of them strongly recommended eggs. But for all of them I had but  one answer â€“ no.  For me the question of diet was not one to be determined on the  authority of the Shastras. It was one interwoven with my course of  life which is guided by principles no longer depending upon outside  authority. I had no desire to live at the cost of them. How could I  relinquish a principle in respect of myself, when I had enforced it  relentlessly in respect of my wife, children and friends? This protracted and first long illness in my life thus afforded me a  unique opportunity to examine my principles and to test them. One  night I gave myself up to despair. I felt that I was at death's  door. I sent word to Anasuyabehn. She ran down to the Ashram.  Vallabhbhai came up with Dr. Kanuga, who felt my pulse and said  'Your pulse is quite good. I see absolutely no danger. This is a  nervous breakdown due to extreme weakness.' But I was far from being  reassured. I passed the night without sleep.  The morning broke without death coming. But I could not get rid of  the feeling that the end was near, and so I began to devote all my  waking hours to listening to the Gita being read to me by the  inmates of the Ashram. I was incapable of reading. I was hardly  inclined to talk. The slightest talk meant a strain on the brain.  All interest in living had ceased, as I have never liked to live for  the sake of living. It was such an agony to live on in that helpless  state, doing nothing, receiving the service of friends and  co-workers, and watching the body slowly wearing away. Whilst I lay thus ever expectant of death, Dr. Talvalkar came one  day with a strange creature. He hailed from Maharashtra. He was not  known to fame, but the moment I saw him I found that he was a crank  like myself. He had come to try his treatment on me. He had almost  finished his course of studies in the Grant Medical College without  taking the degree. Later I came to know that he was a member of the  Brahmo Samaj. Sjt. Kelkar, for that is his name, is a man of an  independent and obstinate temperament. He swears by the ice  treatment, which he wanted to try on me. We gave him the name of  'Ice Doctor'. He is quite confident that he has discovered certain  things which have escaped qualified doctors. It is a pity both for  him and me that he has not been able to infect me with his faith in  his system. I believe in his system up to a certain point, but I am  afraid he has been hasty in arriving at certain conclusions. But whatever may be the merits of his discoveries, I allowed him to  experiment on my body. I did not mind external treatment. The  treatment consisted in the application of ice all over the body.  Whilst I am unable to endorse his claim about the effect his  treatment had on me, it certainly infused in me a new hope and a new  energy, and the mind naturally reacted on the body. I began to have  an appetite, and to have a gentle walk for five to ten minutes. He  now suggested a reform in my diet. Said he: 'I assure you that you  will have more energy and regain your strength quicker if you take  raw eggs. Eggs are as harmless as milk. They certainly cannot come  under the category of meat. And do you know that all eggs are not  fertilized? There are sterilized eggs on the markket.' I was not  however, prepared to take even the sterilized eggs. But the  improvement was enough to give me interest in public activities.
