Friends and doctors assured me that I should recuperate quicker by a change  to Matheran, so I went there. But the water at Matheran being very  hard, it made my stay there extremely difficult. As a result of the  attack of the dysentery that I had, my anal tract had become  extremely tender, and owing to fissures, I felt an excruciating pain  at the time of evacuation, so that the very idea of eating filled me  with dread. Before the week was over, I had to flee from Matheran.  Shankarlal Banker now constituted himself the guardian of my health,  and pressed me to consult Dr. Dalal. Dr. Dalal was called  accordingly. His capacity for taking instantaneous decisions  captured me.  He said: 'I cannot rebuild your body unless you take milk. If in  addition you would take iron and arsenic injections, I would  guarantee fully to renovate your constitution.'  'You can give me the injections,' I replied, 'but milk is a  different question; I have a vow against it.'  'What exactly is the nature of your vow?' the doctor inquired.  I told him the whole history and the reasons behind my vow, how,  since I had come to know that the cow and the buffalo were subjected  to the process of phooka, I had conceived a strong disgust for  milk. Moreover, I had always held that milk is not the natural diet  of man. I had therefore abjured its use altogether. Kasturbai was  standing near my bed listening all the time to this conversation.   'But surely you cannot have any objection to goat's milk then,' she  interposed.  The doctor too took up the strain. 'If you will take goat's milk, it  will be enough for me,' he said.  I succumbed. My intense eagerness to take up the Satyagraha fight  had created in me a strong desire to live, and so I contented myself  with adhering to the letter of my vow only, and sacrificed its  spirit. For although I had only the milk of the cow and the she  buffalo in mind when I took the vow, by natural implication it  covered the milk of all animals. Nor could it be right for me to use  milk at all, so long as I held that milk is not the natural diet of  man. Yet knowing all this I agreed to take goat's milk. The will to  live proved stronger than the devotion to truth, and for once the  votary of truth compromised his sacred ideal by his eagerness to  take up the Satyagraha fight. The memory of this action even now  rankles in my breast and fills me with remorse, and I am constantly  thinking how to give up goat's milk. But I cannot yet free myself  from that subtlest of temptations, the desire to serve, which still  holds me.  My experience in dietetics are dear to me as a part of my researches  in Ahimsa. They give me recreation and joy. But my use of goat's  milk today troubles me not from the view-point of dietetic Ahimsa so  much as from that of truth, being no less than a breach of pledge.  It seems to me that I understand the ideal of truth better than that  of a Ahimsa, and my experience tells me that, if I let go my hold of  truth, I shall never be able to solve the riddle of Ahimsa. The  ideal of truth requires that vows taken should be fulfilled in the  spirit as well as in the letter. In the present case I killed the  spirit – the soul of my vow – by adhering to its outer form only, and  that is what galls me. But in spite of this clear knowledge I cannot  see my way straight before me. In other words, perhaps, I have not  the courage to follow the straight course. Both at bottom mean one  and the same thing, for doubt is invariably the result of want or  weakness of faith. 'Lord, give me faith' is, therefore, my prayer  day and night.  Soon after I began taking goat's milk, Dr. Dalal performed on me a  successful operation for fissures. As I recuperated, my desire to  live revived, especially because God had kept work in store for me. I had hardly begun to feel my way towards recovery, when I happened  casually to read in the papers the Rowlatt Committee's report which  had just been published. Its recommendations startled me. Shankarlal  Banker and Umar Sobani approached me with the suggestion that I  should take some prompt action in the matter. In about a month I  went to Ahmedabad. I mentioned my apprehensions to Vallabhbhai, who  used to come to see me almost daily. 'Something must be done,' said  I to him. 'But what can we do in the circumstances?' he asked in  reply. I answered, 'If even a handful of men can be found to sign  the pledge of resistance, and the proposed measure is passed into  law in defiance of it, we ought to offer Satyagraha at once. If I  was not laid up like this, I should give battle against it all  alone, and expect others to follow suit. But in my present helpless  condition I feel myself to be altogether unequal to the task.' As a result of this talk, it was decided to call a small meeting of  such persons as were in touch with me. The recommendations of the  Rowlatt Committee seemed to me to be altogether unwarranted by the  evidence published in its report, and were, I felt, such that no  self-respecting people could submit to them.  The proposed conference was at last held at the Ashram. Hardly a  score of persons had been invited to it. So far as I remember, among  those who attended were, besides Vallabhbhai, Shrimati Sarojini  Naidu, Mr. Horniman, the late Mr. Umar Sobani, Sjt. Shankarlal  Banker and Shrimati Anasuyabehn. The Satyagraha pledge was drafted  at this meeting, and, as far as I recollect, was signed by all  present. I was not editing any journal at that time, but I used  occasionally to ventilate my views through the daily press. I  followed the practice on this occasion. Shankarlal Banker took up  the agitation in right earnest, and for the first time I got an idea  of his wonderful capacity for organization and sustained work. As all hope of any of the existing institutions adopting a novel  weapon like Satyagraha seemed to me to be in vain, a separate body  called the Satyagraha Sabha was established at my instance. Its  principal members were drawn from Bombay where, therefore, its  headquarters were fixed. The intending covenanters began to sign the  Satyagraha pledge in large numbers, bulletins were issued, and  popular meetings began to be held everywhere recalling all the  familiar features of the Kheda campaign.  I became the president of the Satyagraha Sabha. I soon found that  there was not likely to be much chance of agreement between myself  and the intelligentsia composing this Sabha. My insistence on the  use of Gujarati in the Sabha, as also some of my other methods of  work that would appear to be peculiar, caused them no small worry  and embarrassment. I must say to their credit, however, that most of  them generously put up with my idiosyncrasies.  But from the very beginning it seemed clear to me that the Sabha was  not likely to live long. I could see that already my emphasis on  truth and Ahimsa had begun to be disliked by some of its members.  Nevertheless in its early stages our new activity went on at full  blast, and the movement gathered head rapidly.
