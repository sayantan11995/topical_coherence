So I went to the Commissioner Mr. Griffith's office. All about the  staircase leading to the office I saw soldiers armed from top to  toe, as though for military action. The verandah was all astir. When  I was admitted to the office, I saw Mr. Bowring sitting with Mr. Griffith. I described to the Commissioner the scenes I had witnessed. He  replied briefly: 'I did not want the procession to proceed to the  Fort, as a disturbance was inevitable there. And as I saw that the  people would not listen to persuasion, I could not help ordering the  mounted police to charge through the crowd.'  'But', said I, 'you knew what the consequences must be. The horses  were bound to trample on the people. I think it was quite  unnecessary to send that contingent of mounted men.'  'You cannot judge that,' said Mr. Griffith. 'We police officers know  better than you the effect of your teaching on the people. If we did  not start with drastic measures, the situation would pass out of our  hands. I tell you that the people are sure to go out of your  control. Disobedience of law will quickly appeal to them; it is  beyond them to understand the duty of keeping peaceful. I have no  doubt about your intentions, but the people will not understand  them. They will follow their natural instinct.'  'It is there that I join issue with you,' I replied. 'The people are  not by nature violent but peaceful.'  And thus we argued at length. Ultimately Mr. Griffith said, 'But  suppose you were convinced that your teaching had been lost on the  people, what would you do?'  'I should suspend civil disobedience if I were so convinced.'  'What do you mean? You told Mr. Bowring that you would proceed to  the Punjab the moment you were released.'  'Yes, I wanted to do so by the next available train. But it is out  of the question today.'  'If you will be patient, the conviction is sure to grow on you. Do  you know what is happening in Ahmedabad? And what has happened in  Amritsar? People have everywhere gone nearly mad. I am not yet in  possession of all the facts. The telegraph wires have been cut in  some places. I put it to you that the responsibility for all these  disturbances lies on you.'  'I assure you I should readily take it upon myself wherever I  discovered it. But I should be deeply pained and surprised, if I  found that there were disturbances in Ahmedabad. I cannot answer for  Amritsar. I have never been there, no one knows me there. But even  about the Punjab I am certain of this much that, had not the Punjab  Government prevented my entry into the Punjab, I should have been  considerably helpful in keeping the peace there. By preventing me  they gave the people unnecessary provocation.'  And so we argued on and on. It was impossible for us to agree. I  told him that I intended to address a meeting on Chowpati and to ask  the people to keep the peace, and took leave of him. The meeting was  held on the Chowpati sands. I spoke at length on the duty of  non-violence and on the limitations of Satyagraha, and said:  'Satyagraha is essentially a weapon of the truthful. A Satyagrahi is  pledged to non- violence, and, unless people observe it in thought,  word and deed, I cannot offer mass Satyagraha.'  Anasuyabehn, too, had received news of disturbances in Ahmedabad.  Some one had spread a rumour that she also had been arrested. The  mill-hands had gone mad over her rumoured arrest, struck work and  committed acts of violence, and a sergeant had been done to death.  I proceeded to Ahmedabad. I learnt that an attempt had been made to  pull up the rails near the Nadiad railway station, that a Government  officer had been murdered in Viramgam, and that Ahmedabad was under  martial law. The people were terror-stricken. They had indulged in  acts of violence and were being made to pay for them with interest.  A police officer was waiting at the station to escort me to Mr.  Pratt, the Commissioner. I found him in a state of rage. I spoke to  him gently, and expressed my regret for the disturbances. I  suggested that martial law was unnecessary, and declared my  readiness to co-operate in all efforts to restore peace. I asked for  permission to hold a public meeting on the grounds of the Sabarmati  Ashram. The proposal appealed to him, and the meeting was held, I  think, on Sunday, the 13th of April, and martial law was withdrawn  the same day or the day after. Addressing the meeting, I tried to  bring home to the people the sense of their wrong, declared a  penitential fast of three days for myself, appealed to the people to  go on a similar fast for a day, and suggested to those who had been  guilty of acts of violence to confess their guilt.  I saw my duty as clear as daylight. It was unbearable for me to find  that the labourers, amongst whom I had spent a good deal of my time,  whom I had served, and from whom I had expected better things, had  taken part in the riots, and I felt I was a sharer in their guilt.  Just as I suggested to the people to confess their guilt, I  suggested to the Government to condone the crimes. Neither accepted  my suggestion.  The late Sir Ramanbhai and other citizens of Ahmedabad came to me  with an appeal to suspend Satyagraha. The appeal was needless, for I  had already made up my mind to suspend Satyagraha so long as people  had not learnt the lesson of peace. The friends went away happy.  There were, however, others who were unhappy over the decision. They  felt that, if I expected peace everywhere and regarded it as a  condition precedent to launching Satyagraha, mass Satyagraha would  be an impossibility. I was sorry to disagree with them. If those  amongst whom I worked, and whom I expected to be prepared for  non-violence and self-suffering, could not be non-violent,  Satyagraha was certainly impossible. I was firmly of opinion that  those who wanted to lead the people to Satyagraha ought to be able  to keep the people within the limited non-violence expected of them.  I hold the same opinion even today.
