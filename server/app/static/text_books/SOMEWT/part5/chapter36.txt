We must now leave, for the time being, these dark happenings in the Punjab.  The Congress inquiry into Dyerism in the Punjab had just commenced,  when I received a letter of invitation to be present at a joint  conference of Hindus and Musalmans that was to meet at Delhi to  deliberate on the Khilafat question. Among the signatories to it  were the late Hakim Ajmal Khan Saheb and Mr. Asaf Ali. The late  Swami Shraddhanandji, it was stated, would be attending and, if I  remember aright, he was to be the vice-president of the conference,  which, so far as I can recollect, was to be held in the November of  that year. The Conference was to deliberate on the situation arising  out of the Khilafat betrayal, and on the question as to whether the  Hindus and Musalmans should take any part in the peace celebrations.  The letter of invitation went on to say, among other things, that  not only the Khilafat question but the question of cow protection as  well would be discussed at the conference, and it would, therefore,  afford a golden opportunity for a settlement of the cow question. I did  not like this reference to the cow question. In my letter in reply  to the invitation, therefore, whilst promising to do my best to  attend, I suggested that the two questions should not be mixed up  together or considered in the spirit of a bargain, but should be  decided on their own merits and treated separately.  With these thoughts filling my mind, I went to the conference. It  was a very well attended gathering, though it did not present the  spectacle of later gatherings that were attended by tens of  thousands. I discussed the question referred to above with the late  Swami Shraddhanandji, who was present at the conference. He  appreciated my argument and left it to me to place it before the  conference. I likewise discussed it with the late Hakim Saheb.  Before the conference I contended that, if the Khilafat question had  a just and legitimate basis, as I believe it had, and if the  Government had really committed a gross injustice, the Hindus were  bound to stand by the Musalmans in their demand for the redress of  the Khilafat wrong. It would ill become them to bring in the cow  question in this connection, or to use the occasion to make terms  with the Musalmans, just as it would ill become the Musalmans to  offer to stop cow slaughter as a price for the Hindus' support on  the Khilafat question. But it would be another matter and quite  graceful, and reflect great credit on them, if the Musalmans of  their own free will stopped cow slaughter out of regard for the  religious sentiments of the Hindus, and from a sense of duty towards  them as neighbours and children of the same soil. To take up such an  independent attitude was, I contended, their duty, and would enhance  the dignity of their conduct. But if the Musalmans considered it as  their neighbourly duty to stop cow slaughter, they should do so  regardless of whether the Hindus helped them in the Khilafat or not.  'That being so,' I argued, 'the two questions should be discussed  independently of each other, and the deliberations of the conference  should be confined to the question of the Khilafat only.' My  argument appealed to those present and, as a result, the question of  cow protection was not discussed at this conference.  But in spite of my warning Maulana Abdul Bari Saheb said: 'No matter  whether the Hindus help us or not, the Musalmans ought, as the  countrymen of the Hindus, out of regard for the latter's  susceptibilities, to give up cow slaughter.' And at one time it  almost looked as if they would really put an end to it. There was a suggestion from some quarters that the Punjab question  should be tacked on to that of the Khilafat wrong. I opposed the  proposal. The Punjab question, I said, was a local affair and could  not therefore weigh with us in our decision to participate or not in  the peace celebrations. If we mixed up the local question with the  Khilafat question, which arose directly out of the peace terms, we  should be guilty of a serious indiscretion. My argument easily  carried conviction.  Maulana Hasrat Mohani was present in this meeting. I had known him  even before, but it was only here that I discovered what a fighter  he was. We differed from each other almost from the very beginning,  and in several matters the differences have persisted. Among the numerous resolutions that were passed at this conference,  one called upon both Hindus and Musalmans to take the Swadeshi vow,  and as a natural corollary to it, to boycott foreign goods. Khadi  had not as yet found its proper place. This was not a resolution  that Hasrat Saheb would accept. His object was to wreak vengeance on  the British Empire in case justice was denied in the matter of the  Khilafat. Accordingly, he brought in a counter proposal  for the boycott purely of British goods so far as practicable. I  opposed it on the score of principle, as also of practicability,  adducing for it those arguments that have now become pretty  familiar. I also put before the conference my view-point of  non-violence. I noticed that my arguments made a deep impression on  the audience. Before me, Hasrat Mohani's speech had been received  with such loud acclamations that I was afraid that mine would only  be a cry in the wilderness. I had made bold to speak only because I  felt it would be a dereliction of duty not to lay my views before  the conference. But, to my agreeable surprise, my speech was  followed with the closest attention by those present, and evoked a  full measure of support among those on the platform, and speaker  after speaker rose to deliver speeches in support of my views. The  leaders were able to see that not only would the boycott of British  goods fail of its purpose, but would, if adopted, make of them a  laughing stock. There was hardly a man present in that assembly but  had some article of British manufacture on his person. Many of the  audience therefore realized that nothing but harm could result from  adopting a resolution that even those who voted for it were unable  to carry out.  'Mere boycott of foreign cloth cannot satisfy us, for who knows long  it will be, before we shall be able to manufacture Swadeshi cloth in  sufficient quantity for our needs, and before we can bring about  effective boycott of foreign cloth? We want something that will  produce an immediate effect on the British. Let your boycott of  foreign cloth stand, we do not mind it, but give us something  quicker, and speedier in addition' – so spoke in effect Maulana  Hasrat Mohani. Even as I was listening to him, I felt that something  new, over and above boycott of foreign cloth, would be necessary. An  immediate boycott of foreign cloth seemed to me also to be a clear  impossibility at that time. I did not then know that we could, if we  liked, produce enough khadi for all our clothing requirements; this  was only a later discovery. On the other hand, I knew even then  that, if we depended on the mills alone for effecting the boycott of  foreign cloth, we should be betrayed. I was still in the middle of  this dilemma when the Maulana concluded his speech.  I was  handicapped for want of suitable Hindi or Urdu words. This was my  first occasion for delivering an argumentative speech before an  audience especially composed of Musalmans of the North. I had spoken  in Urdu at the Muslim League at Calcutta, but it was only for a few  minutes, and the speech was intended only to be a feeling appeal to  the audience. Here, on the contrary, I was faced with a critical, if  not hostile audience, to whom I had to explain and bring home my  viewpoint. But I had cast aside all shyness. I was not there to  deliver an address in the faultless, polished Urdu of the Delhi  Muslims, but to place before the gathering my views in such broken  Hindi as I could command. And in this I was successful. This meeting  afforded me a direct proof of the fact that Hindi-Urdu alone could  become the lingua franca of India. Had I spoken in English, I  could not have produced the impression that I did on the audience,  and the Maulana might not have felt called upon to deliver his  challenge. Nor, if he had delivered it, could I have taken it up  effectively.  I could not hit upon a suitable Hindi or Urdu word for the new idea,  and that put me out somewhat. At last I described it by the word  'non-co-operation,' an expression that I used for the first time at  this meeting. As the Maulana was delivering his speech, it seemed to  me that it was vain for him to talk about effective resistance to a  Government with which he was co-operating in more than one thing, if  resort to arms was impossible or undesirable. The only true  resistance to the Government, it therefore seemed to me, was to  cease to co-operate with it. Thus I arrived at the word  non-co-operation. I had not then a clear idea of all its manifold  implications. I therefore did not enter into details. I simply said:  'The Musalmans have adopted a very important resolution. If the  peace terms are unfavourable to them – which may God forbid  –  they will stop all co-operation with Government. It is an inalienable  right of the people thus to withhold co-operation. We are not bound  to retain Government titles and honours, or to continue in  Government service. If Government should betray us in a great cause  like the Khilafat, we could not do otherwise than non-co-operate. We  are therefore entitled to non-co-operate with Government in case of  a betrayal.'  But months elapsed before the word non-co-operation became current  coin. For the time being it was lost in the proceedings of the  conference. Indeed when I supported the co-operation resolution at  the Congress which met at Amritsar a month later, I did so in the  hope that the betrayal would never come.
