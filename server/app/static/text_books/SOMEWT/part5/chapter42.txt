I must not devote any more chapters here to a description of the  further progress of khadi. It would be outside the scope of these  chapters to give a history of my various activities after they came  before the public eye, and I must not attempt it, if only because to  do so would require a treatise on the subject. My object in writing  these chapters is simply to describe how certain things, as it were  spontaneously, presented themselves to me in the course of my  experiments with truth.  To resume, then, the story of the non-co-operation movement. Whilst  the powerful Khilafat agitation set up by the Ali Brothers was in  full progress, I had long discussions on the subject with the late  Maulana Abdul Bari and the other Ulema,  especially, with regard to the extent to which a Musalman could  observe the rule of non-violence. In the end they all agreed that  Islam did not forbid its followers from following non-violence as a  policy, and further, that, while they were pledged to that policy,  they were bound faithfully to carry it out. At last the  non-co-operation resolution was moved in the Khilafat conference,  and carried after prolonged deliberations. I have a vivid  recollection how once at Allahabad a committee sat all night  deliberating upon the subject. In the beginning the late Hakim Saheb  was sceptical as to the practicability of non-violent non-co-  operation. But after his scepticism was overcome he threw himself  into it heart and soul, and his help proved invaluable to the  movement.  Next, the non-co-operation resolution was moved by me at the Gujarat  political conference that was held shortly afterwards. The  preliminary contention raised by the opposition was that it was not  competent to a provincial conference to adopt a resolution in  advance of the Congress. As against this, I suggested that the  restriction could apply only to a backward movement; but as for  going forward, the subordinate organizations were not only fully  competent, but were in duty bound to do so, if they had in them the  necessary girt and confidence. No permission, I argued, was needed to  try to enhance the prestige of the parent institution, provided one  did it at one's own risk. The proposition was then discussed on its  merits, the debate being marked by its keenness no less than the  atmosphere of 'sweet reasonableness' in which it was conducted. On  the ballot being taken the resolution was declared carried by an  overwhelming majority. The successful passage of the resolution was  due not a little to the personality of Sjt. Vallabhbhai and Abbas  Tyabji. The latter was the president, and his leanings were all in  favour of the non-co-operation resolution.  The All-India Congress Committee resolved to hold a special session  of the Congress in September 1920 at Calcutta to deliberate on this  question. Preparations were made for it on a large scale. Lala Lajpat  Rai was elected President . Congress and Khilafat specials were run  to Calcutta from Bombay. At Calcutta there was a mammoth gathering  of delegates and visitors.  At the request of Maulana Shaukat Ali I prepared a draft of the non-  co-operation resolution in the train. Up to this time I had more or  less avoided the use of the word non-violent in my drafts. I  invariably made use of this word in my speeches. My vocabulary on  the subject was still in process of formation. I found that I could  not bring home my meaning to purely Moslem audiences with the help of the Samskrit equivalent for non-violent. I  therefore asked Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad to give me some other  equivalent for it. He suggested the word ba-aman;  similarly for non-co-operation he suggested the phrase tark-i-mavalat. Thus, while I was still busy devising suitable Hindi, Gujarati and  Urdu phraseology for non-co-operation, I was called upon to frame  the non-co-operation resolution for that eventful Congress. In the  original draft the word 'non-violent' had been left out by me. I had  handed over the draft to Maulana Shaukat Ali who was travelling in  the same compartment, without noticing the omission. During the  night I discovered the error. In the morning I sent Mahadev with the  message that the omission should be made good before the draft was  sent to the press. But I have an impression that the draft was  printed before the insertion could be made. The Subjects Committee  was to have met the same evening. I had therefore to make the necessary  correction in the printed copies of the draft. I afterwards saw that  there would have been great difficulty, had I not been ready with my  draft.  None the less my plight was pitiable indeed. I was absolutely at sea  as to who would support the resolution and who would oppose it. Nor  had I any idea as to the attitude that Lalaji would adopt. I only  saw an imposing phalanx of veteran warriors assembled for the fray  at Calcutta. Dr. Besant, Pandit Malaviyaji, Sjt. Vijayaraghavachari,  Pandit Motilalji and the Deshabandhu being some of them.  In my resolution non-co-operation was postulated only with a view to  obtaining redress of the Punjab and the Khilafat wrongs. That,  however, did not appeal to Sjt. Vijayaraghavachari. 'If non-co-operation was to be declared, why should it be with reference to  particular wrongs? The absence of Swaraj was the biggest wrong that  the country was labouring under; it should be against that that non-co-operation should be directed', he argued. Pandit  Motilalji also wanted the demand for Swaraj to be included in the  resolution. I readily accepted the suggestion and incorporated the  demand for Swaraj in my resolution, which was passed after an  exhaustive, serious and somewhat stormy discussion.  Motilalji was the first to join the movement. I still remember the  sweet discussion that I had with him on the resolution. He suggested  some changes in its phraseology which I adopted. He undertook to win  the Deshabandhu for the movement. The Deshbandhu's heart was  inclined towards it, but he felt sceptical as to the  capacity of the people to carry out the programme. It was only at  the Nagpur Congress that he and Lalaji accepted it whole heartedly.  I felt the loss of the late Lokamanya very deeply at the special  session. It has been my firm faith to this day that, had the  Lokamanya been then alive, he would have given his benedictions to  me on that occasion. But even if it had been otherwise, and he had  opposed the movement, I should still have esteemed his opposition as  a privilege and an education for myself. We had our differences of  opinion always, but they never led to bitterness. He always allowed  me to believe that the ties between us were of the closest. Even as  I write these lines, the circumstances of his death stand forth  vividly before my mind's eye. It was about the hour of midnight,  when Patwardhan, who was then working with me, conveyed over the  telephone the news of his death. I was at that time surrounded by my  companions. Spontaneously the exclamation escaped my lips, 'My  strongest bulwark is gone.' The non-co-operation movement was then  in full swing, and I was eagerly looking forward to encouragement  and inspiration from him. What his attitude would have been with  regard to the final phase of non-cooperation will always be a matter  of speculation, and an idle one at that. But this much is certain  â€“ that the deep void left by his death weighed heavily upon everyone  present at Calcutta. Everyone felt the absence of his counsels in  that hour of crisis in the nation's history.
