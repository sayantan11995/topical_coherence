The resolutions adopted at the Calcutta special session of the Congress  were to be confirmed at its annual session at Nagpur. Here again, as  at Calcutta there was a great rush of visitors and delegates. The  number of delegates in the Congress had not been limited yet. As a  result, so far as I can remember, the figure on this occasion  reached about fourteen thousand. Lalaji pressed for a slight  amendment to the clause about the boycott of schools, which I  accepted. Similarly some amendments were made at the instance of the  Deshabandhu, after which the non-co-operation resolution was passed  unanimously.  The resolution regarding the revision of the Congress constitution  too was to be taken up at this session of the Congress. The sub-committee's draft was presented at the Calcutta special session. The  matter had therefore been thoroughly ventilated and thrashed out. At  the Nagpur session, where it came up for final disposal, Sjt. C.  Vijayaraghavacharia was the President. The Subjects Committee  passed the draft with only one important change. In my draft the  number of delegates had been fixed, I think, at 1,500; the Subjects  Committee substituted in its place the figure 6,000. In my opinion  this increase was the result of hasty judgment, and experience of  all these years has only confirmed me in my view. I hold it to be an  utter delusion to believe that a large number of delegates is in any  way a help to the better conduct of the business, or that it  safeguards the principle of democracy. Fifteen hundred delegates,  jealous of the interests of the people, broad-minded and truthful,  would any day be a better safeguard for democracy than six thousand  irresponsible men chosen anyhow. To safeguard democracy the people  must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect and their  oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives  only such persons as are good and true. But obsessed with the idea  of numbers as the Subjects Committee was, it would have liked to go  even beyond the figure of six thousand. The limit of six thousand  was therefore in the nature of a compromise.  The question of the goal of the Congress formed a subject for keen  discussion. In the constitution that I had presented, the goal of  the Congress was the attainment of Swaraj within the British Empire if possible and without if necessary. A party in the Congress wanted  to limit the goal to Swaraj within the British Empire only. Its  viewpoint was put forth by Pandit Malaviyaji and Mr. Jinnah. But  they were not able to get many votes. Again the draft constitution  provided that the means for the attainment were to be peaceful and  legitimate. This condition too came in for opposition, it being  contended that there should be no restriction upon the means to be  adopted. But the Congress adopted the original draft after an  instructive and frank discussion. I am of opinion that, if this  constitution had been worked out by the people honestly,  intelligently and zealously, it would have become a potent  instrument of mass education, and the very process of working it out  would have brought us Swaraj. But a discussion of the theme would be  irrelevant here.  Resolutions about Hindu-Muslim unity, the removal of untouchability  and khadi too were passed in this Congress, and since then the Hindu  members of the Congress have taken upon themselves the  responsibility of ridding Hinduism of the curse of untouchability,  and the Congress has established a living bond of relationship with  the 'skeletons' of India through khadi. The adoption of  non-co-operation for the sake of the Khilafat was itself a great  practical attempt made by the Congress to bring about Hindu-Muslim  unity.
