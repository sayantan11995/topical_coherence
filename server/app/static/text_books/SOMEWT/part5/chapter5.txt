At Burdwan we came face to face with the hardships that a third class  passenger has to go through even in securing his ticket. 'Third class  tickets are not booked so early,' we were told. I went to the  Station Master, though that too was a difficult business. Someone  kindly directed me to where he was, and I represented to him our  difficulty. He also made the same reply. As soon as the booking  window opened, I went to purchase the tickets. But it was no easy  thing to get them. Might was right, and passengers, who were forward  and indifferent to others, coming one after another, continued to  push me out. I was therefore about the last of the first crowd to  get a ticket.  The train arrived, and getting into it was another trial. There was  a free exchange of abuse and pushes between passengers already in  the train and those trying to get in. We ran up and down the  platform, but were everywhere met with the same reply: 'No room  here.' I went to the guard. He said, 'You must try to get in where  you can or take the next train.'  'But I have urgent business,' I respectfully replied. He had no time  to listen to me. I was disconcerted. I told Maganlal to get in  wherever possible, and I got into an inter-class compartment with my  wife. The guard saw us getting in. At Asansol station he came to  charge us excess fares. I said to him:  'It was your duty to find us room. We could not get any, and so we  are sitting here. If you can accommodate us in a third class  compartment, we shall be only too glad to go there.'  'You may not argue with me,' said the guard. 'I cannot accommodate  you. You must pay the excess fare, or get out.'  I wanted to reach Poona somehow. I was not therefore prepared to  fight the guard, so I paid the excess fare he demanded, i.e., up to  Poona. But I resented the injustice.  In the morning we reached Mogalsarai. Maganlal had managed to get a  seat in the third class, to which I now shifted.Â  I acquainted  the ticket examiner with all the facts, and asked him to give me a  certificate to the effect that I had shifted to a third class  compartment at Mogalsarai. This he declined to do. I applied to the  railway authorities for redress, and got a reply to this effect: 'It  is not our practice to refund excess fares without the production of  a certificate, but we make an exception in your case. It is not  possible, however, to refund the excess fare from Burdwan to  Mogalsarai.'  Since this I have had experiences of third class travelling which,  if I wrote them all down, would easily fill a volume. But I can only  touch on them causally in these chapters. It has been and always  will be my profound regret that physical incapacity should have  compelled me to give up third class travelling.  The woes of third class passengers are undoubtedly due to the high-handedness  of railway authorities. But the rudeness, dirty habits,  selfishness and ignorance of the passengers themselves are no less  to blame. The pity is that they often do not realize that they are  behaving ill, dirtily or selfishly. They believe that everything  they do is in the natural way. All this may be traced to the  indifference towards them of us 'educated' people.  We reached Kalyan dead tried. Maganlal and I got some water from the  station water-pipe and had our bath. As I was proceeding to arrange  for my wife's bath, Sjt. Kaul of the Servants of India Society  recognizing us came up. He too was going to Poona. He offered to  take my wife to the second class bath room. I hesitated to accept  the courteous offer. I knew that my wife had no right to avail  herself of the second class bathroom, But I ultimately connived at  the impropriety. This, I know, does not become a votary of truth.  Not that my wife was eager to use the bath room, but a husband's  partiality for his wife got the better of his partiality for Truth.  The face of truth is hidden behind the golden veil of maya, says  the Upanishad.
