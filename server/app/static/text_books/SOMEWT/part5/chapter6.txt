On arrival in Poona, we found ourselves, after the performance of the shradha ceremonies, discussing the future of the Society, and the question  as to whether I should join it or not. This question of membership  proved a very delicate matter for me to handle. Whilst Gokhale was  there I did not have to seek admission as a member. I had simply to  obey his wish, a position I loved to be in. Launching on the stormy  sea of Indian public life, I was in need of a sure pilot. I had one  in Gokhale and had felt secure in his keeping. Now that he was gone,  I was thrown on my own resources, and I felt that it was my duty to  seek admission. That, I thought, would please Gokhale's spirit. So,  without hesitation and with firmness, I began the wooing. Most of the members of the Society were in Poona at this juncture. I  set about pleading with them and tried to dispel their fears about  me. But I saw that they were divided. One section favoured my  admission, the other was strongly against it. I knew that neither  yielded to the other in its affection for me, but possibly their  loyalty to the Society was greater, at any rate not less than their  love for me. All our discussions were therefore free from  bitterness, and strictly confined to matters of principle. The  section that was opposed to me held that they and I were as the  poles asunder in various vital matters, and they felt my membership  was likely to imperil the very objects for which the Society was  founded. This naturally was more than they could bear.  We dispersed after prolonged discussions, the final decision being  postponed to a later date.  I was considerably agitated as I returned home. Was it right for me  to be admitted by a majority vote? Would it be consonant with my  loyalty to Gokhale? I saw clearly that, when there was such a sharp  division amongst the members of the Society over admitting me, by  far the best course for me was to withdraw my application for  admission and save those opposed to me from a delicate situation.  Therein I thought lay my loyalty to the Society and Gokhale. The  decision came to me in a flash, and immediately I wrote to Mr.  Shastri asking him not to have the adjourned meeting at all. Those  who had opposed my application fully appreciated the decision. It  saved them from an awkward position and bound us in closer bonds of  friendship. The withdrawal of my application made me truly a member  of the Society.  Experience now tells me that it was well that I did not formally  become a member, and that the opposition of those who had been  against me was justified. Experience has shown too that our views on  matters of principle were widely divergent. But the recognition of  the differences has meant no estrangement or bitterness between us.  We have remained as brothers, and the Society's Poona home has  It is true that I did not officially become a member of the Society,  but I have ever been a member in spirit. Spiritual relationship is  far more precious than physical. Physical relationship divorced from spiritual  is body without soul.
