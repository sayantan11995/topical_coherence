I next went to Rangoon to meet Dr. Mehta, and on my way I halted at  Calcutta. I was the guest of the late Babu Bhupendranath Basu.  Bengali hospitality reached its climax here. In those days I was a  strict fruitarian, so all the fruits and nuts available in Calcutta  were ordered for me. The ladies of the house kept awake all night  skinning various nuts. Every possible care was taken in dressing  fresh fruit in the Indian style. Numerous delicacies were prepared  for my companions, amongst whom was my son Ramdas. Much as I could  appreciate this affectionate hospitality, I could not bear the  thought of a whole household being occupied in entertaining two or  three guests. But as yet I saw no escape from such embarrassing  attentions.  On the boat going to Rangoon I was a deck passenger. If excess of  attention embarrassed us in Sjt. Basu's house, grossest inattention,  even to the elementary comforts of deck passengers, was our lot on  the boat. What was an apology for a bath room was unbearably dirty,  the latrines were stinking sinks. To use the latrine one had to wade  through urine and excreta or jump over them.  This was more than flesh and blood could bear. I approached the  Chief Officer without avail. If anything was lacking to complete the  picture of stink and filth, the passengers furnished it by their  thoughtless habits. They spat where they sat, dirtied the  surroundings with the leavings of their food, tobacco and betel  leaves. There was no end to the noise, and everyone tried to  monopolize as much room as possible. Their luggage took up more room  than they. We had thus two days of the severest trial.  On reaching Rangoon I wrote to the Agent of the Steamship Company,  acquainting him with all the facts. Thanks to this letter and to Dr.  Mehta's efforts in the matter, the return journey, though on deck was  less unbearable.  In Rangoon my fruitarian diet was again a source of additional  trouble to the host. But since Dr. Mehta's home was as good as my  own, I could control somewhat the lavishness of the menu. However,  as I had not set any limit to the number of articles I might eat,  the palate and the eyes refused to put an effective check on the  supply of varieties ordered. There were no regular hours for meals.  Personally I preferred having the last meal before night fall.  Nevertheless as a rule it could not be had before eight or nine. This year – 1915 – was the year of the Kumbha fair, which is held at  Hardvar once every 12 years. I was by no means eager to attend the  fair, but I was anxious to meet Mahatma Munshiramji who was in his  Gurukul. Gokhale's Society had sent a big volunteer corps for  service at the Kumbha. Pandit Hridayanath Kunzru was at the head,  and the late Dr. Dev was the medical officer. I was invited to send  the Phoenix party to assist them, and so Maganlal Gandhi had already  preceded me. On my return from Rangoon, I joined the band. The journey from Calcutta to Hardvar was particularly trying.  Sometimes the compartments had no lights. From Saharanpur we were  huddled into carriages for goods or cattle. These had no roofs, and  what with the blazing midday sun overhead and the scorching iron  floor beneath, we were all but roasted. The pangs of thirst, caused  by even such a journey as this, could not persuade orthodox Hindus  to take water, if it was 'Musalmani.' They waited until they could  get the 'Hindu' water. These very Hindus, let it be noted, do not so  much as hesitate or inquire when during illness the doctor  administers them wine or prescribes beef tea or a Musalman or  Christian compounder gives them water.  Our stay in Shantiniketan had  taught us that the scavenger's work would be our special function in  India. Now for the volunteers in Hardvar tents had been pitched in a dharmashala, and Dr. Dev had dug some pits to be used as latrines.  He had to depend on paid scavengers for looking after these. Here  was work for the Phoenix party. We offered to cover up the excreta  with earth and to see to their disposal, and Dr. Dev gladly accepted  our offer. The offer was naturally made by me, but it was Maganlal  Gandhi who had to execute it. My business was mostly to keep sitting  in the tent giving darshan and holding religious and other  discussions with numerous pilgrims who called on me. This left me  not a minute which I could call my own. I was followed even to the  bathing ghat by these darshan-seekers, nor did they leave me  alone whilst I was having my meals. Thus it was in Hardvar that I  realized what a deep impression my humble services in South Africa  had made throughout the whole of India.  But this was no enviable position to be in. I felt as though I was  between the devil and the deep sea. Where no one recognized me, I  had to put up with the hardships that fall to the lot of the  millions in this land, e.g., in railway travelling. Where I  was surrounded by people who had heard of me I was the victim of  their craze for darshan. Which of the two conditions was more pitiable,  I have often been at a loss to determine. This at least I know that  the darshanvalas' blind love has often made me angry, and more  often sore at heart. Whereas travelling, though often trying, has  been uplifting and has hardly ever roused me to anger.  I was in those days strong enough to roam about a lot, and was  fortunately not so known as not to be able to go in the streets  without creating much fuss. During these roamings I came to observe  more of the pilgrims' absent mindedness, hypocrisy and slovenliness,  than of their piety. The swarm of sadhus, who had descended there,  seemed to have been born to enjoy the good things of life. Here I saw a cow with five feet! I was astonished, but knowing men  soon disillusioned me. The poor five-footed cow was a sacrifice to  the greed of the wicked. I learnt that the fifth foot was nothing  else but a foot cut off from a live calf and grafted upon the  shoulder of the cow! The result of this double cruelty was exploited  to fleece the ignorant of their money. There was no Hindu but would  be attracted by a five-footed cow, and no Hindu but would lavish his  charity on such a miraculous cow.  The day of the fair was now upon us. It proved a red letter day for  me. I had not gone to Hardvar with the sentiments of a pilgrim. I  have never thought of frequenting places of pilgrimage in search of  piety. But the seventeen lakhs of men that were reported to be there  could not all be hypocrites or mere sight-seers. I had no doubt that  countless people amongst them had gone there to earn merit and for  self-purification. It is difficult, if not impossible, to say to  what extent this kind of faith uplifts the soul.  I therefore passed the whole night immersed in deep thought. There  were those pious souls in the midst of the hypocrisy that surrounded  them. They would be free of guilt before their Maker. If the visit  to Hardvar was in itself a sin, I must publicly protest against it,  and leave Hardvar on the day Kumbha. If the pilgrimage to Hardvar  and to the Kumbha fair was not sinful, I must impose some act of  self-denial on myself in atonement for the iniquity prevailing there  and purify myself. This was quite natural for me. My life is based  on disciplinary resolutions. I thought of the unnecessary trouble I  had caused to my hosts at Calcutta and Rangoon, who had so lavishly  entertained me. I therefore decided to limit the articles of my  daily diet and to have my final meal before sunset. I was convinced  that, if I did not impose these restrictions on myself, I should put  my future hosts to considerable inconvenience and should engage them  in serving me rather than engage myself in service. So I pledged  myself never whilst in India to take more than five articles in  twenty-four hours, and never to eat after dark. I gave the fullest  thought to the difficulties I might have to face. But I wanted to  leave no loophole. I rehearsed to myself what would happen during an  illness, if I counted medicine among the five articles, and made no  exception in favour of special articles of diet. I finally decided  that there should be no exception on any account whatsoever. I have been under these vows for now thirteen years. They have  subjected me to a severe test, but I am able to testify that they  have also served as my shield. I am of opinion that they have added  a few years to my life and saved me from many an illness.
