NEW SALEM, Aug. 10, 1833
E. C. BLANKENSHIP.
Dear Sir: — In regard to the time David Rankin served
the enclosed discharge shows correctly — as well as I can
recollect — having no writing to refer. The transfer of
Rankin from my company occurred as follows: Rankin
having lost his horse at Dixon’s ferry and having
acquaintance in one of the foot companies who were going
down the river was desirous to go with them, and one
Galishen being an acquaintance of mine and belonging to
the company in which Rankin wished to go wished to leave
it and join mine, this being the case it was agreed that they
should exchange places and answer to each other’s names
— as it was expected we all would be discharged in very
few days. As to a blanket — I have no knowledge of Rankin
ever getting any. The above embraces all the facts now in
my recollection which are pertinent to the case.
I shall take pleasure in giving any further information in
my power should you call on me.
Your friend, A. LINCOLN.

TO Mr. SPEARS.
MR. SPEARS: At your request I send you a receipt for the
postage on your paper. I am somewhat surprised at your
request. I will, however, comply with it. The law requires
newspaper postage to be paid in advance, and now that I
have waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by
insinuating that unless you get a receipt I will probably
make you pay it again.
Respectfully, A. LINCOLN.
