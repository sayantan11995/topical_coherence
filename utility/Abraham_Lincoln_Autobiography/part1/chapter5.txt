SPRINGFIELD, April 1, 1838.
DEAR 
MADAM: 
— 
Without apologizing for being
egotistical, I shall make the history of so much of my life as
has elapsed since I saw you the subject of this letter. And,
by the way, I now discover that, in order to give a full and
intelligible account of the things I have done and suﬀered
since I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that
happened before.
It was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of
my acquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine,
being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives
residing in Kentucky, proposed to me that on her return she
would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that I
would engage to become her brother-in-law with all
convenient despatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal,
for you know I could not have done otherwise had I really
been averse to it; but privately, between you and me, I was
most confoundedly well pleased with the project. I had seen
the said sister some three years before, thought her
intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to
plodding life through hand in hand with her. Time passed
on; the lady took her journey and in due time returned,
sister in company, sure enough. This astonished me a little,
 for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed
that she was a triﬂe too willing, but on reﬂection it
occurred to me that she might have been prevailed on by
her married sister to come without anything concerning me
ever having been mentioned to her, and so I concluded that
if no other objection presented itself, I would consent to
waive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival
in the neighborhood — for, be it remembered, I had not yet
seen her, except about three years previous, as above
mentioned. In a few days we had an interview, and,
although I had seen her before, she did not look as my
imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but
she now appeared a fair match for Falstaﬀ. I knew she was
called an “old maid,” and I felt no doubt of the truth of at
least half of the appellation, but now, when I beheld her, I
could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother; and this,
not from withered features, — for her skin was too full of
fat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles, — but from
her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in general,
and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing
could have commenced at the size of infancy and reached
her present bulk in less than thirty-ﬁve or forty years; and
in short, I was not at all pleased with her. But what could I
do? I had told her sister that I would take her for better or
for worse, and I made a point of honor and conscience in all
things to stick to my word especially if others had been
induced to act on it which in this case I had no doubt they
had, for I was now fairly convinced that no other man on
 earth would have her, and hence the conclusion that they
were bent on holding me to my bargain.
“Well,” thought I, “I have said it, and, be the
consequences what they may, it shall not be my fault if I fail
to do it.” At once I determined to consider her my wife;
and, this done, all my powers of discovery were put to work
in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set oﬀ
against her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome,
which, but for her unfortunate corpulency, was actually
true. Exclusive of this no woman that I have ever seen has a
ﬁner face. I also tried to convince myself that the mind was
much more to be valued than the person; and in this she
was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had
been acquainted.
Shortly after this, without coming to any positive
understanding with her, I set out for Vandalia, when and
where you ﬁrst saw me. During my stay there I had letters
from her which did not change my opinion of either her
intellect or intention, but on the contrary conﬁrmed it in
both.
All this while, although I was ﬁxed, “ﬁrm as the surge-
repelling rock,” in my resolution, I found I was continually
repenting the rashness which had led me to make it.
Through life, I have been in no bondage, either real or
imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much desired to
be free. After my return home, I saw nothing to change my
opinions of her in any particular. She was the same, and so
was I. I now spent my time in planning how I might get
along through life after my contemplated change of
 circumstances should have taken place, and how I might
procrastinate the evil day for a time, which I really dreaded
as much, perhaps more, than an Irishman does the halter.
After all my suﬀering upon this deeply interesting
subject, here I am, wholly, unexpectedly, completely, out of
the “scrape”; and now I want to know if you can guess how
I got out of it —— out, clear, in every sense of the term; no
violation of word, honor, or conscience. I don’t believe you
can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the
lawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit:
After I had delayed the matter as long as I thought I could
in honor do (which, by the way, had brought me round into
the last fall), I concluded I might as well bring it to a
consummation without further delay; and so I mustered my
resolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but,
shocking to relate, she answered, No. At ﬁrst I supposed
she did it through an aﬀectation of modesty, which I
thought 
but 
ill 
became 
her 
under 
the 
peculiar
circumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the
charge, I found she repelled it with greater ﬁrmness than
before. I tried it again and again but with the same success,
or rather with the same want of success.
I ﬁnally was forced to give it up; at which I very
unexpectedly 
found 
myself 
mortiﬁed 
almost 
beyond
endurance. I was mortiﬁed, it seemed to me, in a hundred
diﬀerent ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the
reﬂection that I had been too stupid to discover her
intentions, and at the same time never doubting that I
understood them perfectly, and also that she, whom I had
 taught myself to believe nobody else would have, had
actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness. And, to
cap the whole, I then for the ﬁrst time began to suspect
that I was really a little in love with her. But let it all go. I’ll
try and outlive it. Others have been made fools of by the
girls, but this can never with truth be said of me. I most
emphatically in this instance, made a fool of myself. I have
now come to the conclusion never again to think of
marrying, and for this reason: I can never be satisﬁed with
any one who would be blockhead enough to have me.
When you receive this, write me a long yarn about
something to amuse me. Give my respects to Mr. Browning.
Your sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.
