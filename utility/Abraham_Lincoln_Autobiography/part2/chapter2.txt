SPRINGFIELD, May 21, 1844.
DEAR HARDIN: KNOWING that you have correspondents
enough, I have forborne to trouble you heretofore; and I
now only do so to get you to set a matter right which has
got wrong with one of our best friends. It is old Uncle
Thomas Campbell of Spring Creek — (Berlin P.O.). He has
received several documents from you, and he says they are
old newspapers and documents, having no sort of interest
in them. He is, therefore, getting a strong impression that
you treat him with disrespect. This, I know, is a mistaken
impression; and you must correct it. The way, I leave to
yourself. Rob’t W. Canﬁeld says he would like to have a
document or two from you.
The Locos (Democrats) here are in considerable trouble
about Van Buren’s letter on Texas, and the Virginia
electors. They are growing sick of the Tariﬀ question; and
consequently are much confounded at V.B.’s cutting them
oﬀ from the new Texas question. Nearly half the leaders
swear they won’t stand it. Of those are Ford, T. Campbell,
Ewing, Calhoun and others. They don’t exactly say they
won’t vote for V.B., but they say he will not be the
candidate, and that they are for Texas anyhow.
As ever yours, A. LINCOLN.
