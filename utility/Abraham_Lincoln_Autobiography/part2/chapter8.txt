PEKIN, MAY 12, 1853
MR. JOSHUA R. STANFORD.
SIR: — I hope the subject-matter of this letter will appear
a suﬀicient apology to you for the liberty I, a total stranger,
take in addressing you. The persons here holding two lots
under a conveyance made by you, as the attorney of Daniel
M. Baily, now nearly twenty-two years ago, are in great
danger of losing the lots, and very much, perhaps all, is to
depend on the testimony you give as to whether you did or
did not account to Baily for the proceeds received by you
on this sale of the lots. I, therefore, as one of the counsel,
beg of you to fully refresh your recollection by any means
in your power before the time you may be called on to
testify. If persons should come about you, and show a
disposition to pump you on the subject, it may be no more
than prudent to remember that it may be possible they
design to misrepresent you and embarrass the real
testimony you may ultimately give. It may be six months or
a year before you are called on to testify.
Respectfully, A. LINCOLN.
