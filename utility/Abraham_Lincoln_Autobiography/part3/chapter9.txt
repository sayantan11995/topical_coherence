CHICAGO, ILL., July 24, 1558.
HON. S. A. DOUGLAS: My dear Sir, â€” Will it be
agreeable to you to make an arrangement for you and
myself to divide time, and address the same audiences the
present canvass? Mr. Judd, who will hand you this, is
authorized to receive your answer; and, if agreeable to you,
to enter into the terms of such arrangement.
Your obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.
