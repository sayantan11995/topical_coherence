MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.
WASHINGTON, D.C., MAY 14, 1862.
TO SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
The third section of the “Act further to promote the
eﬀiciency of the Navy,” approved 21st of December, 1861,
provides:
“That the President of the United States by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, shall have the authority
to detail from the retired list of the navy for the command
of squadrons and single ships such oﬀicers as he may
believe that the good of the service requires to be thus
placed in command; and such oﬀicers may, if upon the
recommendation of the President of the United States they
shall receive a vote of thanks of Congress for their services
and gallantry in action against an enemy, be restored to the
active list, and not otherwise.”
In conformity with this law, Captain David G. Farragut
was nominated to the Senate for continuance as the ﬂag-
oﬀicer in command of the squadron which recently
rendered such important service to the Union by his
successful operations on the lower Mississippi and capture
of New Orleans.
 Believing that no occasion could arise which would more
fully correspond with the intention of the law or be more
pregnant with happy inﬂuence as an example, I cordially
recommend that Captain D. G. Farragut receive a vote of
thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed
in the capture since 21st December, 1861, of Forts Jackson
and St. Philip, city of New Orleans, and the destruction of
various rebel gunboats, rams, etc.....

the capture of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, city of New
Orleans, and the destruction of rebel gunboats, rams, etc.,
in April 1862. For their services and gallantry on those
occasions I cordially recommend that they should, by name,

MAJOR-GENERAL 
MCCLELLAN, 
CUMBERLAND,
Virginia: Your long despatch of yesterday is just received. I
will answer more fully soon. Will say now that all your
despatches to the Secretary of War have been promptly
shown to me. Have done and shall do all I could and can to
sustain you. Hoped that the opening of James River and
putting Wool and Burnside in communication, with an open
road to Richmond, or to you, had eﬀected something in that
direction. I am still unwilling to take all our force oﬀ the
direct line between Richmond and here.

SOLDIERS, OF THE TWELFTH INDIANA REGIMENT: 
IT HAS NOT been customary heretofore, nor will it be
hereafter, for me to say something to every regiment
passing in review. It occurs too frequently for me to have
speeches ready on all occasions. As you have paid such a
mark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I
should say a word or two in reply. Your colonel has thought
ﬁt, on his own account and in your name, to say that you
are satisﬁed with the manner in which I have performed my
part in the diﬀiculties which have surrounded the nation.
For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful, but on
the other hand I assure you that the nation is more
indebted to you, and such as you, than to me. It is upon the
brave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country
that our reliance has been placed in support of free
government and free institutions.
For the part which you and the brave army of which you
are a part have, under Providence, performed in this great
struggle, I tender more thanks especially to this regiment,
which has been the subject of good report. The thanks of
the nation will follow you, and may God’s blessing rest
upon you now and forever. I hope that upon your return to
 your homes you will ﬁnd your friends and loved ones well
and happy. I bid you farewell.

TO GENERAL McDOWELL, AND GENERAL MEIGS’S
INDORSEMENT THEREON.
MAY 17, 1862. You will retain the separate command of
the forces taken with you; but while co-operating with
General McClellan you will obey his orders, except that you
are to judge, and are not to allow your force to be disposed
otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this
capital which may be possible from that distance.
[Indorsement.]
TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR: The President having
shown this to me, I suggested that it is dangerous to direct
a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any
case, and that to give instructions to General McClellan to
this same end and furnish General McDowell with a copy
thereof would eﬀect the object desired by the President. He
desired me to say that the sketch of instructions to General
McClellan 
herewith 
he 
thought 
made 
this 
addition
unnecessary.

WASHINGTON, May 18, 1862.
GENERAL: YOUR DESPATCH to the President, asking
reinforcements, 
has 
been 
received 
and 
carefully
considered.
The President is not willing to uncover the capital
entirely; and it is believed that, even if this were prudent, it
would require more time to eﬀect a junction between your
army and that of the Rappahannock by the way of the
Potomac and York rivers than by a land march. In order,
therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon
Richmond at the earliest moment, General McDowell has
been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route.
He is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save
the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put
his left wing in communication with your right wing, and
you are instructed to co-operate so as to establish this
communication as soon as possible by extending your right-
wing to the north of Richmond.
It is believed that this communication can be safely
established either north or south of the Pamunkey River.
In any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of
the enemy’s forces from leaving Richmond and falling in
 overwhelming force upon General McDowell. He will move
with between thirty-ﬁve and forty thousand men.
A copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with
this. The speciﬁc task assigned to his command has been to
provide against any danger to the capital of the nation.
At your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent
forward to co-operate in the reduction of Richmond, but
charged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of
Washington; and you will give no order, either before or
after your junction, which can put him out of position to
cover this city. You and he will communicate with each
other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be
necessary 
for 
eﬀicient 
cooperation. 
When 
General
McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be
drawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staﬀ-
oﬀicers to be prepared to supply him by that route.
The President desires that General McDowell retain the
command of the Department of the Rappahannock and of
the forces with which he moves forward.
By order of the President: EDWIN M. STANTON,
Secretary of War.

MAY 19, 1862.
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA:
A Proclamation
Whereas there appears in the public prints what purports
to be a proclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words
and ﬁgures following, to wit:
(General 
Orders 
No. 
11) 
HEADQUARTERS
DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, HILTON HEAD, PORT
ROYAL, S. C., May 9, 1862.
“The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South
Carolina, comprising the military department of the South,
having deliberately declared themselves no longer under
the protection of the United States of America, and having
taken up arms against the said United States, it became a
military necessity to declare martial law. This was
accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862. Slavery
and martial law in a free country are altogether
incompatible. The persons in these three States: Georgia
Florida, and South Carolina — heretofore held as slaves are
therefore declared forever free.
 “By command of Major-General D. Hunter: “(Oﬀicial.)ED.
W. SMITH, “Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.”
And whereas the same is producing some excitement and
misunderstanding: therefore,
I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,
proclaim and declare that the Government of the United
States, had no knowledge, information, or belief of an
intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a
proclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that
the document is genuine. And further, that neither General
Hunter nor any other commander or person has been
authorized by the Government of the United States to make
a proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and
that the supposed proclamation now in question, whether
genuine or false, is altogether void so far as respects such a
declaration.
I further make known that whether it be competent for
me, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare
the slaves of any State or States free, and whether, at any
time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity
indispensable to the maintenance of the government to
exercise such supposed power, are questions which under
my responsibility I reserve to myself, and which I cannot
feel justiﬁed in leaving to the decision of commanders in
the ﬁeld.
These are totally diﬀerent questions from those of police
regulations in armies and camps.
On the sixth day of March last, by special message, I
recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint
 resolution, to be substantially as follows:
Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate
with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of
slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by
such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the
inconvenience, public and private, produced by such
change of system.
The resolution in the language above quoted was
adopted by large majorities in both branches of Congress,
and now stands an authentic, deﬁnite, and solemn proposal
of the nation to the States and people most immediately
interested in the subject-matter. To the people of those
States I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue — I beseech
you to make arguments for yourselves. You cannot, if you
would, be blind to the signs of the times. I beg of you a
calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may
be, far above personal and partisan politics. This proposal
makes common cause for a common object, casting no
reproaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change
it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven,
not rending or wrecking anything. Will you not embrace it?
So much good has not been done, by one eﬀort, in all past
time, as in the providence of God it is now your high
privilege to do. May the vast future not have to lament that
you have neglected it.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be aﬀixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of
May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
 and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United States
the eighty-sixth.

MAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN: Your long despatch of
yesterday just received. You will have just such control of
General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate.
McDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get
aboard of boats, if the boats were ready at Fredericksburg,
unless his march shall be resisted, in which case the force
resisting him will certainly not be confronting you at
Richmond. By land he can reach you in ﬁve days after
starting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two
weeks, judging by past experience. Franklin’s single
division did not reach you in ten days after I ordered it.

MAJOR-GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN: In consequence
of General Banks’s critical position, I have been compelled
to suspend General McDowell’s movements to join you. The
enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper’s Ferry,
and we are trying to throw General Fremont’s force and
part of General McDowell’s in their rear.

WASHINGTON May 24, 1862.
MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN: I left
General McDowell’s camp at dark last evening. Shields’s
command is there, but it is so worn that he cannot move
before Monday morning, the 26th. We have so thinned our
line to get troops for other places that it was broken
yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one
regiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General
Banks in some peril.
The enemy’s forces under General Anderson now
opposing General McDowell’s advance have as their line of
supply and retreat the road to Richmond.
If, in conjunction with McDowell’s movement against
Anderson, you could send a force from your right to cut oﬀ
the enemy’s supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad
bridges across the two forks of the Pamunkey, and intercept
the enemy’s retreat, you will prevent the army now
opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of
nearly 15,000 men; and if you succeed in saving the
bridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in
addition to the one you now have. Can you not do this
almost as well as not while you are building the
Chickahominy bridges? McDowell and Shields both say
 they can, and positively will, move Monday morning. I wish
you to move cautiously and safely.
You will have command of McDowell, after he joins you,
precisely as you indicated in your long despatch to us of the
21st.

each of our commanders along our line from Richmond to
Corinth supposes himself to be confronted by numbers
superior to his own. Under this pressure We thinned the
line on the upper Potomac, until yesterday it was broken
with heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril,
out of which he is not yet extricated, and may be actually
captured. We need men to repair this breach, and have
them not at hand. My dear General, I feel justiﬁed to rely
very much on you. I believe you and the brave oﬀicers and

TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL
WAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.
MAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Fredricksburg: General
Fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from
Franklin on Harrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and
capture or destroy Jackson’s and Ewell’s forces. You are
 instructed, laying aside for the present the movement on
Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the
Shenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of
the Manassas Gap railroad. Your object will be to capture
the forces of Jackson and Ewell, either in co-operation with
General Fremont, or, in case want of supplies or of
transportation, interferes with his movements, it is believed
that the force which you move will be suﬀicient to
accomplish this object alone. The information thus far
received here makes it probable that if the enemy operate
actively against General Banks, you will not be able to
count upon much assistance from him, but may even have
to release him. Reports received this moment are that
Banks is ﬁghting with Ewell eight miles from Winchester.

threatening Leesburg and Geary, on the Manassas Gap
railroad, from both north and south — in precisely what
force we cannot tell. I think the movement is a general and
concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon
the purpose of a very desperate defense of Richmond. I

Jackson, and Johnson are pouring through the gap they
made day before yesterday at Front Royal, making a dash
northward. It will be a very valuable and very honorable
service for General McDowell to cut them oﬀ. I hope he will

WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., May

MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN: Your despatch received.
General Banks was at Strasburg, with about 6,000 men,
Shields having been taken from him to swell a column for
McDowell to aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force
scattered at various places. On the 23d a rebel force of
7000 to 10,000 fell upon one regiment and two companies
guarding the bridge at Front Royal, destroying it entirely;
crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th (yesterday)
pushed to get north of Banks, on the road to Winchester.
Banks ran a race with them, beating them into Winchester
yesterday evening. This morning a battle ensued between
the two forces, in which Banks was beaten back into full
retreat toward Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into
a total rout. Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, just now
reports that Jackson is now near Front Royal, With 10,000,
following up and supporting, as I understand, the forces
now pursuing Banks, also that another force of 10,000 is
near Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped
here, as we are here, it will be all we can do to prevent
them crossing the Potomac at Harper’s Ferry or above. We
 have about 20,000 of McDowell’s force moving back to the
vicinity of Front Royal, and General Fremont, who was at
Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg; both these movements
intended to get in the enemy’s rear.
One more of McDowell’s brigades is ordered through
here to Harper’s Ferry; the rest of his force remains for the
present at Fredericksburg. We are sending such regiments
and dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare to
Harper’s Ferry, supplying their places in some sort by
calling in militia from the adjacent States. We also have
eighteen cannon on the road to Harper’s Ferry, of which
arm there is not a single one yet at that point. This is now
our situation.
If McDowell’s force was now beyond our reach, we
should be utterly helpless. Apprehension of something like
this, and no unwillingness to sustain you, has always been
my reason for withholding McDowell’s force from you.
Please understand this, and do the best you can with the
force you have.

MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.
MAY 16, 1862 TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES:
The insurrection which is yet existing in the United
States and aims at the overthrow of the Federal
Constitution and the Union, was clandestinely prepared
during the Winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open
organization in the form of a treasonable provisional
government at Montgomery, in Alabama on the 18th day of
February, 1861. On the 12th day of April, 1861, the
insurgents committed the ﬂagrant act of civil war by the
bombardment and the capture of Fort Sumter, Which cut
oﬀ the hope of immediate conciliation. Immediately
afterward all the roads and avenues to this city were
obstructed, and the capital was put into the condition of a
siege. The mails in every direction were stopped and the
lines of telegraph cut oﬀ by the insurgents, and military
and naval forces which had been called out by the
government for the defense of Washington were prevented
from reaching the city by organized and combined
treasonable resistance in the State of Maryland. There was
no adequate and eﬀective organization for the public
defense. Congress had indeﬁnitely adjourned. There was no
 time to convene them. It became necessary for me to
choose whether, using only the existing means, agencies,
and processes which Congress had provided, I should let
the government fall at once into ruin or whether, availing
myself of the broader powers conferred by the Constitution
in cases of insurrection, I would make an eﬀort to save it,
with all its blessings, for the present age and for posterity.
I thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the
heads of all the departments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th
day of April, 1861, at the oﬀice of the Navy Department,
and then and there, with their unanimous concurrence, I
directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to
sea to aﬀord protection to the commercial marine, and
especially the California treasure ships then on their way to
this coast. I also directed the commandant of the navy-yard
at Boston to purchase or charter and arm as quickly as
possible ﬁve steamships for purposes of public defense. I
directed the commandant of the navy-yard at Philadelphia
to purchase or charter and arm an equal number for the
same purpose. I directed the commandant at New York to
purchase or charter and arm an equal number. I directed
Commander Gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put
to sea two other vessels. Similar directions were given to
Commodore Dupont, with a view to the opening of passages
by water to and from the capital. I directed the several
oﬀicers to take the advice and obtain the aid and eﬀicient
services, in the matter, of his Excellency Edwin D. Morgan,
the Governor of New York, or in his absence George D.
Morgan, William M. Evarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H.
 Grinnell, who were by my directions especially empowered
by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his department in
that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops
and supplies for the public defense.
The several departments of the government at that time
contained so large a number of disloyal persons that it
would have been impossible to provide safely through
oﬀicial agents only for the performance of the duties thus
conﬁded to citizens favorably known for their ability,
loyalty, and patriotism.
The several orders issued upon these occurrences were
transmitted by private messengers, who pursued a
circuitous way to the seaboard cities, inland across the
States of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern lakes. I
believe by these and other similar measures taken in that
crisis, some of which were without any authority of law, the
government was saved from overthrow. I am not aware that
a dollar of the public funds thus conﬁded without authority
of law to unoﬀicial persons was either lost or wasted,
although apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to
me as objections to those extraordinary proceedings, and
were necessarily overruled.
I recall these transactions now because my attention has
been directed to a resolution which was passed by the
House of Representatives on the 30th day of last month,
which is in these words:
“Resolved, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War
by investing Alexander Cummings with the control of large
sums of the public money and authority to purchase
 military supplies without restriction, without requiring
from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his
duties, when the services of competent public oﬀicers were
available, and by involving the government in a vast
number of contracts with persons not legitimately engaged
in the business pertaining to the subject-matter of such
contracts, especially in the purchase of arms for future
delivery, has adopted a policy highly injurious to the public
service, and deserves the censure of the House.”
Congress will see that I should be wanting equally in
candor and in justice if I should leave the censure
expressed in this resolution to rest exclusively or chieﬂy
upon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is unanimously
entertained by the heads of department who participated in
the proceedings which the House of Representatives have
censured. It is due to Mr. Cameron to say that although he
fully approved the proceedings they were not moved nor
suggested by himself, and that not only the President, but
all the other heads of departments, were at least equally
responsible with him for whatever error, wrong, or fault
was committed in the premises.

McClellan at 6.30 P.M. yesterday telegraphed that Fitz-John
Porter’s division had fought and driven 13,000 of the
enemy, under General Branch, from Hanover Court-House,
and was driving them from a stand they had made on the
railroad at the time the messenger left. Two hours later he
telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six
cars on the Virginia Central, which he at once sent to
communicate with Porter. Nothing further from McClellan.
If Porter eﬀects a lodgment on both railroads near
Hanover Court-House, consider whether your forces in
front of Fredericksburg should not push through and join
him.

General F. J. Porter’s victory. Still, if it was a total rout of
the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and
Fredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say
you have all the railroads but the Richmond and
Fredericksburg. I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you
can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to West
Point. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to
Hanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing. That the
whole of the enemy is concentrating on Richmond, I think
cannot be certainly known to you or me. Saxton, at
Harper’s Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be
Jackson’s and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown
today. General King telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that
contrabands give certain information that 15,000 left
Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce Jackson. I

Quite certainly they were within it two days ago. Some part
of their forces attacked Harper’s Ferry at dark last evening,
and are still in sight this morning. Shields, with McDowell’s
advance, retook Front Royal at 11 A.M. yesterday, with a
dozen of our own prisoners taken there a week ago, 150 of
the enemy, two locomotives, and eleven cars, some other
property and stores, and saved the bridge.
General Fremont, from the direction of Mooreﬁeld,

WASHINGTON; June 13. 1862
MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT: We cannot aﬀord to keep
your force and Banks’s and McDowell’s engaged in keeping
Jackson south of Strasburg and Front Royal. You fought
Jackson alone and worsted him. He can have no substantial
reinforcements so long as a battle is pending at Richmond.
Surely you and Banks in supporting distance are capable of
keeping him from returning to Winchester. But if Sigel be
sent forward to you, and McDowell (as he must) be put to
other work, Jackson will break through at Front Royal
again. He is already on the right side of the Shenandoah to
do it, and on the wrong side of it to attack you. The orders
already sent you and Banks place you and him in the
proper positions for the work assigned you. Jackson cannot
move his whole force on either of you before the other can
learn of it and go to his assistance. He cannot divide his
force, sending part against each of you, because he will be
too weak for either. Please do as I directed in the order of
the 8th and my despatch of yesterday, the 12th, and neither
you nor Banks will be overwhelmed by Jackson. By proper
scout lookouts, and beacons of smoke by day and ﬁres by
night you can always have timely notice of the enemy’s
 approach. I know not as to you, but by some this has been
too much neglected.
A. LINCOLN. TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT
WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., June 15,
1862.
MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:
MY DEAR SIR: — Your letter of the 12th by Colonel
Zagonyi is just received. In answer to the principal part of
it, I repeat the substance of an order of the 8th and one or
two telegraphic despatches sent you since.
We have no deﬁnite power of sending reinforcements; so
that we are compelled rather to consider the proper
disposal of the forces we have than of those we could wish
to have. We may be able to send you some dribs by
degrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you alone
beat Jackson last Sunday, I argue that you are stronger
than he is to-day, unless he has been reinforced; and that
he cannot have been materially reinforced, because such
reinforcement could only have come from Richmond, and
he is much more likely to go to Richmond than Richmond is
to come to him. Neither is very likely. I think Jackson’s
game — his assigned work — now is to magnify the
accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements, and
thus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many
of our troops away from Richmond as his own force
amounts to. Thus he helps his friends at Richmond three or
four times as much as if he were there. Our game is not to
allow this. Accordingly, by the order of the 8th, I directed
you to halt at Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well
 in hand, the objects being to guard against Jackson’s
returning by the same route to the upper Potomac over
which you have just driven him out, and at the same time
give some protection against a raid into West Virginia.
Already I have given you discretion to occupy Mount
Jackson instead, if, on full consideration, you think best. I
do not believe Jackson will attack you, but certainly he
cannot attack you by surprise; and if he comes upon you in
superior force, you have but to notify us, fall back
cautiously, and Banks will join you in due time. But while
we know not whether Jackson will move at all, or by what
route, we cannot safely put you and Banks both on the
Strasburg line, and leave no force on the Front Royal line
— the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid. The
true policy is to place one of you on one line and the other
on the other in such positions that you can unite once you
actually ﬁnd Jackson moving upon it. And this is precisely
what we are doing. This protects that part of our frontier,
so to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the assistance
of McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling
to have it deranged. While you have only asked for Sigel, I
have spoken only of Banks, and this because Sigel’s force is
now the principal part of Bank’s force.
About transferring General Schenck’s commands, the
purchase of supplies, and the promotion and appointment
of oﬀicers, mentioned in your letter, I will consult with the
Secretary of War to-morrow.
Yours truly,
A. LINCOLN.

all the force I could, and that I hoped to make it reach
35,000. You at the same time told me that within a
reasonable time you would seize the railroad at or east of
Knoxville, Tenn., if you could. There was then in the
department a force supposed to be 25,000, the exact
number as well known to you as to me. After looking about
two or three days, you called and distinctly told me that if I
would add the Blenker division to the force already in the
department, you would undertake the job. The Blenker
division contained 10,000, and at the expense of great
dissatisfaction to General McClellan I took it from his army
and gave it to you. My promise was literally fulﬁlled. I have
 given you all I could, and I have given you very nearly, if
not quite, 35,000.
Now for yours. On the 23d of May, largely over two
months afterward, you were at Franklin, Va., not within 300
miles of Knoxville, nor within 80 miles of any part of the
railroad 
east 
of 
it, 
and 
not 
moving 
forward, 
but
telegraphing here that you could not move for lack of
everything. Now, do not misunderstand me. I do not say
you have not done all you could. I presume you met
unexpected diﬀiculties; and I beg you to believe that as
surely as you have done your best, so have I. I have not the
power now to ﬁll up your Corps to 35,000. I am not
demanding of you to do the work of 35,000. I am only
asking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive, get your
force in order, and give such protection as you can to the
valley of the Shenandoah and to western Virginia.
Have you received the orders, and will you act upon
them?

BRIGADIER-GENERAL 
SCHURZ, 
MOUNT 
Jackson,
Virginia: Your long letter is received. The information you
give is valuable. You say it is fortunate that Fremont did not
intercept Jackson; that Jackson had the superior force, and
would have overwhelmed him. If this is so, how happened it
that Fremont fairly fought and routed him on the 8th? Or is
the account that he did ﬁght and rout him false and
fabricated? Both General Fremont and you speak of
Jackson having beaten Shields. By our accounts he did not
beat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He did
meet and drive back with disaster about 2000 of Shields’s
advance till they were met by an additional brigade of
Shields’s, when Jackson himself turned and retreated.
Shields himself and more than half his force were not
nearer than twenty miles to any of it.

Yours

making it probable that Jackson has been reinforced by
about 10,000 from Richmond, is corroborated by a
despatch from General King at Fredericksburg, saying a
Frenchman, just arrived from Richmond by way of
Gordonsville, met 10,000 to 15,000 passing through the
latter place to join Jackson.
If this is true, it is as good as a reinforcement to you of
an equal force. I could better dispose of things if I could

MESSAGE TO THE SENATE.
WASHINGTON, JUNE 23, 1862.
TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES: On the 7th
day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the
project of a treaty between the United States and Mexico
which had been proposed to me by Mr. Corwin, our
minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the advice
of the Senate thereupon.
On the 25th day of February last a resolution was
adopted by the Senate to the eﬀect: “That it is not
advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the United
States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of
the debt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of
European powers.”
This resolution having been duly communicated to me,
notice thereof was immediately given by the Secretary of
State to Mr. Corwin, and he was informed that he was to
consider his instructions upon the subject referred to
modiﬁed by this resolution and would govern his course
accordingly. That despatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by
reason of the disturbed condition of Mexico, until a very
recent date, Mr. Corwin being without instructions, or thus
 practically left without instructions, to negotiate further
with Mexico.
In view of the very important events Occurring there, he
has thought that the interests of the United States would
be promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should
provide for a loan to that republic. He has therefore signed
such treaties, and they having been duly ratiﬁed by the
Government of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for
my consideration. The action of the Senate is of course
conclusive against an acceptance of the treaties On my
part. I have, nevertheless, thought it just to our excellent
minister in Mexico and respectful to the Government of
that republic to lay the treaties before the Senate, together
with the correspondence which has occurred in relation to
them. In performing this duty I have only to add that the
importance of the subject thus submitted to the Senate, can
not be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive and
consider with the highest respect any further advice the
Senate may think proper to give upon the subject.

MESSAGE TO THE SENATE, JUNE 23, 1862.
TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES: The bill
which has passed the House of Representatives and the
Senate, entitled “An act to repeal that part of an act of
Congress which prohibits the circulation of bank-notes of a
less denomination than ﬁve dollars in the District of
Columbia,” has received my attentive consideration, and I
now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the
following objections: 1. The bill proposes to repeal the
existing legislation prohibiting the circulation of bank-notes
of a less denomination than ﬁve dollars within the District
of Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by
banks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my
judgment, it will be found impracticable, in the present
condition of the currency, to make such a discrimination.
The banks have generally suspended specie payments, and
a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable
notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so
extended, in practical operation, as to include those of all
classes, whether authorized or unauthorized. If this view be
correct, the currency of the District, should this act become
a law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to the serious
injury of honest trade and honest labor.
 2. This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be
otherwise more certainly and beneﬁcially attained. During
the existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the National
Government to secure to the people a sound circulating
medium. This duty has been, under existing circumstances,
satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing the
issue of United States notes, receivable for all government
dues except customs, and made a legal tender for all debts,
public and private, except interest on public debt. The
object of the bill submitted to me — namely, that of
providing a small note currency during the present
suspension — can be fully accomplished by authorizing the
issue, as part of any new emission of United States notes
made necessary by the circumstances of the country, of
notes of a similar character, but of less denomination than
ﬁve dollars. Such an issue would answer all the beneﬁcial
purposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to
the treasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments
to soldiers and other creditors of small sums, and would
furnish; to the people a currency as safe as their own
government.
Entertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself
constrained to withhold from it my approval and return it
for the further consideration and action of Congress.

I can only say that my visit to West Point did not have the

matters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell
you all about them. Now, I can only remark that it had
nothing whatever to do with making or unmaking any
general in the country. The Secretary of War, you know,
holds a pretty tight rein on the press, so that they shall not

your being overwhelmed by two hundred thousand, and
talking of where the responsibility will belong, pains me

MAJOR-GENERAL 
HALLECK: 
The 
enemy 
have
concentrated in such force at Richmond as to render it
absolutely necessary, in the opinion of the President, for
you immediately to detach 25,000 of your force and
forward it by the nearest and quickest route by way of
Baltimore and Washington to Richmond. It is believed that
the quickest route would be by way of Columbus, Ky., and
up the Ohio River. But in detaching your force the
President directs that it be done in such a way as to enable
you to hold your ground and not interfere with the
movement against Chattanooga and East Tennessee. This
condition being observed, the forces to be detached and the
routes they are to be sent are left to your own judgment.
The direction to send these forces immediately is
rendered imperative by a serious reverse suﬀered by
General McClellan before Richmond yesterday, the full
extent of which is not yet known.
You will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, stating
the day and hour it is received, and inform me what your
action will be, so that we may take measures to aid in river

it is the price we pay for the enemy not being in

E ECUTIVE MANSION, June 28, 1862
HON. W. H. SEWARD.
MY DEAR SIR: — My view of the present condition of the
war is about as follows: The evacuation of Corinth and our
delay by the ﬂood in the Chickahominy have enabled the
enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond for
McClellan to successfully attack. In fact there soon will be
no substantial rebel force anywhere else. But if we send all
the force from here to McClellan, the enemy will, before we
can know of it, send a force from Richmond and take
Washington. Or if a large part of the western army be
brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond,
and retake Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc. What should
be done is to hold what we have in the West, open the
Mississippi, and take Chattanooga and East Tennessee
without more. A reasonable force should in every event be
kept about Washington for its protection. Then let the
country give us a hundred thousand new troops in the
shortest possible time, which, added to McClellan directly
or indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering any
other place which we now hold, and will substantially end
the war. I expect to maintain this contest until successful,
or till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, or
 Congress or the country forsake me; and I would publicly
appeal to the country for this new force were it not that I
fear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it
is to have a thing understood as it really is. I think the new
force should be all, or nearly all, infantry, principally
because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly.

HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Astor House, New York:
Not much more than when you left. Fulton of Baltimore
American is now with us. He left White House at 11 A.M.
yesterday. He conversed fully with a paymaster who was
with Porter’s force during the ﬁght of Friday and fell back
to nearer McClellan’s quarters just a little sooner than
Porter did, seeing the whole of it; stayed on the Richmond
side of the Chickahominy over night, and left for White
House at 5 A.M. Saturday. He says Porter retired in perfect
order under protection of the guns arranged for the
purpose, under orders and not from necessity; and with all
other of our forces, except what was left on purpose to go
to White House, was safely in pontoons over the
Chickahominy before morning, and that there was heavy
ﬁring on the Richmond side, begun at 5 and ceased at 7
A.M. Saturday. On the whole, I think we have had the
better of it up to that point of time. What has happened
since we still know not, as we have no communication with
General McClellan. A despatch from Colonel Ingalls shows
that he thinks McClellan is ﬁghting with the enemy at
Richmond to-day, and will be to-morrow. We have no means
of knowing upon what Colonel Ingalls founds his opinion.
 Conﬁrmed about saving all property. Not a single
unwounded straggler came back to White House from the
ﬁeld, and the number of wounded reaching there up to 11
A.M. Saturday was not large.
A. LINCOLN.
To what the President has above stated I will only add
one or two points that may be satisfactory for you to know.
First. All the sick and wounded were safely removed
Second. A despatch from Burnside shows that he is from
White House; not a man left behind in condition to aﬀord
eﬀicient support, and is probably doing so.
Third. The despatch from Colonel Ingalls impresses me
with the conviction that the movement was made by
General McClellan to concentrate on Richmond, and was
successful to the latest point of which we have any
information.
Fourth. Mr. Fulton says that on Friday night, between
twelve and one o’clock, General McClellan telegraphed
Commodore Goldsborough that the result of the movement
was satisfactory to him.
Fifth. From these and the facts stated by the President,
my inference is that General McClellan will probably be in
Richmond within two days.
EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.
[Unfortunately McClellan did not do any of the things he
was ordered, and that it was very likely possible to do. It is
still some mystery what he was doing all these days other
than hiding in the woods and staying out of communication
so he would not receive any more uncomfortable orders.
 This was another place where the North was close to
wining the war and did not. D.W.]

McClellan, and this absence of news is our point of anxiety.
Up to the latest point to which we are posted he eﬀected
everything in such exact accordance with his plan,
contingently announced to us before the battle began, that
we feel justiﬁed to hope that he has not failed since. He had
a severe engagement in getting the part of his army on this
side of the Chickahominy over to the other side, in which
the enemy lost certainly as much as we did. We are not
dissatisﬁed with this, only that the loss of enemies does not
compensate for the loss of friends. The enemy cannot come
below White House; certainly is not there now, and
probably has abandoned the whole line. Dix’s pickets are at
New Kent Court-House.

TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE SEVERAL STATES: 
THE CAPTURE OF New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by the
national forces has enabled the insurgents to concentrate a
large force at and about Richmond, which place we must
take with the least possible delay; in fact, there will soon be
no formidable insurgent force except at Richmond. With so
large an army there, the enemy can threaten us on the
Potomac and elsewhere. Until we have re-established the
national authority, all these places must be held, and we
must keep a respectable force in front of WASHINGTON.
But this, from the diminished strength of our army by
sickness and casualties, renders an addition to it necessary
in order to close the struggle which has been prosecuted
for the last three months with energy and success. Rather
than hazard the misapprehension of our military condition
and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by
proclamation, I have deemed it best to address you in this
form. To accomplish the object stated we require without
delay 150,000 men, including those recently called for by
the Secretary of War. Thus reinforced our gallant army will
be enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of the

of this date just received. The Chattanooga expedition must
not on any account be given up. The President regards that
and the movement against East Tennessee as one of the
most important movements of the war, and its occupation
nearly as important as the capture of Richmond. He is not
pleased with the tardiness of the movement toward
Chattanooga, and directs that no force be sent here if you
cannot do it without breaking up the operations against
that point and East Tennessee. Infantry only are needed;
our cavalry and artillery are strong enough. The ﬁrst
reports from Richmond were more discouraging than the
truth warranted. If the advantage is not on our side, it is
balanced. General McClellan has moved his whole force on
the line of the James River, and is supported there by our
gunboats; but he must be largely strengthened before
advancing, and hence the call on you, which I am glad you
answered so promptly. Let me know to what point on the

may, in your judgment, be necessary to garrison and hold
all the numerous cities and military positions that have
been captured by our armies, and to speedily crush the
rebellion that still exists in several of the Southern States,
thus practically restoring to the civilized world our great
 and good government. All believe that the decisive moment
is near at hand, and to that end the people of the United
States are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all
reinforcements that you may deem needful to sustain our
government.

views expressed to me in so patriotic a manner by you, in
the communication of the twenty-eighth day of June, I have
decided to call into the service an additional force of
300,000 men. I suggest and recommend that the troops
should be chieﬂy of infantry. The quota of your State would

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA: 
A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas in and by the second section of an act of
Congress passed on the 7th day of June, A. D. 1862,
entitled “An act for the collection of direct taxes in
insurrectionary districts within the United States, and for
other purposes,” it is made the duty of the President to
declare, on or before the ﬁrst day of July then next
following, by his proclamation, in what States and parts of
States insurrection exists: Now, therefore, be it known that
I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of
America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the States of
South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana,
Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina,
and the State of Virginia except the following counties-
Hancock, 
Brooke, 
Ohio, 
Marshall, 
Wetzel, 
Marion,
Monongalia, Preston, Taylor, Pleasants, Tyler, Ritchie,
Doddridge, Harrison, Wood, Jackson, Wirt, Roane, Calhoun,
Gilmer, Barbour, Tucker, Lewis, Braxton, Upsbur, Randolph,
Mason, Putnam, Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Cabell, Wayne,
Boone, Logan, Wyoming, Webster, Fayette, and Raleigh-are
now in insurrection and rebellion, and by reason thereof
 the civil authority of the United States is obstructed so that
the provisions of the “Act to provide increased revenue
from imports, to pay the interest on the public debt, and for
other purposes,” approved August 5, 1861, can not be
peaceably executed; and that the taxes legally chargeable
upon real estate under the act last aforesaid lying within
the States and parts of States as aforesaid, together with a
penalty of 50 per centum of said taxes, shall be a lien upon
the tracts or lots of the same, severally charged, till paid.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be aﬀixed..............

MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN: It is
impossible to reinforce you for your present emergency. If
we had a million of men, We could not get them to you in
time. We have not the men to send. If you are not strong
enough to face the enemy, you must ﬁnd a place of security,
and wait, rest, and repair. Maintain your ground if you can,
but save the army at all events, even if you fall back to Fort
Monroe. We still have strength enough in the country, and
will bring it out.

WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., July 2, 1862.
MAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN: Your despatch of
Tuesday morning induces me to hope your army is having
some rest. In this hope allow me to reason with you a
moment. When you ask for 50,000 men to be promptly sent
you, you surely labor under some gross mistake of fact.
Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces
made last spring for the defense of WASHINGTON, and
advising a return to that plan. I ﬁnd it included in and
about WASHINGTON 75,000 men. Now, please be assured I
have not men enough to ﬁll that very plan by 15,000. All of
Fremont’s in the valley, all of Banks’s, all of McDowell’s not
with you, and all in WASHINGTON, taken together, do not
exceed, if they reach, 60,000. With Wool and Dix added to
those mentioned, I have not, outside of your army, 75,000
men east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you
50,000, or any other considerable force, promptly, is simply
absurd. If, in your frequent mention of responsibility, you
have the impression that I blame you for not doing more
than you can, please be relieved of such impression. I only
beg that in like manner you will not ask impossibilities of
me. If you think you are not strong enough to take
Richmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save
 the army, material and personal, and I will strengthen it for
the oﬀensive again as fast as I can. The governors of
eighteen States oﬀer me a new levy of 300,000, which I
accept.

WAR DEPARTMENT, JULY 3, 1862.10.30 A.M.
GOVERNOR WASHBURN, Maine [and other governors] I
should not want the half of 300,000 new troops if I could
have them now. If I had 50,000 additional troops here now,
I believe I could substantially close the war in two weeks.
But time is everything, and if I get 50,000 new men in a
month, I shall have lost 20,000 old ones during the same
month, having gained only 30,000, with the diﬀerence
between old and new troops still against me. The quicker
you send, the fewer you will have to send. Time is
everything. Please act in view of this. The enemy having
given up Corinth, it is not wonderful that he is thereby
enabled to check us for a time at Richmond.

oﬀicers, and men have done the best you could. All
accounts say better ﬁghting was never done. Ten thousand
thanks for it.
On the 28th we sent General Burnside an order to send
all the force he could spare to you. We then learned that
you had requested him to go to Goldsborough; upon which
we said to him our order was intended for your beneﬁt, and
we did not wish to be in conﬂict with your views.
We hope you will have help from him soon. Today we
have ordered General Hunter to send you all he can spare.

reinforcements without endangering all he has gained.

WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 4,
1862.
MAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN: I understand your
position as stated in your letter and by General Marcy. To
reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the oﬀensive
within a month, or even six weeks, is impossible. In
addition to that arrived and now arriving from the Potomac
(about 10,000 men, I suppose), and about 10,000 I hope
you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5000
from Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you
another man within a month. Under these circumstances
the defensive for the present must be your only care. Save
the army ﬁrst, where you are, if you can; secondly, by
removal, if you must. You, on the ground, must be the judge
as to which you will attempt, and of the means for eﬀecting
it. I but give it as my opinion that with the aid of the
gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned above you can
hold your present position — provided, and so long as, you
can keep the James River open below you. If you are not
tolerably conﬁdent you can keep the James River open, you
had better remove as soon as possible. I do not remember
that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger
 of having your communication cut on the river below you,
yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your attention.
Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN.
P.S. — If at any time you feel able to take the oﬀensive,
you are not restrained from doing so. A.L.

ARMY OF THE POTOMAC AT HARRISON’S LANDING,
VIRGINIA.
July 9, 1862.
THE PRESIDENT: What amount of force have you now?
GENERAL McCLELLAN: About 80,000, can’t vary much,
certainly 75,000.
THE PRESIDENT:[to the corps commanders] What is the
whole amount of your corps with you now.
GENERAL SUMNER: About 15,000.
GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: 15,000 for duty.
GENERAL KEYES: About 12,500.
GENERAL PORTER: About 23,000 — fully 20,000 ﬁt for
duty.
GENERAL FRANKLIN: About 15,000.
THE PRESIDENT: What is likely to be your condition as
to health in this camp?
GENERAL McCLELLAN: Better than in any encampment
since landing at Fortress Monroe.
PRESIDENT LINCOLN:[to the corps commanders] In
your present encampment what is the present and
prospective condition as to health?
 GENERAL SUMNER: As good as any part of Western
Virginia.
GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Excellent for health, and
present health improving.
GENERAL KEYES: A little improved, but think camp is
getting worse.
GENERAL PORTER: Very good.
GENERAL FRANKLIN: Not good.
THE PRESIDENT: Where is the enemy now?
GENERAL McCLELLAN: From four to ﬁve miles from us
on all the roads — I think nearly the whole army — both
Hills, Longstreet, Jackson, Magruder, Huger.
THE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Where and
in what condition do you believe the enemy to be now?
GENERAL SUMNER: I think they have retired from our
front; were very much damaged, especially in their best
troops, in the late actions, from superiority of arms.
GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Don’t think they are in force
in our vicinity.
GENERAL KEYES: Think he has withdrawn, and think
preparing to go to WASHINGTON.
GENERAL PORTER: Believe he is mainly near Richmond.
He feels he dare not attack us here.
GENERAL FRANKLIN: I learn he has withdrawn from
our front and think that is probable.
THE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] What is the
aggregate of your killed, wounded, and missing from the
attack on the 26th ultimo till now?
GENERAL SUMNER: 1175.
 GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Not large 745.
GENERAL KEYES: Less than 500.
GENERAL PORTER: Over 5000.
GENERAL FRANKLIN: Not over 3000.
THE PRESIDENT: If you desired could you remove the
army safely?
GENERAL McCLELLAN: It would be a delicate and very
diﬀicult matter.
THE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] If it were
desired to get the army away, could it be safely eﬀected?
GENERAL SUMNER: I think we could, but I think we
give up the cause if we do.
GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Perhaps we could, but I think
it would be ruinous to the country.
GENERAL KEYES: I think it could if done quickly.
GENERAL PORTER: Impossible — move the army and
ruin the country.
GENERAL FRANKLIN: I think we could, and that we had
better — think Rappahannock the true line.
THE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Is the army
secure in its present position?
GENERAL SUMNER: Perfectly so, in my judgment.
GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: I think it is safe.
GENERAL KEYES: With help of General B. [Burnside]
can hold position.
GENERAL PORTER: Perfectly so. Not only, but we are
ready to begin moving forward.

WHEREAS, IN THE judgment of the President, the public
safety does require that the railroad line called and known
as the Southwest Branch of the Paciﬁc Railroad in the State
of Missouri be repaired, extended, and completed from
Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springﬁeld, in the said
State, the same being necessary to the successful and
economical conduct of the war and to the maintenance of
the authority of the government in the Southwest:
Therefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress
entitled “An act to authorize the President of the United
States in certain cases to take possession of railroad and
telegraph lines, and for other purposes,” approved January
31, 1862, it is ordered, That the portion of the said railroad
line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon be repaired,
extended, and completed, so as to be made available for the
military uses of the government, as speedily as may be.
And, inasmuch as upon the part of the said line from Rolla
to the stream called Little Piney a considerable portion of
the necessary work has already been done by the railroad
company, and the road to this extent may be completed at
comparatively small cost, it is ordered that the said line
from Rolla to and across Little Piney be ﬁrst completed,
and as soon as possible.
 The Secretary of War is charged with the execution of
this order. And to facilitate the speedy execution of the
work, he is directed, at his discretion, to take possession
and control of the whole or such part of the said railroad
line, and the whole or such part of the rolling stock, oﬀices,
shops, 
buildings, 
and 
all 
their 
appendages 
and
appurtenances, as he may judge necessary or convenient
for the early completion of the road from Rolla to Lebanon.

GENTLEMEN: — AFTER the adjournment of Congress
now very near, I shall have no opportunity of seeing you for
several months. Believing that you of the border States
hold more power for good than any other equal number of
members, I feel it a duty which I cannot justiﬁably waive to
make this appeal to you. I intend no reproach or complaint
when I assure you that, in my opinion, if you all had voted
for the resolution in the gradual-emancipation message of
last March, the war would now be substantially ended. And
the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and
swift means of ending it. Let the States which are in
rebellion see deﬁnitely and certainly that in no event will
the States you represent ever join their proposed
confederacy, and they cannot much longer maintain the
contest. But you cannot divest them of their hope to
ultimately have you with them so long as you show a
determination to perpetuate the institution within your own
States. Beat them at elections, as you have overwhelmingly
done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim you as their
own. You and I know what the lever of their power is. Break
that lever before their faces, and they can shake you no
 more forever. Most of you have treated me with kindness
and consideration and I trust you will not now think I
improperly touch what is exclusively your own, when, for
the sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your
States, do better than to take the course I urge? Discarding
punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times,
and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our
case, can you do better in any possible event? You prefer
that the constitutional relation of the States to the nation
shall be practically restored without disturbance of the
institution; and if this were done, my whole duty in this
respect, under the Constitution and my oath of oﬀice,
would be performed. But it is not done, and we are trying
to accomplish it by war. The incidents of the war cannot be
avoided. If the war continues long, as it must if the object
be not sooner attained, the institution in your States will be
extinguished by mere friction and abrasion — by the mere
incidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have
nothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is gone
already. How much better for you and for your people to
take the step which at once shortens the war and secures
substantial compensation for that which is sure to be
wholly lost in any other event! How much better to thus
save the money which else we sink forever in war! How
much better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long
render us pecuniarily unable to do it! How much better for
you as seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell out and buy
out that without which the war could never have been, than
to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in
 cutting 
one 
another’s 
throats! 
I 
do 
not 
speak 
of
emancipation at once, but of a decision at once to
emancipate 
gradually. 
Room 
in 
South 
America 
for
colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance,
and when numbers shall be large enough to be company
and encouragement for one another, the freed people will
not be so reluctant to go.
I am pressed with a diﬀiculty not yet mentioned — one
which threatens division among those who, united, are
none too strong. An instance of it is known to you. General
Hunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope still is, my
friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me
in the general wish that all men everywhere could be free.
He proclaimed all men free within certain States, and I
repudiated the proclamation. He expected more good and
less harm from the measure than I could believe would
follow. Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not
oﬀence, to many whose support the country cannot aﬀord
to lose. And this is not the end of it. The pressure in this
direction is still upon me, and is increasing. By conceding
what I now ask you can relieve me, and, much more, can
relieve the country in this important point.
Upon these considerations, I have again begged your
attention to the message of March last. Before leaving the
Capital, consider and discuss it among yourselves. You are
patriots and statesmen, and as such I pray you consider
this proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the
consideration of your States and people. As you would
perpetuate popular government for the best people in the
 world, I beseech you that you do in nowise omit this. Our
common country is in great peril, demanding the loftiest
views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief. Once
relieved, its form of government is saved to the world; its
beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated,
and 
its 
happy 
future 
fully 
assured 
and 
rendered
inconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the
privilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that
grandeur, and to link your own names therewith forever.

told that over 160,000 men have gone into your army on
the Peninsula. When I was with you the other day we made
out 86,500 remaining, leaving 73,500 to be accounted for. I
believe 23,500 will cover all the killed, wounded, and
missing in all your battles and skirmishes, leaving 50,000
who have left otherwise. No more than 5000 of these have
died, leaving 45,000 of your army still alive and not with it.
I believe half or two-thirds of them are ﬁt for duty to-day.
Have you any more perfect knowledge of this than I have?
If I am right, and you had these men with you, you could go

MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.
JULY 4, 1862.
FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES: Herewith is the draft of the bill to
compensate any State which may abolish slavery within its
limits, the passage of which, substantially as presented, I
respectfully and earnestly recommend.
A. LINCOLN.
Be 
it 
enacted 
by 
the 
Senate 
and 
House 
of
Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled: — That whenever the President of the
United States shall be satisﬁed that any State shall have
lawfully abolished slavery within and through-out such
State, either immediately or gradually, it shall be the duty
of the President, assisted by the Secretary of the Treasury,
to prepare and deliver to each State an amount of six per
cent. interest-bearing bonds of the United States equal to
the aggregate value at —— — dollars per head of all the
slaves within such State, as reported by the census of 1860;
the whole amount for any one State to be delivered at once
if the abolishment be immediate, or in equal annual
instalments if it be gradual, interest to begin running on
each bond at the time of delivery, and not before.
 And be it further enacted, That if any State, having so
received any such bonds, shall at any time afterwards by
law reintroduce or tolerate slavery within its limits,
contrary to the act of abolishment upon which such bonds
shall have been received, said bonds so received by said
State shall at once be null and void, in whosesoever hands
they may be, and such State shall refund to the United
States all interest which may have been paid on such
bonds.

I HAVE INADVERTENTLY omitted so long to inform you that
in March last Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, of New York,
gratuitously presented to the United States the ocean
steamer Vanderbilt, by many esteemed the ﬁnest merchant
ship in the world. She has ever since been and still is doing
valuable service to the government. For the patriotic act of

country I recommend that some suitable acknowledgment
be made.

FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES: 
CONSIDERING THE BILL for “An act to suppress insurrection,
to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and conﬁscate the
property of rebels, and for other purposes,” and the joint
resolution explanatory of said act as being substantially
one, I have approved and signed both.
Before I was informed of the passage of the resolution I
had prepared the draft of a message stating objections to
the bill becoming a law, a copy of which draft is herewith
transmitted.
A. LINCOLN.
     
  I I  
  
   H  H
   
       
 A I   
I HEREWITH RETURN to your honorable body, in which it
originated, the bill for an act entitled “An act to suppress
treason and rebellion, to seize and conﬁscate the property
of rebels, and for other purposes,” together with my
objections to its becoming a law.
There is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection.
It is wholly prospective, and touches neither person nor
property of any loyal citizen, in which particulars it is just
and proper. The ﬁrst and second sections provide for the
conviction and punishment of persons Who shall be guilty
of treason and persons who shall “incite, set on foot, assist,
or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the
authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or shall
give aid and comfort thereto, or shall engage in or give aid
and comfort to any such existing rebellion or insurrection.”
By fair construction persons within these sections are not
to be punished without regular trials in duly constituted
courts, under the forms and all the substantial provisions of
law and of the Constitution applicable to their several
cases. To this I perceive no objection, especially as such
persons would be within the general pardoning power and
also the special provision for pardon and amnesty
contained in this act.
 It is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted
under these sections shall be free. I think there is an
unfortunate form of expression rather than a substantial
objection in this. It is startling to say that Congress can
free a slave within a State, and yet if it were said the
ownership of the slave had ﬁrst been transferred to the
nation and that Congress had then liberated him the
diﬀiculty would at once vanish. And this is the real case.
The traitor against the General Government forfeits his
slave at least as justly as he does any other property, and
he forfeits both to the government against which be
oﬀends. The government, so far as there can be ownership,
thus owns the forfeited slaves, and the question for
Congress in regard to them is, “Shall they be made free or
be sold to new masters?” I perceive no objection to
Congress deciding in advance that they shall be free. To the
high honor of Kentucky, as I am informed, she is the owner
of some slaves by escheat, and has sold none, but liberated
all. I hope the same is true of some other States. Indeed, I
do not believe it will be physically possible for the General
Government to return persons so circumstanced to actual
slavery. I believe there would be physical resistance to it
which could neither be turned aside by argument nor
driven away by force. In this view I have no objection to
this feature of the bill. Another matter involved in these
two sections, and running through other parts of the act,
will be noticed hereafter.
I perceive no objection to the third or fourth sections.
 So far as I wish to notice the ﬁfth and sixth sections, they
may be considered together. That the enforcement of these
sections would do no injustice to the persons embraced
within them, is clear. That those who make a causeless war
should be compelled to pay the cost of it, is too obviously
just to be called in question. To give governmental
protection to the property of persons who have abandoned
it, and gone on a crusade to overthrow the same
government, is absurd, if considered in the mere light of
justice. The severest justice may not always be the best
policy. The principle of seizing and appropriating the
property of the persons embraced within these sections is
certainly not very objectionable, but a justly discriminating
application of it would be very diﬀicult and, to a great
extent, impossible. And would it not be wise to place a
power of remission somewhere, so that these persons may
know they have something to lose by persisting and
something to gain by desisting?
[A man without hope is a most dangerous man — he has
nothing to lose!]
I am not sure whether such power of remission is or is
not in section thirteen. Without any special act of Congress,
I think our military commanders, when — in military
phrase, “they are within the enemy’s country,” should, in an
orderly manner, seize and use whatever of real or personal
property may be necessary or convenient for their
commands; at the same time preserving, in some way, the
evidence of what they do.
 What I have said in regard to slaves, while commenting
on the ﬁrst and second sections, is applicable to the ninth,
with the diﬀerence that no provision is made in the whole
act for determining whether a particular individual slave
does or does not fall within the classes deﬁned in that
section. He is to be free upon certain conditions but
whether those conditions do or do not pertain to him no
mode of ascertaining is provided. This could be easily
supplied.
To the tenth section I make no objection. The oath
therein required seems to be proper, and the remainder of
the section is substantially identical with a law already
existing.
The 
eleventh 
section 
simply 
assumes 
to 
confer
discretionary power upon the executive. Without the law, I
have no hesitation to go as far in the direction indicated as
I may at any time deem expedient. And I am ready to say
now — I think it is proper for our military commanders to
employ, as laborers, as many persons of African descent as
can be used to advantage.
The twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better
than unobjectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper,
if all other parts of the act shall stand.
That to which I chieﬂy object pervades most parts of the
act, but more distinctly appears in the ﬁrst, second,
seventh, and eighth sections. It is the sum of those
provisions which results in the divesting of title forever.
For the causes of treason and ingredients of treason, not
amounting to the full crime, it declares forfeiture extending
 beyond the lives of the guilty parties; whereas the
Constitution of the United States declares that “no
attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or
forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.”
True, there is to be no formal attainder in this case; still, I
think the greater punishment cannot be constitutionally
inﬂicted, in a diﬀerent form, for the same oﬀence.
With great respect I am constrained to say I think this
feature of the act is unconstitutional. It would not be
diﬀicult to modify it.
I may remark that the provision of the Constitution, put
in language borrowed from Great Britain, applies only in
this country, as I understand, to real or landed estate.
Again, this act in rem forfeits property for the
ingredients of treason without a conviction of the supposed
criminal, or a personal hearing given him in any
proceeding. That we may not touch property lying within
our reach, because we cannot give personal notice to an
owner 
who 
is 
absent 
endeavoring 
to 
destroy 
the
government, is certainly not satisfactory. Still, the owner
may not be thus engaged; and I think a reasonable time
should be provided for such parties to appear and have
personal hearings. Similar provisions are not uncommon in
connection with proceedings in rem.
For the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House in
which it originated.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL’S OFFICE, 
WASHINGTON, JULY 21, 1862.
The following order has been received from the President
of the United States: Representations have been made to
the President by the ministers of various foreign powers in
amity with the United States that subjects of such powers
have during the present insurrection been obliged or
required by military authorities to take an oath of general
or qualiﬁed allegiance to this government. It is the duty of
all aliens residing in the United States to submit to and
obey the laws and respect the authority of the government.
For any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this
obligation and subversive of that authority they may
rightfully be subjected to military restraints when this may
be necessary. But they cannot be required to take an oath
of allegiance to this government, because it conﬂicts with
the duty they owe to their own sovereigns. All such
obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and
annulled. Military commanders will abstain from imposing
similar obligations in future, and will in lieu thereof adopt
such other restraints of the character indicated as they
shall ﬁnd necessary, convenient, and eﬀectual for the public
safety. It is further directed that whenever any order shall
be made aﬀecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of
 the same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the
War Department for the consideration of the Department of
State.

African descent as can be advantageously used for military
or naval purposes, giving them reasonable wages for their
labor.
3. That as to both property and persons of African

MY DEAR SIR: — Yours of the 16th is received...........
You are ready to say I apply to friends what is due only to
enemies. I distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends
who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me. This
appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this
struggle than any other one thing. You remember telling
me, the day after the Baltimore mob in April, 1861, that it
would crush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to
attempt bringing troops over Maryland soil to Washington.
I brought the troops notwithstanding, and yet there was
Union feeling enough left to elect a Legislature the next
autumn, which in turn elected a very excellent Union
United States senator! I am a patient man — always willing
to forgive on the Christian terms of repentance, and also to
give ample time for repentance. Still, I must save this
government, if possible. What I cannot do, of course, I will
not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I
shall not surrender this game leaving any available card
unplayed.
 Yours truly,
A. LINCOLN.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 28, 1862.
CUTHBERT BULLITT, Esq., New Orleans, Louisiana.
SIR: — The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr.
Thomas J. Durant has been shown to me. The writer
appears to be an able, a dispassionate, and an entirely
sincere man. The ﬁrst part of the letter is devoted to an
eﬀort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana
was adopted against the will of a majority of the people.
This is probably true, and in that fact may be found some
instruction. Why did they allow the ordinance to go into
eﬀect? Why did they not assert themselves? Why stand
passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by
minority? Why did they not hold popular meetings and have
a convention of their own to express and enforce the true
sentiment of the State? If preorganization was against them
then, why not do this now that the United States army is
present to protect them? The paralysis — the dead palsy —
of the government in this whole struggle is that this class of
men will do nothing for the government, nothing for
themselves, except demanding that the government shall
not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!
 Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of
master and slave is disturbed by the presence of our army,
and he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part,
is done under cover of an act of Congress, while
constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of
military necessity. The truth is, that what is done and
omitted about slaves is done and omitted on the same
military necessity. It is a military necessity to have men and
money; and we can get neither in suﬀicient numbers or
amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves
coming to them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the
pressure in this direction, nor of my eﬀorts to hold it within
bounds till he and such as he shall have time to help
themselves.
I am not posted to speak understandingly on all the
police regulations of which Mr. Durant complains. If
experience shows any one of them to be wrong, let them be
set right. I think I can perceive in the freedom of trade
which Mr. Durant urges that he would relieve both friends
and enemies from the pressure of the blockade. By this he
would serve the enemy more eﬀectively than the enemy is
able to serve himself. I do not say or believe that to serve
the enemy is the purpose, of Mr. Durant, or that he is
conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic
ones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no
choice of sides in the contest, were anxious only to have
quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages, and to fall
in with the victorious side at the end of it without loss to
themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting the
 contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no
duty — apparently thinks of none — resting upon Union
men. He even thinks it injurious to the Union cause that
they should be restrained in trade and passage without
taking sides. They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump,
but to be merely passengers — deadheads at that — to be
carried snug and dry throughout the storm, and safely
landed right side up. Nay, more: even a mutineer is to go
untouched, lest these sacred passengers receive an
accidental wound. Of course the rebellion will never be
suppressed in Louisiana if the professed Union men there
will neither help to do it nor permit the government to do it
without their help. Now, I think the true remedy is very
diﬀerent from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does not
lie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing
the necessity for the war. The people of Louisiana who wish
protection to person and property have but to reach forth
their hands and take it. Let them in good faith reinaugurate
the national authority, and set up a State government
conforming thereto under the Constitution. They know how
to do it and can have the protection of the army while doing
it. The army will be withdrawn so soon as such State
government can dispense with its presence; and the people
of the State can then, upon the old constitutional terms,
govern themselves to their own liking. This is very simple
and easy.
If they will not do this — if they prefer to hazard all for
the sake of destroying the government — it is for them to
consider whether it is probable I will surrender the
 government to save them from losing all. If they decline
what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do.
What would you do in my position? Would you drop the war
where it is? Or would you prosecute it in future with elder-
stalk squirts charged with rose water? Would you deal
lighter blows rather than heavier ones? Would you give up
the contest, leaving any available means unapplied? I am in
no boastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and I shall
do all I can, to save the government, which is my sworn
duty as well as my personal inclination. I shall do nothing in
malice. What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing.
Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.

E TRACT FROM LETTER TO AUGUST BELMONT.
JULY 31, 1862.
Broken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has
nothing to do now but to take her place in the Union as it
was, barring the already broken eggs. The sooner she does
so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past
mending. This government cannot much longer play a game
in which it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those
enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for
ten years trying to destroy the government, and if they fail,
still come back into the Union unhurt. If they expect in any
contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join with the
writer in saying, “Now is the time.”
How much better it would have been for the writer to
have gone at this, under the protection of the army at New
Orleans, than to have sat down in a closet writing
complaining letters northward!

E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,
AUGUST 4, 1863.
TO COUNT A. DE GASPARIN.
DEAR SIR — Your very acceptable letter, dated Orbe,
Canton de Vaud, Switzerland, 18th of July, 1862, is
received. The moral eﬀect was the worst of the aﬀair
before Richmond, and that has run its course downward.
We are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as
we hope. I believe it is true that, in men and material, the
enemy suﬀered more than we in that series of conﬂicts,
while it is certain that he is less able to bear it.
With us every soldier is a man of character, and must be
treated with more consideration than is customary in
Europe. Hence our great army, for slighter causes than
could have prevailed there, has dwindled rapidly, bringing
the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated.
We shall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not
alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a
draft for part of this. It seems strange even to me, but it is
true, that the government is now pressed to this course by
a popular demand. Thousands who wish not to personally
enter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send
substitutes, provided they can have assurance that
 unwilling persons, similarly situated, will be compelled to
do likewise. Besides this, volunteers mostly choose to enter
newly forming regiments, while drafted men can be sent to
ﬁll up the old ones, wherein man for man they are quite
doubly as valuable.
You ask, “Why is it that the North with her great armies
so often is found with inferiority of numbers face to face
with the armies of the South?” While I painfully know the
fact, a military man, which I am not, would better answer
the question. The fact I know has not been overlooked, and
I suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the
other facts that the enemy holds the interior and we the
exterior lines, and that we operate where the people
convey information to the enemy, while he operates where
they convey none to us.
I have received the volume and letter which you did me
the honor of addressing to me, and for which please accept
my sincere thanks. You are much admired in America for
the ability of your writings, and much loved for your
generosity to us and your devotion to liberal principles
generally.
You are quite right as to the importance to us, for its
bearing upon Europe, that we should achieve military
successes, and the same is true for us at home as well as
abroad. Yet it seems unreasonable that a series of
successes, extending through half a year, and clearing
more than 100,000 square miles of country, should help us
so little, while a single half-defeat should hurt us so much.
But let us be patient.
 I am very happy to know that my course has not
conﬂicted with your judgment of propriety and policy I can
only say that I have acted upon my best convictions,
without selﬁshness or malice, and that by the help of God I
shall continue to do so.
Please be assured of my highest respect and esteem.

FELLOW CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for
my appearing before you on this occasion, but it is also true
that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves,
and I oﬀer in justiﬁcation of myself and of you that, upon
examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution
against it. I, however, have an impression that; there are
younger gentlemen who will entertain you better and
better address your understanding than I will or could, and
therefore I propose but to detain you a moment longer. I am
very little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless I
hope to produce some good by it. The only thing I think of
just now not likely to be better said by some one else is a
matter in which we have heard some other persons blamed
for what I did myself There has been a very widespread
attempt to have a quarrel between General McClellan and
the Secretary of War Now, I occupy a position that enables
me to believe that these two gentlemen are not nearly so
deep in the quarrel as some presuming to be their friends.
General McClellan’s attitude is such that in the very
selﬁshness of his nature he cannot but wish to be
successful — and I hope he will — and the Secretary of War
is precisely in the same situation. If the military
commanders in the ﬁeld cannot be successful, not only the
 Secretary of War, but myself, for the time being the master
of both, cannot but be failures. I know General McClellan
wishes to be successful, and I know he does not wish it any
more than the Secretary of War for him, and both of them
together no more than I wish it. Sometimes we have a
dispute about how many men General McClellan has had,
and those who would disparage him say he has had a very
large number, and those who would disparage the
Secretary of War insist that General McClellan has had a
very small number. The basis for this is, there is always a
wide diﬀerence, and on this occasion perhaps a wider one,
between the grand total on McClellan’s rolls and the men
actually ﬁt for duty; and those who would disparage him
talk of the grand total on paper, and those who would
disparage the Secretary of War talk of those at present ﬁt
for duty. General McClellan has sometimes asked for things
that the Secretary of War did not give him. General
McClellan is not to blame for asking for what he wanted
and needed, and the Secretary of War is not to blame for
not giving when he had none to give. And I say here, so far
as I know, the Secretary of War has withheld no one thing
at any time in my power to give him. I have no accusation
against him. I believe he is a brave and able man, and I
stand here, as justice requires me to do, to take upon
myself what has been charged on the Secretary of War as
withholding from him. I have talked longer than I expected
to do, and now I avail myself of my privilege of saying no
more.

WASHINGTON, Thursday, August 14, 1862.
THIS AFTERNOON THE President of the United States gave
an audience to a committee of colored men at the White
House. 
They 
were 
introduced 
by 
Rev. 
J. 
Mitchell,
Commissioner of Emigration, E. M. Thomas, the chairman,
remarked that they were there by invitation to hear what
the Executive had to say to them.
Having all been seated, the President, after a few
preliminary observations, informed them that a sum of
money had been appropriated by Congress, and placed at
his disposition, for the purpose of aiding the colonization, in
some country, of the people, or a portion of them, of African
descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long
time been his inclination, to favor that cause. And why, he
asked, should the people of your race be colonized, and
where? Why should they leave this country? This is,
perhaps, the ﬁrst question for proper consideration. You
and we are diﬀerent races. We have between us a broader
diﬀerence than exists between almost any other two races.
Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss; but this
physical diﬀerence is a great disadvantage to us both, as I
think. Your race suﬀer very greatly, many of them, by living
 among us, while ours suﬀer from your presence. In a word,
we suﬀer on each side. If this is admitted, it aﬀords a
reason, at least, why we should be separated. You here are
free men, I suppose.
[A voice— “Yes, sir!”]
Perhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your
race are suﬀering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong
inﬂicted on any people. But even when you cease to be
slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an
equality with the white race. You are cut oﬀ from many of
the advantages which the other race enjoys. The aspiration
of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free, but on
this broad continent not a single man of your race is made
the equal of a single man of ours. Go where you are treated
the best, and the ban is still upon you. I do not propose to
discuss this, but to present it as a fact, with which we have
to deal. I cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact about which
we all think and feel alike, I and you. We look to our
condition. Owing to the existence of the two races on this
continent, I need not recount to you the eﬀects upon white
men, growing out of the institution of slavery.
I believe in its general evil eﬀects on the white race. See
our present condition — the country engaged in war —
white men cutting one another’s throats — none knowing
how far it will extend — and then consider what we know to
be the truth: But for your race among us there could not be
war, although many men engaged on either side do not care
for you one way or the other. Nevertheless I repeat, without
the institution of slavery and the colored race as a basis,
 the war could not have an existence. It is better for us both,
therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free men
among you, who, even if they could better their condition,
are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those
who, being slaves, could obtain their freedom on this
condition. I suppose one of the principal diﬀiculties in the
way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see
that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe
that you can live in WASHINGTON, or elsewhere in the
United States, the remainder of your life, as easily, perhaps
more so, than you can in any foreign Country; and hence
you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to
do with the idea of going to a foreign country.
This is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selﬁsh
view of the case. You ought to do something to help those
who are not so fortunate as yourselves. There is an
unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be,
for you free colored people to remain with us. Now, if you
could give a start to the white people, you would open a
wide door for many to be made free. If we deal with those
who are not free at the beginning, and whose intellects are
clouded by slavery, we have very poor material to start
with. If intelligent colored men, such as are before me,
would move in this matter, much might be accomplished.
It is exceedingly important that we have men at the
beginning capable of thinking as white men, and not those
who have been systematically oppressed. There is much to
encourage you. For the sake of your race you should
sacriﬁce something of your present comfort for the purpose
 of being as grand in that respect as the white people. It is a
cheering thought throughout life that something can be
done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been
subject to the hard usages of the world. It is diﬀicult to
make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of
himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.
In the American Revolutionary war sacriﬁces were made by
men engaged in it, but they were cheered by the future.
General WASHINGTON himself endured greater physical
hardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he
was a happy man because he had engaged in beneﬁting his
race, in doing something for the children of his neighbors,
having none of his own.
The colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time.
In a certain sense it is a success. The old President of
Liberia, Roberts, has just been with me — the ﬁrst time I
ever saw him. He says they have within the bounds of that
colony between three and four hundred thousand people,
or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode
Island or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and
less than in some of our larger ones. They are not all
American colonists or their descendants. Something less
than 12,000 have been sent thither from this country. Many
of the original settlers have died; yet, like people else-
where, their oﬀspring outnumber those deceased. The
question is, if the colored people are persuaded to go
anywhere, why not there?
One reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you
would rather remain within reach of the country of your
 nativity. I do not know how much attachment you may have
toward our race. It does not strike me that you have the
greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to
them, at all events.
The place I am thinking about for a colony is in Central
America. It is nearer to us than Liberia not much more than
one fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days’ run by
steamers. Unlike Liberia, it is a great line of travel — it is a
highway. The country is a very excellent one for any people,
and with great natural resources and advantages, and
especially because of the similarity of climate with your
native soil, thus being suited to your physical condition.
The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway
from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Paciﬁc Ocean,
and this particular place has all the advantages for a
colony. On both sides there are harbors — among the ﬁnest
in the world. Again, there is evidence of very rich coal-
mines. A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country.
Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will aﬀord an
opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment
till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes. If
you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is
a bad show; and so where there is nothing to cultivate and
of which to make a farm. But if something is started so that
you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there, it
is a great advantage. Coal land is the best thing I know of
with which to commence an enterprise. To return — you
have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a
speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest
 in the country, including the coal-mines. We have been
mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites, as well as
blacks, look to their self-interest. Unless among those
deﬁcient of intellect, everybody you trade with makes
something. 
You 
meet 
with 
these 
things 
here 
and
everywhere. If such persons have what will be an
advantage to them, the question is whether it cannot be
made of advantage to you. You are intelligent, and know
that success does not so much depend on external help as
on self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves.
As to the coal-mines, I think I see the means available for
your self-reliance. I shall, if I get a suﬀicient number of you
engaged, have provision made that you shall not be
wronged. If you will engage in the enterprise, I will spend
some of the money intrusted to me. I am not sure you will
succeed. The government may lose the money; but we
cannot succeed unless we try, and we think with care we
can succeed. The political aﬀairs in Central America are
not in quite as satisfactory a condition as I wish. There are
contending factions in that quarter, but it is true all the
factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and
want it, and are more generous than we are here.
To your colored race they have no objection I would
endeavor to have you made the equals, and have the best
assurance that you should be the equals, of the best.
The practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can
get a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and
children, who are willing to go when I present evidence of
encouragement and protection. Could I get a hundred
 tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and
able to “cut their own fodder,” so to speak? Can I have
ﬁfty? If I could ﬁnd twenty-ﬁve able-bodied men, with a
mixture of women and children — good things in the family
relation, 
I 
think, 
— 
I 
could 
make 
a 
successful
commencement. I want you to let me know whether this
can be done or not. This is the practical part of my wish to
see you. These are subjects of very great importance,
worthy of a month’s study, instead of a speech delivered in
an hour. I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not
pertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours
for the present time, but as one of the things, if successfully
managed, the good of mankind — not conﬁned to the
present generation, but as
“From age to age descends the lay
To millions yet to be,
Till far its echoes roll away
Into eternity.”
The above is merely given as the substance of the
President’s remarks.
The chairman of the delegation brieﬂy replied that they
would hold a consultation, and in a short time give an
answer.
The President said: Take your full time-no hurry at all.
The delegation then withdrew.

HON. HORACE GREELEY.
DEAR SIR: — I have just read yours of the 19th,
addressed to myself through the New York Tribune. If there
be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may
know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert
them. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to
be falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against
them. If there be perceptible in it an impatient and
dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend,
whose heart I have always supposed to be right.
As to the policy I “seem to be pursuing,” as you say, I
have not meant to leave any one in doubt.
I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way
under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority
can be restored, the nearer the Union will be, “the Union as
it was.” If there be those who would not save the Union
unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not
agree with them. If there be those who would not save the
Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I
do not agree with them. My paramount object in this
struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or
destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing
 any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all
the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some
and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do
about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it
helps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear
because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I
shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts
the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe
doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors
when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so
fast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here
stated my purpose according to my view of oﬀicial duty, and
I intend no modiﬁcation of my oft expressed personal wish
that all men, everywhere, could be free.
Yours,
A. LINCOLN.

HIS E CELLENCY ANDREW G. CURTIN, Governor of
Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
SIR: — The application made to me by your adjutant
general for authority to call out the militia of the State of
Pennsylvania has received careful consideration. It is my
anxious desire to aﬀord, as far as possible, the means and
power of the Federal Government to protect the State of
Pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces; and since,
in your judgment, the militia of the State are required, and
have been called upon by you, to organize for home defense
and protection, I sanction the call that you have made, and
will receive them into the service and pay of the United
States to the extent they can be armed, equipped, and
usefully 
employed. 
The 
arms 
and 
equipments 
now
belonging to the General Government will be needed for
the troops called out for the national armies, so that arms
can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by
the draft of nine months’ men, heretofore ordered. But as
arms may be supplied by the militia under your call, these,
with the 30,000 in your arsenal, will probably be suﬀicient
for the purpose contemplated by your call. You will be
authorized to provide such equipments as may be required,
according to the regulations of the United States service,
 which, upon being turned over to the United States
Quartermaster’s Department, will be paid for at regulation
prices, or the rates allowed by the department for such
articles. Railroad transportation will also be paid for, as in
other cases. Such general oﬀicers will be supplied as the
exigencies of the service will permit.

not to exceed 80,000 disciplined troops, properly so called,
this side of the mountains; and most of them, with many of
the new regiments, are now close in the rear of the enemy
supposed to be invading Pennsylvania. Start half of them to
Harrisburg, and the enemy will turn upon and beat the
remaining half, and then reach Harrisburg before the part
going there, and beat it too when it comes. The best
possible security for Pennsylvania is putting the strongest
force possible in rear of the enemy.

Philadelphia is more than 150 miles from Hagerstown, and
could not be reached by the rebel army in ten days, if no
hindrance was interposed.

A COMMITTEE FROM THE RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS
OF CHICAGO,
SEPTEMBER 13,1862.
The subject presented in the memorial is one upon which
I have thought much for weeks past, and I may even say for
months. I am approached with the most opposite opinions
and advice, and that by religious men, who are equally
certain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that
either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief,
and perhaps in some respects both. I hope it will not be
irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God
would reveal his will to others, on a point so connected
with my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it
directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself
than I often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of
Providence in this matter. And if I can learn what it is I will
do it! These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I
suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a direct
revelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case,
ascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be
wise and right.
 The subject is diﬀicult, and good men do not agree. For
instance, the other day, four gentlemen of standing and
intelligence from New York called as a delegation on
business connected with the war; but before leaving two of
them 
earnestly 
besought 
me 
to 
proclaim 
general
emancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked
them. You know also that the last session of Congress had a
decided majority of antislavery men, yet they could not
unite on this policy. And the same is true of the religious
people. Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a great
deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and
expecting God to favor their side: for one of our soldiers
who had been taken prisoner told Senator Wilson a few
days since that he met nothing so discouraging as the
evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers.
But we will talk over the merits of the case.
What good would a proclamation of emancipation from
me do, especially as we are now situated? I do not want to
issue a document that the whole world will see must
necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope’s bull against the
comet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even
enforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a
single court, or magistrate or individual that would be
inﬂuenced by it there? And what reason is there to think it
would have any greater eﬀect upon the slaves than the late
law of Congress, which I approved, and which oﬀers
protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who
come within our lines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has
caused a single slave to come over to us. And suppose they
 could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to
throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them?
How can we feed and care for such a multitude? General
Butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more
rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the
white troops under his command. They eat, and that is all;
though it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also
by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If,
now, the pressure of the war should call oﬀ our forces from
New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent
the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again? for I
am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners,
free or slave, they immediately auction them oﬀ. They did
so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the
Tennessee River a few days ago. And then I am very
ungenerously attacked for it! For instance, when, after the
late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out
from Washington under a ﬂag of truce to bury the dead and
bring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who
went along to help, and sent them into slavery, Horace
Greeley said in his paper that the government would
probably do nothing about it. What could I do?
Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of
good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as
you desire? Understand, I raise no objections against it on
legal or constitutional grounds; for, as commander-in-chief
of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have a
right to take any measure which may best subdue the
enemy; nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view
 of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at
the South. I view this matter as a practical war measure, to
be 
decided 
on 
according 
to 
the 
advantages 
or
disadvantages it may oﬀer to the suppression of the
rebellion.
I admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least
its sine qua non. The ambition of politicians may have
instigated them to act, but they would have been impotent
without slavery as their instrument. I will also concede that
emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them
that we are incited by something more than ambition. I
grant, further, that it would help somewhat at the North,
though not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent
imagine. Still, some additional strength would be added in
that way to the war, and then, unquestionably, it would
weaken the rebels by drawing oﬀ their laborers, which is of
great importance; but I am not so sure we could do much
with the blacks. If we were to arm them, I fear that in a few
weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels; and,
indeed, thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our
white troops. I will mention another thing, though it meet
only your scorn and contempt. There are ﬁfty thousand
bayonets in the Union armies from the border slave States.
It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a
proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the
rebels. I do not think they all would — not so many, indeed,
as a year ago, or as six months ago — not so many to-day as
yesterday. Every day increases their Union feeling. They
are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to beat the
 rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit
that we already have an important principle to rally and
unite the people, in the fact that constitutional government
is at stake. This is a fundamental idea going down about as
deep as anything.
Do not misunderstand me because I have mentioned
these objections. They indicate the diﬀiculties that have
thus far prevented my action in some such way as you
desire. I have not decided against a proclamation of liberty
to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement; and I
can assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and
night, more than any other. Whatever shall appear to be
God’s will, I will do. I trust that in the freedom with which I
have canvassed your views I have not in any respect injured
your feelings.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
A Proclamation.
I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of
America and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy
thereof, do hereby proclaim and declare that hereafter, as
heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of
practically restoring the constitutional relation between the
United States and each of the States and the people thereof
in which States that relation is or may be suspended or
disturbed.
That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of
Congress, to again recommend the adoption of a practical
measure tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or
rejection of all slave States, so called, the people whereof
may not then be in rebellion against the United States, and
which States may then have voluntarily adopted, or
thereafter may voluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual
abolishment of slavery within their respective limits; and
that the eﬀort to colonize persons of African descent with
their consent upon this continent or elsewhere, with the
 previously obtained consent of the governments existing
there, will be continued.
That on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons
held as slaves within any State or designated part of a
State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against
the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever
free; and the executive government of the United States,
including the military and naval authority thereof, will
recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and
will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of
them, in any eﬀorts they may make for their actual
freedom.
That the Executive will on the 1st day of January
aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts
of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively,
shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the
fact that any State or the people thereof shall on that day
be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United
States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a
majority of the qualiﬁed voters of such State shall have
participated shall, in the absence of strong countervailing
testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State
and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the
United States.
That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress
entitled “An act to make an additional article of war,”
approved March 13, 1862, and which act is in the words
and ﬁgure following:
 “Be 
it 
enacted 
by 
the 
Senate 
and 
House 
of
Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That hereafter the following shall be
promulgated as an additional article of war for the
government of the Army of the United States and shall be
obeyed and observed as such.
“ART. All oﬀicers or persons in the military or naval
service of the United States are prohibited from employing
any of the forces under their respective commands for the
purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who
may have escaped from any person, to whom such service
or labor is claimed to be due, and any oﬀicer who shall be
found guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall
be dismissed from the service.
“SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That this act shall
take eﬀect from and after its passage.”
Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled “An
act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and
rebellion, to seize and conﬁscate the property of rebels,
and for other purposes,” approved July 17, 1862, and which
sections are in the words and ﬁgures following:
“SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That all slaves of
persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against
the Government of the United States, or who shall in any
way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such
persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army, and
all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them
and coming under the control of the Government of the
United States, and all slaves of such persons found on (or)
 being within any place occupied by rebel forces and
afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States,
shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of
their servitude and not again held as slaves.
“SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That no slave
escaping into any State, Territory, or the District of
Columbia from any other State shall be delivered up or in
any way impeded or hindered of his liberty, except for
crime, or some oﬀence against the laws, unless the person
claiming said fugitive shall ﬁrst make oath that the person
to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to
be due is his lawful owner, and has not borne arms against
the United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way
given aid and comfort thereto; and no person engaged in
the military or naval service of the United States shall,
under any pretense whatever, assume to decide on the
validity of the claim of any person to the service or labor of
any other person, or surrender up any such person to the
claimant, on pain of being dismissed from the service.”
And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons
engaged in the military and naval service of the United
States to observe, obey, and enforce, within their respective
spheres of service, the act and sections above recited.
And the Executive will in due time recommend that all
citizens of the United States who shall have remained loyal
thereto throughout the rebellion shall (upon the restoration
of the constitutional relation between the United States and
their respective States and people, if that relation shall
have been suspended or disturbed) be compensated for all
 losses by acts of the United States, including the loss of
slaves.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be aﬀixed.
Done at the City of Washington, this twenty-second day
of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the
United States the eighty-seventh.

THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
OF
AMERICA A Proclamation
Whereas it has become necessary to call into service not
only volunteers, but also portions of the militia of the States
by draft, in order to suppress the insurrection existing in
the United States, and disloyal persons are not adequately
restrained by the ordinary processes of law from hindering
this measure, and from giving aid and comfort in various
ways to the insurrection: Now, therefore, be it ordered
First. That during the existing insurrection, and as a
necessary measure for suppressing the same, all rebels and
insurgents, their aiders and abettors within the United
States, and all persons discouraging volunteer enlistments,
resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice
aﬀording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of
the United States, shall be subject to martial law, and liable
to trial and punishment by courts-martial or military
commissions.
Second. That the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in
respect to all persons arrested, or who are now, or
hereafter during the rebellion shall be, imprisoned in any
 fort camp, arsenal, military prison or other place of
conﬁnement by any military authority or by the sentence of
any court-martial or military commission.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be aﬀixed.
Done at the city of WASHINGTON, this twenty-fourth day
of September. A.D. eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and of
the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.

I APPEAR BEFORE you to do little more than acknowledge
the courtesy you pay me, and to thank you for it. I have not
been distinctly informed why it is that on this occasion you
appear to do me this honor, though I suppose it is because
of the proclamation. What I did, I did after a very full
deliberation, and under a very heavy and solemn sense of
responsibility. I can only trust in God I have made no
mistake. I shall make no attempt on this occasion to sustain
what I have done or said by any comment. It is now for the
country and the world to pass judgment and, maybe, take
action upon it.
I will say no more upon this subject. In my position I am
environed with diﬀiculties. Yet they are scarcely so great as
the diﬀiculties of those who upon the battle-ﬁeld are
endeavoring to purchase with their blood and their lives
the future happiness and prosperity of this country. Let us
never forget them. On the fourteenth and seventeenth days
of this present month there have been battles bravely,
skillfully, and successfully fought. We do not yet know the
particulars. Let us be sure that, in giving praise to certain
individuals, we do no injustice to others. I only ask you, at
the conclusion of these few remarks, to give three hearty
 cheers for all good and brave oﬀicers and men who fought
those successful battles.

FROM THE MILITARY SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES.
E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September
26, 1862.
MAJOR JOHN J. KEY:
I am informed that, in answer to the question, “Why was
not the rebel army bagged immediately after the battle
near Sharpsburg?” propounded to you by Major Levi C.
Turner, Judge Advocate, etc., you said: “That is not the
game. The object is, that neither army shall get much
advantage of the other; that both shall be kept in the ﬁeld
till they are exhausted, when we will make a compromise
and save slavery.”
I shall be very happy if you will, within twenty-four hours
from the receipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner that
you did not, either literally or in substance, make the
answer stated.
[Above delivered to Major Key at 10.25 a.m. September
27th.]
At about 11 o’clock A.M., September 27, 1862, Major Key
and Major Turner appeared before me. Major Turner says:
“As I remember it, the conversation was: ‘Why did we not
bag them after the battle of Sharpsburg?’ Major Key’s reply
 was: ‘That was not the game; that we should tire the rebels
out and ourselves; that that was the only way the Union
could be preserved, we come together fraternally, and
slavery be saved.’”
On cross-examination, Major Turner says he has
frequently heard Major Key converse in regard to the
present troubles, and never heard him utter a sentiment
unfavorable to the maintenance of the Union. He has never
uttered anything which he, Major T., would call disloyalty.
The particular conversation detailed was a private one.
[Indorsement on the above.]
In my view, it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman
holding a military commission from the United States to
utter such sentiments as Major Key is within proved to
have done. Therefore, let Major John J. Key be forthwith
dismissed from the military service of the United States.

HON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.
MY DEAR SIR: Your kind letter of the 25th is just
received. It is known to some that, while I hope something
from the proclamation, my expectations are not as
sanguine as are those of some friends. The time for its
eﬀect southward has not come; but northward the eﬀect
should be instantaneous. It is six days old, and, while
commendation 
in 
newspapers 
and 
by 
distinguished
individuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks
have declined, and troops come forward more slowly than
ever. This, looked soberly in the face, is not very
satisfactory. We have fewer troops in the ﬁeld at the end of
the six days than we had at the beginning — the attrition
among the old outnumbering the addition by the new. The
North responds to the proclamation suﬀiciently in breath;
but breath alone kills no rebels.
I wish I could write more cheerfully; nor do I thank you
the less for the kindness of your letter.

Indians, and evidently seeking to commit us to their right to
parole prisoners in that way. My inclination is to send the
prisoners back with a deﬁnite notice that we will recognize
no paroles given to our prisoners by the rebels as extending
beyond a prohibition against ﬁghting them, though I wish
your opinion upon it, based both upon the general law and
our cartel. I wish to avoid violations of the law and bad
faith. Answer as quickly as possible, as the thing, if done at

telegraph you as follows: The President directs that you
cross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy, or drive
him south. Your army must move now, while the roads are
good. If you cross the river between the enemy and
Washington, and cover the latter by your operation, you can
be reinforced by thirty thousand men. If you move up the
valley of the Shenandoah, not more than twelve or ﬁfteen
thousand can be sent you. The President advises the
interior line between Washington and the enemy, but does
not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as
soon as possible. You will immediately report what line you
adopt, and when you intend to cross the river; also to what
point the reinforcements are to be sent. It is necessary that
the plan of your operations be positively determined on,
before orders are given for building bridges and repairing
railroads. I am directed to add that the Secretary of War
and the General-in-chief fully concur with the President in
these directions.

established by it would evidently break up the whole army.
Buell’s old troops, now in pursuit of Bragg, have done more
hard marching recently; and, in fact, if you include
marching and ﬁghting, there are scarcely any old troops
east or west of the mountains that have not done as hard
service. I sincerely wish war was an easier and pleasanter
business than it is; but it does not admit of holidays. On
Morgan’s command, where it is now sent, as I understand,

E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 13, 1862.
MY DEAR SIR — You remember my speaking to you of
what I called your over-cautiousness. Are you not over-
cautious when you assume that you cannot do what the
enemy is constantly doing? Should you not claim to be at
least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?
As I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that
you cannot subsist your army at Winchester unless the
railroad from Harper’s Ferry to that point be put in working
order. But the enemy does now subsist his army at
Winchester, at a distance nearly twice as great from
railroad transportation as you would have to do, without
the railroad last named. He now wagons from Culpepper
Court-House, which is just about twice as far as you would
have to do from Harper’s Ferry. He is certainly not more
than half as well provided with wagons as you are. I
certainly should be pleased for you to have the advantage
of the railroad from Harper’s Perry to Winchester; but it
wastes an the remainder of autumn to give it to you, and, in
fact, ignores the question of time, which cannot and must
not be ignored.
Again, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is
“to operate upon the enemy’s communications as much as
 possible, without exposing your own.” You seem to act as if
this applies against you, but cannot apply in your favor.
Change positions with the enemy, and think you not he
would break your communication with Richmond within the
next 
twenty-four 
hours? 
You 
dread 
his 
going 
into
Pennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he gives up his
communications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to
do but to follow and ruin him; if he does so with less than
full force, fall upon and beat what is left behind all the
easier.
Exclusive of the water line, you are now nearer to
Richmond than the enemy is, by the route that you can and
he must take. Why can you not reach there before him,
unless you admit that he is more than your equal on a
march? His route is the arc of a circle, while yours is the
chord. The roads are as good on yours as on his.
You know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the
Potomac below instead of above the Shenandoah and Blue
Ridge. My idea was, that this would at once menace the
enemy’s communications, which I would seize if he would
permit. If he should move northward, I would follow him
closely, holding his communications. If he should prevent
our 
seizing 
his 
communications, 
and 
move 
toward
Richmond, I would press closely to him, ﬁght him if a
favorable opportunity should present, and at least try to
beat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say “try;” if we
never try, we shall never succeed. If he makes a stand at
Winchester, moving neither north or south, I would ﬁght
him there, on the idea that if we cannot beat him when he
 bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we
bear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a
simple truth, and is too important to be lost sight of for a
moment. In coming to us he tenders us an advantage which
we should not waive. We should not so operate as to merely
drive him away. As we must beat him somewhere or fail
ﬁnally, we can do it, if at all, easier near to us than far
away. If we cannot beat the enemy where he now is, we
never can, he again being within the entrenchments of
Richmond.
[And, indeed, the enemy was let back into Richmond and
it took another two years and thousands of dead for
McClelland cowardice — if that was all that it was. I still
suspect, and I think the evidence is overwhelming that he
was, either secretly a supporter of the South, or, what is
more likely, a politician readying for a diﬀerent campaign:
that of the Presidency of the United States.]
Recurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside
track, the facility of supplying from the side away from the
enemy is remarkable, as it were, by the diﬀerent spokes of
a wheel extending from the hub toward the rim, and this
whether you move directly by the chord or on the inside
arc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The chord line,
as you see, carries you by Aldie, Hay Market, and
Fredericksburg; and you see how turnpikes, railroads, and
ﬁnally the Potomac, by Aquia Creek, meet you at all points
from WASHINGTON; the same, only the lines lengthened a
little, if you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way.
 The gaps through the Blue Ridge I understand to be
about the following distances from Harper’s Ferry, to wit:
Vestal’s, 5 miles; Gregory’s, 13; Snicker’s, 18; Ashby’s, 28;
Manassas, 38; Chester, 45; and Thornton’s, 53. I should
think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy,
disabling him to make an important move without your
knowledge, and compelling him to keep his forces together
for dread of you. The gaps would enable you to attack if you
should wish. For a great part of the way you would be
practically between the enemy and both WASHINGTON
and Richmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest
number of troops from here. When at length running for
Richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way, if he
does so, turn and attack him in rear. But I think he should
be engaged long before such a point is reached. It is all
easy if our troops march as well as the enemy, and it is
unmanly to say they cannot do it. This letter is in no sense
an order.
Yours truly,
A. LINCOLN.

The insurrection which has for some time prevailed in
several of the States of this Union, including Louisiana,
having temporarily subverted and swept away the civil
institutions of that State, including the judiciary and the
judicial authorities of the Union, so that it has become
necessary to hold the State in military Occupation, and it
being indispensably necessary that there shall be some
judicial tribunal existing there capable of administering
justice, I have therefore thought it proper to appoint, and I
do hereby constitute, a provisional court, which shall be a
court of record, for the State of Louisiana; and I do hereby
appoint Charles A Peabody, of New York, to be a provisional
judge to hold said court, with authority to hear, try, and
determine all causes, civil and criminal, including causes in
law, equity, revenue, and admiralty, and particularly all
such powers and jurisdiction as belong to the district and
circuit courts of the United States, conforming his
proceedings so far as possible to the course of proceedings
and practice which has been customary in the courts of the
United States and Louisiana, his judgment to be ﬁnal and
conclusive. And I do hereby authorize and empower the
 said judge to make and establish such rules and regulations
as may be necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction, and
empower the said judge to appoint a prosecuting attorney,
marshal, and clerk of the said court, who shall perform the
functions of attorney, marshal, and clerk according to such
proceedings and practice as before mentioned and such
rules and regulations as may be made and established by
said judge. These appointments are to continue during the
pleasure of the President, not extending beyond the
military occupation of the city of New Orleans or the
restoration of the civil authority in that city and in the State
of Louisiana. These oﬀicers shall be paid, out of the
contingent fund of the War Department, compensation as
follows: The judge at the rate of  3500 per annum; the
prosecuting attorney, including the fees, at the rate of
 3000 per annum; the marshal, including the fees, at the
rate of  3000 per annum; and the clerk, including the fees,
at the rate of  2500 per annum; such compensations to be
certiﬁed by the Secretary of War. A copy of this order,
certiﬁed by the Secretary of War and delivered to such
judge, shall be deemed and held to be a suﬀicient

ﬁve weeks’ total inaction of the army, and during which
period we have sent to the army every fresh horse we

cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move, presents a

15, 1862.
The President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and
Navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the
Sabbath by the oﬀicers and men in the military and naval
service. The importance for man and beast of the
prescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian
soldiers and sailors, a becoming deference to the best
sentiment of a Christian people, and a due regard for the
divine will demand that Sunday labor in the army and navy
be reduced to the measure of strict necessity.
The discipline and character of the national forces should
not suﬀer nor the cause they defend be imperilled by the
profanation of the day or name of the Most High. “At this
time of public distress,” adopting the words of Washington
in 1776, “men may ﬁnd enough to do in the service of God
and their country without abandoning themselves to vice
and immorality.” The ﬁrst general order issued by the
Father 
of

my view there could be no possible object in such an

What we do want is the conclusive evidence that

that other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for
them and send them. To send a parcel of Northern men

enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that it is
not genuine — that you have never seen it. My dear
General, this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has
been, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our ﬁnal ruin if it
is not abandoned. If you had the articles of this requisition
upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make them
of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get
vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say
nothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the
vessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks
more. And, after all, where you are going you have no use
for them. When you parted with me you had no such ideas
in your mind. I know you had not, or you could not have
 expected to be oﬀ so soon as you said. You must get back to
something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is
a failure before you start. You must be oﬀ before Congress
meets. You would be better oﬀ anywhere, and especially
where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons
doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that
draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care
for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two
thousand good soldiers. Now, dear General, do not think
this is an ill-natured letter; it is the very reverse. The
simple publication of this requisition would ruin you.

GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.
MY DEAR SIR — I have just received and read your letter
of the 20th. The purport of it is that we lost the late
elections and the administration is failing because the war
is unsuccessful, and that I must not ﬂatter myself that I am
not justly to blame for it. I certainly know that if the war
fails the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for
it, whether I deserve it or not. And I ought to be blamed if I
could do better. You think I could do better; therefore you
blame me already. I think I could not do better; therefore I
blame you for blaming me. I understand you now to be
willing to accept the help of men who are not Republicans,
provided they have “heart in it.” Agreed. I want no others.
But who is to be the judge of hearts, or of “heart in it”? If I
must discard my own judgment and take yours, I must also
take that of others and by the time I should reject all I
should be advised to reject, I should have none left,
Republicans or others not even yourself. For be assured, my
dear sir, there are men who have “heart in it” that think
you are performing your part as poorly as you think I am
performing mine. I certainly have been dissatisﬁed with the
 slowness of Buell and McClellan; but before I relieved them
I had great fears I should not ﬁnd successors to them who
would do better; and I am sorry to add that I have seen
little since to relieve those fears.
I do not see clearly the prospect of any more rapid
movements. I fear we shall at last ﬁnd out that the diﬀiculty
is in our case rather than in particular generals. I wish to
disparage no one certainly not those who sympathize with
me; but I must say I need success more than I need
sympathy, and that I have not seen the so much greater
evidence of getting success from my sympathizers than
from those who are denounced as the contrary. It does
seem to me that in the ﬁeld the two classes have been very
much alike in what they have done and what they have
failed to do. In sealing their faith with their blood, Baker
and Lyon and Bohien and Richardson, Republicans, did all
that men could do; but did they any more than Kearny and
Stevens and Reno and Mansﬁeld, none of whom were
Republicans, and some at least of whom have been bitterly
and 
repeatedly 
denounced 
to 
me 
as 
secession
sympathizers? I will not perform the ungrateful task of
comparing cases of failure.
In answer to your question, “Has it not been publicly
stated in the newspapers, and apparently proved as a fact,
that from the commencement of the war the enemy was
continually supplied with information by some of the
conﬁdential subordinates of as important an oﬀicer as
Adjutant-General Thomas?” I must say “No,” as far as my
knowledge extends. And I add that if you can give any
 tangible evidence upon the subject, I will thank you to
come to this city and do so.

HON. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.
MY DEAR SIR: — Few things perplex me more than this
question 
between 
Governor 
Gamble 
and 
the 
War
Department, as to whether the peculiar force organized by
the former in Missouri are State troops or United States
troops. Now, this is either an immaterial or a mischievous
question. First, if no more is desired than to have it settled
what name the force is to be called by, it is immaterial.
Secondly, if it is desired for more than the ﬁxing a name, it
can only be to get a position from which to draw practical
inferences; then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one
dispute by deciding the question, I should merely furnish a
nest-full of eggs for hatching new disputes. I believe the
force is not strictly either “State troops” or “United States
troops.” It is of mixed character. I therefore think it is safer,
when a practical question arises, to decide that question
directly, 
and 
not 
indirectly 
by 
deciding 
a 
general
abstraction supposed to include it, and also including a
great deal more. Without dispute Governor Gamble
appoints the oﬀicers of this force, and ﬁlls vacancies when
they occur. The question now practically in dispute is: Can
Governor Gamble make a vacancy by removing an oﬀicer or
 accepting a resignation? Now, while it is proper that this
question shall be settled, I do not perceive why either
Governor Gamble or the government here should care
which way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only because
there seems to be pertinacity about it. It seems to me that
it might be either way without injury to the service; or that
the oﬀer of the Secretary of War to let Governor Gamble
make vacancies, and he (the Secretary) to ratify the making
of them, ought to be satisfactory.
Yours truly, A. LINCOLN

E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 1,
1862.
JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.
SIR: — Three hundred Indians have been sentenced to
death in Minnesota by a military commission, and execution
only awaits my action. I wish your legal opinion whether if I
should conclude to execute only a part of them, I must
myself designate which, or could I leave the designation to
some oﬀicer on the ground?
Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN.

FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES — Since your last annual assembling
another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed;
and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a
return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best
light he gives us, trusting that in his own good time and
wise way all will yet be well.
The correspondence touching foreign aﬀairs which has
taken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in
virtual compliance with a request to that eﬀect, made by
the House of Representatives near the close of the last
session of Congress.
If the condition of our relations with other nations is less
gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is
certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily
distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended.
In the month of June last there were some grounds to
expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of
our domestic diﬀiculties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as
we think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would
soon recede from that position, which has proved only less
injurious to themselves than to our own country. But the
temporary reverses which afterward befell the national
 arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal
citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple
justice.
The civil war, which has so radically changed, for the
moment, the occupations and habits of the American
people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition, and
aﬀected very deeply the prosperity, of the nations with
which we have carried on a commerce that has been
steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It
has, at the same time, excited political ambitions and
apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation
throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we
have forborne from taking part in any controversy between
foreign states, and between parties or factions in such
states. 
We 
have 
attempted 
no 
propagandism 
and
acknowledged no revolution, but we have left to every
nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own
aﬀairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by
foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to
its 
supposed 
and 
often 
exaggerated 
eﬀects 
and
consequences resulting to those nations themselves,
nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government,
even if it were just, would certainly be unwise.
The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the
slave trade has been put into operation with a good
prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special
pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part
of her Majesty’s government has been marked with a
 jealous respect for the authority of the United States and
the rights of their moral and loyal citizens.
The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the
state dues has been carried into full eﬀect under the act of
Congress for that purpose.
A blockade of 3000 miles of seacoast could not be
established and vigorously enforced in a season of great
commercial activity like the present without committing
occasional mistakes and inﬂicting unintentional injuries
upon foreign nations and their subjects.
A civil war occurring in a country where foreigners
reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations is
necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral
rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions,
and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between
nations which have a common interest in preserving peace
and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have so far as
possible heard and redressed complaints which have been
presented by friendly powers. There is still, however, a
large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon
which the government is unable to agree with the
governments whose protection is demanded by the
claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the
United States or their citizens suﬀer wrongs from the naval
or military authorities of foreign nations which the
governments of those states are not at once prepared to
redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states thus
interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such
complaints. This proposition has been made especially to
 Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each
case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been
formally adopted.
I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in
behalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark Admiral P.
Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May, 1861, prevented by
the commander of the blockading force oﬀ Charleston from
leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar
privilege had shortly before been granted to an English
vessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the
papers in the case to be communicated to the proper
committees.
Applications have been made to me by many free
Americans of African descent to favor their emigration,
with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in
recent acts of Congress, Other parties, at home and abroad
— some from interested motives, others upon patriotic
considerations, and still others inﬂuenced by philanthropic
sentiments — have suggested similar measures, while, on
the other hand, several of the Spanish American republics
have protested against the sending of such colonies to their
respective territories. Under these circumstances I have
declined to move any such colony to any state without ﬁrst
obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement
on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the
rights of freemen; and I have at the same time oﬀered to
the several states situated within the Tropics, or having
colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice
and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary
 emigration of persons of that class to their respective
territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and
humane. Liberia and Haiti are as yet the only countries to
which colonists of African descent from here could go with
certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I
regret to say such persons contemplating colonization do
not seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to
some others, nor so willing as I think their interest
demands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this
respect is improving, and that ere long there will be an
augmented and considerable migration to both these
countries from the United States.
The new commercial treaty between the United States
and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution.
A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated,
subject to the Senate’s consent, with Liberia, and a similar
negotiation is now pending with the Republic of Haiti. A
considerable improvement of the national commerce is
expected to result from these measures.
Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal,
Russia, 
Prussia, 
Denmark, 
Sweden, 
Austria, 
the
Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European states
remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue
to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.
During the last year there has not only been no change of
our previous relations with the independent states of our
own continent, but more friendly sentiments than have
heretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these
neighbors, whose safety and progress are so intimately
 connected with our own. This statement especially applies
to Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and
Chile.
The commission under the convention with the Republic
of New Granada closed its session without having audited
and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it.
A proposition is pending to revive the convention, that it
may be able to do more complete justice. The joint
commission between the United States and the Republic of
Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its
report.
I have favored the project for connecting the United
States with Europe by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar
project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco to
connect by a Paciﬁc telegraph with the line which is being
extended across the Russian Empire.
The Territories of the United States, with unimportant
exceptions, have remained undisturbed by the civil war;
and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as
justiﬁes an expectation that some of them will soon be in a
condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally
admitted into the Federal Union.
The immense mineral resources of some of those
Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible.
Every step in that direction would have a tendency to
improve the revenues of the government and diminish the
burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious
consideration whether some extraordinary measures to
promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which
 suggests itself as most likely to be eﬀective is a scientiﬁc
exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with
a view to the publication of its results at home and in
foreign countries — results which cannot fail to be
auspicious.
The condition of the ﬁnances win claim your most
diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to
the military and naval operations required for the
suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a
promptitude 
and 
certainty 
unusual 
in 
similar
circumstances, and the public credit has been fully
maintained. The continuance of the war, however, and the
increased 
disbursements 
made 
necessary 
by 
the
augmented forces now in the ﬁeld demand your best
reﬂections as to the best modes of providing the necessary
revenue without injury to business and with the least
possible burdens upon labor.
The suspension of specie payments by the banks soon
after the commencement of your last session made large
issues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way
could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other
just demands be so economically or so well provided for.
The 
judicious 
legislation 
of 
Congress, 
securing 
the
receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties
and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made
them an universal currency, and has satisﬁed, partially at
least, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform
circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense
sums in discounts and exchanges.
 A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest
period compatible with due regard to all interests
concerned should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the
value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these
ﬂuctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a
leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt
and 
certain 
convertibility, 
into 
coin 
is 
generally
acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against
them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of
United States notes payable in coin and suﬀiciently large
for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully,
and safely maintained.
Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary
provision for the public wants can be made and the great
advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?
I know of none which promises so certain results and is
at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of
banking associations, under a general act of Congress, well
guarded in its provisions. To such associations the
government might furnish circulating notes, on the security
of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These
notes, prepared under the supervision of proper oﬀicers,
being uniform in appearance and security and convertible
always into coin, would at once protect labor against the
evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by
cheap and safe exchanges.
A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds
would compensate the United States for the preparation
and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of
 the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the
public debt employed as securities. The public credit,
moreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of
new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand
for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed
system would create.
It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of
considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would
reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the
opportunity oﬀered to existing institutions to reorganize
under the act, substituting only the secured uniform
national circulation for the local and various circulation,
secured and unsecured, now issued by them.
The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including
loans and balance from the preceding year, for the ﬁscal
year ending on the 30th June, 1862, were  583,885,247.06,
of which sum  49,056,397.62 were derived from customs;
 1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public lands,
 152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources,  931,787.64;
from loans in all forms,  529,692,460.50. The remainder,
 2,257,065.80, was the balance from last year.
The disbursements during the same period were: For
congressional, 
executive, 
and 
judicial 
purposes,
 5,939,009.29; for foreign intercourse,  1,339,710.35; for
miscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans, post-
oﬀice deﬁciencies, collection of revenue, and other like
charges,  14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior
Department,  3,102,985.52; under the War Department,
 394,368,407.36; 
under 
the 
Navy 
Department,
  42,674,569.69; 
for 
interest 
on 
public 
debt,
 13,190,324.45; and for payment of public debt, including
reimbursement 
of 
temporary 
loan 
and 
redemptions,
 96,096,922.09; making an aggregate of  570,841,700.25,
and leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July,
1862, of  13,043,546.81.
It should be observed that the sum of  96,096,922.09,
expended for reimbursements and redemption of public
debt, being included also in the loans made, may be
properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures,
leaving the actual receipts for the year  487,788,324.97,
and the expenditures  474,744,778.16.
Other information on the subject of the ﬁnances will be
found in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to
whose statements and views I invite your most candid and
considerate attention.
The reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are
herewith transmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are
scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous
and extensive transactions and operations conducted
through those departments. Nor could I give a summary of
them here upon any principle which would admit of its
being much shorter than the reports themselves. I
therefore content myself with laying the reports before you
and asking your attention to them.
It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in
the ﬁnancial condition of the Post-Oﬀice Department as
compared with several preceding years. The receipts for
the ﬁscal year 1861 amounted to  8,349,296.40, which
 embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for
three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation
of revenue from the so-called seceded States during the
last ﬁscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the
loyal States has been suﬀicient to produce a revenue
during the same year of  8,299,820.90, being only  50,000
less than was derived from all the States of the Union
during the previous year. The expenditures show a still
more favorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was
 13,606,759.11. For the last year the amount has been
reduced to  11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about
 2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the
preceding year, and about  3,750,000 as compared with
the ﬁscal year 1860. The deﬁciency in the department for
the previous year was  4,551,966.98. For the last ﬁscal
year it was reduced to  2,112,814.57. These favorable
results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in
the insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of
all expenditures in that department in the interest of
economy. The eﬀiciency of the postal service, it is believed,
has also been much improved. The Postmaster-General has
also opened a correspondence through the Department of
State with foreign governments proposing a convention of
postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the
rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails.
This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens
and to the commercial interests of this country, has been
favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments
from whom replies have been received.
 I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the
Postmaster-General in his report respecting the further
legislation required, in his opinion, for the beneﬁt of the
postal service.
The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard
to the public lands:
“The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue.
From the 1st July, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the
entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were  137,476.2
— a sum much less than the expenses of our land system
during the same period. The homestead law, which will take
eﬀect on the 1st of January next, oﬀers such inducements
to settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an
extent suﬀicient to meet the expenses of the General Land
Oﬀice and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into
market.”
The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising
from the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from
the same source as reported from the Treasury Department
arises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods of
time, though apparently were not really coincident at the
beginning 
point, 
the 
Treasury 
report 
including 
a
considerable sum now which had previously been reported
from the Interior, suﬀiciently large to greatly overreach the
sum derived from the three months now reported upon by
the Interior and not by the Treasury.
The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past
year manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several
points have engaged in open hostilities against the white
 settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the
Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance
to the United States and entered into treaties with the
insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States
were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees
has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former
relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges
that they were constrained by superior force to enter into
treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States
neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty
stipulations required.
In the month of August last the Sioux Indians in
Minnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with
extreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women, and
children. This attack was wholly unexpected, and therefore
no means of defense had been provided. It is estimated that
not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and a
large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak
was induced is not deﬁnitely known, and suspicions, which
may be unjust, need not to be stated. Information was
received by the Indian Bureau from diﬀerent sources about
the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous
attack was to be made upon white settlements by all the
tribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky
Mountains. The State of Minnesota has suﬀered great
injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her territory
has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained
by the destruction of property. The people of that State
manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond
 the limits of the State as a guaranty against future
hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Aﬀairs will furnish
full details. I submit for your especial consideration
whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many
wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that
this can be proﬁtably done.
I 
submit 
a 
statement 
of 
the 
proceedings 
of
commissioners, which shows the progress that has been
made in the enterprise of constructing the Paciﬁc Railroad.
And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and
also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now
pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the
great canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital and
rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and
especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be
noticed at some greater length. I purpose having prepared
and laid before you at an early day some interesting and
valuable statistical information upon this subject. The
military and commercial importance of enlarging the
Illinois and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River
is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the
Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I
respectfully ask attention to it.
To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the
15th of May last, I have caused the Department of
Agriculture of the United States to be organized.
The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a
few months this department has established an extensive
system of correspondence and exchanges, both at home
 and abroad, which promises to eﬀect highly beneﬁcial
results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent
improvements in agriculture, in the introduction of new
products, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics
of the diﬀerent States.
Also, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely
seeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already
published and liberally diﬀused much valuable information
in anticipation of a more elaborate report, which will in due
time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in
chemical science now in progress in the laboratory.
The creation of this department was for the more
immediate beneﬁt of a large class of our most valuable
citizens, and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has
been organized will not only meet your approbation, but
that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest
anticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the
fruitful source of advantage to all our people.
On the 22d day of September last a proclamation was
issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith
submitted.
In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second
paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your
attention 
to 
what 
may 
be 
called 
“compensated
emancipation.”
A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people,
and its laws. The territory is the only part which is of
certain durability. “One generation passeth away and
another generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever.”
 It is of the ﬁrst importance to duly consider and estimate
this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth’s surface
which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United
States is well adapted to be the home of one national
family, and it is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast
extent and its variety of climate and productions are of
advantage in this age for one people, whatever they might
have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and
intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous
combination for one united people.
In the inaugural address I brieﬂy pointed out the total
inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the diﬀerences
between the people of the two sections. I did so in language
which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to
repeat:
“One section of our country believes slavery is right and
ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong
and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial
dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and
the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are
each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a
community 
where 
the 
moral 
Sense 
of 
the 
people
imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the
people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and
a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly
cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the
separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave
trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately
revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive
 slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be
surrendered at all by the other.
“Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not
remove our respective sections from each other nor build
an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may
be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the
reach of each other, but the diﬀerent parts of our country
cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and
intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue
between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse
more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation
than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends
can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced
between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you
go to war, you cannot ﬁght always; and when, after much
loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease ﬁghting,
the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are
again upon you.”
There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a
national boundary upon which to divide. Trace through,
from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave
country, and we shall ﬁnd a little more than one third of its
length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or
soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly
all its remaining length are merely surveyors’ lines, over
which people may walk back and forth without any
consciousness of their presence. No part of this line can be
made any more diﬀicult to pass by writing it down on paper
or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of
 separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding
section the fugitive-slave clause along with all other
constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from,
while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be
made to take its place.
But there is another diﬀiculty. The great interior region
bounded east by the Alleghenies, north by the British
dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the
line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and
which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of
Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of
Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above
10,000,000 people, and will have 50,000,000 within ﬁfty
years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It
contains more than one third of the country owned by the
United States — certainly more than 1,000,000 square
miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it
would have more than 75,000,000 people. A glance at the
map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great body
of the Republic. The other parts are but marginal borders
to it, the magniﬁcent region sloping west from the Rocky
Mountains to the Paciﬁc being the deepest and also the
richest in undeveloped resources. In the production of
provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from
them this great interior region is naturally one of the most
important in the world. Ascertain from statistics the small
proportion of the region which has yet been brought into
cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing
 amount of products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the
magnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region
has no seacoast — touches no ocean anywhere. As part of
one nation, its people now ﬁnd, and may forever ﬁnd, their
way to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa
by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco; but separate
our common country into two nations, as designed by the
present rebellion, and every man of this great interior
region is thereby cut oﬀ from some one or more of these
outlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier, but by
embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.
And this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line
may be ﬁxed. Place it between the now free and slave
country, or place it south of Kentucky or north of Ohio, and
still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any
port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to
any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by
a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west,
and south, are indispensable to the well-being of the people
inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region. Which of
the three may be the best is no proper question. All are
better than either, and all of right belong to that people and
to their successors forever. True to themselves, they will
not ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow
rather that there shall be no such line.
Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these
communications to and through them to the great outside
world. They, too, and each of them, must have access to this
 Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any
national boundary.
Our national strife springs not from our permanent part;
not from the land we inhabit; not from our national
homestead. There is no possible severing of this but would
multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its
adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors
separation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion,
however much of blood and treasure the separation might
have cost.
Our strife pertains to ourselves — to the passing
generations of men — and it can without convulsion be
hushed forever with the passing of one generation.
In this view I recommend the adoption of the following
resolution and articles amendatory to the Constitution of
the United States:
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America, in Congress assembled, (two
thirds of both Houses concurring), That the following
articles be proposed to the Legislatures (or conventions) of
the several States as amendments to the Constitution of the
United States, all or any of which articles, when ratiﬁed by
three fourths of the said Legislatures (or conventions), to
be valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, viz.
ART. — Every State wherein slavery now exists which
shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before
the 
1st 
day 
of 
January, 
A.D. 
1900, 
shall 
receive
compensation from the United States as follows, to wit:
 The President of the United States shall deliver to every
such State bonds of the United States bearing interest at
the rate of — per cent. per annum to an amount equal to
the aggregate sum of —— — for each slave shown to have
been therein by the Eighth Census of the United States,
said bonds to be delivered to such State by instalments or
in one parcel at the completion of the abolishment,
accordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one
time within such State; and interest shall begin to run upon
any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as
aforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid
and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein
shall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or
the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.
ART. — All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom
by the chances of the war at any time before the end of the
rebellion shall be forever free; but all owners of such who
shall not have been disloyal shall be compensated for them
at the same rates as is provided for States adopting
abolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall
be twice accounted for.
ART. — Congress may appropriate money and otherwise
provide for colonizing free colored persons with their own
consent at any place or places without the United States.
I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at
some length. Without slavery the rebellion could never
have existed; without slavery it could not continue.
Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of
sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the African
 race amongst us. Some would perpetuate slavery; some
would abolish it suddenly and without compensation; some
would abolish it gradually and with compensation; some
would remove the freed people from us, and some would
retain them with us; and there are yet other minor
diversities. Because of these diversities we waste much
strength 
in 
struggles 
among 
ourselves. 
By 
mutual
concession we should harmonize and act together. This
would be compromise, but it would be compromise among
the friends and not with the enemies of the Union. These
articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual
concessions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that
emancipation will follow, at least in several of the States.
As to the ﬁrst article, the main points are, ﬁrst, the
emancipation; 
secondly, 
the 
length 
of 
time 
for
consummating it (thirty-seven years); and, thirdly, the
compensation.
The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates
of perpetual slavery, but the length of time should greatly
mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time spares both races
from the evils of sudden derangement — in fact, from the
necessity of any derangement — while most of those whose
habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure
will have passed away before its consummation. They will
never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of
emancipation, but will deprecate the length of time. They
will feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves. But
it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant
destitution 
which 
must 
largely 
attend 
immediate
 emancipation in localities where their numbers are very
great, and it gives the inspiring assurance that their
posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each
State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at
the end of the century, or at any intermediate tune, or by
degrees extending over the whole or any part of the period,
and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also
provides for compensation, and generally the mode of
making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the
dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and
especially of those who are to receive the compensation.
Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive
will object. Yet the measure is both just and economical. In
a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of
property — property acquired by descent or by purchase,
the same as any other property. It is no less true for having
been often said that the people of the South are not more
responsible for the original introduction of this property
than are the people of the North; and when it is
remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and
sugar and share the proﬁts of dealing in them, it may not
be quite safe to say that the South has been more
responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then, for
a common object this property is to be sacriﬁced, is it not
just that it be done at a common charge?
And if with less money, or money more easily paid, we
can preserve the beneﬁts of the Union by this means than
we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it?
Let us consider it, then. Let us ascertain the sum we have
 expended in the war Since compensated emancipation was
proposed last March, and consider whether if that measure
had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave
States the same sum would not have done more to close the
war than has been otherwise done. If so, the measure
would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and
economical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay
something as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a
large sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to
pay any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we
are able. The war requires large sums, and requires them
at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated
emancipation of course would be large. But it would
require no ready cash, nor the bonds even any faster than
the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably
would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At
that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of
people to share the burden, instead of thirty-one millions as
now. And not only so, but the increase of our population
may be expected to continue for a long time after that
period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not
have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the
same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an
average, from our ﬁrst national census, in 1790, until that
of 1860, we should in 1900 have a population of
103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far
beyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad
national homestead, is our ample resource. Were our
territory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly
 our population could not expand as stated. Instead of
receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled
to send part of the native born away. But such is not our
condition. We have 2,963,000 square miles. Europe has
3,800,000, with a population averaging 73 persons to the
square mile. Why may not our country at some time
average as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste
surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other
causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage?
If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe,
how soon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the
past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever, depends
much on whether we maintain the Union...............
[a page of tables of projected statistics]
These ﬁgures show that our country may be as populous
as Europe now is at some point between 1920 and 1930,
say about 1925 — our territory, at 73 persons to the square
mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000.
And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves
relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or
by long and exhausting war springing from the only great
element of national discord among us. While it cannot be
foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession,
breeding lesser ones indeﬁnitely, would retard population,
civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the
extent of it would be very great and injurious.
The proposed emancipation would shorten the war,
perpetuate peace, insure this increase of population, and
proportionately the wealth of the country. With these we
 should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with
our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt
without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at
six per cent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of
our revolutionary struggle until to-day, without paying
anything on either principal or interest, each man of us
would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed
upon it then; and this because our increase of men through
the whole period has been greater than six per cent. — has
run faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus time alone
relieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases
faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt.
This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of
what is justly due, but it shows the great importance of
time in this connection — the great advantage of a policy
by which we shall not have to pay until we number
100,000,000 what by a diﬀerent policy we would have to
pay now, when we number but 31,000,000. In a word, it
shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war
than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan.
And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It
will be a saving of both.
As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable
to return to bondage the class of persons therein
contemplated. Some of them, doubtless, in the property
sense belong to loyal owners, and hence Provision is made
in this article for compensating such.
The third article relates to the future of the freed people.
It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in
 colonizing such as may consent. This ought nut to be
regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other,
insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual
consent of the people to be deported and the American
voters through their representatives in Congress.
I cannot make it better known than it already is that I
strongly favor colonization; and yet I wish to say there is an
objection urged against free colored persons remaining in
the country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes
malicious.
It is insisted that their presence would injure and
displace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could
be a proper time for mere catch arguments that time surely
is not now. In times like the present men should utter
nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible
through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored
people can displace any more white labor by being free
than by remaining slaves? If they stay in their old places,
they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places,
they leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is
neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without
deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white
labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the
customary amount of labor would still have to be
performed. The freed people would surely not do more than
their old proportion of it, and very probably for a time
would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers,
bringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently
enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a
 limited 
extent, 
enhanced 
wages 
to 
white 
labor 
is
mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity
in the market-increase the demand for it and you increase
the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor by
colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by
precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages
of white labor.
But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth
and cover the whole land. Are they not already in the land?
Will liberation make them any more numerous? Equally
distributed among the whites of the whole country, and
there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the
one in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many
communities now having more than one free colored
person to seven whites, and this without any apparent
consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia and
the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this
condition. The District has more than one free colored to
six whites, and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I
believe it has never presented the presence of free colored
persons as one of its grievances. But why should
emancipation South send the free people North? People of
any color seldom run unless there be something to run
from. Heretofore colored people to some extent have ﬂed
North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage
and 
destitution. 
But 
if 
gradual 
emancipation 
and
deportation be adopted, they will have neither to ﬂee from.
Their old masters will give them wages at least until new
laborers can be procured, and the freedmen in turn will
 gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be
found for them in congenial climes and with people of their
own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the
mutual interests involved. And in any event, cannot the
North decide for itself whether to receive them?
Again, as practice proves more than theory in any case,
has there been any irruption of colored people northward
because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last
spring?
What I have said of the proportion of free colored
persons to the whites in the District is from the census of
1860, having no reference to persons called contrabands
nor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing
slavery here.
The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not
but that a restoration of the national authority would be
accepted without its adoption.
Nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation
of September 22, 1862, be stayed because of the
recommendation of this plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt
not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.
And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that
Congress provide by law for compensating any State which
may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been
acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be
only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments
apply to both.
This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion
of, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving
 the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is
presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan
would, I am conﬁdent, secure peace more speedily and
maintain it more permanently than can be done by force
alone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and
manner of payment and times of payment, would be easier
paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely
solely upon force. It is much, very much, that it would cost
no blood at all.
The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It
cannot become such without the concurrence of, ﬁrst, two
thirds of Congress, and afterwards three fourths of the
States. The requisite three fourths of the States will
necessarily include seven of the slave States. Their
concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their
severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day
upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would
end the struggle now and save the Union forever.
I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a
paper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the chief
magistrate of the nation, nor do I forget that some of you
are my seniors, nor that many of you have more experience
than I in the conduct of public aﬀairs. Yet I trust that in
view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will
perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue
earnestness I may seem to display.
Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted,
would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of
money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the
 national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate
both indeﬁnitely? Is it doubted that we here — Congress
and executive — can secure its adoption? Will not the good
people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?
Can we, can they, by any other means so certainly or so
speedily assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by
concert. It is not “Can any of us imagine better?” but “Can
we all do better?” Object whatsoever is possible, still the
question recurs, “Can we do better?” The dogmas of the
quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The
occasion is piled high with diﬀiculty, and we must rise with
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew
and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we
shall save our country.
Fellow-citizens, we can not escape history. We of this
Congress and this administration will be remembered in
spite 
of 
ourselves. 
No 
personal 
signiﬁcance 
or
insigniﬁcance can spare one or another of us. The ﬁery trial
through which we pass will light us down in honor or
dishonor to the latest generation. We say we are for the
Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know
how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how
to save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the
responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we assure
freedom to the free — honorable alike in what we give and
what we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the
last, best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this
could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just — a
 way which if followed the world will forever applaud and
God must forever bless.

WASHINGTON, December 3, 1862.
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
On the 3d of November, 1861, a collision took place oﬀ
the coast of Cuba between the United States war steamer
San Jacinto and the French brig Jules et Marie, resulting in
serious damage to the latter. The obligation of this
Government to make amends therefor could not be
questioned if the injury resulted from any fault On the part
of the San Jacinto. With a view to ascertain this, the subject
was referred to a commission of the United States and
French naval oﬀicers at New York, with a naval oﬀicer of
Italy as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived at was that the
collision was occasioned by the failure of the San Jacinto
seasonably to reverse her engine. It then became necessary
to ascertain the amount of indemniﬁcation due to the
injured party. The United States consul-general at Havana
was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of
France on this point, and they have determined that the
sum of  9,500 is an equitable allowance under the
circumstances.
I recommend an appropriation of this sum for the beneﬁt
of the owners of the Jules et Marie.
 A copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of
the United States at Havana, to the Secretary of State on
the subject is herewith transmitted.

TO 
THE 
SENATE 
OF THE UNITED STATES: In
compliance with your resolution of December 5, 1862,
requesting the President “to furnish the Senate with all
information in his possession touching the late Indian
barbarities in the State of Minnesota, and also the evidence
in his possession upon which some of the principal actors
and head men were tried and condemned to death,” I have
the honor to state that on receipt of said resolution, I
transmitted the same to the Secretary of the Interior,
accompanied by a note, a copy of which is herewith
inclosed, marked A, and in response to which I received,
through that department, a letter of the Commissioner of
Indian Aﬀairs, a copy of which is herewith inclosed, marked
B.
I further state that on the eighth day of November last I
received a long telegraphic despatch from Major-General
Pope, at St. Paul, Minnesota, simply announcing the names
of the persons sentenced to be hanged. I immediately
telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all cases
forwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach
me until two or three days before the present meeting of
Congress. Meantime I received, through telegraphic
 despatches and otherwise, appeals in behalf of the
condemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions of
opinion as to the proper policy in regard to them and to the
Indians generally in that vicinity, none of which, as I
understand, falls within the scope of your inquiry. After the
arrival of the transcripts of records, but before I had
suﬀicient opportunity to examine them, I received a joint
letter 
from 
one 
of 
the 
senators 
and 
two 
of 
the
representatives from Minnesota, which contains some
statements of fact not found in the records of the trials, and
for which reason I herewith transmit a copy, marked C. I
also, for the same reason, inclose a printed memorial of the
citizens of St. Paul, addressed to me, and forwarded with
the letter aforesaid.
Anxious to not act with so much clemency as to
encourage another outbreak on the one hand, nor with so
much severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I caused a
careful examination of the records of trials to be made, in
view of ﬁrst ordering the execution of such as had been
proved guilty of violating females. Contrary to my
expectation, only two of this class were found. I then
directed a further examination and a classiﬁcation of all
who were proven to have participated in massacres, as
distinguished from participation in battles. This class
numbered forty, and included the two convicted of female
violation. One of the number is strongly recommended, by
the commission which tried them, for commutation to ten
years imprisonment I have ordered the other thirty-nine to
be executed on Friday the 19th instant. The order was
 despatched from here on Monday, the 8th instant, by a
messenger to General Sibley, and a copy of which order is
herewith transmitted, marked D.
An abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith
inclosed, marked E.
To avoid the immense amount of copying, I lay before the
Senate the original transcripts of the records of trials, as
received by me.
This is as full and complete a response to the resolution
as it is in my power to make.

E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON DECEMBER 12,
1862.
HON. FERNANDO WOOD.
MY DEAR SIR: — Your letter of the 8th, with the
accompanying note of same date, was received yesterday.
The most important paragraph in the letter, as I consider, is
in these words:
“On the 25th of November last I was advised by an
authority which I deemed likely to be well informed, as well
as reliable and truthful, that the Southern States would
send representatives to the next Congress, provided that a
full and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No
guarantee or terms were asked for other than the amnesty
referred to.”
I strongly suspect your information will prove to be
groundless; nevertheless, I thank you for communicating it
to me. Understanding the phrase in the paragraph just
quoted— “the Southern States would send representatives
to the next Congress” — to be substantially the same as
that “the people of the Southern States would cease
resistance, and would reinaugurate, submit to, and
maintain the national authority within the limits of such
States, under the Constitution of the United States,” I say
 that in such case the war would cease on the part of the
United States; and that if within a reasonable time “a full
and general amnesty” were necessary to such end, it would
not be withheld.
I do not think it would be proper now to communicate
this, formally or informally, to the people of the Southern
States. My belief is that they already know it; and when
they choose, if ever, they can communicate with me
unequivocally. Nor do I think it proper now to suspend
military operations to try any experiment of negotiation.
I should nevertheless receive with great pleasure the
exact information you now have, and also such other as you
may in any way obtain. Such information might be more
valuable before the 1st of January than afterwards.
While there is nothing in this letter which I shall dread to
see in history, it is, perhaps, better for the present that its
existence should not become public. I therefore have to
request that you will regard it as conﬁdential.

GAMBLE, 
SAINT 
Louis, 
MO.: 
It 
is
represented to me that the enrolled militia alone would
now maintain law and order in all the counties of your
State north of the Missouri River. If so all other forces there
might be removed south of the river, or out of the State.
Please post yourself and give me your opinion upon the
subject.
A. LINCOLN.

HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD AND HON. SALMON P.
CHASE.
GENTLEMEN: — You have respectively tendered me
your resignations as Secretary of State and Secretary of the
Treasury of the United States. I am apprised of the
circumstances which may render this course personally
desirable to each of you; but after most anxious
consideration my deliberate judgment is that the public
interest does not admit of it. I therefore have to request
that you will resume the duties of your departments
respectively.
Your obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.

HON. T. J. HENDERSON.
DEAR SIR:-Your letter of the 8th to Hon. William Kellogg
has just been shown me. You can scarcely overestimate the
pleasure it would give me to oblige you, but nothing is
operating 
so 
ruinously 
upon 
us 
everywhere 
as
“absenteeism.” It positively will not do for me to grant
leaves of absence in cases not suﬀicient to procure them
under the regular rules.
It would astonish you to know the extent of the evil of
“absenteeism.” We scarcely have more than half the men
we are paying on the spot for service anywhere.
Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN.

TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC: I have just read your
general’s report of the battle of Fredericksburg. Although
you were not successful, the attempt was not an error, nor
the failure other than accident. The courage with which
you, in an open ﬁeld, maintained the contest against an
intrenched foe, and the consummate skill and success with
which you crossed and recrossed the river in the face of the
enemy, show that you possess all the qualities of a great
army, which will yet give victory to the cause of the country
and of popular government.
Condoling with the mourners for the dead, and
sympathizing with the severely wounded, I congratulate
you that the number of both is comparatively so small.
I tender to you, oﬀicers and soldiers, the thanks of the
nation.
A. LINCOLN.
        
   
  
 
TO MISS FANNY McCULLOUGH.
E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December,
23, 1862.
DEAR FANNY: — It is with deep regret that I learn of the
death of your kind and brave father, and especially that it is
aﬀecting your young heart beyond what is common in such
cases. In this sad world of ours sorrow comes to all, and to
the young it comes with bittered agony because it takes
them unawares.
The older have learned ever to expect it. I am anxious to
aﬀord some alleviation of your present distress, perfect
relief is not possible, except with time. You cannot now
realize that you will ever feel better. Is not this so? And yet
it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again. To know
this, which is certainly true, will make you some less
miserable now. I have had experience enough to know what
I say, and you need only to believe it to feel better at once.
The memory of your dear father, instead of an agony, will
yet be a sad, sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer and
holier sort than you have known before.
Please present my kind regards to your aﬄicted mother.
Your sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.

HONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.
Sir: — Two Ohio regiments and one Illinois regiment
which were captured at Hartsville have been paroled and
are now at Columbus, Ohio. This brings the Ohio regiments
substantially to their homes. I am strongly impressed with
the belief that the Illinois regiment better be sent to
Illinois, where it will be recruited and put in good condition
by the time they are exchanged so as to re-enter the
service. They did not misbehave, as I am satisﬁed, so that
they should receive no treatment nor have anything
withheld from them by way of punishment.
Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.
