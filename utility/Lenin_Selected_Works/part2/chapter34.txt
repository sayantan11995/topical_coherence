To Comrade Sverdlov.

I learnt only last night that Zinoviev had issued a writ ten denial of his participation in Kamenev’s statement in Novaya Zhizn.

Why then have you not sent me anything???

I sent all the letters about Kamenev and Zinoviev to C.C. members only.—You know this; is it not strange then that you seem to doubt it?

It looks as if I will not be able to attend the Plenary Meeting, because “they are looking for me”. If you (+ Stalin, Sokolnikov and Dzerzhinsky) demand a compromise on the Zinoviev and Kamenev affair,{1} enter a proposal against me, to have the case referred to a Party court (the facts are clear that Zinoviev was also thwarting it deliberately); this will be a postponement.

“Kamenev’s resignation has been accepted”? From the C.C.? Please let me have the text of his statement. /p>
