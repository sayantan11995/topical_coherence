Let no one imagine that my experiments in dancing and the like marked a  stage of indulgence in my life. The reader will have noticed that even  then I had my wits about me. That period of infatuation was not  unrelieved by a certain amount of self-introspection on my part. I kept  account of every farthing I spent, and my expenses were carefully  calculated. Every little item such as omnibus fares or postage or a  couple of coppers spent on newspapers, would be entered, and the balance  struck every evening before going to bed. That habit has stayed with me  ever since, and I know that as a result, though I have had to handle  public funds amounting to lakhs, I have succeeded in exercising strict  economy in their disbursement, and instead of outstanding debts have had  invariably a surplus balance in respect of all the movements I have led.  Let every youth take a leaf out of my book and make it a point to  account for everything that comes into and goes out of his pocket, and  like me he is sure to be a gainer in the end. As I kept strict watch over my way of living, I could see that it was necessary to  economize. I therefore decided to reduce my expenses by half. My  accounts showed numerous items spent on fares. Again my living with a  family meant the payment of a regular weekly bill. It also included the  courtesy of occasionally taking members of the family out to dinner, and  likewise attending parties with them. All this involved heavy items for  conveyances, especially as, if the friend was a lady, custom required  that the man should pay all the expenses. Also dining out meant extra  cost, as no deduction could be made from the regular weekly bill for  meals not taken. It seemed to me that all these items could be saved, as  likewise the drain on my purse caused through a false sense of  propriety. So I decided to take rooms on my own account, instead of living any longer in a  family, and also to remove from place to place according to the work I  had to do, thus gaining experience at the same time. The rooms were so  selected as to enable me to reach the place of business on foot in half  an hour, and so save fares. Before this I had always taken some kind of  conveyance whenever I went anywhere, and had to find extra time for  walks. The new arrangement combined walks and economy, as it meant a  saving of fares and gave me walks of eight or ten miles a day. It was  mainly this habit of long walks that kept me practically free from  illness throughout my stay in England and gave me a fairly strong body. Thus I rented a suite of rooms; one for a sitting room and another for a bedroom. This  was the second stage. The third was yet to come. These changes saved me half the expense. But how was I to utilize the time? I knew  that Bar examinations did not require much study, and I therefore did  not feel pressed for time. My weak English was a perpetual worry to me.  Mr. (afterwards Sir Frederic) Lely's words, 'Graduate first and then  come to me', still rang in my ears. I should, I thought, not only be  called to the Bar, but have some literary degree as well. I inquired  about the Oxford and Cambridge University courses, consulted a few  friends, and found that, if I elected to go to either of these places,  that would mean greater expense and a much longer stay in England than I  was prepared for. A friend suggested that, if I really wanted to have  the satisfaction of taking a difficult examination, I should pass the  London Matriculation. It meant a good deal of labour and much addition  to my stock of general knowledge, without any extra expense worth the  name. I welcomed the suggestion. But the syllabus frightened me. Latin  and a modern language were compulsory! How was I to manage Latin? But  the friend entered a strong plea for it: 'Latin is very valuable to  lawyers. Knowledge of Latin is very useful in understanding law books.  And one paper in Roman Law is entirely in Latin. Besides a knowledge of  Latin means greater command over the English language.' It went home and  I decided to learn Latin, no matter how difficult it might be. French I  had already begun, so I thought that should be the modern language. I  joined a private Matriculation class. Examinations were held every six  months and I had only five months at my disposal. It was an almost  impossible task for me. But the aspirant after being an English  gentleman chose to convert himself into a serious student. I framed my  own time-table to the minute; but neither my intelligence nor memory  promised to enable me to tackle Latin and French besides other subjects  within the given period. The result was that I was ploughed in Latin. I  was sorry but did not lose heart. I had acquired a taste for Latin, also  I thought my French would be all the better for another trial and I  would select a new subject in the science group. Chemistry which was my  subject in science had no attraction for want of experiments, whereas it  ought to have been a deeply interesting study. It was one of the  compulsory subjects in India and so I had selected it for the London  Matriculation. This time, however, I chose Heat and Light instead of  Chemistry. It was said to be easy and I found it to be so. With my preparation for another trial, I made an effort to simplify my life  still further. I felt that my way of living did not yet befit the modest  means of my family. The thought of my struggling brother, who nobly  responded to my regular calls for monetary help, deeply pained me. I saw  that most of those who were spending from eight to fifteen pounds  monthly had the advantage of scholarships. I had before me examples of  much simpler living. I came across a fair number of poor students living  more humbly than I. One of them was staying in the slums in a room at  two shillings a week and living on two pence worth of cocoa and bread  per meal from Lockhart's cheap Cocoa Rooms. It was far from me to think  of emulating him, but I felt I could surely have one room instead of two  and cook some of my meals at home. That would be a saving of four to  five pounds each month. I also came across books on simple living. I  gave up the suite of rooms and rented one instead, invested in a stove,  and began cooking my breakfast at home. The process scarcely took me  more than twenty minutes for there was only oatmeal porridge to cook and  water to boil for cocoa. I had lunch out and for dinner bread and cocoa  at home. Thus I managed to live on a shilling and three pence a day.  This was also a period of intensive study. Plain living saved me plenty  of time and I passed my examination. Let not the reader think that this living made my life by any means a dreary affair.  On the contrary the change harmonized my inward and outward life. It was  also more in keeping with the means of my family. My life was certainly  more truthful and my soul knew no bounds of joy.
