Towards the end of my second year in England I came across two Theosophists,  brothers, and both unmarried. They talked to me about the Gita  They were reading Sir Edwin Arnold's translation – The Song Celestial – and  they invited me to read the original with them. I felt ashamed, as I  had read the divine poem neither in Samskrit nor in Gujarati. I was  constrained to tell them that I had not read the Gita,  but that I would gladly read it with them, and that though my  knowledge of Samskrit was meagre, still I hoped to be able to  understand the original to the extent of telling where the  translation failed to bring out the meaning. I began reading the Gita with them. The verses in the second chapter.
