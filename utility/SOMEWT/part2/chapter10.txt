I had expected someone on behalf of Dada Abdulla's attorney to meet me  at Pretoria station. I knew that no Indian would be there to receive  me, since I had particularly promised not to put up at an Indian  house. But the attorney had sent no one. I understood later that as  I had arrived on a Sunday, he could not have sent anyone without  inconvenience. I was perplexed, and wondered where to go, as I  feared that no hotel would accept me. Pretoria station in 1893 was quite different from what it was in  1914. The lights were burning dimly. The travellers were few. I let  all the other passengers go and thought that, as soon as the ticket  collector was fairly free, I would hand him my ticket and ask him if  he could direct me to some small hotel or any other such place where  I might go; otherwise I would spend the night at the station. I must  confess I shrank from asking him even this, for I was afraid of  being insulted. The station became clear of all passengers. I gave my ticket to the  ticket collector and began my inquiries. He replied to me  courteously, but I saw that he could not be of any considerable  help. But an American Negro who was standing near by broke into the  conversation. 'I see,' said he, 'that you are an utter stranger here, without any  friends. If you will come with me, I will take you to a small hotel,  of which the proprietor is an American who is very well known to me.  I think he will accept you.' I had my own doubts about the offer, but I thanked him and accepted  his suggestion. He took me to Johnson's Family Hotel. He drew Mr.  Johnson aside to speak to him, and the latter agreed to accommodate  me for the night, on condition that I should have my dinner served  in my room. 'I assure you,' said he, 'that I have no colour prejudice. But I  have only European custom, and, if I allowed you to eat in the  dining-room, my guests might be offended and even go away.' 'Thank you,' said I, 'even for accommodating me for the night. I am now  more or less acquainted with the conditions here, and I understand  your difficulty. I do not mind your serving the dinner in my room. I  hope to be able to make some other arrangement tomorrow.' I was shown into a room, where I now sat waiting for the dinner and  musing, as I was quite alone. There were not many guests in the  hotel, and I had expected the waiter to come very shortly with the  dinner. Instead Mr. Johnston appeared. He said: 'I was ashamed of  having asked you to have your dinner here. So I spoke to the other  guests about you, and asked them if they would mind your having your  dinner in the dining-room. They said they had no objection, and that  they did not mind your staying here as long as you liked. Please,  therefore, come to the dining-room, if you will, and stay here as  long as you wish.' I thanked him again, went to the dining-room and had a hearty dinner. Next morning I called on the attorney, Mr. A. W. Baker. Abdulla  Sheth had given me some description of him, so his cordial reception  did not surprise me. He received me very warmly and made kind  inquiries. I explained all about myself. Thereupon he said: 'We have  no work for you here as barrister, for we have engaged the best  counsel. The case is a prolonged and complicated one, so I shall  take your assistance only to the extent of getting necessary  information. And of course you will make communication with my  client easy for me, as I shall now ask for all the information I  want from him through you. That is certainly an advantage, I have  not yet found rooms for you. I thought I had better do so after  having seen you. There is a fearful amount of colour prejudice here,  and therefore it is not easy to find lodgings for such as you. But I  know a poor woman. She is the wife of a baker. I think she will take  you and thus add to her income at the same time. Come, let us go to  her place.' So he took me to her house. He spoke with her privately about me,  and she agreed to accept me as a boarder at 35 shilling a week. Mr. Baker, besides being an attorney, was a staunch lay preacher, He  is still alive and now engaged purely in missionary work, having  given up the legal profession. He is quite well-to-do. He still  corresponds with me. In his letters he always dwells on the same  theme. He upholds the excellence of Christianity from various points  of view, and contends that it is impossible to find eternal peace,  unless one accepts Jesus as the only son of God and the Saviour of  mankind. During the very first interview Mr. Baker ascertained my religious  views. I said to him: 'I am a Hindu by birth. And yet I do not know  much of Hinduism, and I know less of other religions. In fact I do  not know where I am, and what is and what should be my belief. I  intend to make a careful study of my own religion and, as far as I  can, of other religions as well.' Mr. Baker was glad to hear all this, and said: 'I am one of the  directors of the South Africa General Mission. I have built a church  at my own expense, and deliver sermons in it regularly. I am free  from colour prejudice. I have some co-workers, and we meet at one  o'clock every day for a few minutes and pray for peace and light. I  shall be glad if you will join us there. I shall introduce you to my  co-workers who will be happy to meet you, and I dare say you will  also like their company. I shall give you, besides, some religious  books to read, though of course the book of books is the Holy Bible,  which I would specially recommend to you.' I thanked Mr. Baker and agreed to attend the one o'clock prayers as  regularly as possible. 'So I shall expect you here tomorrow at one o'clock, and we shall go  together to pray,' added Mr. Baker, and we said good-bye. I had little time for reflection just yet. I went to Mr. Johnston, paid the bill and removed to the new  lodgings, where I had my lunch. The landlady was good woman. She had  cooked a vegetarian meal for me. It was not long before I made  myself quite at home with the family. I next went to see the friend to whom Dada Abdulla had given me a  note. From him I learnt more about the hardships of Indians in South  Africa. He insisted that I should stay with him. I thanked him, and  told him that I had already made arrangements. He urged me not to  hesitate to ask for anything I needed. It was now dark. I returned home, had my dinner, went to my room and  lay there absorbed in deep thought. There was not any immediate work  for me. I informed Abdulla Sheth of it. What, I thought, can be  the meaning of Mr. Baker's interest in me? What shall I gain from his  religious co-workers? How far should I undertake the study of  Christianity? How was I to obtain literature about Hinduism? And how  was I to understand Christianity in its proper perspective without  thoroughly knowing my own religion? I could come to only one  conclusion: I should make a dispassionate study of all that came to  me, and deal with Mr. Baker's group as God might guide me; I should  not think of embracing another religion before I had fully  understood my own. Thus musing I fell asleep..........
