The year's stay in Pretoria was a most valuable experience in my life.  Here it was that I had opportunities of learning public work and  acquired some measure of my capacity for it. Here it was that the  religious spirit within me became a living force, and here too I  acquired a true knowledge of legal practice. Here I learnt the  things that a junior barrister learns in a senior barrister's  chamber, and here I also gained confidence that I should not after  all fail as a lawyer. It was likewise here that I learnt the secret  of success as a lawyer. Dada Abdulla's was no small case. The suit was for £40,000. Arising  out of business transactions, it was full of intricacies of  accounts. Part of the claim was based on promissory notes, and part  on the specific performance of promise to deliver promissory notes.  The defence was that the promissory notes were fraudulently taken  and lacked sufficient consideration. There were numerous points of  fact and law in this intricate case. Both parties had engaged the best attorneys and counsel. I thus had  a fine opportunity of studying their work. The preparation of the  plaintiff's case for the attorney and the sorting of facts in  support of his case had been entrusted to me. It was an education to  see how much the attorney accepted, and how much he rejected from my  preparation, as also to see how much use the counsel made of the  brief prepared by the attorney. I saw that this preparation for the  case would give me a fair measure of my powers of comprehension and  my capacity for marshalling evidence. I took the keenest interest in the case. Indeed I threw myself into  it. I read all the papers pertaining to the transactions. My client  was a man of great ability and reposed absolute confidence in me,  and this rendered my work easy. I made a fair study of book-keeping.  My capacity for translation was improved by having to translate the  correspondence, which was for the most part in Gujarati. Although, as I have said before, I took a keen interest in religious  communion and in public work and always gave some of my time to  them, they were not then my primary interest. The preparation of the  case was my primary interest. Reading of law and looking up law  cases, when necessary, had always a prior claim on my time. As a  result, I acquired such a grasp of the facts of the case as perhaps  was not possessed even by the parties themselves, inasmuch as I had  with me the papers of both the parties. I recalled the late Mr. Pincutt's advice – facts are three-fourths  of the law. At a later date it was amply borne out by that famous  barrister of South Africa, the late Mr. Leonard. In a certain case  in my charge I saw that, though justice was on the side of my  client, the law seemed to be against him. In despair I approached  Mr. Leonard for help. He also felt that the facts of the case were  very strong. He exclaimed, 'Gandhi, I have learnt one thing, and it  is this, that if we take care of the facts of a case, the law will  take care of itself. Let us dive deeper into the facts of this  case.' With these words he asked me to study the case further and  then see him again. On a re-examination of the facts I saw them in  an entirely new light, and I also hit upon an old South African case  bearing on the point. I was delighted and went to Mr. Leonard and  told him everything, 'Right,' he said, 'we shall win the case. Only  we must bear in mind which of the judges takes it.' When I was making preparation for Dada Abdulla's case, I had not  fully realized this paramount importance of facts. Facts mean truth,  and once we adhere to truth, the law comes to our aid naturally. I  saw that the facts of Dada Abdulla's case made it very strong  indeed, and that the law was bound to be on his side. But I also saw  that the litigation, if it were persisted in, would ruin  the plaintiff and the defendant, who were relatives and both  belonged to the same city. No one knew how long the case might go  on. Should it be allowed to continue to be fought out in court, it  might go on indefinitely and to no advantage of either party. Both,  therefore, desired an immediate termination of the case, if  possible. I approached Tyeb Sheth and requested and advised him to go to  arbitration. I recommended him to see his counsel. I suggested to  him that, if an arbitrator commanding the confidence of both parties  could appointed, the case would be quickly finished. The lawyers'  fees were so rapidly mounting up that they were enough to devour all  the resources of the clients, big merchants as they were. The case  occupied so much of their attention that they had no time left for  any other work. In the meantime mutual ill-will was steadily  increasing. I became disgusted with the profession. As lawyers the  counsel on both sides were bound to rake up points of law in support  of their own clients. I also saw for the first time that the winning  party never recovers all the costs incurred. Under the Court Fees  Regulation there was a fixed scale of costs to be allowed as between  party and party, the actual costs as between attorney and client  being very much higher. This was more than I could bear. I felt that  my duty was to befriend both parties and bring them together. I  strained every nerve to bring about a compromise. At last Tyeb Sheth  agreed. An arbitrator was appointed, the case was argued before him,  and Dada Abdulla won. But that did not satisfy me. If my client were to seek immediate  execution of the award, it would be impossible for Tyeb Sheth to  meet the whole of the awarded amount, and there was an unwritten law  among the Porbandar Memans living in South Africa that death should  be preferred to bankruptcy. It was impossible for Tyeb Sheth to pay  down the whole sum of about £37,000 and costs. He meant to pay not  a pie less than the amount, and he did not want to be declared  bankrupt. There was only one way. Dada Abdulla should allow him to pay in  moderate installments. He was equal to the occasion, and granted Tyeb  Sheth installments spread over a very long period. It was more  difficult for me to secure this concession of payment by installments  than to get the parties to agree to arbitration. But both were happy  over the result, and both rose in the public estimation. My joy was  boundless. I had learnt the true practice of law. I had learnt to  find out the better side of human nature and to enter men's hearts.  I realized that the true function of a lawyer was to unite parties  riven asunder. The lesson was so indelibly burnt into me that a  large part of my time during the twenty years of my practice as a  lawyer was occupied in bringing about private compromises of  hundreds of cases. I lost nothing thereby - not even money,  certainly not my soul.
