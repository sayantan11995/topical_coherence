It is now time to turn again to my experiences with Christian friends. Mr. Baker was getting anxious about my future. He took me to the  Wellington Convention. The Protestant Christians organize such  gatherings every few years for religious enlightenment or, in other  words, self-purification. One may call this religious restoration or  revival. The Wellington Convention was of this type. The chairman  was the famous divine of the place, the Rev. Andrew Murray. Mr.  Baker had hoped that the atmosphere of religious exaltation at the  Convention, and the enthusiasm and earnestness of the people  attending it, would inevitably lead me to embrace Christianity. But his final hope was the efficacy of prayer. He had an abiding  faith in prayer. It was his firm conviction that God could not but  listen to prayer fervently offered. He would cite the instances of  men like George Muller of Bristol, who depended entirely on prayer  even for his temporal needs. I listened to his discourse on the  efficacy of prayer with unbiased attention, and assured him that  nothing could prevent me from embracing Christianity, should I feel  the call. I had no hesitation in giving him this assurance, as I had  long since taught myself to follow the inner voice. I delighted in  submitting to it. To act against it would be difficult and painful  to me. So we went to Wellington. Mr. Baker was hard put to it in having a  'coloured man' like me for his companion. He had to suffer  inconveniences on many occasions entirely on account of me. We had  to break the journey on the way, as one of the days happened to be a  Sunday, and Mr. Baker and his party would not travel on the Sabbath.  Though the manager of the station hotel agreed to take me in after  much altercation, he absolutely refused to admit me to the  dining-room. Mr. Baker was not the man to give in easily. He stood  by the rights of the guests of a hotel. But I could see his  difficulty. At Wellington also I stayed with Mr. Baker. In spite of  his best efforts to conceal the little inconveniences that he was  put to, I could see them all.  This Convention was an assemblage of devout Christians. I was  delighted at their faith. I met the Rev. Murray. I saw that many  were praying for me. I liked some of their hymns, they were very  sweet.  The Convention lasted for three days. I could understand and  appreciate the devoutness of those who attended it. But I saw no  reason for changing my belief – my religion. It was impossible for me to believe that I could go to  heaven or attain salvation only by becoming a Christian. When I  frankly said so to some good Christian friends, they were shocked.  But there was no help for it. My difficulties lay deeper. It was more than I could believe that  Jesus was the only incarnate son of God, and that only he who  believed in Him, would have everlasting life. If God could have  sons, all of us were His sons. If Jesus was like God, or God  Himself, then all men were like God and could be God Himself. My  reason was not ready to believe literally that Jesus by his death  and by his blood redeemed the sins of the world. Metaphorically  there might be some truth in it. Again, according to Christianity  only human beings had souls, and not other living beings, for whom  death meant complete extinction; while I held a contrary belief. I  could accept Jesus as a martyr, an embodiment of sacrifice, and a  divine teacher, but not as the most perfect man ever born. His death  on the Cross was a great example to the world, but that there was  anything like a mysterious or miraculous virtue in it my heart could  not accept. The pious lives of Christians did not give me anything  that the lives of men of other faiths had failed to give. I had seen  in other lives just the same reformation that I had heard of among  Christians. Philosophically there was nothing extraordinary in  Christian principles. From the point of view of sacrifice, it seemed  to me that the Hindus greatly surpassed the Christians. It was  impossible for me to regard Christianity as a perfect religion or  the greatest of all religions.  I shared this mental churning with my Christian friends whenever  there was an opportunity, but their answers could not satisfy me. Thus if I could not accept Christianity either as a perfect, or the  greatest religion, neither was I then convinced of Hinduism being  such. Hindu defects were pressingly visible to me. If untouchability  could be a part of Hinduism, it could but be a rotten part or an  excrescence. I could not understand the raison d'être  of a multitude of sects and castes. What was the meaning of saying  that the Vedas were the inspired Word of God? If they were inspired,  why not also the Bible and the Koran?  As Christian friends were endeavouring to convert me, even so were  Musalman friends. Abdulla Sheth had kept on inducing me to study  Islam, and of course he had always something to say regarding its  beauty.  I expressed my difficulties in a letter to Raychandbhai. I also  corresponded with other religious authorities in India and received  answers from them. Raychandbhai's letter somewhat pacified me. He  asked me to be patient and to study Hinduism more deeply. One of his  sentences was to this effect: 'On a dispassionate view of the  question I am convinced that no other religion has the subtle and  profound thought of Hinduism, its vision of the soul, or its  charity.'  I purchased Sale's translation of the Koran and began reading it. I  also obtained other books on Islam. I communicated with Christian  friends in England. One of them introduced me to Edward Maitland,  with whom I opened correspondence. He sent me The Perfect Way,  a book he had written in collaboration with Anna Kingsford. The book  was a repudiation of the current Christian belief. He also sent me  another book, The New Interpretation of the Bible.  I liked both. They seemed to support Hinduism. Tolstoy's  The Kingdom of God is Within You  overwhelmed me. It left an abiding impression on me. Before the  independent thinking, profound morality, and the truthfulness of  this book, all the books given me by Mr. Coates seemed to pale into  insignificance.  My studies thus carried me in a direction unthought of by the  Christian friends. My correspondence with Edward Maitland was fairly  prolonged, and that with Raychandbhai continued until his death. I  read some of the books he sent me. These included  Panchikaran, Maniratnamala, Mumukshu Prakaran  of Yogavasishtha, Haribhadra Suri's Shaddarshana Samuchchaya  and others.  Though I took a path my Christian friends had not intended for me, I  have remained for ever indebted to them for the religious quest that  they awakened in me. I shall always cherish the memory of their  contact. The years that followed had more, not less, of such sweet  and sacred contacts in store for me.
