Sheth Haji Muhammad Haji Dada was regarded as the foremost leader of the  Indian community in Natal in 1893. Financially Sheth Abdulla Haji  Adam was the chief among them, but he and others always gave the  first place to Sheth Haji Muhammad in public affairs. A meeting was,  therefore, held under his presidentship at the house of Abdulla  Sheth, at which it was resolved to offer opposition to the Franchise  Bill.  Volunteers were enrolled. Natal-born Indians, that is, mostly  Christian Indian youths, had been invited to attend this meeting. Mr.  Paul, the Durban court interpreter, and Mr. Subhan Godfrey,  headmaster of a mission school, were present, and it was they who  were responsible for bringing together at the meeting a good number  of Christian youths. All these enrolled themselves as volunteers. Many of the local merchants were of course enrolled, noteworthy  among them Sheths Dawud Muhammad, Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin, Adamji  Miyakhan, A. Kolandavellu Pillai, C. Lachhiram, Rangasami Padiachi,  and Amod Jiva. Parsi Rustomji was of course there. From among the  clerks were Messrs Manekji, Joshi, Narsinhram and others, employees  of Dada Abdulla and Co. and other big firms. They were all agreeably  surprised to find themselves taking a share in public work. To be  invited thus to take part was a new experience in their lives. In  face of the calamity that had overtaken the community, all  distinctions such as high and low, small and great, master and  servant, Hindus, Musalmans, Parsis, Christians, Gujaratis, Madrasis,  Sindhis, etc., were forgotten. All were alike the children and  servants of the motherland.  The bill had already passed, or was about to pass, its second  reading. In the speeches on the occasion the fact that Indians had  expressed no opposition the stringent bill was urged as proof of  their unfitness for the franchise.  I explained the situation to the meeting. The first thing we did was  to despatch a telegram to the Speaker of the Assembly requesting him  to postpone further discussion of the bill. A similar telegram was  sent to the premier, Sir John Robinson, and another to Mr. Escombe,  as a friend of Dada Abdulla's. The Speaker promptly replied that  discussion of the bill would be postponed for two days. This  gladdened our hearts.  The petition to be presented to the Legislative Assembly was drawn  up. Three copies had to be prepared and one extra was needed for the  press. It was also proposed to obtain as many signatures to it as  possible, and all this work had to be done in the course of a night.  The volunteers with a knowledge of English and several others sat up  the whole night. Mr. Arthur, an old man, who was known for his  calligraphy, wrote the principal copy. The rest were written by others  to someone's dictation. Five copies were thus got ready  simultaneously. Merchant volunteers went out in their own carriages,  or carriages whose hire they had paid, to obtain signatures to the  petition. This was accomplished in quick time and the petition was despatched. The newspapers published it with favourable  comments. It likewise created an impression on the Assembly. It was  discussed in the House. Partisans of the Bill offered a  defence – an admittedly lame one – in reply to the arguments advanced in the  petition. The ill, however, was passed. We all knew that this was a foregone conclusion, but the agitation had infused new life into the  community and had brought home to them the conviction that the  community was one and indivisible, and that it was as much their  duty to fight for its political rights as for its trading rights. Lord Ripon was at this time Secretary of State for the Colonies. It  was decided to submit to him a monster petition. This was no small  task and could not be done in a day. Volunteers were enlisted, and  all did their due share of the work.  I took considerable pains over drawing up this petition. I read all  the literature available on the subject. My argument centred round a  principle and on expedience. I argued that we had a right to the  franchise in Natal, as we had a kind of franchise in India. I urged  that it was expedient to retain it, as the Indian population capable  of using the franchise was very small.  Ten thousand signatures were obtained in the course of a fortnight.  To secure this number of signatures from the whole of the province  was no light task, especially when we consider that the men were  perfect strangers to the work. Specially competent volunteers had to  be selected for the work, as it had been decided not to take a  single signature without the signatory fully understanding the  petition. The villages were scattered at long distances. The work  could be done promptly only if a number of workers put their whole  heart into it. And this they did. All carried out their allotted  task with enthusiasm.  But as I am writing these lines, figures of  Sheth Dawud Muhammad, Rustomji, Adamji Miyakhan, and  Amod Jiva rise clearly before my mind. They brought in the largest  number of signatures. Dawud Sheth kept going about in his carriage  the whole day. And it was all a labour of love, not one of them  asking for even his out-of-pocket expenses. Dada Abdulla's house  became at once a caravanserai and a public office. A number of  educated fiends who helped me and many others had their food there.  Thus every helper was put to considerable expense.  The petition was at last submitted. A thousand copies had been  printed for circulation and distribution. It acquainted the Indian  public for the first time with conditions in Natal. I sent copies to  all the newspapers and publicists I knew.  The Times of India,  in a leading article on the petition, strongly supported the Indian  demands. Copies were sent to journals and publicists in England  representing different parties. The London Times  supported our claims, and we began to entertain hopes of the bill  being vetoed.  It was now impossible for me to leave Natal. The Indian friends  surrounded me on all sides and importuned me to remain there  permanently. I expressed my difficulties. I had made up my mind not  to stay at public expense. I felt it necessary to set up an  independent household. I thought that the house should be good and  situated in a good locality. I also had the idea that I could not  add to the credit of the community, unless I lived in a  style usual for barristers. And it seemed to me to be impossible to  run such a household with anything less than £300 a year. I therefore  decided that I could stay only if the members of the community  guaranteed legal work to the extent of that minimum, and I  communicated my decision to them.  'But,' said they, 'we should like you to draw that amount for public  work, and we can easily collect it. Of course, this is apart from the  fees you must charge for private legal work.'  'No, I could not thus charge you for public work,' said I. 'The work  would not involve the exercise on my part of much skill as  barrister. My work would be mainly to make you all work. And how  could I charge you for that? And then I should have to appeal to you  frequently for funds for the work, and if I were to draw my  maintenance from you, I should find myself at a disadvantage in  making an appeal for large amounts, and we should ultimately find  ourselves at a standstill. Besides I want the community to find more  than £300 annually for public work.'  'But we have now known you for  some time, and are sure you would not draw anything you do not need.  And if we wanted you to stay here, should we not find your  expenses?'  'It is your love and present enthusiasm that make you talk like  this. How can we be sure that this love and enthusiasm will endure  for ever? And as your friend and servant, I should occasionally have  to say hard things to you. Heaven only knows whether I should then  retain your affection. But the fact is that I must not accept any  salary for public work. It is enough for me that you should all  agree to entrust me with your legal work. Even that may be hard for  you. For one thing I am not a white barrister. How can I be sure  that the court will respond to me? Nor can I be sure how I shall  fare as a lawyer. So even in giving me retainers you may be running  some risk. I should regard even the fact of your giving them to me  as the reward of my public work.'  The upshot of this discussion was that about twenty merchants gave  me retainers for one year for their legal work. Besides this, Dada  Abdulla purchased me the necessary furniture in lieu of a purse he  had intended to give me on my departure. Thus I settled in Natal.
