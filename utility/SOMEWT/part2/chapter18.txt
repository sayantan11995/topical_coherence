The symbol of a Court of justice is pair of scales held evenly by an  impartial and blind but sagacious woman. Fate has purposely made her  blind, in order that she may not judge a person from his exterior  but from his intrinsic worth. But the Law Society of Natal set out  to persuade the Supreme Court to act in contravention of this  principle and to belie its symbol.  I applied for admission as an advocate of the Supreme Court. I held  a certificate of admission from the Bombay High Court. The English  certificate I had to deposit with the Bombay High Court when I was  enrolled there. It was necessary to attach two certificates of  character to the application for admission, and thinking that these  would carry more weight if given by Europeans, I secured them from  two well-known European merchants whom I knew through Sheth Abdulla.  The application had to be presented through a member of the bar, and  as a rule the Attorney General presented such applications without  fees. Mr. Escombe, who, as we have seen, was legal adviser to  Messrs. Dada Abdulla & Co, was the Attorney General. I called on  him, and he willingly consented to present my application. The Law Society now sprang a surprise on me by serving me with a  notice opposing my application for admission. One of their  objections was that the original English certificate was not  attached to my application. But the main objection was that, when  the regulations regarding admission of advocates were made, the  possibility of a coloured man applying could not have been  contemplated. Natal owed its growth to European enterprise, and  therefore it was necessary that the European element should  predominate in the bar. If coloured people were admitted, they might  gradually outnumber the Europeans, and the bulwark of their  protection would break down.  The Law Society had engaged a distinguished lawyer to support their  opposition. As he too was connected with Dada Abdulla & Co., he sent  me word through Sheth Abdulla to go and see him. He talked with me  quite frankly, and inquired about my antecedents, which I gave. Then  he said:  'I have nothing to say against you. I was only afraid lest you  should be some colonial-born adventurer. And the fact that your  application was unaccompanied by the original certificate supported  my suspicion. There have been men who have made use of diplomas  which did not belong to them. The certificates of character from  European traders you have submitted have no value for me. What do  they know about you? What can be the extent of their acquaintance  with you?  'But,' said I, 'everyone here is a stranger to me. Even Sheth  Abdulla first came to know me here.'  'But then you say he belongs to the same place as you? It your  father was Prime Minister there, Sheth Abdulla is bound to know your  family. if you were to produce his affidavit, I should have  absolutely no objection. I would then gladly communicate to the Law  Society my inability to oppose your application.'  This talk enraged me, but I restrained my feelings. 'If I had  attached Dada Abdulla's certificate,' said I to myself, 'it would  have been rejected, and they would have asked for Europeans'  certificates. And what has my admission as advocate to do with my  birth and my antecedents? How could my birth, whether humble or  objectionable, be used against me?' But I contained myself and  quietly replied:  'Though I do not admit that the Law Society has any authority to  require all these details, I am quite prepared to present the  affidavit you desire.'  Sheth Abdulla's affidavit was prepared and duly submitted to the  counsel for the Law Society. He said he was satisfied. But not so  the Law Society. it opposed my application before the Supreme Court,  which ruled out the opposition without even calling upon Mr. Escombe  to reply. The Chief justice said in effect:  'The objection that the applicant has not attached the original  certificate has no substance. If he has made a false affifavit, he  can be prosecuted, and his name can then be struck off the roll, if  he is proved guilty. The law makes no distinction between white and  coloured people. The court has therefore no authority to prevent Mr.  Gandhi from being enrolled as an advocate. We admit his application.  Mr. Gandhi, you can now take the oath.'  I stood up and took the oath before the Registar. As soon as I was  sworn in, the Chief Justice, addressing me, said:  'You must now take off your turban, Mr. Gandhi. you must submit to  the rules of the court with regard to the dress to be worn by practising barristers.' I saw my limitations. The turban that I had insisted on wearing in  the District Magistrate's Court I took off in obedience to the order  of the Supreme Court. Not that, if I had resisted the order, the  resistance could not have been justified. But I wanted to reserve my  strength for fighting bigger battles. I should not exhaust my skill  as a fighter in insisting on retaining my turban. It was worthy of a  better cause.  Sheth Abdulla and other friends did not like my  submission (or was it weakness?). They felt that I should have stood  by my right to wear the turban while practising in the Court. I  tried to reason with them. I tried to press home to them the truth  of the maxim, 'When at Rome do as the Romans do.' 'It would be  right', I said, 'to refuse to obey, if in India an English officer  or judge ordered you to take off your turban; but as an officer of  the court, it would have ill become me to disregard a custom of the  court in the province of Natal.'  I pacified the friends somewhat with these and similar arguments,  but I do not think I convinced them completely, in this instance, of  the applicability of the principle of looking at a thing from a  different standpoint in different circumstances. But all my life  through, the very insistence on truth has taught me to appreciate the  beauty of compromise. I saw in later life that this spirit was an  essential part of Satyagraha. It has often meant endangering my life  and incurring the displeasure of friends. But truth is hard as  adamant and tender as a blossom.  The opposition of the Law Society gave me another advertisement in  South Africa. Most of the newspapers condemned the opposition and  accused the Law Society of jealousy. The advertisement, to some  extent, simplified my work.
