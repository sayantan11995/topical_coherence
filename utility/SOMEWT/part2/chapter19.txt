Practice as a lawyer was and remained for me a subordinate occupation. It was  necessary that I should concentrate on public work to justify my  stay in Natal. The despatch of the petition regarding the  disfranchising bill was not sufficient in itself. Sustained  agitation was essential for making an impression on the Secretary of  State for the Colonies. For this purpose it was thought necessary to  bring into being a permanent organization. So I consulted Sheth  Abdulla and other friends, and we all decided to have a public  organization of a permanent character.  To find out a name to be given to the new organization perplexed me  sorely. It was not to identify itself with any particular party. The  name 'Congress', I knew, was in bad odour with the Conservatives in  England, and yet the Congress was the very life of India. I wanted  to popularize it in Natal. It savoured of cowardice to hesitate to  adopt the name. Therefore, with full explanation of my reasons, I  recommended that the organization should be called the Natal Indian  Congress, and on the 22nd May the Natal Indian Congress came into  being.  Dada Abdulla's spacious room was packed to the full on that day. The  Congress received the enthusiastic approval of all present. Its  constitution was simple, the subscription was heavy. Only he who  paid five shillings monthly could be a member. The well-to-do  classes were persuaded to subscribe as much as they could. Abdulla  Sheth headed the list with £2 per month. Two other friends also  put down the same. I thought I should not stint my subscription, and  put down a pound per month. This was for me no small amount. But I  thought that I would not be beyond my means, if I was to pay my way  at all. And God helped me. We thus got a  considerable number of members who subscribed £1 per month. The  number of those who put down 10s. was even larger. Besides this,  there were donations which were gratefully accepted.  Experience showed that no one paid his subscription for the mere  asking. It was impossible to call frequently on members outside  Durban. The enthusiasm of one moment seemed to wear away the next.  Even the members in Durban had to be considerably dunned before they  would pay in their subscriptions.  The task of collecting subscriptions lay with me, I being the  secretary. And we came to a stage when I had to keep my clerk  engaged all day long in the work of collection. The man got tired of  the job, and I felt that, if the situation was to be improved, the  subscriptions should be made payable annually and not monthly and  that too strictly in advance. So I called a meeting of the Congress.  Everyone welcomed the proposal for making the subscription annual  instead of monthly and for fixing the minimum at £3. Thus the work  of collection was considerably facilitated.  I had learnt at the outset not to carry on public work with borrowed  money. One could rely on people's promises in most matters except in  respect of money. I had never found people quick to pay the amounts  they had undertaken to subscribe, and the Natal Indians were no  exception to the rule. As, therefore, no work was done unless there  were funds on hand, the Natal Indian Congress has never been in  debt.  My co-workers evinced extraordinary enthusiasm in canvassing  members. It was work which interested them and was at the same time  an invaluable experience. Large numbers of people gladly came  forward with cash subscriptions. Work in the distant villages of the  interior was rather difficult. People did not know the nature of  public work. And yet we had invitations to visit far away places,  leading merchants of every place extending their hospitality.  On one occasion during this tour the situation was rather difficult.  We expected our host to contribute £6, but he refused to give  anything more than £3. If we had accepted that amount from him,  others would have followed suit, and our collections would have been  spoiled. It was a late hour of the night, and we were all hungry.  But how could we dine without having first obtained the amount we  were bent on getting? All persuasion was useless. The host seemed to  be adamant. Other merchants in the town reasoned with him, and we  all sat up throughout the night, he as well as we determined not to  budge one inch. Most of my co-workers were burning with rage, but  they contained themselves. At last, when day was already breaking,  the host yielded, paid down £6 and feasted us. This happened at Tongaat,  but the repercussion of the incident was felt as far as  Stanger on the North Coast and Charlestown in the interior. It also  hastened our work of collection.  But collecting funds was not the only thing to do. In fact I had  long learnt the principle of never having more money at one's  disposal than necessary.  Meetings used to be held once a month or even once a week if  required. Minutes of the proceedings of the preceding meeting would  be read, and all sorts of questions would be discussed. People had  no experience of taking part in public discussion or of speaking  briefly and to the point. Everyone hesitated to stand up to speak. I  explained to them the rules of procedure at meetings and they  respected them. They realized that it was an education for them,  and many who had never been accustomed to speaking before an  audience soon acquired the habit of thinking and speaking publicly  about matters of public interest.  Knowing that in public work minor expenses at times absorbed large  accounts, I had decided not to have even the receipt books printed in  the beginning. I had a cyclostyle machine in my office, on which I  took copies of receipts and reports. Such things I began to get  printed only when the Congress coffers were full, and when the  number of members and work had increased. Such economy is essential  for every organization, and yet I know that it is not always  exercised. That is why I have thought it proper to enter into these  little details of the beginnings of a small but growing  organization.  People never cared to have receipts for the amounts  they paid, but we always insisted on the receipts being given. Every  pie was thus clearly accounted for, and I dare say the account books  for the year 1894 can be found intact even today in the records of  Natal Indian Congress. Carefully kept accounts are a  sine qua non for any organization. Without them it falls into disrepute. Without  properly kept accounts it is impossible to maintain truth in its  pristine purity.  Another feature of the Congress was service of colonial-born  educated Indians. The Colonial-born Indian Educational Association  was founded under the auspices of the Congress. The members  consisted mostly of these educated youths. They had to pay a nominal  subscription. The Association served to ventilate their needs and  grievances, to stimulate thought amongst them, to bring them into  touch with Indian merchants and also to afford them scope for  service of the community. It was a sort of debating society. The  members met regularly and spoke or read papers on different  subjects. A small library was also opened in connection with the  Association.  The third feature of the Congress was propaganda. This consisted in  acquainting the English in South Africa and England and people in  India with the real state of things in Natal. With that end in view  I wrote two pamphlets. The first was An Appeal to Every Briton in South Africa.  It contained a statement, supported by evidence, of the general  condition of Natal Indians. The other was entitled The Indian Franchise – An Appeal.  It contained a brief history of the Indian franchise in Natal with  facts and figures. I had devoted considerable labour and study to  the preparation of these pamphlets, and the result was quite  commensurate with the trouble taken. They were widely  circulated.  All this activity resulted in winning the Indians numerous friends  in South Africa and in obtaining the active sympathy of all parties  in India. It also opened out and placed before the South African  Indians a definite line of action.
