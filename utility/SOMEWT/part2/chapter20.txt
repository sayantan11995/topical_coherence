The heart's earnest and pure desire is always fulfilled. In my own  experience I have often seen this rule verified. Service of the poor  has been my heart's desire, and it has always thrown me amongst the  poor and enabled me to identify myself with them.  Although the members of the Natal Indian Congress included the  colonial-born Indians and the clerical class, the unskilled wage-earners, the indentured labourers were still outside its pale. The Congress was not yet theirs. They could not afford to belong to it  by paying the subscription and becoming its members. The Congress  could win their attachment only by serving them. An opportunity  offered itself when neither the Congress nor I was really ready for  it. I had put in scarcely three or four month's practice, and the  Congress also was still in its infancy, when a Tamil man in tattered  clothes, head-gear in hand, two front teeth broken and his mouth  bleeding, stood before me trembling and weeping. He had been heavily belaboured by his master. I learnt all about him from my clerk, who was a Tamilian. Balasundaram - as that was the visitor's name - was  serving his indenture under a well-known European resident of  Durban. The master, getting angry with him, had lost self-control,  and had beaten Balasundaram severely, breaking two of his teeth.  I sent him to a doctor. In those days only white doctors were  available. I wanted a certificate from the doctor about the nature  of the injury Balasundaram had sustained. I secured the certificate,  and straightway took the injured man to the magistrate, to whom I  submitted his affidavit. The magistrate was indignant when he read  it and issued a summons against the employer.  It was far from my desire to get the employer punished. I simply  wanted Balasundaram to be released from him. I read the law about  indentured labour. If an ordinary servant left service without  giving notice, he was liable to be sued by his master in a civil  court. With the indentured labourer the case was entirely different.  He was liable, in similar circumstances, to be proceeded against in  a criminal court and to be imprisoned on conviction. That is why Sir  William Hunter called the indenture system almost as bad as slavery.  Like the slave the indentured labourer was the property of his  master.  There were only two ways of releasing Balasundaram: either by  getting the Protector of Indentured Labourers to cancel his  indenture or transfer him to someone else, or by getting  Balasundaram's employer to release him. I called on the latter and  said to him: 'I do not want to proceed against you and get you  punished. I think you realize that you have severely beaten the man.  I shall be satisfied if you will transfer the indenture to someone  else.' To this he readily agreed. I next saw the Protector. He also  agreed, on condition that I found a new employer.  So I went off in search of an employer. He had to be a European, as  no Indians could employ indentured labour. At that time I knew very  few Europeans. I met one of them. He very kindly agreed to take on  Balasundaram. I gratefully acknowledged his kindness. The magistrate  convicted Balasundaram's employer, and recorded that he had  undertaken to transfer the indenture to someone else.  Balasundaram's case reached the ears of every indentured labourer,  and I came to be regarded as their friend. I hailed this connection  with delight. A regular stream of indentured labourers began to pour  into my office, and I got the best opportunity of learning their  joys and sorrows.  The echoes of Balasundaram's case were heard in far off Madras.  Labourers from different parts of the province, who went to Natal on  indenture, came to know of this case through their indentured  brethren.  There was nothing extraordinary in the case itself, but the fact  that there was someone in Natal to espouse their cause and publicly  work for them gave the indentured labourer a joyful surprise and  inspired him with hope.  I have said that Balasundaram entered my office, head-gear in hand.  There was a peculiar pathos about the circumstance which also showed  our humiliation. I have already narrated the incident when I was  asked to take off my turban. A practice had been forced upon every  indentured labourer and every Indian stranger to take off his head-gear, when visiting a European, whether the head-gear were a cap, turban or a scarf wrapped round the head. A salute even with both  hands was not sufficient. Balasundaram thought that he should follow  the practice even with me. This was the first case in my experience.  I felt humiliated and asked him to tie up his scarf. He did so, not  without a certain hesitation, but I could perceive the pleasure on  his face.  It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves  honoured by the humiliation of their fellow beings.
