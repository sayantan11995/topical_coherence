Balasundaram's case brought me into touch with the indentured Indians. What  impelled me, however, to make a deep study of their condition was  the campaign for bringing them under special heavy taxation. In the same year, 1894, the Natal Government sought to impose an annual tax  of £25 on the indentured Indians. The proposal astonished me. I put  the matter before the Congress for discussion, and it was  immediately resolved to organize the necessary opposition. At the outset I must explain briefly the genesis of the tax.  About the year 1860 the Europeans in Natal, finding that there was  considerable scope for sugar-cane cultivation, felt themselves in  need of labour. Without outside labour the cultivation of cane and  the manufacture of sugar were impossible, as the Natal Zulus were  not suited to this form of work. The Natal Government therefore  corresponded with the Indian Government, and secured their  permission to recruit Indian labour. These recruits were to sign an  indenture to work in Natal for five years, and at the end of the  term they were to be at liberty to settle there and to have full  rights of ownership of land. Those were the inducements held out to  them for the whites then had looked forward to improving their  agriculture by the industry of the Indian labourers after the term  of their indentures had expired. But the Indians gave more than had been expected of them. They grew  large quantities of vegetables. They introduced a number of Indian  varieties and made it possible to grow the local varieties cheaper.  They also introduced the mango. Nor did their enterprise stop at  agriculture. They entered trade. They purchased land for building,  and many raised themselves from the status of labourers to that of  owners of land and houses. Merchants from India followed them and  settled there for trade. The late Sheth Abubakar Amod was first  among them. He soon built up an extensive business. The white traders were alarmed. When they first welcomed the Indian  labourers, they had not reckoned with their business skill. They  might be tolerated as independent agriculturists, but their  competition in trade could not be brooked.  This sowed the seed of the antagonism to Indians. Many other factors  contributed to its growth. Our different ways of living, our  simplicity, our contentment with small gains, our indifference to  the laws of hygiene and sanitation, our slowness in keeping our  surroundings clean and tidy, and our stinginess in keeping our  houses in good repair – all these combined with the difference in  religion, contributed to fan the flame of antagonism. Through  legislation this antagonism found its expression in the  disfranchising bill and the bill to impose a tax on the indentured  Indians. Independent of legislation a number of pinpricks had  already been started.  The first suggestion was that the Indian labourers should be  forcibly repatriated, so that the term of their indentures might  expire in India. The Government of India was not likely to accept  the suggestion. Another proposal was therefore made to the effect  that:  1. the indentured labourer should return to India on the expiry of his indenture; or that  2. he should sign a fresh indenture every two years, an increment being given at each renewal; and that  3. in the case of his refusal to return to India or renew the indenture he should pay an annual tax of £25.  A deputation composed of Sir Henry Binns and Mr. Mason was sent to  India to get the proposal approved by the Government there. The  Viceroy at that time was Lord Elgin. He disapproved of the £25 tax,  but agreed to a poll tax of £3. I thought then, as I do even now,  that this was a serious blunder on the part of the Viceroy. In  giving his approval he had in no way thought of the interests of  India. It was no part of his duty thus to accommodate the Natal  Europeans. In the course of three or four years an indentured labourer with his wife and each male child over 16 and female child  over 13 came under the impost. To levy a yearly tax of £12 from a  family of four – husband, wife and two children – when the average  income of the husband was never more than 14s. a month, was  atrocious and unknown anywhere else in the world.  We organized a fierce campaign against this tax. If the Natal Indian  Congress had remained silent on the subject, the Viceroy might have  approved of even the £25 tax. The reduction from £25 to £3 was  probably due solely to the Congress agitation. But I may be mistaken  in thinking so. It may be possible that the Indian Government had  disapproved of the £25 tax from the beginning and reduced it to £3,  irrespective of the opposition from the Congress. In any case it was  a breach of trust on the part of the Indian Government. As trustee  of the welfare of India, the Viceroy ought never to have approved of  this inhuman tax.  The Congress could not regard it as any great achievement to have  succeeded in getting the tax reduced from £25 to £3. The regret was  still there that it had not completely safeguarded the interests of  the indentured Indians. It ever remained its determination to get  the tax remitted, but it was twenty years before the determination was  realized. And when it was realized, it came as a result of the labours of not only the Natal Indians but of all the Indians in  South Africa. The breach of faith with the late Mr. Gokhale became  the occasion of the final campaign, in which the indentured Indians  took their full share, some of them losing their lives as a result  of the firing that was resorted to, and over ten thousand suffering  imprisonment.  But truth triumphed in the end. The sufferings of the Indians were  the expression of that truth. Yet it would not have triumphed except  for unflinching faith, great patience, and incessant effort. Had the  community given up the struggle, had the Congress abandoned the  campaign and submitted to the tax as inevitable, the hated impost  would have continued to be levied from the indentured Indians until  this day, to the eternal shame of the Indians in South Africa and of  the whole of India.
