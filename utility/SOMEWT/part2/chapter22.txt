I found myself entirely absorbed in the service of the community,  the reason behind it was my desire for self-realization. I had made  the religion of service my own, as I felt that God could be realized  only through service. And service for me was the service of India,  because it came to me without my seeking, because I had an aptitude  for it. I had gone to South Africa for travel, for finding an escape  from Kathiawad intrigues and for gaining my own livelihood. But as I  have said, I found myself in search of God and striving for self-realization. Christian friends had whetted my appetite for knowledge, which had  become almost insatiable, and they would not leave me in peace, even  if I desired to be indifferent. In Durban Mr. Spencer Walton, the  head of the South Africa General Mission, found me out. I became  almost a member of his family. At the back of this acquaintance was  of course my contact with Christians in Pretoria. Mr. Walton had a  manner all his own. I do not recollect his ever having invited me to  embrace Christianity. But he placed his life as an open book before  me, and let me watch all his movements. Mrs. Walton was a very  gentle and talented woman. I liked the attitude of this couple. We  knew the fundamental differences between us. Any amount of  discussion could not efface them. Yet even differences prove  helpful, where there is tolerance, charity and truth. I liked Mr.  and Mrs. Walton's humility, perseverance and devotion to work, and  we met very frequently.  This friendship kept alive my interest in religion. It was  impossible now to get the leisure that I used to have in Pretoria  for my religious studies. But what little time I could spare I  turned to good account. My religious correspondence continued.  Raychandbhai was guiding me. Some friend sent me Narmadashanker's  book Dharma Vichar. Its preface proved very helpful. I had heard about the Bohemian way  in which the poet had lived, and a description in the preface of the  revolution effected in his life by his religious studies captivated  me. I came to like the book, and read it from cover to cover with  attention. I read with interest Max Muller's book, India â€“ What Can It Teach Us?  and the translation of the Upanishads  published by the Theosophical Society. All this enhanced my regard  for Hinduism, and its beauties began to grow upon me. It did not,  however, prejudice me against other religions. I read  Washington Irving's Life of Mahomet and His Successors  and Carlyle's panegyric on the Prophet. These books raised Muhammad  in my estimation. I also read a book called The Sayings of Zarathustra. Thus I gained more knowledge of the different religions. The study  stimulated my self-introspection and fostered in me the habit of  putting into practice whatever appealed to me in my studies. Thus I  began some of the Yogic practices, as well as I could understand  them from a reading of the Hindu books. But I could not get on very  far, and decided to follow them with the help of some expert when I  returned to India. The desire has never been fulfilled. I made too an intensive study of Tolstoy's books.  The Gospels in Brief, What to Do?  and other books made a deep impression on me. I began to realize  more and more the infinite possibilities of universal love. About the same time I came in contact with another Christian family.  At their suggestion I attended the Wesleyan church every Sunday. For  these days I also had their standing invitation to dinner. The  church did not make a favourable impression on me. The sermons  seemed to be uninspiring. The congregation did not strike me as  being particularly religious. They were not an assembly of devout  souls; they appeared rather to be worldly-minded people, going to  church for recreation and in conformity to custom. Here, at times, I  would involuntarily doze. I was ashamed, but some of my neighbours,  who were in no better case, lightened the shame. I could not go on  long like this, and soon gave up attending the service. My connection with the family I used to visit every Sunday was  abruptly broken. In fact it may be said that I was warned to visit  it no more. It happened thus. My hostess was a good and simple  woman, but somewhat narrow-minded. We always discussed religious  subjects. I was then re-reading Arnold's Light of Asia.  Once we began to compare the life of Jesus with that of Buddha.  'Look at Gautama's compassion!' said I. 'It was not confined to  mankind, it was extended to all living beings. Does not one's heart  overflow with love to think of the lamb joyously perched on his  shoulders? One fails to notice this love for all living beings in  the life of Jesus.' The comparison pained the good lady. I could  understand her feelings. I cut the matter short, and we went to the  dining room. Her son, a cherub aged scarcely five, was also with us.  I am happiest when in the midst of children, and this youngster and  I had long been friends. I spoke derisively of the piece of meat on  his plate and in high praise of the apple on mine. The innocent boy  was carried away and joined in my praise of the fruit.  But the mother? she was dismayed.  I was warned. I checked myself and changed the subject. The  following week I visited the family as usual, but not without  trepidation. I did not see that I should stop going there, I did not  think it proper either. But the good lady made my way easy.  'Mr. Gandhi,' she said, 'please don't take it ill if I feel obliged to  tell you that my boy is none the better for your company. Every day  he hesitates to eat meat and asks for fruit, reminding me of your  argument. This is too much. If he gives up meat, he is bound to get  weak, if not ill. How could I bear it? Your discussion should  henceforth be only with us elders. They are sure to react badly on  children.'  'Mrs---,' I replied, 'I am sorry. I can understand your feelings as  a parent, for I too have children. We can very easily end this  unpleasant state of things. What I eat and omit to eat is bound to  have a greater effect on the child than what I say. The best way,  therefore, is for me to stop these visits. That certainly need not  affect our friendship.'  'I thank you,' she said with evident relief.
