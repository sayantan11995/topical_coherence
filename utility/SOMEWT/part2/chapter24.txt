By now I had been three years in South Africa. I had got to know the  people and they had got to know me. In 1896 I asked permission to go  home for six months, for I saw that I was in for a long stay there.  I had established a fairly good practice, and could see that people  felt the need of my presence. So I made up my mind to go home, fetch  my wife and children, and then return and settle out there. I also  saw that, if I went home, I might be able to do there some public  work by educating public opinion and creating more interest in the  Indians of South Africa. The £3 tax was an open sore. There could  be no peace until it was abolished.  But who was to take charge of the Congress work and Education  Society in my absence? I could think of two men – Adamji Miyakhan and  Parsi Rustomji. There were many workers now available from the  commercial class. But the foremost among those who could fulfill the  duties of the secretary by regular work, and who also commanded the  regard of the Indian community, were these two. The secretary  certainly needed a working knowledge of English. I recommended the  late Adamji Miyakhan's name to the Congress, and it approved of his  appointment as secretary. Experience showed that the choice was a  very happy one. Adamji Miyakhan satisfied all with his perseverance,  liberality, amiability and courtesy, and proved to every one that  the secretary's work did not require a man with a barrister's degree  or high English education. About the middle of 1896 I sailed for home in the s. s. Pongola  which was bound for Calcutta.  There were very few passengers on board. Among them were two English  officers, with whom I came in close contact. With one of them I used  to play chess for an hour daily. The ship's doctor gave me a Tamil Self-Teacher  which I began to study. My experience in Natal had shown me that I  should acquire a knowledge of Urdu to get into closer contact with  the Musalmans, and of Tamil to get into closer touch with the Madras  Indians.  At the request of the English friend, who read Urdu with me, I found  out a good Urdu Munshi from among he deck passengers, and we made  excellent progress in our studies. The officer had a better memory  than I. He would never forget a word after once he had seen it; I  often found it difficult to decipher Urdu letters. I brought more  perseverance to bear, but could never overtake the officer. With Tamil I made fair progress. There was no help available, but  the Tamil Self-Teacher  was a well-written book, and I did not feel in need of much outside  help.  I had hoped to continue these studies even after reaching India, but  it was impossible. Most of my reading since 1893 has been done in  jail. I did make some progress in Tamil and Urdu, in jails –  Tamil in South African jails, and Urdu in Yeravda jail. But I never  learnt to speak Tamil, and the little I could do by way of reading  is now rusting away for want of practice. I still feel what a handicap this ignorance of Tamil or Telugu has  been. The affection that the Dravidians in South Africa showered on  me has remained a cherished memory. Whenever I see a Tamil or Telugu  friend, I cannot but recall the faith, perseverance and selfless  sacrifice of many of his compatriots in South Africa. And they were  mostly illiterate, the men no less than the women. The fight in  South Africa was for such, and it was fought by illiterate soldiers;  it was for the poor and the poor took their full share in it.  Ignorance of their language, however, was never a handicap to me in  stealing the hearts of these simple and good countrymen. They spoke  broken Hindustani or broken English, and we found no difficulty in  getting on with our work. But I wanted to requite their affection by  learning Tamil and Telugu. In Tamil, as I have said, I made some  little progress, but in Telugu, which I tried to learn in India, I  did not get beyond the alphabet. I fear now I can never learn these  languages, and am therefore hoping that the Dravidians will learn  Hindustani. The non-English-speaking among them in South Africa do  speak Hindi or Hindustani, however indifferently. It is only the  English-speaking ones who will not learn it, as though a knowledge  of English were an obstacle to learning our own languages. But I have digressed. Let me finish the narrative of my voyage. I  have to introduce to my readers the captain of the s .s. Poongola.  We had become friends. The good captain was a Plymouth Brother. Our  talks were more about spiritual subjects than nautical. He drew a  line between morality and faith. The teaching of the Bible was to  him child's play. Its beauty lay in its simplicity. Let all, men,  women and children, he would say, have faith in Jesus and his  sacrifice, and their sins were sure to be redeemed. This friend  revived my memory of the Plymouth Brother of Pretoria. The religion  that imposed any moral restrictions was to him no good.  My  vegetarian food had been the occasion of the whole of this  discussion. Why should I not eat meat, or for that matter beef? Had  not God created all the lower animals for the enjoyment of mankind  as, for instance, He had created the vegetable kingdom? These  questions inevitably drew us into religious discussion. We could not convince each other. I was confirmed in my opinion that  religion and morality were synonymous. The captain had no doubt  about the correctness of his opposite conviction. At the end of twenty-four days the pleasant voyage came to a close,  and admiring the beauty of the Hooghly, I landed at Calcutta. The  same day I took the train for Bombay.
