On the very day after my brother-in-law's death I had to go to Bombay  for the public meeting. There had hardly been time for me to think  out my speech. I was feeling exhausted after days and nights of  anxious vigil, and my voice had become husky. However, I went to  Bombay trusting entirely to God. I had never dreamt of writing out  my speech. In accordance with Sir Pherozeshah's instructions I reported myself  at his office at 5 P. M. on the eve of the meeting. 'Is your speech ready, Gandhi?' he asked. 'No, sir,' said I, trembling with fear, 'I think of speaking ex tempore.' 'That will not do in Bombay. Reporting here is bad, and if we would  benefit by this meeting, you should write out your speech, and it  should be printed before daybreak tomorrow. I hope you can manage  this?' I felt rather nervous, but I said I would try. 'Then, tell me, what time should Mr. Munshi  come to you for the  manuscript?' 'Eleven o'clock tonight,' said I. On going to the meeting the next day, I saw the wisdom of Sir  Pherozeshah's advice. The meeting was held in the hall of the Sir  Cowasji Jehangir Institute. I had heard that when Sir Pherozeshah  Mehta addressed meetings the hall was always packed – chiefly by the students intent on hearing him – leaving not an inch of room. This  was the first meeting of the kind in my experience. I saw that my  voice could reach only a few. I was trembling as I began to read my  speech. Sir Pherozeshah cheered me up continually by asking me to  speak louder and still louder. I have a feeling that, far from  encouraging me, it made my voice sink lower and lower. My old friend Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande came to my rescue. I handed  my speech to him. His was just the proper voice. But the audience  refused to listen. The hall rang with the cries of 'Wacha,' 'Wacha.'  So Mr. Wacha stood up and read the speech, with wonderful results.  The audience became perfectly quiet, and listened to the speech to  the end, punctuating it with applause and cries of 'shame' where  necessary. This gladdened my heart. Sir Pherozeshah liked the speech. I was supremely happy. The meeting won me the active sympathy of Sjt. Deshpande and a Parsi  friend, whose name I hesitate to mention, as he is a high-placed  Government official today. Both expressed their resolve to accompany  me to South Africa. Mr. C. M. Cursetji, who was then Small Causes  Court Judge, however, moved the Parsi friend from his resolve as he  had plotted his marriage. He had to choose between marriage and  going to South Africa, and he chose the former. But Parsi Rustomji  made amends for the broken resolve, and a number of Parsi sisters  are now making amends for the lady who helped in the breach, by  dedicating themselves to khadi work. I have therefore gladly  forgiven that couple. Sjt. Deshpande had no temptations of marriage,  but he too could not come. Today he is himself doing enough  reparation for the broken pledge. On my way back to South Africa I  met one of the Tyabjis at Zanzibar. He also promised to come and  help me, but never came. Mr. Abbas Tyabji is atoning for that  offence. Thus none of my three attempts to induce barristers to go  to South Africa bore any fruit. In this connection I remember Mr. Pestonji Padshah. I had been on  friendly terms with him ever since my stay in England. I first met  him in a vegetarian restaurant in London. I knew of his brother Mr.  Barjorji Padshah by his reputation as a 'crank'. I had never met  him, but friends said that he was eccentric. Out of pity for the  horses he would not ride in tramcars, he refused to take degrees in  spite of a prodigious memory, he had developed an independent  spirit, and he was a vegetarian, though a Parsi. Pestonji had not  quite this reputation, but he was famous for his erudition even in  London. The common factor between us, however, was vegetarianism,  and not scholarship, in which it was beyond my power to approach him. I found him out again in Bombay. He was Protonotary in the High  Court. When I met him he was engaged on his contribution to a Higher  Gujarati Dictonary. There was not a friend I had not approached for  help in my South African work. Pestonji Padshah, however, not only  refused to aid me, but even advised me not to return to South  Africa. 'It is impossible to help you,' he said. 'But I tell you I do not  like even your going to South Africa. Is there lack of work in our country? Look,  now, there is not a little to do for our language. I have to find  out scientific words. But this is only one branch of the work. Think  of the poverty of the land. Our people in South Africa are no doubt  in difficulty, but I do not want a man like you to be sacrificed for  that work. Let us win self-government here, and we shall  automatically help our countrymen there. I know I cannot prevail  upon you, but I will not encourage anyone of your type to throw in  his lot with you.' I did not like this advice, but it increased my regard for Mr.  Pestonji Padshah. I was struck with his love for the country and for  the mother tongue. The incident brought us closer to each other. I  could understand his point of view. But far from giving up my work  in South Africa, I became firmer in my resolve. A patriot cannot  afford to ignore any branch of service to the motherland. And for me  the text of the Gita was clear and emphatic:
