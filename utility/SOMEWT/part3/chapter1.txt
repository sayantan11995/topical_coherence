This was my first voyage with my wife and children. I have often observed  in the course of this narrative that, on account of child marriages  amongst middle class Hindus, the husband will be literate whilst the  wife remains practically unlettered. A wide gulf thus separates  them, and the husband has to become his wife's teacher. So I had to  think out the details of the dress to be adopted by my wife and  children, the food they were to eat, and the manners which would be  suited to their new surroundings. Some of the recollections of those  days are amusing to look back upon.  A Hindu wife regards implicit obedience to her husband as the  highest religion. A Hindu husband regards himself as lord and master  of his wife, who must ever dance attendance upon him.  I believed, at the time of which I am writing, that in order to look  civilized, our dress and manners had, as far as possible, to  approximate to the European standard. Because, I thought, only thus  could we have some influence, and without influence it would not be  possible to serve the community.  I therefore determined the style of dress for my wife and children.  How could I like them to be known as Kathiawad Banias? The Parsis  used then to be regarded as the most civilized people amongst  Indians, and so, when the complete European style seemed to be  unsuited, we adopted the Parsi style. Accordingly my wife wore the  Parsi sari, and the boys the Parsi coat and trousers. Of course no one could be  without shoes and stockings. It was long before my wife and children  could get used to them. The shoes cramped their feet and the  stockings stank with perspiration. The toes often got sore. I always  had my answers ready to all these objections. But I have an  impression that it was not so much the answers as the force of  authority that carried conviction. They agreed to the changes in  dress as there was no alternative. In the same spirit and with even  more reluctance they adopted the use of knives and forks. When my  infatuation for these signs of civilization wore away, they gave up  the knives and forks. After having become long accustomed to the new  style, it was perhaps no less irksome for me to return to the  original mode. But I can see today that we feel all the freer and  lighter for having cast off the tinsel of 'civilization'. On board the same steamer with us were some relatives and  acquaintances. These and other deck passengers I frequently met,  because, the boat belonging to my client's friends, I was free to move  about anywhere and every where I liked.  Since the steamer was making straight for Natal, without calling at  intermediate ports, our voyage was of only eighteen days. But as  though to warn us of the coming real storm on land, a terrible gale  overtook us, whilst we were only four days from Natal. December is a  summer month of monsoon in the southern hemisphere, and gales, great  and small, are, therefore, quite common in the southern seas at that  season. The gale in which we were caught was so violent and  prolonged that the passengers became alarmed. It was a solemn scene.  All became one in face of the common danger. They forgot their  differences and began to think of the one and only God - Musalmans,  Hindus, Christians and all. Some took various vows. The captain also  joined the passengers in their prayers. He assured them that, though  the storm was not without danger, he had had experience of many  worse ones, and explained to them that a well-built ship could stand  almost any weather. But they were inconsolable. Every minute were  heard sounds and crashes which foreboded breaches and leaks. The  ship rocked and rolled to such an extent that it seemed as though  she would capsize at any moment. It was out of the question for  anyone to remain on deck. 'His will be done' was the only cry on  every lip. So far as I can recollect, we must have been in this plight for about twenty-four hours. At last the sky cleared,  the sun made its appearance, and the captain said that the storm had  blown over. People's faces beamed with gladness, and with the  disappearance of danger disappeared also the name of God from their  lips, Eating and drinking, singing and merrymaking again became  the order of the day. The fear of death was gone, and the momentary  mood of earnest prayer gave place to maya1.  There were of course the usual namaz2  and the prayers, yet they had none of the solemnity of that dread hour.  But the storm had made me one with the passengers. I had little fear  of the storm, for I had had experience of similar ones. I am a good  sailor and do not get sea-sick. So I could fearlessly move amongst  the passengers, bringing them comfort and good cheer, and conveying  to them hourly reports of the captain. The friendship I thus formed  stood me, as we shall see, in very good stead.  The ship cast anchor in the port of Durban on the 18th or 19th of  December. The Naderi also reached the same day.  But the real storm was still to come.
