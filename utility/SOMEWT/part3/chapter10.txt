I must skip many other experiences of the period between 1897 and 1899  and come straight to the Boer War.  When the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the  Boers, but I believed then that I had yet no right, in such cases,  to enforce my individual convictions. I have minutely dealt with the  inner struggle regarding this in my history of the Satyagraha in  South Africa, and I must not repeat the argument here. I invite the  curious to turn to those pages. Suffice it to say that my loyalty to  the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that  war. I felt that, if I demanded rights as a British citizen, it was  also my duty, as such, to participate in the defence of the British  Empire. I held then that India could achieve her complete  emancipation only within and through the British Empire. So I  collected together as many comrades as possible, and with very  great difficulty got their services accepted as an ambulance corps.  The average Englishman believed that the Indian was a coward,  incapable of taking risks or looking beyond his immediate  self-interest. Many English friends, therefore, threw cold water on  my plan. But Dr. Booth supported it whole-heartedly. He trained us  in ambulance work. We secured medical certificates of fitness for  service. Mr. Laughton and the late Mr. Escombe enthusiastically  supported the plan, and we applied at last for service at the front.  The Government thankfully acknowledged our application, but said  that our services were not then needed.  I would not rest satisfied, however, with this refusal. Through the  introduction of Dr. Booth, I called on the Bishop of Natal. There  were many Christian Indians in our corps. The Bishop was delighted  with my proposal and promised to help us in getting our services  accepted.  Time too was working with us. The Boer had shown more  pluck, determination and bravery than had been expected; and our  services were ultimately needed.  Our corps was 1,100 strong, with  nearly 40 leaders, About three hundred were free Indians, and the  rest indentured. Dr. Booth was also with us. The corps acquitted  itself well. Though our work was to be outside the firing line, and  though we had the protection of the Red Cross, we were asked at a  critical moment to serve within the firing line. The reservation had  not been of our seeking. The authorities did not want us to be  within the range of fire. The situation, however, was changed after  the repulse at Spion Kop, and General Buller sent the message that,  though we were not bound to take the risk, Government would be  thankful if we would do so and fetch the wounded from the field. We  had no hesitation, and so the action at Spion Kop found us working  within the firing line. During these days we had to march from  twenty to twenty-five miles a day, bearing the wounded on  stretchers. Amongst the wounded we had the honour of carrying  soldiers like General Woodgate.  The corps was disbanded after six weeks' service. After the reverses  at Spion Kop and Vaalkranz, the British Commander-in-Chief abandoned  the attempt to relieve Ladysmith and other places by summary  procedure, and decided to proceed slowly, awaiting reinforcements  from England and India.  Our humble work was at the moment much applauded, and the Indians'  prestige was enhanced. The newspapers published laudatory rhymes  with the refrain, 'We are sons of Empire after all.'  General Buller mentioned with appreciation the work of the corps in  his despatch, and the leaders were awarded the War Medal.  The Indian community became better organized. I got into closer  touch with the indentured Indians. There came a greater awakening  amongst them, and the feeling that Hindus, Musalmans, Christians,  Tamilians, Gujaratis and Sindhis were all Indians and children of  the same motherland took deep root amongst them. Everyone believed  that the Indians' grievances were now sure to be redressed. At the  moment the white man's attitude seemed to be distinctly changed. The  relations formed with the whites during the war were of the  sweetest. We had come in contact with thousands of tommies. They  were friendly with us and thankful for being there to serve them. I cannot forbear from recording a sweet reminiscence of how human  nature shows itself at its best in moments of trial. We were  marching towards Chievely Camp where Lieutenant Roberts, the son of  Lord Roberts, had received a mortal wound. Our corps had the honour  of carrying the body from the field. It was a sultry day - the day  of our march. Everyone was thirsting for water. There was a tiny  brook on the way where we could slake our thirst. But who was to  drink first? We had proposed to come in after the tommies had  finished. But they would not begin first and urged us to do so, and  for a while a pleasant competition went on for giving precedence to  one another.
