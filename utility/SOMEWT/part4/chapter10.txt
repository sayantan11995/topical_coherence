A variety of incidents in my life have conspired to bring me in close  contact with people of many creeds and many communities, and my  experience with all of them warrants the statement that I have known  no distinction between relatives and strangers, countrymen and  foreigners, white and coloured, Hindus and Indians of other faiths,  whether Musalmans, Parsis, Christians or Jews. I may say that my  heart has been incapable of making any such distinctions. I cannot  claim this as a special virtue, as it is in my very nature, rather  than a result of any effort on my part, whereas in the case of ahimsa (non-violence), brahmacharya (celibacy),  aparigraha (non-possession) and other cardinal virtues, I am fully conscious of  a continuous striving for their cultivation.  When I was practising in Durban, my office clerks often stayed with  me, and there were among them Hindus and Christians, or to describe  them by their provinces, Gujaratis and Tamilians. I do not recollect  having ever regarded them as anything but my kith and kin. I treated  them as members of my family, and had unpleasantness with my wife if  ever she stood in the way of my treating them as such. One of the  clerks was a Christian, born of Panchama parents.  The house was built after the Western model and the rooms rightly  had no outlets for dirty water. Each room had therefore  chamber-pots. Rather than have these cleaned by a servant or a  sweeper, my wife or I attended to them. The clerks who made  themselves completely at home would naturally clean their own pots,  but the Christian clerk was a newcomer, and it was our duty to  attend to his bedroom. My wife managed the pots of the others, but  to clean those used by one who had been a Panchama seemed to her to  be the limit, and we fell out. She could not bear the pots being  cleaned by me, neither did she like doing it herself. Even today I  can recall the picture of her chiding me, her eyes red with anger,  and pearl drops streaming down her cheeks, as she descended the  ladder, pot in hand. But I was a cruelly kind husband. I regarded  myself as her teacher, and so harassed her out of my blind love for  her.  I was far from being satisfied by her merely carrying the pot. I  would have her do it cheerfully. So I said, raising my voice: 'I  will not stand this nonsense in my house.'  The words pierced her like an arrow.  She shouted back: 'Keep your house to yourself and let me go.' I  forgot myself, and the spring of compassion dried up in me. I caught  her by the hand, dragged the helpless woman to the gate, which was  just opposite the ladder, and proceeded to open it with the  intention of pushing her out. The tears were running down her cheeks  in torrents, and she cried: 'Have you no sense of shame? Must you so  far forget yourself? Where am I to go? I have no parents or  relatives here to harbour me. Being your wife, you think I must put  up with your cuffs and kicks? For Heaven's sake behave yourself, and  shut the gate. Let us not be found making scenes like this!'  I put on a brave face, but was really ashamed and shut the gate. If my  wife could not leave me, neither could I leave her. We have had  numerous bickerings, but the end has always been peace between us.  The wife, with her matchless powers of endurance, has always been  the victor.  Today I am in a position to narrate the incident with some  detachment, as it belongs to a period out of which I have  fortunately emerged. I am no longer a blind, infatuated husband, I  am no more my wife's teacher. Kasturba can, if she will, be as  unpleasant to me today, as I used to be to her before. We are tried  friends, the one no longer regarding the other as the object of  lust. She has been a faithful nurse throughout my illnesses, serving  without any thought of reward.  The incident in question occurred in 1898, when I had no conception  of brahmacharya.  It was a time when I thought that the wife was the object of the  husband's lust, born to do her husband's behest, rather than a  helpmate, a comrade and a partner in the husband's joys and sorrows. It was in the year 1900 that these ideas underwent a radical  transformation, and in 1906 they took concrete shape. But of this I  propose to speak in its proper place. Suffice it to say that with  the gradual disappearance in me of the carnal appetite, my domestic  life became and is becoming more and more peaceful, sweet and happy. Let no one conclude from this narrative of a sacred recollection  that we are by any means an ideal couple, or that there is a  complete identity of ideals between us. Kasturba herself does not  perhaps know whether she has any ideals independently of me. It is  likely that many of my doings have not her approval even today. We  never discuss them, I see no good in discussing them. For she was  educated neither by her parents nor by me at the time when I ought  to have done it. But she is blessed with one great quality to a very  considerable degree, a quality which most Hindu wives possess in  some measure. And it is this; willingly or unwillingly, consciously  or unconsciously, she has considered herself blessed in following in  my footsteps, and has never stood in the way of my endeavour to lead  a life of restraint. Though, therefore, there is a wide difference  between us intellectually, I have always had the feeling that ours  is a life of contentment, happiness and progress.
