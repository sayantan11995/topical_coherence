Though my co-workers and I were relieved of the charge of the patients,  there remained many things arising out of the black plague still to be dealt with.  I have referred to the negligence of the Municipality regarding the  location. But it was wide awake so far as the health of its white  citizens was concerned. It had spent large amounts for the  preservation of their health and now it poured forth money like  water in order to stamp out the plague. In spite of the many sins of  omission and commission against the Indians that I had laid at the  door of the Municipality, I could not help commending its solicitude  for the white citizens, and I rendered it as much help as I could in  its laudable efforts. I have an impression that, if I had withheld  my co-operation, the task would have been more difficult for the  Municipality, and that it would not have hesitated to use armed  force and do its worst.  But all that was averted. The Municipal authorities were pleased at  the Indians' behaviour, and much of the future work regarding plague  measures was simplified. I used all the influence I could   with the Indians to make them submit to the  Municipality's  requirements, and I do not remember anyone having resisted my advice.  The location was put under a strong guard, passage in and out being  made impossible without permission. My co-workers and I had free  permits of entry and exit. The decision was to make the whole  location population vacate, and live under canvas for three weeks in  an open plain about thirteen miles from Johannesburg, and then to  set fire to the location. To settle down under canvas with  provisions and other necessaries was bound to take some time, and a  guard became necessary during the interval.  The people were in a terrible fright, but my constant presence was a consolation to them.  Many of the poor people used to hoard their scanty savings  underground. This had to be unearthed. They had no bank, they knew  none. I became their banker. Streams of money poured into my office.  I could not possibly charge any fees for my labours in such a  crisis. I coped with the work somehow. I knew my bank manager very  well. I told him that I should have to deposit these moneys with  him. The banks were by no means anxious to accept large amounts of  copper and silver. There was also the fear of bank clerks refusing  to touch money coming from a plague-affected area. But the manager  accommodated me in every way. It was decided to disinfect all the  money before sending it to the bank. So far as I can remember,  nearly sixty thousand pounds were thus deposited. I advised such of  the people as had enough money to place it as fixed deposit, and  they accepted the advice. The result was some of them became  accustomed to invest their money in banks.  The location residents were removed by special train to Klipspruit  Farm near Johannesburg, where they were supplied with provisions by  the Municipality at public expense. This city under canvas looked  like a military camp. The people who were unaccustomed to this camp  life were distressed and astonished over the arrangements, but they  did not have to put up with any particular inconvenience. I used to  cycle out to them daily. Within twenty-four hours of their stay they  forgot all their misery and began to live merrily. Whenever I went  there I found them enjoying themselves with song and mirth. Three  weeks' stay in the open air evidently improved their health.  So far as I recollect, the location was put to the flames on the  very next day after its evacuation. The Municipality showed not the  slightest inclination to save anything from the conflagration. About  this very time, and for the same reason, the Municipality burnt down  all its timber in the market, and sustained a loss of some £10,000. The reason for this drastic step was the discovery  of some dead rats in the market.  The Municipality had to incur heavy expenditure, but it successfully  arrested the further progress of the plague, and the city once more  breathed freely.
