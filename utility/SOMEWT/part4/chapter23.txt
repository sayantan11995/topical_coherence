It has already been seen that, though household expenses were heavy,  the tendency towards simplicity began in Durban. But the  Johannesburg house came in for much severer overhauling in the light  of Ruskin's teaching.  I introduced as much simplicity as was possible in a barrister's  house. It was impossible to do without a certain amount of  furniture. The change was more internal than external. The liking  for doing personally all the physical labour increased. I therefore  began to bring my children also under that discipline.  Instead of buying baker's bread, we began to prepare unleavened  wholemeal bread at home according to Kuhne's recipe. Common mill  flour was no good for this, and the use of hand-ground flour, it was  thought, would ensure more simplicity, health and economy. So I  purchased a hand-mill for £7. The iron wheel was too heavy to be  tacked by one man, but easy for two. Polak and I and the children  usually worked it. My wife also occasionally lent a hand, though the  grinding hour was her usual time for commencing kitchen work. Mrs.  Polak now joined us on her arrival. The grinding proved a very  beneficial exercise for the children. Neither this nor any other  work was ever imposed on them, but it was a pastime to them to come  and lend a hand, and they were at liberty to break off whenever  tired. But the children, including those whom I shall have occasion  to introduce later, as a rule never failed me. Not that I had no  laggards at all, but most did their work cheerfully enough. I can  recall few youngsters in those days fighting shy of work or pleading  fatigue.  We had engaged a servant to look after the house. He lived with us  as a member of the family, and the children used to help him in his  work. The municipal sweeper removed the night-soil, but we  personally attended to the cleaning of the closet instead of asking  or expecting the servant to do it. This proved a good training for  the children. The result was that none of my sons developed any  aversion for scavenger's work, and they naturally got a good  grounding in general sanitation. There was hardly any illness in the  home at Johannesburg, but whenever there was any, the nursing was  willingly done by the children. I will not say that I was  indifferent to their literary education, but I certainly did not  hesitate to sacrifice it. My sons have therefore some reason for a  grievance against me. Indeed they have occasionally given expression  to it, and I must plead guilty to a certain extent. The desire to  give them a literary education was there. I even endeavoured to give  it to them myself, but every now and then there was some hitch or  other. As I had made no other arrangement for their private tuition,  I used to get them to walk with me daily to the office and back home  – a distance of about five miles in all. This gave them and me a fair  amount of exercise. I tried to instruct them by conversation during  these walks, if there was no one else claiming my attention. All my  children, excepting the eldest, Harilal, who had stayed away in  India, were brought up in Johannesburg in this manner. Had I been  able to devote at least an hour to their literary education with  strict regularity, I should have given them, in my opinion, an ideal  education. But it was been their, as also my, regret that I failed  to ensure them enough literary training. The eldest son has often  given vent to his distress privately before me and publicly in the  press; the other sons have generously forgiven the failure as  unavoidable. I am not heart-broken over it and the regret, if any,  is that I did not prove an ideal father. But I hold that I  sacrificed their literary training to what I genuinely, though may  be wrongly, believed to be service to the community. I am quite  clear that I have not been negligent in doing whatever was needful  for building up their character. I believe it is the bounden duty of  every parent to provide for this properly. Whenever, in spite of my  endeavour, my sons have been found wanting, it is my certain  conviction that they have reflected, not want of care on my part,  but the defects of both their parents.  Children inherit the qualities of the parents, no less than their  physical features. Environment does play an important part, but the  original capital on which a child starts in life is inherited from  its ancestors. I have also seen children successfully surmounting  the effects of an evil inheritance. That is due to purity being an  inherent attribute of the soul.  Polak and I had often very heated discussions about the desirability  or otherwise of giving the children an English education. It has  always been my conviction that Indian parents who train their  children to think and talk in English from their infancy betray  their children and their country. They deprive them of the spiritual  and social heritage of the nation, and render them to that extent  unfit for the service of the country. Having these convictions, I  made a point of always talking to my children in Gujarati. Polak  never liked this. He thought I was spoiling their future. He  contended, with all the vigour and love at his command, that, if  children were to learn a universal language like English from their  infancy, they would easily gain considerable advantage over others  in the race of life. He failed to convince me. I do not now remember  whether I convinced him of the correctness of my attitude, or  whether he gave me up as too obstinate. This happened about twenty  years ago, and my convictions have only deepened with experience.  Though my sons have suffered for want of full literary education,  the knowledge of the mother tongue that they naturally acquired has  been all to their and the country's good, inasmuch as they do not  appear the foreigners they would otherwise have appeared. They  naturally become bilingual, speaking and writing English with fair  ease, because of daily contact with a large circle of English  friends, and because of their stay in a country where English was  the chief language spoken.
