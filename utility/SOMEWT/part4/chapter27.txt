I was anxious to observe brahmacharya  in thought, word and deed, and equally anxious to devote the maximum  of time to the Satyagraha struggle and fit myself for it by  cultivating purity. I was therefore led to make further changes and  to impose greater restraints upon myself in the matter of food. The  motive for the previous changes had been largely hygienic, but the  new experiments were made from a religious standpoint. Fasting and restriction in diet now played a more important part in  my life. Passion in man is generally co-existent with a hankering  after the pleasures of the palate. And so it was with me. I have  encountered many difficulties in trying to control passion as well  as taste, and I cannot claim even now to have brought them under  complete subjection. I have considered myself to be a heavy eater.  What friends have thought to be my restraint has never appeared to  me in that light. If I had failed to develop restraint to the extent  that I have, I should have descended lower than the beasts and met  my doom long ago. However, as I had adequately realized my  shortcomings, I made great efforts to get rid of them, and thanks to  this endeavour I have all these years pulled on with my body and put  in with it my share of work.  Being conscious of my weakness and unexpectedly coming in contact  with congenial company, I began to take an exclusive fruit diet or  to fast on the Ekadashi day, and also to observe  Janmashtami and similar holidays.  I began with a fruit diet, but from the standpoint of restraint I  did not find much to choose between a fruit diet and a diet of food  grains. I observed that the same indulgence of taste was possible  with the former as with the latter, and even more, when one got  accustomed to it. I therefore came to attach greater importance to  fasting or having only one meal a day on holidays. And if there was  some occasion for penance or the like, I gladly utilized it too for  the purpose of fasting.  But I also saw that, the body now being drained more effectively,  the food yielded greater relish and the appetite grew keener. It  dawned upon me that fasting could be made as powerful a weapon of  indulgence as of restraint. Many similar later experiences of mine  as well as of others can be adduced as evidence of this startling  fact. I wanted to improve and train my body, but as my chief object  now was to achieve restraint and a conquest of the palate, I  selected first one food and then another, and at the same time  restricted the amount. But the relish was after me, as it were. As I  gave up one thing and took up another, this latter afforded me a  fresher and greater relish than its predecessor. In making these experiments I had several companions, the chief of  whom was Hermann Kallenbach. I have already written about this  friend in the history of Satyagraha in South Africa, and will not go  over the same ground here. Mr. Kallenbach was always with me whether  in fasting or in dietetic changes. I lived with him at his own place  when the Satyagraha struggle was at its height. We discussed our  changes in food and derived more pleasure from the new diet than  from the old. Talk of this nature sounded quite pleasant in those  days, and did not strike me as at all improper. Experience has  taught me, however, that it was wrong to have dwelt upon the relish  of food. One should eat not in order to please the palate, but just  to keep the body going. When each organ of sense subserves the body  and through the body the soul, its special relish disappears, and  then alone does it begin to function in the way nature intended it  to do.  Any number of experiments is too small and no sacrifice is  too great for attaining this symphony with nature. But unfortunately  the current is nowadays flowing strongly in the opposite  direction. We are not ashamed to sacrifice a multitude of other  lives in decorating the perishable body and trying to prolong it  existence for a few fleeting moments, with the result that we kill  ourselves, both body and soul. In trying to cure one old disease, we  give rise to a hundred new ones; in trying to enjoy the pleasures of  sense, we lose in the end even our capacity for enjoyment. All this  is passing before our very eyes, but there are none so blind as  those who will not see.  Having thus set forth their object and the train of ideas which led  up to them, I now propose to describe the dietetic experiments at  some length.
