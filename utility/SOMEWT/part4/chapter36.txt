Day by day it became increasingly clear to me how very difficult it was  to bring up and educate boys and girls in the right way. If I was to  be their real teacher and guardian, I must touch their hearts. I  must share their joys and sorrows, I must help them to solve the  problems that faced them, and I must take along the right channel  the surging aspirations of their youth.  On the release of some of the Satyagrahis from jail, Tolstoy Farm  was almost denuded of its inmates. The few that remained mostly  belonged to Phoenix. So I removed them there. Here I had to pass  through a fiery ordeal.  In those days I had to move between Johannesburg and Phoenix. Once  when I was in Johannesburg I received tidings of the moral fall of  two of the inmates of the Ashram. News of an apparent failure or  reverse in the Satyagraha struggle would not have shocked me, but  this news came upon me like a thunderbolt. The same day I took the  train for Phoenix. Mr. Kallenbach insisted on accompanying me. He  had noticed the state I was in. He would not brook the thought of my  going alone, for he happened to be the bearer of the tidings which  had so upset me.  During the journey my duty seemed clear to me. I felt that the  guardian or teacher was responsible, to some extent at least, for  the lapse of his ward or pupil. So my responsibility regarding the  incident in question became clear to me as daylight. My wife had  already warned me in the matter, but being of a trusting nature, I  had ignored her caution. I felt that the only way the guilty parties  could be made to realize my distress and the depth of their own fall  would be for me to do some penance. So I imposed upon myself a fast  for seven days and a vow to have only one meal a day for a period of  four months and a half. Mr. Kallenbach tried to dissuade me, but in  vain. He finally conceded the propriety of the penance, and insisted  on joining me. I could not resist his transparent affection. I felt greatly relieved, for the decision meant a heavy load off my mind.  The anger against the guilty parties subsided and gave place to the  purest pity for them. Thus considerably eased, I reached Phoenix, I  made further investigation and acquainted myself with some more  details I needed to know.  My penance pained everybody, but it cleared the atmosphere. Everyone  came to realize what a terrible thing it was to be sinful, and the  bond that bound me to the boys and girls became stronger and truer. A circumstance arising out of this incident compelled me, a little  while after, to go into a fast for fourteen days, the results of  which exceeded even my expectations.  It is not my purpose to make out from these incidents that it is the  duty of a teacher to resort to fasting whenever there is a  delinquency on the part of his pupils. I hold, however, that some  occasions do call for this drastic remedy. But it presupposes  clearness of vision and spiritual fitness. Where there is no true  love between the teacher and the pupil, where the pupil's  delinquency has not touched the very being of the teacher and where  the pupil has no respect for the teacher, fasting is out of place  and may even be harmful. Though there is thus room for doubting the  propriety of fasts in such cases, there is no question about the  teacher's responsibility for the error of his pupil.  The first penance did not prove difficult for any of us. I had to suspend or  stop none of my normal activities. It may be recalled that during  the whole of this period of penance I was a strict fruitarian. The  latter part of the second fast went fairly hard with me. I had not  then completely understood the wonderful efficacy of Ramanama, and  my capacity for suffering was to that extent less. Besides, I did  not know the technique of fasting, especially the necessity of  drinking plenty of water, however nauseating or distasteful it might  be. Then the fact that the first fast had been an easy affair had  made me rather careless as to the second. Thus during the first I  took Kuhne baths every day, but during the second I gave them up  after two or three days, and drank very little water, as it was  distasteful and produced nausea. The throat became parched and weak  and during the last days I could speak only in a very low voice. In  spite of this, however, my work was carried on through dictation  where writing was necessary. I regularly listened to readings from  the Ramayana and other sacred books. I had also sufficient strength  to discuss and advise in all urgent matters.
