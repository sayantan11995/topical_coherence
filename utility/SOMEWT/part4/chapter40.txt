Though I thus took part in the war as a matter of duty, it chanced that I  was not only unable directly to participate in it, but actually  compelled to offer what may be called miniature Satyagraha even at  that critical juncture.  I have already said that an officer was appointed in charge of our  training, as soon as our names were approved and enlisted. We were  all under the impression that this Commanding Officer was to be our  chief only so far as technical matters were concerned, and that in  all other matters I was the head of our Corps, which was directly  responsible to me in matters of internal discipline; that is to say,  the Commanding Officer had to deal with the Corps through me. But  from the first the Officer left us under no such delusion. Mr. Sorabji Adajania was a shrewd man. He warned me. 'Beware of this  man,' he said. 'He seems inclined to lord it over us. We will have  none of his orders. We are prepared to look upon him as our  instructor. But the youngsters he has appointed to instruct us also  feel as though they had come as our masters.'  These youngsters were Oxford students who had come to instruct us  and whom the Commanding Officer had appointed to be our section  leaders.  I also had not failed to notice the high-handedness of the  Commanding Officer, but I asked Sorabji not to be anxious and tried  to pacify him. But he was not the man to be easily convinced. 'You are too trusting. Those people will deceive you with wretched  words, and when at last you see through them, you will ask us to  resort to Satyagraha, and so come to grief, and bring us all to  grief along with you,' said he with a smile.  'What else but grief can you hope to come to after having cast in  your lot with me?' said I. 'A Satyagrahi is born to be deceived. Let  the Commanding Officer deceive us. Have I not told you times without  number that ultimately a deceiver only deceives himself?' Sorabji gave a loud laugh. 'Well, then,' said he, 'continue to be  deceived. You will some day meet your death in Satyagraha and drag  poor mortals like me behind you.'  These words put me in mind of what  the late Miss Emily Hobhouse wrote to me with regard to  non-co-operation: 'I should not be surprised if one of these days  you have to go to the gallows for the sake of truth. May God show  you the right path and protect you.'  The talk with Sorabji took place just after the appointment of the  Commanding Officer. In a very few days our relations with him  reached the breaking-point. I had hardly regained my strength after  the fourteen days' fast, when I began to take part in the drill,  often walking to the appointed place about two miles from home. This  gave me pleurisy and laid me low. In this condition I had to go  week-end camping. Whilst the others stayed there, I returned home.  It was here that an occasion arose for Satyagraha. The Commanding Officer began to exercise his authority somewhat  freely. He gave us clearly to understand that he was our head in all  matters, military and non-military, giving us at the same time a  taste of his authority. Sorabji hurried to me. He was not at all  prepared to put up with this high-handedness. He said: 'We must have  all orders through you. We are still in the training camp and all  sorts of absurd orders are being issued. Invidious distinctions are  made between ourselves and those youths who have been appointed to  instruct us. We must have it out with the Commanding Officer,  otherwise we shall not be able to go on any longer. The Indian  students and others who have joined our Corps are not going to abide  by any absurd orders. In a cause which has been taken up for the  sake of self-respect, it is unthinkable to put up with loss of it.' I approached the Commanding Officer and drew his attention to the  complaints I had received. He wrote asking me to set out the  complaints in writing, at the same time asking me 'to impress upon  those who complain that the proper direction in which to make  complaints is to me through their section commanders, now appointed,  who will inform me through the instructors.'  To this I replied saying that I claimed no authority, that in the  military sense I was no more than any other private, but that I had  believed that as Chairman of the Volunteer Corps, I should be  allowed unofficially to act as their representative. I also set out  the grievances and requests that had been brought to my notice,  namely, that grievous dissatisfaction had been caused by the  appointment of section leaders without reference to the feeling of  the members of the Corps; that they be recalled, and the Corps be  invited to elect section leaders, subject to the Commander's  approval.  This did not appeal to the Commanding Officer, who said it  was repugnant to all military discipline that the section leaders  should be elected by the Corps, and that the recall of appointments  already made would be subversive of all discipline.  So we held a meeting and decided upon withdrawal. I brought home to  the members the serious consequences of Satyagraha. But a very large  majority voted for the resolution, which was to the effect that,  unless the appointments of Corporals already made were recalled and  the members of the Corps given an opportunity of electing their own  Corporals, the members would be obliged to abstain from further  drilling and week-end camping.  I then addressed a letter to the Commanding Officer telling him what  a severe disappointment his letter rejecting my suggestion had been.  I assured him that I was not fond of any exercise of authority and  that I was most anxious to serve. I also drew his  attention to a precedent. I pointed out that, although I occupied no  official rank in the South African Indian Ambulance Corps at the  time of the Boer War, there was never a hitch between Colonel Gallwey  and the Corps, and the Colonel never took a step without  reference to me with a view to ascertain the wishes of the Corps. I  also enclosed a copy of the resolution we had passed the previous  evening.  This had no good effect on the Officer, who felt that the meeting  and the resolution were a grave breach of discipline.  Hereupon I addressed a letter to the Secretary of State for India, acquainting  him with all the facts and enclosing a copy of the resolution. He  replied explaining that conditions in South Africa were different,  and drawing my attentions to the fact that under the rules the  section commanders were appointed by the Commanding Officer, but  assuring me that in future, when appointing section commanders, the  Commanding Officer would consider my recommendations.  A good deal of correspondence passed between us after this, but I do  not want to prolong the bitter tale. Suffice it to say that my  experience was of a piece with the experiences we daily have in  India. What with threats and what with adroitness the Commanding  Officer succeeded in creating a division in our Corps. Some of those  who had voted for the resolution yielded to the Commander's threats  or persuasions and went back on their promise.  About this time an unexpectedly large contingent of wounded soldiers  arrived at the Netley Hospital, and the services of our Corps were  requisitioned. Those whom the Commanding Officer could persuade went  to Netley. The others refused to go. I was on my back, but was in  communication with the members of the Corps. Mr. Roberts, the  Under-Secretary of State, honoured me with many calls during those days.  He insisted on my persuading the others to serve. He suggested that  they should form a separate Corps and that at the Netley Hospital  they could be responsible only to the Commanding Officer there, so  that there would be no question of loss of self-respect, Government  would be placated, and at same time helpful service would be  rendered to the large number of wounded received at the hospital.  This suggestion appealed both to my companions and to me, with the  result that those who had stayed away also went to Netley. Only I remained away, lying on my back and making the best of a bad  job.
