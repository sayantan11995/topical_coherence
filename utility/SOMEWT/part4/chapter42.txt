The persistence of the pleurisy caused some anxiety,  but I knew that the cure lay not in taking medicine internally but in dietetic  changes assisted by external remedies.  I called in Dr. Allinson of vegetarian fame, who treated diseases by  dietetic modifications and whom I had met in 1890. He thoroughly  overhauled me. I explained to him how I had pledged myself not to  take milk. He cheered me up and said: 'You need not take milk. In  fact I want you to do without any fat for some days.' He then  advised me to live on plain brown bread, raw vegetables such as  beet, radish, onion and other tubers and greens, and also fresh  fruit, mainly oranges. The vegetables were not to be cooked but  merely grated fine, if I could not masticate them.  I adopted this for about three days, but raw vegetables did not  quite suit me. My body was not in a condition to enable me to do  full justice to the experiment. I was nervous about taking raw  vegetables.  Dr. Allinson also advised me to keep all the windows of my room open  for the whole twenty-four hours, bathe in tepid water, have an oil  massage on the affected parts and a walk in the open for fifteen to  thirty minutes. I liked all these suggestions.  My room had French windows which, if kept wide open, would let in  the rain. The fanlight could not be opened. I therefore got the  glass broken, so as to let in fresh air, and I partially opened the  windows in a manner not to let in rain.  All these measures somewhat improved my health, but did not  completely cure me.  Lady Cecilia Roberts occasionally called on me. We became friends.  She wanted very much to persuade me to take milk. But as I was  unyielding, she hunted about for a substitute for milk. Some friend  suggested to her malted milk, assuring her quite unknowingly that it  was absolutely free from milk, and that it was a chemical  preparation with all the properties of milk. Lady Cecilia, I knew,  had a great regard for my religious scruples, and so I implicitly  trusted her. I dissolved the powder in water and took it only to  find that it tasted just like milk. I read the label on the bottle,  to find, only too late, that it was a preparation of milk. So I gave  it up.  I informed Lady Cecilia about the discovery, asking her not to worry  over it. She came post haste to me to say how sorry she was. Her  friend had not read the label at all. I begged her not to be anxious  and expressed my regret that I could not avail myself of the thing  she had procured with so much trouble. I also assured her that I did  not at all feel upset or guilty over having taken milk under a  misapprehension.  I must skip over many other sweet reminiscences of my contact with  Lady Cecilia. I could think of many friends who have been a source  of great comfort to me in the midst of trials and disappointments.  One who has faith reads in them the merciful providence of God, who  thus sweetens sorrow itself.  Dr. Allinson, when he next called, relaxed his restrictions and permitted me to have groundnut butter  or olive oil for the sake of fat, and to take the vegetables cooked,  if I chose, with rice. These changes were quite welcome, but they  were far from giving me a complete cure. Very careful nursing was  still necessary, and I was obliged to keep mostly in bed.  Dr. Mehta occasionally looked in to examine me and held out a  standing offer to cure me if only I would listen to his advice. Whilst things were going on in this way, Mr. Roberts one day came to  see me and urged me very strongly to go home. 'You cannot possibly  go to Netley in this condition. There is still severer cold ahead of  us. I would strongly advise you to get back to India, for it is only  there that you can be completely cured. If, after your recovery, you  should find the war still going on, you will have many opportunities  there of rendering help. As it is, I do not regard what you have  already done as by any means a mean contribution.'  I accepted his advice and began to make preparations for returning to India.
