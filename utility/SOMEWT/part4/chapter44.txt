Before coming to a narrative of the course my life took in India, it seems  necessary to recall a few of the South African experiences which I  have deliberately left out.  Some lawyer friends have asked me to give my reminiscences of the  bar. The number of these is so large that, if I were to describe  them all, they would occupy a volume by themselves and take me out  of my scope. But it may not perhaps be improper to recall some of  those which bear upon the practice of truth.  So far as I can recollect, I have already said that I never resorted  to untruth in my profession, and that a large part of my legal  practice was in the interest of public work, for which I charged  nothing beyond out-of-pocket expenses, and these too I sometimes met  myself. I had thought that in saying this I had said all that was  necessary as regards my legal practice. But friends want me to do  more. They seem to think that, if I described however slightly, some  of the occasions when I refused to swerve from the truth, the legal  profession might profit by it.  As a student I had heard that the lawyer's profession was a liar's  profession. But this did not influence me, as I had no intention of  earning either position or money by lying.  My principle was put to the test many a time in South Africa. Often  I knew that my opponents had tutored their witnesses, and if I only  encouraged my client or his witness to lie, we could win the case.  But I always resisted the temptation. I remember only one occasion  when, after having won a case, I suspected that my client had  deceived me. In my heart of hearts I always wished that I should win  only if my client's case was right. In fixing my fees I do not  recall ever having made them conditional on my winning the case.  Whether my client won or lost, I expected nothing more nor less than  my fees.  I warned every new client at the outset that he should not expect me  to take up a false case or to coach the witnesses, with the result  that I built up such a reputation that no false cases used to come  to me. Indeed some of my clients would keep their clean cases for  me, and take the doubtful ones elsewhere.  There was one case which proved a severe trial. It was brought to me  by one of my best clients. It was a case of highly complicated  accounts and had been a prolonged one. It had been heard in parts  before several courts. Ultimately the book-keeping portion of it was  entrusted by the court to the arbitration of some qualified  accountants. The award was entirely in favour of my client, but the  arbitrators had inadvertently committed an error in calculation  which, however small, was serious, inasmuch as an entry which ought  to have been on the debit side was made on the credit side. The  opponents had opposed the award on other grounds. I was junior  counsel for my client. When the senior counsel became aware of the  error, he was of opinion that our client was not bound to admit it.  He was clearly of opinion that no counsel was bound to admit  anything that went against his client's interest. I said we ought to  admit the error.  But the senior counsel contended: 'In that case  there is every likelihood of the court canceling the whole award,  and no sane counsel would imperil his client's case to that extent.  At any rate I would be the last man to take any such risk. If the  case were to be sent up for a fresh hearing, one could never tell  what expenses our client might have to incur, and what the ultimate  result might be!'  The client was present when this conversation took place. I said: 'I feel that both our client and we ought to run the risk.  Where is the certainty of the court upholding a wrong award simply  because we do not admit the error? And supposing the admission were  to bring the client to grief, what harm is there?'  'But why should we make the admission at all?' said the senior  counsel.  'Where is the surety of the court not detecting the error or our  opponent not discovering it?' said I.  'Well then, will you argue the case? I am not prepared to argue it  on your terms,' replied the senior counsel with decision. I humbly answered: 'If you will not argue, then I am prepared to do  so, if our client so desires. I shall have nothing to do with the  case if the error is not admitted.'  With this I looked at my client. He was a little embarrassed. I had  been in the case from the very first. The client fully trusted me,  and knew me through and through. He said: 'Well, then, you will  argue the case and admit the error. Let us lose, if that is to be  our lot. God defend the right.'  I was delighted. I had expected nothing less from him. The senior  counsel again warned me, pitied me for my obduracy, but  congratulated me all the same.  What happened in the court we shall see in the next chapter.
