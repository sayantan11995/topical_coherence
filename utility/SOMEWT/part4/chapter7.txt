With the growing simplicity of my life, my dislike for medicines steadily  increased. While practising in Durban, I suffered for some time from  debility and rheumatic inflammation. Dr. P. J. Mehta, who had come  to see me, gave me treatment, and I got well. After that, up to the  time when I returned to India, I do not remember having suffered  from any ailment to speak of.  But I used to be troubled with constipation and frequent headaches,  while at Johannesburg. I kept myself fit with occasional laxatives  and a well-regulated diet. But I could hardly call myself healthy,  and always wondered when I should get free from the incubus of these  laxative medicines.  About this time I read of the formation of a 'No Breakfast  Association' in Manchester. The argument of the promoters was that  Englishmen ate too often and too much, that their doctors' bills  were heavy because they ate until midnight, and that they should at  least give up breakfast, if they wanted to improve this state of  affairs. Though all these things could not be said of me, I felt  that the argument did partly apply in my case. I used to have three  square meals daily in addition to afternoon tea. I was never a spare  eater and enjoyed as many delicacies as could be had with a  vegetarian and spiceless diet. I scarcely ever got up before six or  seven. I therefore argued that, if I also dropped the morning  breakfast, I might become free from headaches. So I tried the  experiment. For a few days it was rather hard, but the headaches  entirely disappeared. This led me to conclude that I was eating more  than I needed.  But the change was far from relieving me of constipation. I tried  Kuhne's hipbaths, which gave some relief but did not completely cure  me. In the meantime the German who had a vegetarian restaurant, or  some other friend, I forget who, placed in my hands Just's  Return of Nature.  In this book I read about earth treatment. The author also advocated  fresh fruit and nuts as the natural diet of man. I did not at once  take to the exclusive fruit diet, but immediately began experiments  in earth treatment, and with wonderful results. The treatment  consisted in applying to the abdomen a bandage of clean earth  moistened with cold water and spread like a poultice on fine linen.  This I applied at bed time, removing it during the night or in the  morning, whenever I happened to wake up. It proved a radical cure.  Since then I have tried the treatment on myself and my friends and  never had reason to regret it. In India I have not been able to try  this treatment with equal confidence. For one thing, I have never  had time to settle down in one place to conduct the experiments. But  my faith in the earth and water treatment remains practically the  same as before. Even today I give myself the earth treatment to a  certain extent and recommend it to my co-workers, whenever the occasion  arises.  Though I have had two serious illnesses in my life, I believe that  man has little need to drug himself. Nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand can  be brought round by means of a well-regulated diet, water and earth  treatment and similar household remedies. He who runs to the doctor, vaidya or hakim for every little aliment, and swallows all kinds of vegetable and  mineral drugs, not only curtails his life, but, by becoming the  slave of his body instead of remaining its master, loses  self-control, and ceases to be a man.  Let no one discount these observations because they are being  written in a sickbed. I know the reasons for my illnesses. I am  fully conscious that I alone am responsible for them, and it is  because of that consciousness that I have not lost patience. In fact  I have thanked God for them as lessons and successfully resisted the  temptation of taking numerous drugs. I know my obstinacy often tries  my doctors, but they kindly bear with me and do not give me up.  However, I must not digress. Before proceeding further, I should  give the reader a word of warning. Those who purchase Just's book on  the strength of this chapter should not take everything in it to be  gospel truth. A writer almost always presents one aspect of a case,  whereas every case can be seen from no less than seven points of  view, all of which are probably correct by themselves, but not  correct at the same time and in the same circumstances. And then  many books are written with a view to gaining customers and earning  name and fame. Let those, therefore, who read such books as these do  so with discernment, and take advice of some experienced man before  trying any of the experiments set forth, or let them  read the books with patience and digest them thoroughly before  acting upon them.
