Before I reached home, the party which had started from Phoenix had already  arrived. According to our original plan I was to have preceded them,  but my preoccupation in England with the war had upset all our  calculations, and when I saw that I had to be detained in England  indefinitely, I was faced with the question of finding a place for  accommodating the Phoenix party. I wanted them all to stay together  in India, if possible, and to live the life they had led at Phoenix.  I did not know of any Ashram to which I could recommend them to go,  and therefore cabled to them to meet Mr. Andrews and do as he  advised.  So they were first put in the Gurukul, Kangri, where the late Swami  Shraddhanandji treated them as his own children. After this they  were put in the Shantiniketan Ashram, where the Poet and his people  showered similar love upon them. The experiences they gathered at  both these places too stood them and me in good stead.  The Poet, Shraddhanandji and Principal Sushil Rudra, as I used to  say to Andrews, composed this trinity. When in South Africa he was  never tired of speaking of them, and of my many sweet memories of  South Africa, Mr. Andrews' talks, day in and day out, of this great  trinity, are amongst the sweetest and most vivid. Mr. Andrews  naturally put the Phoenix party in touch with Sushil Rudra.  Principal Rudra had no Ashram, but he had a home which he placed  completely at the disposal of the Phoenix family. Within a day of  their arrival, his people made them feel so thoroughly at home that  they did not seem to miss Phoenix at all.  It was only when I landed in Bombay that I learnt that the Phoenix  party was at Shantiniketan. I was therefore impatient to meet them  as soon as I could after my meeting with Gokhale.  The receptions in Bombay gave me an occasion for offering what might be called a  little Satyagraha.  At the party given in my honour at Mr. Jehangir Petit's place, I did  not dare to speak in Gujarati. In those palatial surroundings of  dazzling splendour I, who had lived my best life among indentured  labourers, felt myself a complete rustic. With my Kathiawadi cloak,  turban and dhoti, I looked somewhat more civilized than I do today,  but the pomp and splendour of Mr. Petit's mansion made me feel  absolutely out of my element. However, I acquitted myself tolerably  well, having taken shelter under Sir Pherozeshah's protecting wing. Then there was the Gujarati function. The Gujaratis would not let me  go without a reception, which was organized by the late Uttamlal  Trivedi. I had acquainted myself with the programme beforehand. Mr.  Jinnah was present, being a Gujarati, I forget whether as president  or as the principal speaker. He made a short and sweet little speech  in English. As far as I remember most of the other speeches were  also in English. When my turn came, I expressed my thanks in  Gujarati explaining my partiality for Gujarati and Hindustani, and  entering my humble protest against the use of English in a Gujarati  gathering. This I did, not without some hesitation, for I was afraid  lest it should be considered discourteous for an inexperienced man,  returned home after a long exile, to enter his protest against  established practices. But no one seemed to misunderstand my  insistence on replying in Gujarati. In fact I was glad to note that  everyone seemed reconciled to my protest.  The meeting thus emboldened me to think that I should not find it  difficult to place my new-fangled notions before my countrymen. After a brief stay in Bombay, full of these preliminary experiences,  I went to Poona whither Gokhale had summoned me.
