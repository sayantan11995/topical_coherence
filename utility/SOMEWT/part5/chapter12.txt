Champaran is the land of King Janaka. Just as it abounds in mango groves, so  used it to be full of indigo plantations until the year 1917. The  Champaran tenant was bound by law to plant three out of every twenty  parts of his land with indigo for his landlord. This system was  known as the tinkathia system, as three kathas out of twenty  (which make one acre) had to be planted with indigo.  I must confess that I did not then know even the name, much less the  geographical position, of Champaran, and I had hardly any notion of  indigo plantations. I had seen packets of indigo, but little dreamed  that it was grown and manufactured in Champaran at great hardship to  thousands of agriculturists.  Rajkumar Shukla was one of the agriculturists who had been under  this harrow, and he was filled with a passion to wash away the stain  of indigo for the thousands who were suffering as he had suffered. This man caught hold of me at Lucknow, where I had gone for the  Congress of 1916. 'Vakil Babu will tell you everything about our  distress,' he said, and urged me to go to Champaran. 'Vakil Babu'  was none other than Babu Brajkishore Prasad, who became my esteemed  co-worker in Champaran, and who is the soul of public work in  Bihar. Rajkumar Shukla brought him to my tent. He was dressed in a  black alpaca achkan and trousers. Brijkishore Babu failed then to  make an impression on me. I took it that he must be some vakil  exploiting the simple agriculturists. Having heard from him  something of Champaran, I replied as was my wont: 'I can give no  opinion without seeing the condition with my own eyes. You will  please move the resolution in the Congress, but leave me free for  the present.' Rajkumar Shukla of course wanted some help from the  Congress. Babu Brajkishore Prasad moved the resolution, expressing  sympathy for the people of Champaran, and it was unanimously passed. Rajkumar Shukla was glad, but far from satisfied. He wanted me  personally to visit Champaran and witness the miseries of the ryots  there. I told him that I would include Champaran in the tour which I  had contemplated and give it a day or two. 'One day will be enough,'  said he, 'and you will see things with your own eyes.' From Lucknow I went to Cawnpore. Rajkumar Shukla followed me there.  'Champaran is very near here. Please give a day,' he insisted.' Pray  excuse me this time. But I promise that I will come,' said I,  further committing myself.  I returned to the Ashram. The ubiquitous Rajkumar was there too.  'Pray fix the day now', he said. 'Well,' said I, 'I have to be in  Calcutta on such and such a date, come and meet me then, and take me  from there.' I did not know where I was to go, what to do, what  things to see.  Before I reached Bhupen Babu's place in Calcutta, Rajkumar Shukla  had gone and established himself there. Thus this ignorant,  unsophisticated but resolute agriculturist captured me. So early in 1917, we left Calcutta for Champaran, looking just like  fellow rustics. I did not even know the train. He took me to it, and  we travelled together, reaching Patna in the morning.  This was my first visit to Patna. I had no friend or acquaintance  with whom I could think of putting up. I had an idea that Rajkumar  Shukla, simple agriculturist as he was, must have some influence in  Patna. I had come to know him a little more on the journey, and on  reaching Patna I had no illusions left concerning him. He was  perfectly innocent of every thing. The vakils that he had taken to  be his friends were really nothing of the sort. Poor Rajkumar was  more or less as a menial to them. Between such agriculturist clients  and their vakils there is a gulf as wide as the Ganges in flood. Rajkumar Shukla took me to Rajendra Babu's place in Patna. Rajendra  Babu had gone to Puri or some other place, I now forget which. There  were one or two servants at the bungalow who paid us no attention. I  had with me something to eat. I wanted dates which my companion  procured for me from the bazaar.  There was strict untouchability in Bihar. I might not draw water at  the well whilst the servants were using it, lest drops of water from  my bucket might pollute them, the servants not knowing to what caste  I belonged. Rajkumar directed me to the indoor latrine, the servant  promptly directed me to the outdoor one. All this was far from  surprising or irritating to me, for I was inured to such things. The  servants were doing the duty, which they thought Rajendra Babu would  wish them to do.  These entertaining experiences enhanced my regard for Rajkumar  Shukla, if they also enabled me to know him better. I saw now that  Rajkumar Shukla could not guide me, and that I must take the reins  in my own hands.
