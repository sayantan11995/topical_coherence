To give a full account of the Champaran inquiry would be to narrate the  histroy, for the period, of the Champaran ryot, which is out of the  question in these chapters. The Champaran inquiry was a bold  experiment with Truth and Ahimsa, and I am giving week by week only  what occurs to me as worth giving from that point of view. For more  details the reader must turn to Sjt. Rajendra Prasad's history of  the Champaran Satyagraha in Hindi, of which, I am told, an English  edition1 is now in the press.  But to return to the subject matter of this chapter. The inquiry  could not be conducted in Gorakhbabu's house, without practically  asking poor Gorakhbabu to vacate it. And the people of Motihari had  not yet shed their fear to the extent of renting a house to us.  However, Brajkishorebabu tactfully secured one with considerable  open space about it, and we now removed there.  It was not quite possible to carry on the work without money. It had  not been the practice hitherto to appeal to the public for money for  work of this kind. Brajkishorebabu and his friends were mainly  vakils who either contributed funds themselves, or found it from  friends whenever there was an occasion. How could they ask the  people to pay when they and their kind could well afford to do so?  That seemed to be the argument. I had made up my mind not to accept  anything from the Champaran ryots. It would be bound to be  misinterpreted. I was equally determined not to appeal to the  country at large for funds to conduct this inquiry. For that was  likely to give it an all-India and political aspect. Friends from  Bombay offered Rs. 15,000, but I declined the offer with thanks. I  decided to get as much as was possible, with Brajkishorebabu's help,  from well-to-do Biharis living outside Champaran and, if more was  needed, to approach my friend Dr. P.J. Mehta of Rangoon. Dr. Mehta  readily agreed to send me whatever might be needed. We were thus  free from all anxiety on this score. We were not likely to require  large funds, as we were bent on exercising the greatest economy in  consonance with the poverty of Champaran. Indeed itÂ  was found  in the end that we did not need any large amount. I have an  impression that we expended in all not more than three thousand  rupees, and, as far as I remember, we saved a few hundred rupees  from what we had collected.  The curious ways of living of my companions in the early days were a  constant theme of raillery at their expense. Each of the vakils had  a servant and a cook, and therefore a separate kitchen, and they  often had their dinner as late as midnight. Though they paid their  own expenses, their irregularity worried me, but as we had become  close friends there was no possibility of a misunderstanding between  us, and they received my ridicule in good part. Ultimately it was  agreed that the servants should be dispensed with, that all the  kitchens should be amalgamated, and that regular hours should be  observed. As all were not vegetarians, and as two kitchens would  have been expensive, a common vegetarian kitchen was decided upon.  It was also felt necessary to insist on simple meals.  These arrangements considerably reduced the expenses and saved us a  lot of time and energy, and both these were badly needed. Crowds of  peasants came to make their statements, and they were followed by an  army of companions who filled the compound and garden to  overflowing. The efforts of my companions to save me from darshan-seekers  were often of no avail, and I had to be exhibited for darshan  at particular hours. At least five to seven volunteers were required  to take down statements, and even then some people had to go away in  the evening without being able to make their statements. All these  statements were not essential, many of them being repetitions, but  the people could not be satisfied otherwise, and I appreciated their  feeling in the matter.  Those who took down the statements had to observe certain rules.  Each peasant had to be closely cross-examined, and whoever failed to  satisfy the test was rejected. This entailed a lot of extra time but  most of the statements were thus rendered incontrovertible.  An officer from the C.I.D. would always be present when these  statements were recorded. We might have prevented him, but we had  decided from the very beginning not only not to mind the presence of  C.I.D. officers, but to treat them with courtesy and to give them  all the information that it was possible to give them. This was far  from doing us any harm. On the contrary the very fact that the  statements were taken down in the presence of the C.I.D. officers  made the peasants more fearless. Whilst on the one hand excessive  fear of the C.I.D. was driven out of the peasants' minds, on the  other, their presence exercised a natural restraint on exaggeration.  It was the business of C.I.D. friends to entrap people and so the  peasants had necessarily to be cautious.  As I did not want to irritate the planters, but to win them over by  gentleness, I made a point of writing to and meeting such of them  against whom allegations of a serious nature were made. I met the  Planters' Association as well, placed the ryots' grievances before  them and acquainted myself with their point of view. Some of the  planters hated me, some were indifferent and a few treated me with  courtesy.
