Brajkishorebabu and Rajendrababu were a matchless pair. Their devotion made it  impossible for me to take a single step without their help. Their  disciples, or their companions – Shambhaubabu, Anugrahababu,  Dharanibabu, Ramnavmibabu and other vakils – were always with us.  Vindhyababu and Janakdharibabu also came and helped us now and then.  All these were Biharis. Their principal work was to take down the  ryots' statements.  Professor Kripalani could not but cast in his lot with us. Though a  Sindhi he was more Bihari than a born Bihari. I have seen only a few  workers capable of merging themselves in the province of their  adoption. Kripalani is one of those few. He made it impossible for  anyone to feel that he belonged to a different province. He was my  gatekeeper in chief. For the time being he made it the end and aim of  his life to save me from darshan - seekers. He warded off people, calling to his aid now his unfailing  humour, now his non-violent threats. At nightfall he would take up  his occupation of a teacher and regale his companions with his  historical studies and observations, and quicken any timid visitor  into bravery.  Maulana Mazharul Haq had registered his name on the standing list of  helpers whom I might count upon whenever necessary, and he made a  point of looking in once or twice a month. The pomp and splendour in  which he then lived was in sharp contrast to his simple life of  today. The way in which he associated with us made us feel that he  was one of us, though his fashionable habit gave a stranger a  different impression.  As I gained more experience of Bihar, I became convinced that work  of a permanent nature was impossible without proper village  education. The ryots' ignorance was pathetic. They either allowed  their children to roam about, or made them toil on indigo  plantations from morning to night for a couple of coppers a day. In  those days a male labourer's wage did not exceed ten pice, a  female's did not exceed six, and a child's three. He who succeeded  in earning four annas a day was considered most fortunate. In consultation with my companions I decided to open primary schools  in six villages. One of our conditions with the villagers was that  they should provide the teachers with board and lodging while we  would see to the other expenses. The village folk had hardly any  cash in their hands, but they could well afford to provide  foodstuffs. Indeed they had already expressed their readiness to  contribute grain and other raw materials.  From where to get the teachers was a great problem. It was difficult  to find local teachers who would work for a bare allowance or  without remuneration. My idea was never to entrust children to  commonplace teachers. Their literary qualification was not so  essential as their moral fibre.  So I issued a public appeal for voluntary teachers. It received a  ready response. Sjt. Gangadharrao Deshpande sent Babasaheb Soman and  Pundalik. Shrimati Avantikabai Gokhale came from Bombay and Mrs.  Anandibai Vaishampayan from Poona. I sent to the Ashram for  Chhotalal, Surendranath and my son Devdas. About this time Mahadev  Desai and Narahari Parikh with their wives cast in their lot with  me. Kasturbai was also summoned for the work. This was a fairly  strong contingent. Shrimati Avantikabai and Shrimati Anandibai were  educated enough, but Shrimati Durga Desai and Shrimati Manibehn  Parikh had nothing more than a bare knowledge of Gujarati, and  Kasturbai not even that. How were these ladies to instruct the  children in Hindi?  I explained to them they were expected to teach the children not  grammar and the three R's so much as cleanliness and good manners. I  further explained that even as regards letters there was not so  great a difference between Gujarati, Hindi and Marathi as they  imagined, and in the primary classes, at any rate, the teaching of  the rudiments of the alphabet and numerals was not a difficult  matter. The result was that the classes taken by these ladies were  found to be most successful. The experience inspired them with  confidence and interest in their work. Avantikabai's became a model  school. She threw herself heart and soul into her work. She brought  her exceptional gifts to bear on it. Through these ladies we could,  to some extent, reach the village women.  But I did not want to stop at providing for primary education. The  villages were insanitary, the lanes full of filth, the wells  surrounded by mud and stink and the courtyards unbearably untidy.  The elder people badly needed education in cleanliness. They were  all suffering from various skin diseases. So it was decided to do as  much sanitary work as possible and to penetrate every department of  their lives.  Doctors were needed for this work. I requested the Servants of India  Society to lend us the services of the late Dr. Dev. We had been  great friends, and he readily offered his services for six months.  The teachers – men and women – had all to work under him.  All of them had express instructions not to concern themselves with  grievances against planters or with politics. People who had any  complaints to make were to be referred to me. No one was to venture  out of his beat. The friends carried out these instructions with  wonderful fidelity. I do not remember a single occasion of  indiscipline.
