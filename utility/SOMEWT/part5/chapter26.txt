The Kheda campaign was launched while the deadly war in Europe was still  going on. Now a crisis had arrived, and the Viceroy had invited  various leaders to a war conference in Delhi. I had also been urged  to attend the conference. I have already referred to the cordial  relations between Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy, and myself. In response to the invitation I went to Delhi. I had, however,  objections to taking part in the conference, the principal one being  the exclusion from it of leaders like the Ali Brothers. They were  then in jail. I had met them only once or twice, though I had heard  much about them. Everyone had spoken highly of their  services and their courage. I had not then come in close touch  with Hakim Saheb, but Principal Rudra and Dinabandhu Andrews had  told me a good deal in his praise. I had met Mr. Shuaib Qureshi and Mr.  Khwaja at the Muslim League in Calcutta. I had also come in contact  with Drs. Ansari and Abdur Rahman. I was seeking the friendship of  good Musalmans. and was eager to understand the Musalman mind  through contact with their purest and most patriotic  representatives. I therefore never needed any pressure to go with  them, wherever they took me, in order to get into intimate touch  with them.  I had realized early enough in South Africa that there was no  genuine friendship between the Hindus and the Musalmans. I never  missed a single opportunity to remove obstacles in the way of unity.  It was not in my nature to placate anyone by adulation, or at the  cost of self-respect. But my South African experiences had  convinced me that it would be on the question of Hindu-Muslim unity  that my Ahimsa would be put to its severest test, and that the  question presented the widest field for my experiments in Ahimsa.  The conviction is still there. Every moment of my life I realize  that God is putting me on my trial.  Having such strong convictions on the question when I returned from  South Africa, I prized the contact with the Brothers. But before  closer touch could be established they were isolated. Maulana  Mahomed Ali used to write long letters to me from Betul and  Chhindwada whenever his jailers allowed him to do so. I applied for  permission to visit the Brothers, but to no purpose.  It was after the imprisonment of the Ali Brothers that I was invited  by Muslim friends to attend the session of the Muslim League at  Calcutta. Being requested to speak, I addressed them on the duty of  the Muslims to secure the Brother's release. A little while after  this I was taken by these friends to the Muslim College at Aligarh.  There I invited the young men to be fakirs for the service of the  motherland.  Next I opened correspondence with the Government for the release of  the Brothers. In that connection I studied the Brothers' views and  activities about the Khilafat. I had discussions with Musalman  friends. I felt that, if I would become a true friend of the  Muslims, I must render all possible help in securing the release of  the Brothers, and a just settlement of the Khilafat question. It was  not for me to enter into the absolute merits of the question,  provided there was nothing immoral in their demands. In matters of  religion beliefs differ, and each one's is supreme for himself. If  all had the same belief about all matters of religion, there would  be only one religion in the world. As time progressed I found that  the Muslim demand about the Khilafat was not only not against any  ethical principle, but that the British Prime Minister had admitted  the justice of the Muslim demand. I felt, therefore, bound to render  what help I could in securing a due fulfillment of the prime  Minister's pledge. The pledge had been given in such clear terms  that the examination of the Muslim demand on the merits was needed  only to satisfy my own conscience.  Friends and critics have criticized my attitude regarding the  Khilafat question. In spite of the criticism I feel that I have no  reason to revise it or to regret my co-operation with the Muslims. I  should adopt the same attitude, should a similar occasion arise.  When, therefore, I went to Delhi, I had fully intended to submit the  Muslim case to the Viceroy. The Khilafat question had not then  assumed the shape it did subsequently.  But on my reaching Delhi another difficulty in the way of my  attending the conference arose. Dinabandhu Andrews raised a question  about the morality of my participation in the war conference. He  told me of the controversy in the British press regarding secret  treaties between England and Italy. How could I participate in the  conference, if England had entered into secret treaties with another  European power? asked Mr. Andrews. I knew nothing of the treaties.  Dinabandhu Andrews' word was enough for me. I therefore addressed a  letter to Lord Chelmsford explaining my hesitation to take part in  the conference. He invited me to discuss the question with him. I  had a prolonged discussion with him and his Private Secretary Mr.  Maffey. As a result I agreed to take part in the conference. This  was in effect the Viceroy's argument: 'Surely you do not believe  that the Viceroy knows everything done by the British Cabinet. I do  not claim, no one claims, that the British Government is infallible.  But if you agree that the Empire has been, on the whole, a power for  good, if you believe that India has, on the whole, benefited by the  British connection, would you not admit that it is the duty of every  Indian citizen to help the Empire in the hour of its need? I too  have read what the British papers say about the secret treaties. I  can assure you that I know nothing beyond what the papers say, and  you know the canards that these papers frequently start. Can you,  acting on a mere newspaper report, refuse help to the Empire at such  a critical juncture? You may raise whatever moral issues you like  and challenge us as much as you please after the conclusion of the  war, not today.'  The argument was not new. It appealed to me as new because of the  manner in which, and the hour at which, it was presented, and I  agreed to attend the conference. As regards the Muslim demands I was  to address a letter to the Viceroy.
