So I attended the conference. The Viceroy was very keen on my  supporting the resolution about recruiting. I asked for permission  to speak in Hindi-Hindustani. The Viceroy acceded to my request, but  suggested that I should speak also in English. I had no speech to  make. I spoke but one sentence to this effect: 'With a full sense of  my responsibility I beg to support the resolution.'  Many congratulated me on my having spoken in Hindustani. That was,  they said, the first instance within living memory of anyone having  spoken in Hindustani at such a meeting. The congratulations and the  discovery that I was the first to speak in Hindustani at a Viceregal  meeting hurt my national pride. I felt like shrinking into myself.  What a tragedy that the language of the country should be taboo in  meetings held in the country, for work relating to the country, and  that a speech there in Hindustani by a stray individual like myself  should be a matter for congratulation! Incidents like these are  reminders of the low state to which we have been reduced. The one sentence that I uttered at the conference had for me  considerable significance. It was impossible for me to forget either  the conference or the resolution I supported. There was one  undertaking that I had to fulfill while yet in Delhi. I had to write  a letter to the Viceroy. This was no easy thing for me. I felt it my  duty both in the interests of the Government and of the people to  explain therein how and why I attended the conference, and to state  clearly what the people expected from Government.  In the letter I expressed my regret for the exclusion from the  conference of leaders like Lokamanya Tilak and the Ali Brothers, and  stated the people's minimum political demand as also the demands of  the Muslims on account of the situation created by the war. I asked  for permission to publish the letter, and the Viceroy gladly gave  it.  The letter had to be sent to Simla, where the Viceroy had gone  immediately after the conference. The letter had for me considerable  importance, and sending it by post would have meant delay. I wanted  to save time, and yet I was not inclined to send it by any messenger  I came across. I wanted some pure man to carry it and hand it  personally at the Viceregal Lodge. Dinabandhu Andrews and Principal  Rudra suggested the name of the good Reverend Ireland of the Cambridge  Mission. He agreed to carry the letter if he might read it and if it  appealed to him as good. I had no objection as the letter was by no  means private. He read it, liked it and expressed his willingness to  carry out the mission. I offered him the second class fare, but he  declined it saying he was accustomed to travelling intermediate.  This he did though it was a night journey. His simplicity and his  straight and plainspoken manner captivated me. The letter thus  delivered at the hands of a pure-minded man had, as I thought, the  desired result. It eased my mind and cleared my way.  The other part of my obligation consisted in raising recruits. Where  could I make a beginning except in Kheda? And whom could I invite to  be the first recruits except my own co-workers? So as soon as I  reached Nadiad, I had a conference with Vallabhbhai and other  friends. Some of them could not easily take to the proposal. Those  who liked the proposal had misgivings about its success. There was  no love lost between the Government and the classes to which I  wanted to make my appeal. The bitter experience they had had of the  Government officials was still fresh in their memory.  And yet they were in favour of starting work. As soon as I set about  my task, my eyes were opened. My optimism received a rude shock.  Whereas during the revenue campaign the people readily offered their  carts free of charge, and two volunteers came forth when one was  needed, it was difficult now to get a cart even on hire, to say  nothing of volunteers. But we would not be dismayed. We decided to  dispense with the use of carts and to do our journeys on foot. At  this rate we had to trudge about twenty miles a day. If carts were not  forthcoming, it was idle to expect people to feed us. It was hardly  proper to ask for food. So it was decided that every volunteer must  carry his food in his satchel. No bedding or sheet was necessary as  it was summer.  We had meetings wherever we went. People did attend, but hardly one  or two would offer themselves as recruits. 'You are a votary of  Ahimsa, how can you ask us to take up arms?' 'What good has  Government done for India to deserve our co-operation?' These and  similar questions used to be put to us.  However, our steady work began to tell. Quite a number of names were  registered, and we hoped that we should be able to have a regular  supply as soon as the first batch was sent. I had already begun to  confer with the Commissioner as to where the recruits were to be  accommodated.  The Commissioners in every division were holding conferences on the  Delhi model. One such was held in Gujarat. My co-workers and I were  invited to it. We attended, but I felt there was even less place for  me here than at Delhi. In this atmosphere of servile submission I  felt ill at ease. I spoke somewhat at length. I could say nothing to  please the officials, and had certainly one or two hard things to  say.  I used to issue leaflets asking people to enlist as recruits. One of  the arguments I had used was distasteful to the Commissioner: 'Among  the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look  upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we  want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of  arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle classes render  voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will  disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn.' The  Commissioner referred to this and said that he appreciated my  presence in the conference in spite of the differences between us.  And I had to justify my standpoint as courteously as I could. Here is the letter to the Viceroy referred to above:  As you are aware, after careful consideration, I felt constrained  to convey to Your Excellency that I could not attend the Conference  for reasons stated in the letter of the 26th instant (April), but,  after the interview you were good enough to grant me, I persuaded  myself to join it, if for no other cause, then certainly out of my  great regard for yourself. One of my reasons for abstention and  perhaps the strongest was that Lokamanya Tilak, Mrs. Besant and the  Ali Brothers, whom I regard as among the most powerful leaders of  public opinion, were not invited to the Conference. I still feel  that it was a grave blunder not to have asked them, and I  respectfully suggest that blunder might be possibly repaired if  these leaders were invited to assist the Government by giving it the  benefit of their advice at the Provincial Conferences, which, I  understand, are to follow. I venture to submit that no Government can  afford to disregard the leaders, who represent the large masses of  the people as these do, even though they may hold views  fundamentally different. At the same time it gives me pleasure to be  able to say that the views of all parties were permitted to be  freely expressed at the Committees of the Conference. For my part, I  purposely refrained from stating my views at the Committee at which  I had the honour of serving, or at the Conference itself. I felt  that I could best serve the objects of the Conference by simply  tendering my support to the resolutions submitted to it, and this I  have done without any reservation. I hope to translate the spoken  word into action as early as the Government can see its way to  accept my offer, which I am submitting simultaneously herewith in a  separate letter.  I recognize that in the hour of its danger we must give, as we have  decided to give, ungrudging and unequivocal support to the Empire of  which we aspire in the near future to be partners in the same sense  as the Dominions overseas. But it is the simple truth that our  response is due to the expectation that our goal will be reached all  the more speedily. On that account, even as performance of duty  automatically confers a corresponding right, people are entitled to  believe that the imminent reforms alluded to in your speech will  embody the main general principles of the Congress-League Scheme,  and I am sure that it is this faith which has enabled many members  of the Conference to tender to the Government their full-hearted  co-operation.  If I could make my countrymen retrace their steps, I would make  them withdraw all the Congress resolutions, and not whisper 'Home  Rule' or 'Responsible Government' during the pendency of the war. I  would make India offer all her able-bodied sons as a sacrifice to  the Empire at its critical moment, and I know that India, by this  very act, would become the most favoured partner in the Empire, and  racial distinctions would become a thing of the past. But  practically the whole of educated India has decided to take a less  effective course, and it is no longer possible to say that educated  India does not exercise any influence on the masses. I have been  coming into most intimate touch with the ryots ever since my return  from South Africa to India, and I wish to assure you that the desire  for Home Rule has widely penetrated them. I was present at the  sessions of the last Congress, and I was a party to the resolution that full Responsible Government should be granted to  British India within a period to be fixed definitely by a  Parliamentary Statute. I admit that it is a bold step to take, but I  feel sure that nothing less than a definite vision of Home Rule to  be realized in the shortest possible time will satisfy the Indian  people. I know that there are many in India who consider no  sacrifice as too great in order to achieve the end, and they are  wakeful enough to realize that they must be equally prepared to  sacrifice themselves for the Empire in which they hope and desire to  reach their final status. It follows then that we can but accelerate  our journey to the goal by silently and simply devoting ourselves  heart and soul to the work of delivering the Empire from the  threatening danger. It will be national suicide not to recognize  this elementary truth. We must perceive that, if we serve to save  the Empire, we have in that very act secured Home Rule. Whilst, therefore, it is clear to me that we should give to the  Empire every available man for its defence, I fear that I cannot say  the same thing about financial assistance. My intimate intercourse  with the ryots convinces me that India has already donated to the  Imperial Exchequer beyond her capacity. I know that in making this  statement I am voicing the opinion of the majority of my countrymen.  The conference means for me, and I believe for many of us, a  definite step in the consecration of our lives to the common cause,  but ours is a peculiar position. We are today outside the  partnership. Ours is a consecration based on hope of better future.  I should be untrue to you and to my country if I did not clearly and  unequivocally tell you what that hope is. I do not bargain for its fulfillment, but you should know that disappointment of hope means disillusion.  There is one thing I may not omit. You have appealed  to us to sink domestic differences. If the appeal involves the  toleration of tyranny and wrongdoing on the part of officials, I am  powerless to respond. I shall resist organized tyranny to the  uttermost. The appeal must be to the officials that they do not  ill-treat a single soul, and that they consult and respect popular  opinion as never before. In Champaran by resisting an  age-long tyranny I have shown the ultimate sovereignty of British  justice. In Kheda a population that was cursing the Government now  feels that it, and not the Government, is the power when it is  prepared to suffer for the truth it represents. It is, therefore,  losing its bitterness and is saying to itself that the Government  must be a Government for people, for it tolerates orderly and  respectful disobedience where injustice is felt. Thus Champaran and  Kheda affairs are my direct, definite and special contribution to  the war. Ask me to suspend my activities in that direction and you  ask me to suspend my life. If I could popularize the use of  soul-force, which is but another name for love-force, in place of  brute force, I know that I could present you with an India that  could defy the whole world to do its worst. In season and out of  season, therefore, I shall discipline myself to express in my life  this eternal law of suffering, and present it for acceptance to  those who care, and if I take part in any other activity, the motive  is to show the matchless superiority of that law.  Lastly, I would like you to ask His Majesty's Ministers to give  definite assurance about Mohammedan States. I am sure you know that  every Mohammedan is deeply interested in them. As a Hindu, I cannot  be indifferent to their cause. Their sorrows must be our sorrows. In  the most scrupulous regard for the rights of those States and of  the Muslim sentiment as to their places of worship, and your just  and timely treatment of India's claim to Home Rule lies the safety  of the Empire. I write this, because I love the English nation, and  I wish to evoke in every Indian the loyalty of Englishmen.
