After a short tour in South India I reached Bombay, I think on the 4th  April, having received a wire from Sjt. Shankarlal Banker asking me  to be present there for the 6th of April celebrations. But in the meanwhile Delhi had already observed the hartal  on the 30th March. The word of the late Swami Shraddhanandji and  Hakim Ajmal Khan Saheb was law there. The wire about the  postponement of the hartal till the 6th of April had reached there too late. Delhi had never  witnessed a hartal like that before. Hindus and Musalmans seemed united like one man.  Swami Shraddhanandji was invited to deliver a speech in the Jumma  Masjid, which he did. All this was more than the authorities could  bear. The police checked the hartal procession as it was proceeding towards the railway station, and  opened fire, causing a number of casualties, and the reign of  repression commenced in Delhi. Shraddhanandji urgently summoned me  to Delhi. I wired back, saying I would start for Delhi immediately  after the 6th of April celebrations were over in Bombay.  The story of happenings in Delhi was repeated with variations in  Lahore and Amritsar. From Amritsar Drs. Satyapal and Kitchlu had  sent me a pressing invitation to go there. I was altogether  unacquainted with them at at that time, but I communicated to them  my intention to visit Amritsar after Delhi. On the morning of the 6th the citizens of Bombay flocked to the Chowpati for a bath in the sea, after which they  moved on in a procession to Thakurdvar. The procession included a  fair sprinkling of women and children, while the Musalmans joined it  in large numbers. From Thakurdvar some of us who were in the  procession were taken by the Musalman friends to a mosque near by,  where Mrs. Naidu and myself were persuaded to deliver speeches. Sjt.  Vithaldas Jerajani proposed that we should then and there administer  the Swadeshi and Hindu-Muslim unity pledges to the people, but I  resisted the proposal on the ground that pledges should not be  administered or taken in precipitate hurry, and that we should be  satisfied with what was already being done by the people. A pledge  once taken, I argued, must not be broken afterwards; therefore it  was necessary that the implications of the Swadeshi pledge should be  clearly understood, and the grave responsibility entailed by the  pledge regarding Hindu-Muslim unity fully realized by all concerned.  In the end I suggested that those who wanted to take the pledges  should again assemble on the following morning for the purpose. Needless to say the hartal in Bombay was a complete success. Full preparation had been made for  starting civil disobedience. Two or three things had been discussed  in this connection. It was decided that civil disobedience might be  offered in respect of such laws only as easily lent themselves to  being disobeyed by the masses. The salt tax was extremely unpopular  and a powerful movement had been for some time past going on to  secure its repeal. I therefore suggested that the people might  prepare salt from sea-water in their own houses in disregard of the  salt laws. My other suggestion was about the sale of proscribed  literature. Two of my books, viz., Hind Swaraj  and Sarvodaya (Gujarati adaptation of Ruskin's Unto This Last),  which had been already proscribed, came handy for this purpose. To  print and sell them openly seemed to be the easiest way of offering  civil disobedience. A sufficient number of copies of the books was  therefore printed, and it was arranged to sell them at the end of  the monster meeting that was to be held that evening after the  breaking of the fast.  On the evening of the 6th an army of volunteers issued forth  accordingly with this prohibited literature to sell it among the  people. Both Shrimati Sarojini Devi and I went out in cars. All the  copies were soon sold out. The proceeds of the sale were to be utilized  for furthering the civil disobedience campaign. Both these books  were priced at four annas per copy, but I hardly remember anybody  having purchased them from me at their face value merely. Quite a  large number of people simply poured out all the cash that was in  their pockets to purchase their copy. Five and ten rupee notes just  flew out to cover the price of a single copy, while in one case I  remember having sold a copy for fifty rupees! It was duly explained  to the people that they were liable to be arrested and imprisoned  for purchasing the proscribed literature. But for the moment they  had shed all fear of jail-going.  It was subsequently learnt that the Government had conveniently  taken the view that the books that had been proscribed by it had not  in fact been sold, and that what we had sold was not held as coming  under the definition of proscribed literature. The reprint was held  by the Government to be a new edition of the books that had been  proscribed, and to sell them did not constitute an offence under the  law. This news caused general disappointment.  The next morning another meeting was held for the administration of  the pledges with regard to Swadeshi and Hindu-Muslim unity.  Vithaldas Jerajani for the first time realized that all is not gold  that glitters. Only a handful of persons came. I distinctly remember  some of the sisters who were present on that occasion. The men who  attended were also very few. I had already drafted the pledge and  brought it with me. I thoroughly explained its meaning to those  present before I administered it to them. The paucity of the  attendance neither pained nor surprised me, for I have noticed this  characteristic difference in the popular attitude â€“ partiality for  exciting work, dislike for quiet constructive effort. The difference  has persisted to this day. But I shall have to devote to this subject a chapter by itself. To  return to the story. On the night of the 7th I started for Delhi and  Amritsar. On reaching Mathura on the 8th I first heard rumours about  my probable arrest. At the next stoppage after Mathura, Acharya  Gidvani came to meet me, and gave me definite news that I was to be  arrested, and offered his services to me if I should need them. I  thanked him for the offer, assuring him that I would not fail to  avail myself of it, if and when I felt it necessary.  Before the train had reached Palwal railway station, I was served  with a written order to the effect that I was prohibited from  entering the boundary of the Punjab, as my presence there was likely  to result in a disturbance of the peace. I was asked by the police  to get down from the train. I refused to do so saying, 'I want to go  to the Punjab in response to a pressing invitation, not to foment  unrest, but to allay it. I am therefore sorry that it is not  possible for me to comply with this order.' At last the train reached Palwal. Mahadev was with me. I asked him  to proceed to Delhi to convey to Swami Shraddhanandji the news about  what had happened and to ask the people to remain clam. He was to  explain why I had decided to disobey the order served upon me and  suffer the penalty for disobeying it, and also why it would spell  victory for our side if we could maintain perfect peace in spite of  any punishment that might be inflicted upon me.  At Palwal railway station I was taken out of the train and put under  police custody. A train from Delhi came in a short time. I was made  to enter a third class carriage, the police party accompanying. On  reaching Mathura, I was taken to the police barracks, but no police  official could tell me as to what they proposed to do with me or  where I was to be taken next. Early at 4 o'clock the next morning I  was awoken and put in a goods train that was going towards Bombay.  At noon I was again made to get down at Sawai Madhopur. Mr. Bowring,  Inspector of Police, who arrived by the mail train from Lahore, now  took charge of me. I was put in a first class compartment with him.  And from an ordinary prisoner I became a 'gentleman' prisoner. The  officer commenced a long panegyric of Sir Michael O'Dwyer. Sir  Michael had nothing against me personally, he went on, only he  apprehended a disturbance of the peace if I entered the Punjab and  so on. In the end he requested me to return to Bombay of my own  accord and agree not to cross the frontier of the Punjab. I replied  that I could not possibly comply with the order, and that I was not  prepared of my own accord to go back. Whereupon the officer, seeing  no other course, told me that he would have to enforce law against  me. 'But what do you want to do with me?' I asked him. He replied  that he himself did not know, but was awaiting further orders. 'For  the present,' he said, I am taking you to Bombay.'  We reached Surat. Here I was made over to the charge of another  police officer. 'You are now free,' the officer told me when we had  reached Bombay. 'It would however be better,' he added, 'if you get  down near the Marine Lines where I shall get the train stopped for  you. At Colaba there is likely to be a big crowd.' I told him that I  would be glad to follow his wish. He was pleased and thanked me for  it. Accordingly I alighted at the Marine Lines. The carriage of a  friend just happened to be passing by. It took me and left me at  Revashankar Jhaveri's place. The friend told me that the news of my  arrest had incensed the people and roused them to a pitch of mad  frenzy. 'An outbreak is apprehended every minute near Pydhuni, the  Magistrate and the police have already arrived there,' he added. Scarcely had I reached my destination, when Umar Sobani and  Anasuyabehn arrived and asked me to motor to Pydhuni at once. 'The  people have become impatient, and are very much excited,' they said,  'we cannot pacify them. Your presence alone can do it.'  I got into the car. Near Pydhuni I saw that a huge crowd had gathered.  On seeing me the people went mad with joy. A procession was  immediately formed, and the sky was rent with the shouts of Vande mataram and Allaho akbar.  At Pydhuni we sighted a body of mounted police. Brickbats were  raining down from above. I besought the crowd to be calm, but it  seemed as if we should not be able to escape the shower of  brickbats. As the procession issued out of Abdur Rahman Street and  was about to proceed towards the Crawford Market, it suddenly found  itself confronted by a body of the mounted police, who had arrived  there to prevent it from proceeding further in the direction of the  Fort. The crowd was densely packed. It had almost broken through the  police cordon. There was hardly any chance of my voice being heard  in that vast concourse. Just then the officer in charge of the  mounted police gave the order to disperse the crowd, and at once the  mounted party charged upon the crowd brandishing their lances as  they went. For a moment I felt that I would be hurt. But my  apprehension was groundless, the lances just grazed the car as the  lancers swiftly passed by. The ranks of the people were soon broken,  and they were thrown into utter confusion, which was soon converted  into a rout. Some got trampled under foot, others were badly mauled  and crushed. In that seething mass of humanity there was hardly any  room for the horses to pass, nor was there an exit by which the  people could disperse. So the lancers blindly cut their way through  the crowd. I hardly imagine they could see what they were doing. The  whole thing presented a most dreadful spectacle. The horsemen and  the people were mixed together in mad confusion.  Thus the crowd was dispersed and its progress checked. Our motor was  allowed to proceed. I had it stopped before the Commissioner's  office, and got down to complain to him about the conduct of the  police.
