Thus, whilst this movement for the preservation of non-violence was making  steady though slow progress on the one hand, Government's policy of  lawless repression was in full career on the other, and was  manifesting itself in the Punjab in all its nakedness. Leaders were  put under arrest, martial law, which in other words meant no law,  was proclaimed, special tribunals were set up. These tribunals were  not courts of justice but instruments for carrying out the arbitrary  will of an autocrat. Sentences were passed unwarranted by evidence  and in flagrant violation of justice. In Amritsar innocent men and  women were made to crawl like worms on their bellies. Before this  outrage the Jalianwala Bagh tragedy paled into insignificance in my  eyes, though it was this massacre principally that attracted the  attention of the people of India and of the world.  I was pressed to proceed to the Punjab immediately in disregard of  consequences. I wrote and also telegraphed to the Viceroy asking for  permission to go there, but in vain. If I proceeded without the  necessary permission, I should not be allowed to cross the boundary  of the Punjab, but left to find what satisfaction I could from civil  disobedience. I was thus confronted by a serious dilemma. As things  stood, to break the order against my entry into the Punjab could, it  seemed to me, hardly be classed as civil disobedience, for I did not  see around me the kind of peaceful atmosphere that I wanted, and the  unbridled repression in the Punjab had further served to aggravate  and deepen the feelings of resentment. For me, therefore, to offer  civil disobedience at such a time, even if it were possible, would  have been like fanning the flame. I therefore decided not to proceed  to the Punjab in spite of the suggestion of friends. It was a bitter  pill for me to swallow. Tales of rank injustice and oppression came  pouring in daily from the Punjab, but all I could do was to sit  helplessly by and gnash my teeth.  Just then Mr. Horniman, in whose hands The Bombay Chronicle had  became a formidable force, was suddenly spirited away by the  authorities. This act of the Government seemed to me to be  surrounded by a foulness which still stinks in my nostrils. I know  that Mr. Horniman never desired lawlessness. He had not liked my  breaking the prohibitory order of the Punjab Government without the  permission of the Satyagraha Committee, and had fully endorsed the  decision to suspend civil disobedience. I had even received from him  a letter advising suspension before I had announced my  decision to that effect. Only owing to the distance between Bombay  and Ahmedabad I got the letter after the announcement. His sudden  deportation therefore caused me as much pain as surprise. As a result of these developments I was asked by the directors of  The Bombay Chronicle to take up the responsibility of conducting  that paper. Mr. Brelvi was already there on the staff, so not much  remained to be done by me, but as usual with my nature, the  responsibility would have become an additional tax.  But the Government came as it were to my rescue, for by its order  the publication of The Chronicle had to be suspended. The friends who were directing the management of The Chronicle, viz.,  Messrs. Umar Sobani and Shankarlal Banker, were at this also  controlling Young India. They suggested that, in view of the  suppression of The Chronicle, I should now take up the editorship  of Young India, and that, in order to fill the gap left by the  former, Young India should be converted from a weekly into a  bi-weekly organ. This was what I felt also. I was anxious to expound  the inner meaning of Satyagraha to the public, and also hoped that  through this effort I should at least be able to do justice to the  Punjab situation. For, behind all I wrote, there was potential  Satyagraha, and the Government knew as much. I therefore readily  accepted the suggestion made by these friends.  But how could the  general public be trained in Satyagraha through the medium of  English? My principal field of work lay in Gujarat. Sjt. Indulal  Yajnik was at that time associated with the group of Messrs. Sobani  and Banker. He was conducting the Gujarati monthly Navajivan which  had the financial backing of these friends. They placed the monthly  at my disposal, and further Sjt. Indulal offered to work on it. This  monthly was converted into a weekly.  In the meantime The Chronicle was resuscitated. Young India was  therefore restored to its original weekly form. To have published  the two weeklies from two different places would have been very  inconvenient to me and involved more expenditure. As Navajivan was  already being published from Ahmedabad Young India was also removed  there at my suggestion.  There were other reasons besides for this change. I had already  learnt from my experience of Indian Opinion that such journals  needed a press of their own. Moreover the press laws in force in  India at that time were such that, if I wanted to express my views untrammelled, the existing printing presses, which were naturally  run for business, would have hesitated to publish them. The need for  setting up a press of our own, therefore, became all the more  imperative, and since this could be conveniently done only at  Ahmedabad, Young India too had to be taken there. Through these journals I now commenced to the best of my ability the  work of educating the reading public in Satyagraha. Both of them had  reached a very wide circulation, which at one time rose to the neighbourhood of forty thousand each. But while the circulation of  Navajivan went up at a bound, that of Young India increased only by  slow degrees. After my incarceration the circulation of both these  journals fell to a low ebb, and today stands below eight thousand. From the very start I set my face against taking advertisements in  these journals. I do not think that they have lost anything thereby.  On the contrary, it is my belief that it has in no small measure  helped them to maintain their independence.  Incidentally these journals helped me also to some extent to remain  at peace with myself, for whilst immediate resort to civil  disobedience was out of the question, they enabled me freely to  ventilate my views and to put heart into the people. Thus I feel  that both the journals rendered good service to the people in this  hour of trial, and did their humble bit towards lightening the  tyranny of the martial law.
