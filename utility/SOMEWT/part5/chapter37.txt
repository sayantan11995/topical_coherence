The Punjab Government could not keep in confinement the hundreds of  Punjabis who, under the martial law regime, had been clapped into  jail on the strength of the most meagre evidence by tribunals that  were courts only in name. There was such an outcry all round against  this flagrant piece of injustice that their further incarceration  became imposible. Most of the prisoners were released before the  Congress opened. Lala Harkishanlal and the other leaders were all  released, while the session of the Congress was still in progress.  The Ali Brothers too arrived there straight from jail. The people's  joy knew no bounds. Pandit Motilal Nehru, who, at the sacrifice of  his splendid practice, had made the Punjab his headquarters and had  done great service, was the President of the Congress; the late  Swami Shraddhanandji was the Chairman of the Reception Committee. Up to this time my share in the annual proceedings of the Congress was  confined only to the constructive advocacy of Hindi by making my  speech in the national language, and to presenting in that speech the  case of the Indians overseas. Nor did I expect to be called upon to  do anything more this year. But, as had happened on many a previous  occasion, responsible work came to me all of a sudden. The King's announcement on the new reforms had just been issued. It  was not wholly satisfactory even to me, and was unsatisfactory to  everyone else. But I felt at that time that the reforms, though  defective, could still be accepted. I felt in the King's  announcement and its language the hand of Lord Sinha, and it lent a  ray of hope. But experienced stalwarts like the late Lokamanya and  Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das shook their heads. Pandit Malaviyaji  was neutral.  Pandit Malaviyaji had harboured me in his own room. I had a glimpse  of the simplicity of his life on the occasion of the foundation  ceremony of the Hindu University; but on this occasion, being in the  same room with him, I was able to observe his daily routine in the  closest detail, and what I saw filled me with joyful surprise. His  room presented the appearance of a free inn for all the poor. You  could hardly cross from one end to the other. It was so crowded. It  was accessible at all odd hours to chance visitors who had the  licence to take as much of his time as they liked. In a corner of  this crib lay my charpai1 in all its dignity.  But I may not occupy this chapter with a description of Malaviyaji's  mode of living, and must return to my subject.  I was thus enabled to  hold daily discussions with Malaviyaji, who used lovingly to explain  to me, like an elder brother, the various view-points of the  different parties. I saw that my participation in the deliberations  on the resolution on the reforms was inevitable. Having had my share  of responsibility in the drawing up of the Congress report on the  Punjab wrongs, I felt that all that still remained to be done in  that connection must claim my attention. There had to be dealings  with Government in that matter. Then similarly there was the  Khilafat question. I further believed at that time that Mr. Montagu  would not betray or allow India's cause to be betrayed. The release  of the Ali Brothers and other prisoners too seemed to me to be an  auspicious sign. In these circumstances I felt that a resolution not  rejecting but accepting the reforms was the correct thing.  Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das, on the other hand, held firmly to the  view that the reforms ought to be rejected as wholly inadequate and  unsatisfactory. The late Lokamanya was more or less neutral, but had  decided to throw in his weight on the side of any resolution that  the Deshabandhu might approve.  The idea of having to differ from such seasoned, well tried and  universally revered leaders was unbearable to me. But on the other  hand the voice of conscience was clear. I tried to run away from the  Congress and suggested to Pandit Malaviyaji and Motilalji that it  would be in the general interest if I absented myself from the  Congress for the rest of the session. It would save me from having  to make an exhibition of my difference with such esteemed leaders. But my suggestion found no favour with these two seniors. The news  of my proposal was somehow whispered to Lala Harkishanlal. 'This  will never do. It will very much hurt the feelings of the Punjabis,'  he said. I discussed the matter with Lokamanya, Deshabandhu and Mr.  Jinnah, but no way out could be found. Finally I laid bare my  distress to Malaviyaji. 'I see no prospect of a compromise,' I told  him, 'and if I am to move my resolution, a division will have to be  called and votes taken. But I do not find here any arrangements for  it. The practice in the open session of the Congress so far has been  to take votes by a show of hands with the result that all  distinction between visitors and delegates is lost, while, as for  taking a count of votes in such vast assemblies, we have no means at  all. So it comes to this that, even if I want to call a division,  there will be no facility for it, nor meaning in it.' But Lala  Harkishanlal came to the rescue and undertook to make the necessary  arrangements. 'We will not,' he said, 'permit visitors in the  Congress pandal on the day on which voting is to take place. And as  for taking the count, well, I shall see to that. But you must not  absent yourself from the Congress.'  I capitulated; I framed my  resolution, and in heart trembling undertook to move it. Pandit  Malaviyaji and Mr. Jinnah were to support it. I could notice that,  although our difference of opinion was free from any trace of  bitterness, and although our speeches too contained nothing but cold  reasoning, the people could not stand the very fact of a difference;  it pained them. They wanted unanimity.  Even while speeches were being delivered, efforts to settle the  difference were being made on the platform, and notes were being  freely exchanged among the leaders for that purpose. Malaviyaji was  leaving no stone unturned to bridge the gulf. Just then Jeramdas  handed over his amendment to me and pleaded in his own sweet manner  to save the delegates from the dilemma of a division. His amendment  appealed to me. Malaviyaji's eye was already scanning every quarter  for a ray of hope. I told him that Jeramdas's amendment seemed to me  to be likely to be acceptable to both the parties. The Lokamanya, to  whom it was next shown, said, 'If C.R. Das approves, I will have no  objection.' Deshabandhu at last thawed, and cast a look towards Sjt.  Bepin Chandra Pal for endorsement. Malaviyaji was filled with hope.  He snatched away the slip of paper containing the amendment, and  before Deshabandhu had even pronounced a definite 'yes', shouted  out, 'Brother delegates, you will be glad to learn that a compromise  had been reached.' What followed beggars description. The pandal was  rent with the clapping of hands, and the erstwhile gloomy faces of  the audience lit up with joy.  It is hardly necessary to deal with the text of the amendment. My  object here is only to describe how this resolution was undertaken  as part of my experiments with which these chapters deal. The compromise further increased my responsibility.
