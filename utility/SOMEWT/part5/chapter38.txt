I must regard my participation in Congress proceedings at Amritsar as  my real entrance into the Congress politics. My attendance at the  previous Congress was nothing more perhaps than an annual renewal of  allegiance to the Congress. I never felt on these occasions that I  had any other work cut out for me except that of a mere private, nor  did I desire more.  My experience of Amritsar had shown that there were one or two  things for which perhaps I had some aptitude and which could be  useful to the Congress. I could already see that the late Lokamanya,  the Deshabandhu, Pandit Motilalji and other leaders were pleased  with my work in connection with the Punjab inquiry. They used to  invite me to their informal gatherings where, as I found, resolutions  for the Subjects Committee were conceived. At these gatherings only  those persons were invited who enjoyed the special confidence of the  leaders and whose services were needed by them. Interlopers also  sometimes found their way to these meetings.  There were, for the coming year, two things which interested me, as  I had some aptitude for them. One of these was the memorial of the  Jalianwala Bagh Massacre. The Congress had passed a resolution for  it amid great enthusiasm. A fund of about five lakhs had to be  collected for it. I was appointed one of the trustees. Pandit  Malaviyaji enjoyed the reputation of being the prince among beggars  for the public cause. But I knew that I was not far behind him in  that respect. It was whilst I was in South Africa that I discovered  my capacity in this direction. I had not the unrivalled magic of  Malaviyaji for commanding princely donations from the potentates of  India. But I knew that there was no question of approaching the  Rajas and Maharajas for donations for the Jalianwala Bagh memorial.  The main responsibility for the collection thus fell, as I had  expected, on my shoulders. The generous citizens of Bombay  subscribed most liberally, and the memorial trust has at present a  handsome credit balance in the bank. But the problem that faces the  country today is what kind of memorial to erect on the ground, to  sanctify which, Hindus, Musalmans and Sikhs mingled their blood. The  three communities, instead of being bound in a bond of amity and  love, are to all appearance, at war with one another, and the  nation is at a loss as to how to utilize the memorial fund. My other aptitude which the Congress could utilize was as a  draftsman. The Congress leaders had found that I had a faculty for  condensed expression, which I had acquired by long practice. The  then existing constitution of the Congress was Gokhale's legacy. He  had framed a few rules which served as a basis for running the  Congress machinery. The interesting history of the framing of these  rules I had learnt form Gokhale's own lips. But everybody had now  come to feel that these rules were no longer adequate for the ever  increasing business of the Congress. The question had been coming up  year after year. The Congress at that time had practically no  machinery functioning during the interval between session and  session, or for dealing with fresh contingencies that might arise in  the course of the year. The existing rules provided for  three secretaries, but as a matter of fact only one of them was a  functioning secretary, and even he was not a whole-timer. How was  he, single-handed, to run the Congress office, to think of the  future, or to discharge during the current year the obligations  contracted by the Congress in the past? During that year, therefore,  everybody felt that this question would assume all the more  importance. The Congress was too unwieldy a body for the discussion  of public affairs. There was no limit set to the number of delegates  in the Congress or to the number of delegates that each province could  return. Some improvement upon the existing chaotic condition was  thus felt by everybody to be an imperative necessity. I undertook  the responsibility of framing a constitution on one condition. I saw  that there were two leaders, viz., the Lokamanya and the  Deshabandhu who had the greatest hold on the public. I requested  that they, as the representatives of the people, should be  associated with me on the Committee for framing the constitution.  But since it was obvious that they would not have the time  personally to participate in the constitution-making work, I  suggested that two persons enjoying their confidence should be a  appointed along with me on the Constitution Committee, and that the  number of its personnel should be limited to three. This suggestion  was accepted by the late Lokmanya and the late Deshabandhu, who suggested the names of Sjts. Kelkar and I.B. Sen  respectively as their proxies. The Constitution Committee could not  even once come together, but we were able to consult with each other  by correspondence, and in the end presented a unanimous report. I  regard this constitution with a certain measure of pride. I hold  that, if we could fully work out this constitution, the mere fact of  working it out would bring us Swaraj. With the assumption of this  responsibility I may be said to have made my real entrance into the  Congress politics.
