From Rajkot I proceeded to Shantiniketan. The teachers and students  overwhelmed me with affection. The reception was a beautiful  combination of simplicity, art and love. It was here I met Kakasaheb  Kalelkar for the first time.  I did not know then why Kalelkar was called 'Kakasaheb'. But I  learnt later on that Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande, who was a  contemporary and a close friend of mine in England, and who had  conducted a school in the Baroda State called 'Ganganath Vidyalaya',  had given the teachers family names with a view to investing the  Vidyalaya with a family atmosphere. Sjt. Kalelkar who was a teacher  there came to be called, 'Kaka' (literaly, paternal uncle), Phadke was  called 'Mama' (literaly, maternal uncle), and Harihar Sharma received the  name 'Anna' (literaly, brother). Others also got similar names. Anandanand  (Swami) as Kaka's friend and Patwardhan (Appa) as Mama's  friend later joined the family, and all in course of time became my  co-workers one after another. Sjt. Deshpande himself used to be  called 'Saheb'. When the Vidyalaya had to be dissolved, the family  also broke up, but they never gave up their spiritual relationship  or their assumed names.  Kakasaheb went out to gain experience of different institutions, and  at the time I went to Shantiniketan, he happened to be there.  Chintaman Shastri, belonging to the same fraternity, was there also.  Both helped in teaching Samskrit.  The Phoenix family had been assigned separate quarters at  Shantiniketan. Maganlal Gandhi was at their head, and he had made it  his business to see that all the rules of the Phoenix Ashram should  be scrupulously observed. I saw that, by dint of his love, knowledge  and perseverance, he had made his fragrance felt in  the whole of Shantiniketan.  Andrews was there, and also Pearson. Amongst the Bengali teachers  with whom we came in fairly close contact were Jagadanandbabu,  Nepalbabu, Santoshbabu, Kshitimohanbabu, Nagenbabu, Sharadbabu and  Kalibabu.  As is my wont, I quickly mixed with the teachers and students, and  engaged them in a discussion on self-help. I put it to the teachers  that, if they and the boys dispensed with the services of paid cooks  and cooked their food themselves, it would enable the teachers to  control the kitchen from the point of view of the boy's physical and  moral health, and it would afford to the students an object-lesson  in self-help. One or two of them were inclined to shake their heads.  Some of them strongly approved of the proposal. The boys welcomed  it, if only because of their instinctive taste for novelty. So we  launched the experiment. When I invited the Poet to express his  opinion, he said that he did not mind it provided the teachers were  favourable. To the boys he said, 'The experiment contains the key to  Swaraj.'  Pearson began to wear away his body in making the experiment a  success. He threw himself into it with zest. A batch was formed to  cut vegetables, another to clean the grain, and so on. Nagenbabu and  others undertook to see to the sanitary cleaning of the kitchen and  its surroundings. It was a delight to me to see them working spade  in hand.  But it was too much to expect the hundred and twenty-five boys with  their teachers to take to this work of physical labour like ducks to  water. There used to be daily discussion. Some began early to show  fatigue. But Pearson was not the man to be tired. One would always  find him with his smiling face doing something or other in or about  the kitchen. He had taken upon himself the cleaning of the bigger  utensils. A party of students played on their sitar  before this cleaning party in order to beguile the tedium of the  operation. All alike took the thing up with zest and Shantiniketan  became a busy hive.  Changes like these when once begun always develop. Not only was the  Phoenix party's kitchen self-conducted, but the food cooked in it  was of the simplest. Condiments were eschewed. Rice, dal,  vegetables and even wheat flour were all cooked at one and the same  time in a steam cooker. And Shantiniketan boys started a similar kitchen with a view to introducing reform in the Bengali  kitchen. One or two teachers and some students ran this kitchen. The experiment was, however, dropped after some time. I am of the opinion  that the famous institution lost nothing by having conducted the  experiment for a brief interval, and some of the experiences gained  could not but be of help to the teachers.  I had intended to stay at Shantiniketan for some time, but fate  willed otherwise. I had hardly been there a week when I received  from Poona a telegram announcing Gokhale's death. Shantiniketan was  immersed in grief. All the members came over to me to express their  condolences. A special meeting was called in the Ashram temple to  mourn the national loss. It was a solemn function. The same day I  left for Poona with my wife and Maganlal. All the rest stayed at  Shantiniketan.  Andrews accompanied me up to Burdwan. 'Do you think,' he asked me,  'that a time will come for Satyagraha in India? And if so, have you  any idea when it will come?'  'It is difficult to say,' said I. 'For one year I am to do nothing.  For Gokhale took from me a promise that I should travel in India for  gaining experience, and express no opinion on public questions until  I have finished the period of probation. Even after the year is  over, I will be in no hurry to speak and pronounce opinions. And so  I do not suppose there will be any occasion for Satyagraha for five  years or so.'  I may note in this connection that Gokhale used to laugh at some of  my ideas in Hind Swaraj (Indian Home Rule)  and say: 'After you have stayed a year in India, your views will  correct themselves.'
