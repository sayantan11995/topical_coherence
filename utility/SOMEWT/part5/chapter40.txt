As last, after no end of wandering in Gujarat, Gangabehn found the  spinning wheel in Vijapur in the Baroda State. Quite a number of  people there had spinning wheels in their homes, but had long since  consigned them to the lofts as useless lumber. They expressed to  Gangabehn their readiness to resume spinning, if someone promised to provide  them with a regular supply of slivers, and to buy the yarn spun by  them. Gangabehn communicated the joyful news to me. The providing of  slivers was found to be a difficult task. On my mentioning the  thing to the late Umar Sobani, he solved the difficulty by  immediately undertaking to send a sufficient supply of slivers from  his mill. I sent to Gangabehn the slivers received from Umar Sobani,  and soon yarn began to pour in at such a rate that it became quite a  problem how to cope with it.  Mr. Umar Sobani's generosity was great, but still one could not go  on taking advantage of it for ever. I felt ill at ease, continuously  receiving slivers from him. Moreover, it seemed to me to be  fundamentally wrong to use mill-slivers. If one could use mill-slivers,  why not use mill-yarn as well? Surely no mills supplied  slivers to the ancients? How did they make their slivers then?  With these thoughts in my mind I suggested to Gangabehn to find  carders who could supply slivers. She confidently undertook the  task. She engaged a carder who was prepared to card cotton. He  demanded thirty-five rupees, if not much more, per month. I  considered no price too high at the time. She trained a few  youngsters to make slivers out of the carded cotton. I begged for  cotton in Bombay. Sjt. Yashvantprasad Desai at once responded.  Gangabehn's enterprise thus prospered beyond expectations. She found  out weavers to weave the yarn that was spun in Vijapur, and soon  Vijapur khadi gained a name for itself.  While these developments were taking place in Vijapur, the spinning  wheel gained a rapid footing in the Ashram. Maganlal Gandhi, by  bringing to bear all his splendid mechanical talent on the wheel,  made many improvements in it, and wheels and their accessories began  to be manufactured at the Ashram. The first piece of khadi  manufactured in the Ashram cost 17 annas per yard. I did not  hesitate to commend this very coarse khadi at that rate to friends,  who willingly paid the price.  I was laid up in bed at Bombay. But I was fit enough to make  searches for the wheel there. At last I chanced upon two spinners.  They charged one rupee for a seer of yarn, i.e., 28 tolas  or nearly three quarters of a pound. I was then ignorant of the  economics of khadi. I considered no price too high for securing  handspun yarn. On comparing the rates paid by me with those paid in  Vijapur I found that I was being cheated. The spinners refused to  agree to any reduction in their rates. So I had to dispense with  their service. But they served their purpose. They taught spinning  to Shrimatis Avantikabai, Ramibai Kamdar, the widowed mother of Sjt.  Shankarlal Banker and Shrimati Vasumatibehn. The wheel began merrily  to hum in my room, and I may say without exaggeration that its hum  had no small share in restoring me to health. I am prepared to  admit that its effect was more psychological than physical. But then  it only shows how powerfully the physical in man reacts to the  psychological. I too set my hand to the wheel, but did not do much  with it at the time.  In Bombay, again, the same old problem of obtaining a supply of  hand-made slivers presented itself. A carder twanging his bow used  to pass daily by Sjt. Revashankar's residence. I sent for him and  learnt that he carded cotton for stuffing mattresses. He  agreed to card cotton for slivers, but demanded a stiff price for it,  which, however, I paid. The yarn thus prepared I disposed of to some  Vaishnava friends for making from it the garlands for the pavitra ekadashi.  Sjt. Shivji started a spinning class in Bombay. All these  experiments involved considerable expenditure. But it was willingly  defrayed by patriotic friends, lovers of the motherland, who had  faith in khadi. The money thus spent, in my humble opinion, was not  wasted . It brought us a rich store of experience, and revealed to  us the possibilities of the spinning wheel.  I now grew impatient for the exclusive adoption of khadi for  my dress. My dhoti was still of Indian mill cloth. The coarse khadi manufactured in the  Ashram and at Vijapur was only thirty inches in width. I gave notice to Gangabehn that, unless she provided me with a  khadi dhoti of forty-five inches within a month, I would do with coarse, short khadi dhoti.  The ultimatum came upon her as a shock. But she proved equal to the  demand made upon her. Well within the month she sent me a pair of  khadi dhotis of forty-five inches width, and thus relieved me from what would then have  been a difficult situation for me.  At about the same time Sjt. Lakshmidas brought Sjt. Ramji, the  weaver, with his wife Gangabehn from Lathi to the Ashram and got  khadi dhotis woven at the Ashram. The part played by this couple in the spread of  khadi was by no means insignificant. They initiated a host of  persons in Gujarat and also outside into the art of weaving hand-spun yarn. To see Gangabehn at her loom is a stirring sight. When this unlettered but self-possessed sister plies at her loom, she  becomes so lost in it that it is difficult to distract her  attention, and much more difficult to draw her eyes off her beloved  loom.
