The time has now come to bring these chapters to a close.  My life from this point onward has been so public that there is  hardly anything about it that people do not know. Moreover, since  1921 I have worked in such close association with the Congress  leaders that I can hardly describe any episode in my life since then  without referring to my relations with them. For though  Shraddhanandji, the Deshabandhu, Hakim Saheb and Lalaji are no more  with us today, we have the good luck to have a host of other veteran  Congress leaders still living and working in our midst. The history  of the Congress, since the great changes in it that I have described  above, is still in the making. And my principal experiments during  the past seven years have all been made through the Congress. A  reference to my relations with the leaders would therefore be  unavoidable, if I set about describing my experiments further. And  this I may not do, at any rate for the present, if only from a sense  of propriety. Lastly, my conclusions from my current experiments can  hardly as yet be regarded as decisive. It therefore seems to me to  be my plain duty to close this narrative here. In fact my pen  instinctively refuses to proceed further.  It is not without a wrench that I have to take leave of the reader.  I set a high value on my experiments. I do not know whether I have  been able to do justice to them. I can only say that I have spared  no pains to give a faithful narrative. To describe truth, as it has  appeared to me, and in the exact manner in which I have arrived at  it, has been my ceaseless effort. The exercise has given me  ineffable mental peace, because, it has been my fond hope that it  might bring faith in Truth and Ahimsa to waverers. My uniform experience has convinced me that there is no other God  than Truth. And if every page of these chapters does not proclaim to  the reader that the only means for the realization of Truth is  Ahimsa, I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters to have  been in vain. And, even though my efforts in this behalf may prove  fruitless, let the readers know that the vehicle, not the great  principle, is at fault. After all, however sincere my strivings  after Ahimsa may have been, they have still been imperfect and  inadequate. The little fleeting glimpses, therefore, that I have  been able to have of Truth can hardly convey an idea of the  indescribable lustre of Truth, a million times more intense than  that of the sun we daily see with our eyes. In fact what I have  caught is only the faintest glimmer of that mighty effulgence. But  this much I can say with assurance, as a result of all my  experiments, that a perfect vision of Truth can only follow a  complete realization of Ahimsa.  To see the universal and all-pervading Spirit of Truth face to face  one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself. And a  man who aspires after that cannot afford to keep out of any field of  life. That is why my devotion to Truth has drawn me into the field  of politics; and I can say without the slightest hesitation, and yet  in all humility, that those who say that religion has nothing to do  with politics do not know what religion means.  Identification with everything that lives is impossible without  self-purification; without self-purification the observance of the  law of Ahimsa must remain an empty dream; God can never be realized  by one who is not pure of heart. Self-purification therefore must  mean purification in all the walks of life. And purification being  highly infectious, purification of oneself necessarily leads to the  purification of one's surroundings.  But the path of self-purification is hard and steep. To attain to  perfect purity one has to become absolutely passion-free in thought,  speech and action; to rise above the opposing currents of love and  hatred, attachment and repulsion. I know that I have not in me as  yet that triple purity, in spite of constant ceaseless striving for  it. That is why the world's praise fails to move me, indeed it very  often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions seems to me to be harder  far than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms.  Ever since my return to India I have had experience of the dormant  passions lying hidden within me. The knowledge of them has made me  feel humiliated though not defeated. The experiences and experiments  have sustained me and given me great joy. But I know that I have  still before me a difficult path to traverse. I must reduce myself  to zero. So long as a man does not of his own free will put himself  last among his fellow creatures, there is no salvation for him.  Ahimsa is the farthest limit of humility. In bidding farewell to the reader, for the time being at any rate, I  ask him to join with me in prayer to the God of Truth that He may  grant me the boon of Ahimsa in mind, word and deed.
