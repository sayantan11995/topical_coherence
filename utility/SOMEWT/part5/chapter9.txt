The pilgrimage to the Kumbha fair was my second visit to Hardvar. The Satyagraha Ashram was founded on the 25th of May, 1915.  Shraddhanandji wanted me to settle in Hardvar. Some of my Calcutta  friends recommended Vaidyanathadham. Others strongly urged me to  choose Rajkot. But when I happened to pass through Ahmedabad, many  friends pressed me to settle down there, and they volunteered to  find the expenses of the Ashram, as well as a house for us to live  in.  I had a predilection for Ahmedabad. Being a Gujarati I thought I  should be able to render the greatest service to the country through  the Gujarati language. And then, as Ahmedabad was an ancient centre  of handloom weaving, it was likely to be the most favourable field  for the revival of the cottage industry of hand-spinning. There was  also the hope that, the city being the capital of Gujarat, monetary  help from its wealthy citizens would be more available here than  elsewhere.  The question of untouchability was naturally among the subjects  discussed with the Ahmedabad friends. I made it clear to them that I  should take the first opportunity of admitting an untouchable  candidate to the Ashram if he was otherwise worthy.  'Where is the untouchable who will satisfy your condition?' said a  vaishnava friend self-complacently.  I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad.  So far as accommodation was concerned, Sjt. Jivanlal Desai, a  barrister in Ahmedabad, was the principal man to help me. He offered  to let, and we decided to hire, his Kochrab bungalow.  The first thing we had to settle was the name of the Ashram. I  consulted friends. Amongst the names suggested were 'Sevashram' (the  abode of service), 'Tapovan' (the abode of austerities), etc. I liked  the name 'Sevashram' but for the absence of emphasis on the method  of service. 'Tapovan' seemed to be a pretentious title, because  though tapas was dear to us we would not presume to be  tapasvins (men of austerity). Our creed was devotion to truth, and our  business was the search for and insistence on truth. I wanted to  acquaint India with the method I had tried in South Africa, and I  desired to test in India the extent to which its application might  be possible. So my companions and I selected the name 'Satyagraha  Ashram', as conveying both our goal and our method of service. For the conduct of the Ashram a code of rules and observances was  necessary. A draft was therefore prepared, and friends were invited  to express their opinions on it. Amongst the many opinions that were  received, that of Sir Gurudas Banerji is still in my memory. He  liked the rules, but suggested that humility should be added as one  of the observances, as he believed that the younger generation sadly  lacked humility. Though I noticed this fault, I feared humility  would cease to be humility the moment it became a matter of vow. The  true connotation of humility is self-effacement. Self-effacement is moksha (salvation), and whilst it cannot, by itself, be an observance,  there may be other observances necessary for its attainment. If the  acts of an aspirant after moksha or a servant have no humility  or selflessness about them, there is no longing for moksha  or service. Service without humility is selfishness and egotism. There were at this time about thirteen Tamilians in our party. Five  Tamil youngsters had accompanied me from South Africa, and the rest  came from different parts of the country. We were in all about  twenty- five men and women.  This is how the Ashram started. All had their meals in a common  kitchen and strove to live as one family.
