    "1830-1837": "     \n A\n      \n  H    \n    \n   A\nA\n \n  .\nMarch , .\nFELLOW CITIZENS: \u2014 Having become a candidate for\nthe honorable o\ufb00ice of one of your Representatives in the\nnext General Assembly of this State, in according with an\nestablished \ncustom \nand \nthe \nprinciples \nof \ntrue\nRepublicanism it becomes my duty to make known to you,\nthe people whom I propose to represent, my sentiments\nwith regard to local a\ufb00airs.\nTime and experience have veri\ufb01ed to a demonstration\nthe public utility of internal improvements. That the\npoorest and most thinly populated countries would be\ngreatly bene\ufb01ted by the opening of good roads, and in the\nclearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no\nperson will deny. Yet it is folly to undertake works of this or\nany other without \ufb01rst knowing that we are able to \ufb01nish\nthem \u2014 as half-\ufb01nished work generally proves to be labor\nlost. There cannot justly be any objection to having\nrailroads and canals, any more than to other good things,\nprovided they cost nothing. The only objection is to paying\nfor them; and the objection arises from the want of ability\nto pay.\nWith respect to the County of Sangamon, some....\n Yet, however desirable an object the construction of a\nrailroad through our country may be, however high our\nimaginations may be heated at thoughts of it, \u2014 there is\nalways a heart-appalling shock accompanying the amount\nof its cost, which forces us to shrink from our pleasing\nanticipations. The probable cost of this contemplated\nrailroad is estimated at  ,; the bare statement of\nwhich, in my opinion, is su\ufb00icient to justify the belief that\nthe improvement of the Sangamon River is an object much\nbetter suited to our infant resources.......\nWhat the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say.\nIt is probable, however, that it would not be greater than is\ncommon to streams of the same length. Finally, I believe\nthe improvement of the Sangamon River to be vastly\nimportant and highly desirable to the people of the county;\nand, if elected, any measure in the Legislature having this\nfor its object, which may appear judicious, will meet my\napprobation and receive my support.\nIt appears that the practice of loaning money at\nexorbitant rates of interest has already been opened as a\n\ufb01eld for discussion; so I suppose I may enter upon it\nwithout claiming the honor or risking the danger which\nmay await its \ufb01rst explorer. It seems as though we are\nnever to have an end to this baneful and corroding system,\nacting almost as prejudicially to the general interests of the\ncommunity as a direct tax of several thousand dollars\nannually laid on each county for the bene\ufb01t of a few\nindividuals only, unless there be a law made \ufb01xing the\nlimits of usury. A law for this purpose, I am of opinion, may\n be made without materially injuring any class of people. In\ncases of extreme necessity, there could always be means\nfound to cheat the law; while in all other cases it would\nhave its intended e\ufb00ect. I would favor the passage of a law\non this subject which might not be very easily evaded. Let\nit be such that the labor and di\ufb00iculty of evading it could\nonly be justi\ufb01ed in cases of greatest necessity.\nUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate\nany plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view\nit as the most important subject which we as a people can\nbe engaged in. That every man may receive at least a\nmoderate education, and thereby be enabled to read the\nhistories of his own and other countries, by which he may\nduly appreciate the value of our free institutions, appears\nto be an object of vital importance, even on this account\nalone, to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to\nbe derived from all being able to read the Scriptures, and\nother works both of a religious and moral nature, for\nthemselves.\nFor my part, I desire to see the time when education \u2014\nand by its means, morality, sobriety, enterprise, and\nindustry \u2014 shall become much more general than at\npresent, and should be grati\ufb01ed to have it in my power to\ncontribute something to the advancement of any measure\nwhich might have a tendency to accelerate that happy\nperiod.\nWith regard to existing laws, some alterations are\nthought to be necessary. Many respectable men have\nsuggested that our estray laws, the law respecting the\n issuing of executions, the road law, and some others, are\nde\ufb01cient in their present form, and require alterations. But,\nconsidering the great probability that the framers of those\nlaws were wiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling\nwith them, unless they were \ufb01rst attacked by others; in\nwhich case I should feel it both a privilege and a duty to\ntake that stand which, in my view, might tend most to the\nadvancement of justice.\nBut, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude. Considering the\ngreat degree of modesty which should always attend youth,\nit is probable I have already been more presuming than\nbecomes me. However, upon the subjects of which I have\ntreated, I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in\nregard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim\nthat it is better only sometimes to be right than at all times\nto be wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be\nerroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.\nEvery man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether\nit be true or not, I can say, for one, that I have no other so\ngreat as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow-men, by\nrendering myself worthy of their esteem. How far I shall\nsucceed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed. I\nam young, and unknown to many of you. I was born, and\nhave ever remained, in the most humble walks of life. I\nhave no wealthy or popular relations or friends to\nrecommend me. My case is thrown exclusively upon the\nindependent voters of the county; and, if elected, they will\nhave conferred a favor upon me for which I shall be\nunremitting in my labors to compensate. But, if the good\n people in their wisdom shall see \ufb01t to keep me in the\nbackground, I have been too familiar with disappointments\nto be very much chagrined.\nYour friend and fellow-citizen, A. LINCOLN.\nNew Salem, March , .\n     \n  \n  .  .   A\n  \n HI .\nNEW SALEM, Aug. , \nE. C. BLANKENSHIP.\nDear Sir: \u2014 In regard to the time David Rankin served\nthe enclosed discharge shows correctly \u2014 as well as I can\nrecollect \u2014 having no writing to refer. The transfer of\nRankin from my company occurred as follows: Rankin\nhaving lost his horse at Dixon\u2019s ferry and having\nacquaintance in one of the foot companies who were going\ndown the river was desirous to go with them, and one\nGalishen being an acquaintance of mine and belonging to\nthe company in which Rankin wished to go wished to leave\nit and join mine, this being the case it was agreed that they\nshould exchange places and answer to each other\u2019s names\n\u2014 as it was expected we all would be discharged in very\nfew days. As to a blanket \u2014 I have no knowledge of Rankin\never getting any. The above embraces all the facts now in\nmy recollection which are pertinent to the case.\nI shall take pleasure in giving any further information in\nmy power should you call on me.\nYour friend, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n    \n   \n     \n   \n  A\n      I \nTO Mr. SPEARS.\nMR. SPEARS: At your request I send you a receipt for the\npostage on your paper. I am somewhat surprised at your\nrequest. I will, however, comply with it. The law requires\nnewspaper postage to be paid in advance, and now that I\nhave waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by\ninsinuating that unless you get a receipt I will probably\nmake you pay it again.\nRespectfully, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n  \n   \n I I A   I \n .\nNew Salem, June , .\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE \u201cJOURNAL\u201d \u2014 In your paper of\nlast Saturday I see a communication, over the signature of\n\u201cMany Voters,\u201d in which the candidates who are announced\nin the Journal are called upon to \u201cshow their hands.\u201d\nAgreed. Here\u2019s mine.\nI go for all sharing the privileges of the government who\nassist in bearing its burdens. Consequently, I go for\nadmitting all whites to the right of su\ufb00rage who pay taxes\nor bear arms (by no means excluding females).\nIf elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon\nmy constituents, as well those that oppose as those that\nsupport me.\nWhile acting as their representative, I shall be governed\nby their will on all subjects upon which I have the means of\nknowing what their will is; and upon all others I shall do\nwhat my own judgment teaches me will best advance their\ninterests. Whether elected or not, I go for distributing the\nproceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several\nStates, to enable our State, in common with others, to dig\ncanals and construct railroads without borrowing money\nand paying the interest on it. If alive on the \ufb01rst Monday in\nNovember, I shall vote for Hugh L. White for President.\n Very respectfully, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n    \n  \n I I A   \n A\nTO ROBERT ALLEN\nNEW SALEM, JUNE , \nDEAR COLONEL: \u2014 I am told that during my absence\nlast week you passed through this place, and stated\npublicly that you were in possession of a fact or facts\nwhich, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the\nprospects of N. W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing\nelection; but that, through favor to us, you should forbear\nto divulge them. No one has needed favors more than I,\nand, generally, few have been less unwilling to accept\nthem; but in this case favor to me would be injustice to the\npublic, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining\nit. That I once had the con\ufb01dence of the people of\nSangamon, is su\ufb00iciently evident; and if I have since done\nanything, either by design or misadventure, which if known\nwould subject me to a forfeiture of that con\ufb01dence, he that\nknows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor to his\ncountry\u2019s interest.\nI \ufb01nd myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of\nwhat fact or facts, real or supposed, you spoke; but my\nopinion of your veracity will not permit me for a moment to\ndoubt that you at least believed what you said. I am\n\ufb02attered with the personal regard you manifested for me;\n but I do hope that, on more mature re\ufb02ection, you will view\nthe public interest as a paramount consideration, and\ntherefore determine to let the worst come. I here assure\nyou that the candid statement of facts on your part,\nhowever low it may sink me, shall never break the tie of\npersonal friendship between us. I wish an answer to this,\nand you are at liberty to publish both, if you choose.\nVery respectfully, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \nI   \nA   \n \n .\nVANDALIA, December , .\nMARY: \u2014 I have been sick ever since my arrival, or I\nshould have written sooner. It is but little di\ufb00erence,\nhowever, as I have very little even yet to write. And more,\nthe longer I can avoid the morti\ufb01cation of looking in the\npost-o\ufb00ice for your letter and not \ufb01nding it, the better. You\nsee I am mad about that old letter yet. I don\u2019t like very well\nto risk you again. I\u2019ll try you once more, anyhow.\nThe \nnew \nState \nHouse \nis \nnot \nyet \n\ufb01nished, \nand\nconsequently the Legislature is doing little or nothing. The\ngovernor delivered an in\ufb02ammatory political message, and\nit is expected there will be some sparring between the\nparties about it as soon as the two Houses get to business.\nTaylor delivered up his petition for the new county to one of\nour members this morning. I am told he despairs of its\nsuccess, on account of all the members from Morgan\nCounty opposing it. There are names enough on the\npetition, I think, to justify the members from our county in\ngoing for it; but if the members from Morgan oppose it,\nwhich they say they will, the chance will be bad.\nOur chance to take the seat of government to Spring\ufb01eld\nis better than I expected. An internal-improvement\nconvention \nwas \nheld \nthere \nsince \nwe \nmet, \nwhich\n recommended a loan of several millions of dollars, on the\nfaith of the State, to construct railroads. Some of the\nLegislature are for it, and some against it; which has the\nmajority I cannot tell. There is great strife and struggling\nfor the o\ufb00ice of the United States Senator here at this time.\nIt is probable we shall ease their pains in a few days. The\nopposition men have no candidate of their own, and\nconsequently they will smile as complacently at the angry\nsnarl of the contending Van Buren candidates and their\nrespective friends as the Christian does at Satan\u2019s rage.\nYou recollect that I mentioned at the outset of this letter\nthat I had been unwell. That is the fact, though I believe I\nam about well now; but that, with other things I cannot\naccount for, have conspired, and have gotten my spirits so\nlow that I feel that I would rather be any place in the world\nthan here. I really cannot endure the thought of staying\nhere ten weeks. Write back as soon as you get this, and, if\npossible, say something that will please me, for really I\nhave not been pleased since I left you. This letter is so dry\nand stupid that I am ashamed to send it, but with my\npresent feelings I cannot do any better.\nGive my best respects to Mr. and Mrs. Able and family.\nYour friend, LINCOLN\n     \n  \n \n  . \n. H.   \nI\n \n A  A  \nSPRINGFIELD, April , .\nDEAR \nMADAM: \n\u2014 \nWithout apologizing for being\negotistical, I shall make the history of so much of my life as\nhas elapsed since I saw you the subject of this letter. And,\nby the way, I now discover that, in order to give a full and\nintelligible account of the things I have done and su\ufb00ered\nsince I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that\nhappened before.\nIt was, then, in the autumn of  that a married lady of\nmy acquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine,\nbeing about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives\nresiding in Kentucky, proposed to me that on her return she\nwould bring a sister of hers with her on condition that I\nwould engage to become her brother-in-law with all\nconvenient despatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal,\nfor you know I could not have done otherwise had I really\nbeen averse to it; but privately, between you and me, I was\nmost confoundedly well pleased with the project. I had seen\nthe said sister some three years before, thought her\nintelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to\nplodding life through hand in hand with her. Time passed\non; the lady took her journey and in due time returned,\nsister in company, sure enough. This astonished me a little,\n for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed\nthat she was a tri\ufb02e too willing, but on re\ufb02ection it\noccurred to me that she might have been prevailed on by\nher married sister to come without anything concerning me\never having been mentioned to her, and so I concluded that\nif no other objection presented itself, I would consent to\nwaive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival\nin the neighborhood \u2014 for, be it remembered, I had not yet\nseen her, except about three years previous, as above\nmentioned. In a few days we had an interview, and,\nalthough I had seen her before, she did not look as my\nimagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but\nshe now appeared a fair match for Falsta\ufb00. I knew she was\ncalled an \u201cold maid,\u201d and I felt no doubt of the truth of at\nleast half of the appellation, but now, when I beheld her, I\ncould not for my life avoid thinking of my mother; and this,\nnot from withered features, \u2014 for her skin was too full of\nfat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles, \u2014 but from\nher want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in general,\nand from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing\ncould have commenced at the size of infancy and reached\nher present bulk in less than thirty-\ufb01ve or forty years; and\nin short, I was not at all pleased with her. But what could I\ndo? I had told her sister that I would take her for better or\nfor worse, and I made a point of honor and conscience in all\nthings to stick to my word especially if others had been\ninduced to act on it which in this case I had no doubt they\nhad, for I was now fairly convinced that no other man on\n earth would have her, and hence the conclusion that they\nwere bent on holding me to my bargain.\n\u201cWell,\u201d thought I, \u201cI have said it, and, be the\nconsequences what they may, it shall not be my fault if I fail\nto do it.\u201d At once I determined to consider her my wife;\nand, this done, all my powers of discovery were put to work\nin search of perfections in her which might be fairly set o\ufb00\nagainst her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome,\nwhich, but for her unfortunate corpulency, was actually\ntrue. Exclusive of this no woman that I have ever seen has a\n\ufb01ner face. I also tried to convince myself that the mind was\nmuch more to be valued than the person; and in this she\nwas not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had\nbeen acquainted.\nShortly after this, without coming to any positive\nunderstanding with her, I set out for Vandalia, when and\nwhere you \ufb01rst saw me. During my stay there I had letters\nfrom her which did not change my opinion of either her\nintellect or intention, but on the contrary con\ufb01rmed it in\nboth.\nAll this while, although I was \ufb01xed, \u201c\ufb01rm as the surge-\nrepelling rock,\u201d in my resolution, I found I was continually\nrepenting the rashness which had led me to make it.\nThrough life, I have been in no bondage, either real or\nimaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much desired to\nbe free. After my return home, I saw nothing to change my\nopinions of her in any particular. She was the same, and so\nwas I. I now spent my time in planning how I might get\nalong through life after my contemplated change of\n circumstances should have taken place, and how I might\nprocrastinate the evil day for a time, which I really dreaded\nas much, perhaps more, than an Irishman does the halter.\nAfter all my su\ufb00ering upon this deeply interesting\nsubject, here I am, wholly, unexpectedly, completely, out of\nthe \u201cscrape\u201d; and now I want to know if you can guess how\nI got out of it \u2014\u2014 out, clear, in every sense of the term; no\nviolation of word, honor, or conscience. I don\u2019t believe you\ncan guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the\nlawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit:\nAfter I had delayed the matter as long as I thought I could\nin honor do (which, by the way, had brought me round into\nthe last fall), I concluded I might as well bring it to a\nconsummation without further delay; and so I mustered my\nresolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but,\nshocking to relate, she answered, No. At \ufb01rst I supposed\nshe did it through an a\ufb00ectation of modesty, which I\nthought \nbut \nill \nbecame \nher \nunder \nthe \npeculiar\ncircumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the\ncharge, I found she repelled it with greater \ufb01rmness than\nbefore. I tried it again and again but with the same success,\nor rather with the same want of success.\nI \ufb01nally was forced to give it up; at which I very\nunexpectedly \nfound \nmyself \nmorti\ufb01ed \nalmost \nbeyond\nendurance. I was morti\ufb01ed, it seemed to me, in a hundred\ndi\ufb00erent ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the\nre\ufb02ection that I had been too stupid to discover her\nintentions, and at the same time never doubting that I\nunderstood them perfectly, and also that she, whom I had\n taught myself to believe nobody else would have, had\nactually rejected me with all my fancied greatness. And, to\ncap the whole, I then for the \ufb01rst time began to suspect\nthat I was really a little in love with her. But let it all go. I\u2019ll\ntry and outlive it. Others have been made fools of by the\ngirls, but this can never with truth be said of me. I most\nemphatically in this instance, made a fool of myself. I have\nnow come to the conclusion never again to think of\nmarrying, and for this reason: I can never be satis\ufb01ed with\nany one who would be blockhead enough to have me.\nWhen you receive this, write me a long yarn about\nsomething to amuse me. Give my respects to Mr. Browning.\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n      H I\n I  I\nI    \nI  A \n  .\nJanuary [?], \nMR. CHAIRMAN: \u2014 Lest I should fall into the too\ncommon error of being mistaken in regard to which side I\ndesign to be upon, I shall make it my \ufb01rst care to remove\nall doubt on that point, by declaring that I am opposed to\nthe resolution under consideration, in toto. Before I\nproceed to the body of the subject, I will further remark,\nthat it is not without a considerable degree of apprehension\nthat I venture to cross the track of the gentleman from\nColes [Mr. Linder]. Indeed, I do not believe I could muster a\nsu\ufb00iciency of courage to come in contact with that\ngentleman, were it not for the fact that he, some days\nsince, most graciously condescended to assure us that he\nwould never be found wasting ammunition on small game.\nOn the same fortunate occasion, he further gave us to\nunderstand, that he regarded himself as being decidedly\nthe superior of our common friend from Randolph [Mr.\nShields]; and feeling, as I really do, that I, to say the most\nof myself, am nothing more than the peer of our friend from\nRandolph, I shall regard the gentleman from Coles as\ndecidedly my superior also, and consequently, in the course\nof what I shall have to say, whenever I shall have occasion\nto allude to that gentleman, I shall endeavor to adopt that\n kind of court language which I understand to be due to\ndecided superiority. In one faculty, at least, there can be no\ndispute of the gentleman\u2019s superiority over me and most\nother men, and that is, the faculty of entangling a subject,\nso that neither himself, or any other man, can \ufb01nd head or\ntail to it. Here he has introduced a resolution embracing\nninety-nine printed lines across common writing paper, and\nyet more than one half of his opening speech has been\nmade upon subjects about which there is not one word said\nin his resolution.\nThough his resolution embraces nothing in regard to the\nconstitutionality of the Bank, much of what he has said has\nbeen with a view to make the impression that it was\nunconstitutional in its inception. Now, although I am\nsatis\ufb01ed that an ample \ufb01eld may be found within the pale of\nthe resolution, at least for small game, yet, as the\ngentleman has traveled out of it, I feel that I may, with all\ndue humility, venture to follow him. The gentleman has\ndiscovered that some gentleman at Washington city has\nbeen \nupon \nthe \nvery \neve \nof \ndeciding \nour \nBank\nunconstitutional, \nand \nthat \nhe \nwould \nprobably \nhave\ncompleted his very authentic decision, had not some one of\nthe Bank o\ufb00icers placed his hand upon his mouth, and\nbegged him to withhold it. The fact that the individuals\ncomposing our Supreme Court have, in an o\ufb00icial capacity,\ndecided in favor of the constitutionality of the Bank, would,\nin my mind, seem a su\ufb00icient answer to this. It is a fact\nknown to all, that the members of the Supreme Court,\ntogether with the Governor, form a Council of Revision, and\n that this Council approved this Bank charter. I ask, then, if\nthe extra-judicial decision not quite but almost made by the\ngentleman at Washington, before whom, by the way, the\nquestion of the constitutionality of our Bank never has, nor\nnever can come \u2014 is to be taken as paramount to a decision\no\ufb00icially made by that tribunal, by which, and which alone,\nthe constitutionality of the Bank can ever be settled? But,\naside from this view of the subject, I would ask, if the\ncommittee which this resolution proposes to appoint are to\nexamine into the Constitutionality of the Bank? Are they to\nbe clothed with power to send for persons and papers, for\nthis object? And after they have found the bank to be\nunconstitutional, and decided it so, how are they to enforce\ntheir decision? What will their decision amount to? They\ncannot compel the Bank to cease operations, or to change\nthe course of its operations. What good, then, can their\nlabors result in? Certainly none.\nThe gentleman asks, if we, without an examination, shall,\nby giving the State deposits to the Bank, and by taking the\nstock reserved for the State, legalize its former misconduct.\nNow I do not pretend to possess su\ufb00icient legal knowledge\nto decide whether a legislative enactment proposing to, and\naccepting from, the Bank, certain terms, would have the\ne\ufb00ect to legalize or wipe out its former errors, or not; but I\ncan assure the gentleman, if such should be the e\ufb00ect, he\nhas already got behind the settlement of accounts; for it is\nwell known to all, that the Legislature, at its last session,\npassed a supplemental Bank charter, which the Bank has\nsince accepted, and which, according to his doctrine, has\n legalized all the alleged violations of its original charter in\nthe distribution of its stock.\nI now proceed to the resolution. By examination it will be\nfound that the \ufb01rst thirty-three lines, being precisely one\nthird of the whole, relate exclusively to the distribution of\nthe stock by the commissioners appointed by the State.\nNow, Sir, it is clear that no question can arise on this\nportion of the resolution, except a question between\ncapitalists in regard to the ownership of stock. Some\ngentlemen have their stock in their hands, while others,\nwho have more money than they know what to do with,\nwant it; and this, and this alone, is the question, to settle\nwhich we are called on to squander thousands of the\npeople\u2019s money. What interest, let me ask, have the people\nin the settlement of this question? What di\ufb00erence is it to\nthem whether the stock is owned by Judge Smith or Sam\nWiggins? If any gentleman be entitled to stock in the Bank,\nwhich he is kept out of possession of by others, let him\nassert his right in the Supreme Court, and let him or his\nantagonist, whichever may be found in the wrong, pay the\ncosts of suit. It is an old maxim, and a very sound one, that\nhe that dances should always pay the \ufb01ddler. Now, Sir, in\nthe present case, if any gentlemen, whose money is a\nburden to them, choose to lead o\ufb00 a dance, I am decidedly\nopposed to the people\u2019s money being used to pay the\n\ufb01ddler. No one can doubt that the examination proposed by\nthis resolution must cost the State some ten or twelve\nthousand dollars; and all this to settle a question in which\nthe people have no interest, and about which they care\n nothing. These capitalists generally act harmoniously and\nin concert, to \ufb02eece the people, and now that they have got\ninto a quarrel with themselves we are called upon to\nappropriate the people\u2019s money to settle the quarrel.\nI leave this part of the resolution and proceed to the\nremainder. It will be found that no charge in the remaining\npart of the resolution, if true, amounts to the violation of\nthe Bank charter, except one, which I will notice in due\ntime. It might seem quite su\ufb00icient to say no more upon\nany of these charges or insinuations than enough to show\nthey are not violations of the charter; yet, as they are\ningeniously framed and handled, with a view to deceive and\nmislead, I will notice in their order all the most prominent\nof them. The \ufb01rst of these is in relation to a connection\nbetween our Bank and several banking institutions in other\nStates. Admitting this connection to exist, I should like to\nsee the gentleman from Coles, or any other gentleman,\nundertake to show that there is any harm in it. What can\nthere be in such a connection, that the people of Illinois are\nwilling to pay their money to get a peep into? By a\nreference to the tenth section of the Bank charter, any\ngentleman can see that the framers of the act contemplated\nthe \nholding \nof \nstock \nin \nthe \ninstitutions \nof \nother\ncorporations. Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice\nforbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money\nin inquiring into its truth?\nThe next charge, in the order of time, is, that some\no\ufb00icer, director, clerk or servant of the Bank, has been\nrequired to take an oath of secrecy in relation to the a\ufb00airs\n of said Bank. Now, I do not know whether this be true or\nfalse \u2014 neither do I believe any honest man cares. I know\nthat \nthe \nseventh \nsection \nof \nthe \ncharter \nexpressly\nguarantees to the Bank the right of making, under certain\nrestrictions, such by-laws as it may think \ufb01t; and I further\nknow that the requiring an oath of secrecy would not\ntranscend those restrictions. What, then, if the Bank has\nchosen to exercise this right? Whom can it injure? Does not\nevery merchant have his secret mark? and who is ever silly\nenough to complain of it? I presume if the Bank does\nrequire any such oath of secrecy, it is done through a\nmotive of delicacy to those individuals who deal with it.\nWhy, Sir, not many days since, one gentleman upon this\n\ufb02oor, who, by the way, I have no doubt is now ready to join\nthis hue and cry against the Bank, indulged in a philippic\nagainst one of the Bank o\ufb00icials, because, as he said, he\nhad divulged a secret.\nImmediately following this last charge, there are several\ninsinuations in the resolution, which are too silly to require\nany sort of notice, were it not for the fact that they\nconclude by saying, \u201cto the great injury of the people at\nlarge.\u201d In answer to this I would say that it is strange\nenough, that the people are su\ufb00ering these \u201cgreat injuries,\u201d\nand yet are not sensible of it! Singular indeed that the\npeople should be writhing under oppression and injury, and\nyet not one among them to be found to raise the voice of\ncomplaint. If the Bank be in\ufb02icting injury upon the people,\nwhy is it that not a single petition is presented to this body\non the subject? If the Bank really be a grievance, why is it\n that no one of the real people is found to ask redress of it?\nThe truth is, no such oppression exists. If it did, our people\nwould groan with memorials and petitions, and we would\nnot be permitted to rest day or night, till we had put it\ndown. The people know their rights, and they are never\nslow to assert and maintain them, when they are invaded.\nLet them call for an investigation, and I shall ever stand\nready to respond to the call. But they have made no such\ncall. I make the assertion boldly, and without fear of\ncontradiction, that no man, who does not hold an o\ufb00ice, or\ndoes not aspire to one, has ever found any fault of the\nBank. It has doubled the prices of the products of their\nfarms, and \ufb01lled their pockets with a sound circulating\nmedium, and they are all well pleased with its operations.\nNo, Sir, it is the politician who is the \ufb01rst to sound the\nalarm (which, by the way, is a false one.) It is he, who, by\nthese unholy means, is endeavoring to blow up a storm that\nhe may ride upon and direct. It is he, and he alone, that\nhere proposes to spend thousands of the people\u2019s public\ntreasure, for no other advantage to them than to make\nvalueless in their pockets the reward of their industry. Mr.\nChairman, this work is exclusively the work of politicians; a\nset of men who have interests aside from the interests of\nthe people, and who, to say the most of them, are, taken as\na mass, at least one long step removed from honest men. I\nsay this with the greater freedom, because, being a\npolitician myself, none can regard it as personal.\nAgain, it is charged, or rather insinuated, that o\ufb00icers of\nthe Bank have loaned money at usurious rates of interest.\n Suppose this to be true, are we to send a committee of this\nHouse to inquire into it? Suppose the committee should\n\ufb01nd it true, can they redress the injured individuals?\nAssuredly not. If any individual had been injured in this\nway, is there not an ample remedy to be found in the laws\nof the land? Does the gentleman from Coles know that\nthere is a statute standing in full force making it highly\npenal for an individual to loan money at a higher rate of\ninterest than twelve per cent? If he does not he is too\nignorant to be placed at the head of the committee which\nhis resolution purposes and if he does, his neglect to\nmention it shows him to be too uncandid to merit the\nrespect or con\ufb01dence of any one.\nBut besides all this, if the Bank were struck from\nexistence, could not the owners of the capital still loan it\nusuriously, as well as now? whatever the Bank, or its\no\ufb00icers, may have done, I know that usurious transactions\nwere much more frequent and enormous before the\ncommencement of its operations than they have ever been\nsince.\nThe next insinuation is, that the Bank has refused specie\npayments. This, if true is a violation of the charter. But\nthere is not the least probability of its truth; because, if\nsuch had been the fact, the individual to whom payment\nwas refused would have had an interest in making it public,\nby suing for the damages to which the charter entitles him.\nYet no such thing has been done; and the strong\npresumption is, that the insinuation is false and groundless.\n From this to the end of the resolution, there is nothing\nthat merits attention \u2014 I therefore drop the particular\nexamination of it.\nBy a general view of the resolution, it will be seen that a\nprincipal object of the committee is to examine into, and\nferret out, a mass of corruption supposed to have been\ncommitted by the commissioners who apportioned the\nstock of the Bank. I believe it is universally understood and\nacknowledged that all men will ever act correctly unless\nthey have a motive to do otherwise. If this be true, we can\nonly suppose that the commissioners acted corruptly by\nalso supposing that they were bribed to do so. Taking this\nview of the subject, I would ask if the Bank is likely to \ufb01nd\nit more di\ufb00icult to bribe the committee of seven, which, we\nare about to appoint, than it may have found it to bribe the\ncommissioners?\n(Here Mr. Linder called to order. The Chair decided that\nMr. Lincoln was not out of order. Mr. Linder appealed to the\nHouse, but, before the question was put, withdrew his\nappeal, saying he preferred to let the gentleman go on; he\nthought he would break his own neck. Mr. Lincoln\nproceeded:)\nAnother gracious condescension! I acknowledge it with\ngratitude. I know I was not out of order; and I know every\nsensible man in the House knows it. I was not saying that\nthe gentleman from Coles could be bribed, nor, on the other\nhand, will I say he could not. In that particular I leave him\nwhere I found him. I was only endeavoring to show that\nthere was at least as great a probability of any seven\n members that could be selected from this House being\nbribed to act corruptly, as there was that the twenty-four\ncommissioners had been so bribed. By a reference to the\nninth section of the Bank charter, it will be seen that those\ncommissioners were John Tilson, Robert K. McLaughlin,\nDaniel Warm, A.G. S. Wight, John C. Riley, W. H. Davidson,\nEdward M. Wilson, Edward L. Pierson, Robert R. Green,\nEzra Baker, Aquilla Wren, John Taylor, Samuel C. Christy,\nEdmund Roberts, Benjamin Godfrey, Thomas Mather, A. M.\nJenkins, W. Linn, W. S. Gilman, Charles Prentice, Richard I.\nHamilton, A.H. Buckner, W. F. Thornton, and Edmund D.\nTaylor.\nThese are twenty-four of the most respectable men in the\nState. Probably no twenty-four men could be selected in the\nState with whom the people are better acquainted, or in\nwhose honor and integrity they would more readily place\ncon\ufb01dence. And I now repeat, that there is less probability\nthat those men have been bribed and corrupted, than that\nany seven men, or rather any six men, that could be\nselected from the members of this House, might be so\nbribed and corrupted, even though they were headed and\nled on by \u201cdecided superiority\u201d himself.\nIn all seriousness, I ask every reasonable man, if an issue\nbe joined by these twenty-four commissioners, on the one\npart, and any other seven men, on the other part, and the\nwhole depend upon the honor and integrity of the\ncontending parties, to which party would the greatest\ndegree of credit be due? Again: Another consideration is,\nthat we have no right to make the examination. What I shall\n say upon this head I design exclusively for the law-loving\nand law-abiding part of the House. To those who claim\nomnipotence for the Legislature, and who in the plenitude\nof their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the\nConstitution, law, good faith, moral right, and everything\nelse, I have not a word to say. But to the law-abiding part I\nsay, examine the Bank charter, go examine the Constitution,\ngo examine the acts that the General Assembly of this State\nhas passed, and you will \ufb01nd just as much authority given\nin each and every of them to compel the Bank to bring its\nco\ufb00ers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this\n\ufb02oor, as to compel it to submit to this examination which\nthis resolution proposes. Why, Sir, the gentleman from\nColes, the mover of this resolution, very lately denied on\nthis \ufb02oor that the Legislature had any right to repeal or\notherwise meddle with its own acts, when those acts were\nmade in the nature of contracts, and had been accepted\nand acted on by other parties. Now I ask if this resolution\ndoes not propose, for this House alone, to do what he, but\nthe other day, denied the right of the whole Legislature to\ndo? He must either abandon the position he then took, or\nhe must now vote against his own resolution. It is no\ndi\ufb00erence to me, and I presume but little to any one else,\nwhich he does.\nI am by no means the special advocate of the Bank. I\nhave long thought that it would be well for it to report its\ncondition to the General Assembly, and that cases might\noccur, when it might be proper to make an examination of\nits a\ufb00airs by a committee. Accordingly, during the last\n session, while a bill supplemental to the Bank charter was\npending before the House, I o\ufb00ered an amendment to the\nsame, in these words: \u201cThe said corporation shall, at the\nnext session of the General Assembly, and at each\nsubsequent General Session, during the existence of its\ncharter, report to the same the amount of debts due from\nsaid corporation; the amount of debts due to the same; the\namount of specie in its vaults, and an account of all lands\nthen owned by the same, and the amount for which such\nlands have been taken; and moreover, if said corporation\nshall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books,\npapers, and all and everything necessary for a full and fair\nexamination of its a\ufb00airs, to any person or persons\nappointed by the General Assembly, for the purpose of\nmaking such examination, the said corporation shall forfeit\nits charter.\u201d\nThis amendment was negatived by a vote of  to .\nEleven of the  who voted against it are now members of\nthis House; and though it would be out of order to call their\nnames, I hope they will all recollect themselves, and not\nvote for this examination to be made without authority,\ninasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it\nwas in their power to do so.\nI have said that cases might occur, when an examination\nmight be proper; but I do not believe any such case has\nnow occurred; and if it has, I should still be opposed to\nmaking an examination without legal authority. I am\nopposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic spirit,\nwhether in relation to the Bank or anything else, which is\n already abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and\nfearful impetuosity, to the ultimate overthrow of every\ninstitution, of every moral principle, in which persons and\nproperty have hitherto found security.\nBut supposing we had the authority, I would ask what\ngood can result from the examination? Can we declare the\nBank unconstitutional, and compel it to desist from the\nabuses of its power, provided we \ufb01nd such abuses to exist?\nCan we repair the injuries which it may have done to\nindividuals? Most certainly we can do none of these things.\nWhy then shall we spend the public money in such\nemployment? Oh, say the examiners, we can injure the\ncredit of the Bank, if nothing else, Please tell me,\ngentlemen, who will su\ufb00er most by that? You cannot injure,\nto any extent, the stockholders. They are men of wealth \u2014\nof large capital; and consequently, beyond the power of\nmalice. But by injuring the credit of the Bank, you will\ndepreciate the value of its paper in the hands of the honest\nand unsuspecting farmer and mechanic, and that is all you\ncan do. But suppose you could e\ufb00ect your whole purpose;\nsuppose you could wipe the Bank from existence, which is\nthe grand ultimatum of the project, what would be the\nconsequence? why, Sir, we should spend several thousand\ndollars of the public treasure in the operation, annihilate\nthe currency of the State, render valueless in the hands of\nour people that reward of their former labors, and \ufb01nally be\nonce more under the comfortable obligation of paying the\nWiggins loan, principal and interest.\n   \n I I\n  \n \n   \n \nADDRESS BEFORE THE YOUNG MEN\u2019S LYCEUM OF\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.\nJANUARY , .\nAs a subject for the remarks of the evening, \u201cThe\nPerpetuation of our Political Institutions\u201d is selected.\nIn the great journal of things happening under the sun,\nwe, the American people, \ufb01nd our account running under\ndate of the nineteenth century of the Christian era. We \ufb01nd\nourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion\nof the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil,\nand salubrity of climate. We \ufb01nd ourselves under the\ngovernment of a system of political institutions conducing\nmore essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty\nthan any of which the history of former times tells us. We,\nwhen mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the\nlegal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled\nnot in the acquirement or establishment of them; they are a\nlegacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic,\nbut now lamented and departed, race of ancestors. Theirs\nwas the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess\nthemselves, and through themselves us, of this goodly land,\nand to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edi\ufb01ce\nof liberty and equal rights; it is ours only to transmit these\n \u2014 the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the\nlatter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by\nusurpation \u2014 to the latest generation that fate shall permit\nthe world to know. This task gratitude to our fathers,\njustice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and love for our\nspecies in general, all imperatively require us faithfully to\nperform.\nHow then shall we perform it? At what point shall we\nexpect the approach of danger? By what means shall we\nfortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic\nmilitary giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?\nNever! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined,\nwith all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in\ntheir military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander,\ncould not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a\ntrack on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years.\nAt what point then is the approach of danger to be\nexpected? I answer: If it ever reach us it must spring up\namongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be\nour lot we must ourselves be its author and \ufb01nisher. As a\nnation of freemen we must live through all time, or die by\nsuicide.\nI hope I am over-wary; but if I am not, there is even now\nsomething of ill omen amongst us. I mean the increasing\ndisregard for law which pervades the country \u2014 the\ngrowing disposition to substitute the wild and furious\npassions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the\nworse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of\njustice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any community;\n and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our\nfeelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth and an\ninsult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts of outrages\ncommitted by mobs form the everyday news of the times.\nThey have pervaded the country from New England to\nLouisiana; they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of\nthe former nor the burning suns of the latter; they are not\nthe creature of climate, neither are they con\ufb01ned to the\nslave holding or the non-slave holding States. Alike they\nspring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern\nslaves, and the order-loving citizens of the land of steady\nhabits. Whatever then their cause may be, it is common to\nthe whole country.\nIt would be tedious as well as useless to recount the\nhorrors of all of them. Those happening in the State of\nMississippi and at St. Louis are perhaps the most\ndangerous in example and revolting to humanity. In the\nMississippi case they \ufb01rst commenced by hanging the\nregular gamblers \u2014 a set of men certainly not following for\na livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation, but\none which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was\nactually licensed by an act of the Legislature passed but a\nsingle year before. Next, negroes suspected of conspiring\nto raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all\nparts of the State; then, white men supposed to be leagued\nwith the negroes; and \ufb01nally, strangers from neighboring\nStates, going thither on business, were in many instances\nsubjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of\nhanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white\n citizens, and from these to strangers, till dead men were\nseen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every\nroadside, and in numbers almost su\ufb00icient to rival the\nnative Spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the\nforest.\nTurn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A\nsingle victim only was sacri\ufb01ced there. This story is very\nshort, and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of\nits length that has ever been witnessed in real life. A\nmulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized in the\nstreet, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree,\nand actually burned to death; and all within a single hour\nfrom the time he had been a freeman attending to his own\nbusiness and at peace with the world.\nSuch are the e\ufb00ects of mob law, and such are the scenes\nbecoming more and more frequent in this land so lately\nfamed for love of law and order, and the stories of which\nhave even now grown too familiar to attract anything more\nthan an idle remark.\nBut you are perhaps ready to ask, \u201cWhat has this to do\nwith the perpetuation of our political institutions?\u201d I\nanswer, It has much to do with it. Its direct consequences\nare, comparatively speaking, but a small evil, and much of\nits danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard\nits direct as its only consequences. Abstractly considered,\nthe hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little\nconsequence. They constitute a portion of population that is\nworse than useless in any community; and their death, if no\npernicious example be set by it, is never matter of\n reasonable regret with any one. If they were annually\nswept from the stage of existence by the plague or\nsmallpox, honest men would perhaps be much pro\ufb01ted by\nthe operation. Similar too is the correct reasoning in regard\nto the burning of the negro at St. Louis. He had forfeited\nhis life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon\none of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city,\nand had he not died as he did, he must have died by the\nsentence of the law in a very short time afterwards. As to\nhim alone, it was as well the way it was as it could\notherwise have been. But the example in either case was\nfearful. When men take it in their heads to-day to hang\ngamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in\nthe confusion usually attending such transactions they will\nbe as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a\ngambler nor a murderer as one who is, and that, acting\nupon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow may, and\nprobably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same\nmistake. And not only so: the innocent, those who have ever\nset their faces against violations of law in every shape,\nalike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law;\nand thus it goes on, step by step, till all the walls erected\nfor the defense of the persons and property of individuals\nare trodden down and disregarded. But all this, even, is not\nthe full extent of the evil. By such examples, by instances of\nthe perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless\nin spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice; and\nhaving been used to no restraint but dread of punishment,\nthey thus become absolutely unrestrained. Having ever\n regarded government as their deadliest bane, they make a\njubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for\nnothing so much as its total annihilation. While, on the\nother hand, good men, men who love tranquillity, who\ndesire to abide by the laws and enjoy their bene\ufb01ts, who\nwould gladly spill their blood in the defense of their\ncountry, seeing their property destroyed, their families\ninsulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured,\nand seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for\nthe better, become tired of and disgusted with a\ngovernment that o\ufb00ers them no protection, and are not\nmuch averse to a change in which they imagine they have\nnothing to lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this\nmobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the\nland, the strongest bulwark of any government, and\nparticularly of those constituted like ours, may e\ufb00ectually\nbe broken down and destroyed \u2014 I mean the attachment of\nthe people. Whenever this e\ufb00ect shall be produced among\nus; whenever the vicious portion of population shall be\npermitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands,\nand burn churches, ravage and rob provision-stores, throw\nprinting presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and\nburn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity,\ndepend on it, this government cannot last. By such things\nthe feelings of the best citizens will become more or less\nalienated from it, and thus it will be left without friends, or\nwith too few, and those few too weak to make their\nfriendship e\ufb00ectual. At such a time, and under such\ncircumstances, men of su\ufb00icient talent and ambition will\n not be wanting to seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and\noverturn that fair fabric which for the last half century has\nbeen the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout\nthe world.\nI know the American people are much attached to their\ngovernment; I know they would su\ufb00er much for its sake; I\nknow they would endure evils long and patiently before\nthey would ever think of exchanging it for another, \u2014 yet,\nnotwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually despised\nand disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their\npersons and property are held by no better tenure than the\ncaprice of a mob, the alienation of their a\ufb00ections from the\ngovernment is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner\nor later, it must come.\nHere, then, is one point at which danger may be\nexpected.\nThe question recurs, How shall we fortify against it? The\nanswer is simple. Let every American, every lover of liberty,\nevery well-wisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the\nRevolution never to violate in the least particular the laws\nof the country, and never to tolerate their violation by\nothers. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of\nthe Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the\nConstitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his\nproperty, and his sacred honor. Let every man remember\nthat to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his\nfather, and to tear the charter of his own and his children\u2019s\nliberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every\nAmerican mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her\n lap; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in\ncolleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in\nalmanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in\nlegislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in\nshort, let it become the political religion of the nation; and\nlet the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave\nand the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and\nconditions, sacri\ufb01ce unceasingly upon its altars.\nWhile ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally\nor even very generally prevail throughout the nation, vain\nwill be every e\ufb00ort, and fruitless every attempt, to subvert\nour national freedom.\nWhen, I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the\nlaws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad\nlaws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of\nwhich no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no\nsuch thing. But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if\nthey exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still,\nwhile they continue in force, for the sake of example they\nshould be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases.\nIf such arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them\nwith the least possible delay, but till then let them, if not\ntoo intolerable, be borne with.\nThere is no grievance that is a \ufb01t object of redress by\nmob law. In any case that may arise, as, for instance, the\npromulgation of abolitionism, one of two positions is\nnecessarily true \u2014 that is, the thing is right within itself,\nand therefore deserves the protection of all law and all\ngood citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be\n prohibited by legal enactments; and in neither case is the\ninterposition of mob law either necessary, justi\ufb01able, or\nexcusable.\nBut it may be asked, Why suppose danger to our political\ninstitutions? Have we not preserved them for more than\n\ufb01fty years? And why may we not for \ufb01fty times as long?\nWe hope there is no su\ufb00icient reason. We hope all danger\nmay be overcome; but to conclude that no danger may ever\narise would itself be extremely dangerous. There are now,\nand will hereafter be, many causes, dangerous in their\ntendency, which have not existed heretofore, and which are\nnot \ntoo \ninsigni\ufb01cant \nto \nmerit \nattention. \nThat \nour\ngovernment should have been maintained in its original\nform, from its establishment until now, is not much to be\nwondered at. It had many props to support it through that\nperiod, which now are decayed and crumbled away.\nThrough that period it was felt by all to be an undecided\nexperiment; now it is understood to be a successful one.\nThen, all that sought celebrity and fame and distinction\nexpected to \ufb01nd them in the success of that experiment.\nTheir all was staked upon it; their destiny was inseparably\nlinked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an\nadmiring world a practical demonstration of the truth of a\nproposition which had hitherto been considered at best no\nbetter than problematical \u2014 namely, the capability of a\npeople to govern themselves. If they succeeded they were\nto be immortalized; their names were to be transferred to\ncounties, and cities, and rivers, and mountains; and to be\nrevered and sung, toasted through all time. If they failed,\n they were to be called knaves and fools, and fanatics for a\n\ufb02eeting hour; then to sink and be forgotten. They\nsucceeded. The experiment is successful, and thousands\nhave won their deathless names in making it so. But the\ngame is caught; and I believe it is true that with the\ncatching end the pleasures of the chase. This \ufb01eld of glory\nis harvested, and the crop is already appropriated. But new\nreapers will arise, and they too will seek a \ufb01eld. It is to\ndeny what the history of the world tells us is true, to\nsuppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue\nto spring up amongst us. And when they do, they will as\nnaturally seek the grati\ufb01cation of their ruling passion as\nothers have done before them. The question then is, Can\nthat grati\ufb01cation be found in supporting and in maintaining\nan edi\ufb01ce that has been erected by others? Most certainly\nit cannot. Many great and good men, su\ufb00iciently quali\ufb01ed\nfor any task they should undertake, may ever be found\nwhose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in\nCongress, a Gubernatorial or a Presidential chair; but such\nbelong not to the family of the lion, or the tribe of the\neagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an\nAlexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering\ngenius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto\nunexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to story\nupon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of\nothers. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any\nchief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor,\nhowever illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and\nif possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of\n emancipating \nslaves \nor \nenslaving \nfreemen. \nIs \nit\nunreasonable, then, to expect that some man possessed of\nthe loftiest genius, coupled with ambition su\ufb00icient to push\nit to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among\nus? And when such an one does it will require the people to\nbe united with each other, attached to the government and\nlaws, and generally intelligent, to successfully frustrate his\ndesigns.\nDistinction will be his paramount object, and although he\nwould as willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing\ngood as harm, yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing\nleft to be done in the way of building up, he would set\nboldly to the task of pulling down.\nHere then is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such\nan one as could not have well existed heretofore.\nAnother reason which once was, but which, to the same\nextent, is now no more, has done much in maintaining our\ninstitutions thus far. I mean the powerful in\ufb02uence which\nthe interesting scenes of the Revolution had upon the\npassions of the people as distinguished from their\njudgment. By this in\ufb02uence, the jealousy, envy, and avarice\nincident to our nature, and so common to a state of peace,\nprosperity, and conscious strength, were for the time in a\ngreat measure smothered and rendered inactive, while the\ndeep-rooted principles of hate, and the powerful motive of\nrevenge, instead of being turned against each other, were\ndirected exclusively against the British nation. And thus,\nfrom the force of circumstances, the basest principles of\nour nature were either made to lie dormant, or to become\n the active agents in the advancement of the noblest of\ncauses \u2014 that of establishing and maintaining civil and\nreligious liberty.\nBut this state of feeling must fade, is fading, has faded,\nwith the circumstances that produced it.\nI do not mean to say that the scenes of the Revolution are\nnow or ever will be entirely forgotten, but that, like\neverything else, they must fade upon the memory of the\nworld, and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time.\nIn history, we hope, they will be read of, and recounted, so\nlong as the Bible shall be read; but even granting that they\nwill, their in\ufb02uence cannot be what it heretofore has been.\nEven then they cannot be so universally known nor so\nvividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest.\nAt the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had\nbeen a participator in some of its scenes. The consequence\nwas that of those scenes, in the form of a husband, a father,\na son, or a brother, a living history was to be found in every\nfamily \u2014 a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its\nown authenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of\nwounds received, in the midst of the very scenes related \u2014\na history, too, that could be read and understood alike by\nall, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and the\nunlearned. But those histories are gone. They can be read\nno more forever. They were a fortress of strength; but what\ninvading foeman could never do the silent artillery of time\nhas done \u2014 the leveling of its walls. They are gone. They\nwere a forest of giant oaks; but the all-restless hurricane\nhas swept over them, and left only here and there a lonely\n trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its foliage,\nunshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle\nbreezes, and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more\nruder storms, then to sink and be no more.\nThey were pillars of the temple of liberty; and now that\nthey have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we,\ntheir descendants, supply their places with other pillars,\nhewn from the solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has\nhelped us, but can do so no more. It will in future be our\nenemy. Reason cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason \u2014\nmust furnish all the materials for our future support and\ndefense. Let those materials be moulded into general\nintelligence, sound morality, and in particular, a reverence\nfor the Constitution and laws; and that we improved to the\nlast, that we remained free to the last, that we revered his\nname to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no\nhostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place,\nshall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our\nWashington.\nUpon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the\nrock of its basis; and as truly as has been said of the only\ngreater institution, \u201cthe gates of hell shall not prevail\nagainst it.\u201d\n   \n     I\n  H  I  I\nI    \nI  A \n   \n  H\n \n      \n    A    .\nMarch , .\nTHE FOLLOWING PROTEST was presented to the House,\nwhich was read and ordered to be spread in the journals, to\nwit:\n\u201cResolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having\npassed both branches of the General Assembly at its\npresent session, the undersigned hereby protest against\nthe passage of the same.\n\u201cThey believe that the institution of slavery is founded on\nboth injustice and bad policy, but that the promulgation of\nabolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its\nevils.\n\u201cThey believe that the Congress of the United States has\nno power under the Constitution to interfere with the\ninstitution of slavery in the di\ufb00erent States.\n\u201cThey believe that the Congress of the United States has\nthe power, under the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the\nDistrict of Columbia, but that the power ought not to be\nexercised, unless at the request of the people of the\nDistrict.\n\u201cThe di\ufb00erence between these opinions and those\ncontained in the said resolutions is their reason for\n entering this protest.\n\u201cDAN STONE, \u201cA.

OWENS.\nFRIEND MARY: \u2014 I have commenced two letters to send\nyou before this, both of which displeased me before I got\nhalf done, and so I tore them up. The \ufb01rst I thought was not\nserious enough, and the second was on the other extreme. I\nshall send this, turn out as it may.\nThis thing of living in Spring\ufb01eld is rather a dull\nbusiness, after all; at least it is so to me. I am quite as\nlonesome here as I ever was anywhere in my life. I have\nbeen spoken to by but one woman since I have been here,\nand should not have been by her if she could have avoided\nit. I \u2018ve never been to church yet, and probably shall not be\nsoon. I stay away because I am conscious I should not know\nhow to behave myself.\nI am often thinking of what we said about your coming to\nlive at Spring\ufb01eld. I am afraid you would not be satis\ufb01ed.\nThere is a great deal of \ufb02ourishing about in carriages here,\nwhich it would be your doom to see without sharing it. You\nwould have to be poor, without the means of hiding your\npoverty. Do you believe you could bear that patiently?\nWhatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should any\never do so, it is my intention to do all in my power to make\n her happy and contented; and there is nothing I can\nimagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in\nthe e\ufb00ort. I know I should be much happier with you than\nthe way I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you.\nWhat you have said to me may have been in the way of jest,\nor I may have misunderstood you. If so, then let it be\nforgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you would think\nseriously before you decide. What I have said I will most\npositively abide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is that\nyou had better not do it. You have not been accustomed to\nhardship, and it may be more severe than you now imagine.\nI know you are capable of thinking correctly on any subject,\nand if you deliberate maturely upon this subject before you\ndecide, then I am willing to abide your decision.\nYou must write me a good long letter after you get this.\nYou have nothing else to do, and though it might not seem\ninteresting to you after you had written it, it would be a\ngood deal of company to me in this \u201cbusy wilderness.\u201d Tell\nyour sister I don\u2019t want to hear any more about selling out\nand moving.

EDWARDS tells me you wish to know\nwhether the act to which your own incorporation provision\nwas attached passed into a law. It did. You can organize\nunder the general incorporation law as soon as you choose.\nI also tacked a provision onto a fellow\u2019s bill to authorize\nthe relocation of the road from Salem down to your town,\nbut I am not certain whether or not the bill passed, neither\ndo I suppose I can ascertain before the law will be\npublished, if it is a law. Bowling Greene, Bennette Abe? and\nyourself are appointed to make the change. No news. No\nexcitement except a little about the election of Monday\nnext.\nI suppose, of course, our friend Dr. Heney stands no\nchance in your diggings.\nYour friend and humble servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \nA   \n \n .\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. , \nFRIEND MARY: YOU will no doubt think it rather strange\nthat I should write you a letter on the same day on which\nwe parted, and I can only account for it by supposing that\nseeing you lately makes me think of you more than usual;\nwhile at our late meeting we had but few expressions of\nthoughts. You must know that I cannot see you, or think of\nyou, with entire indi\ufb00erence; and yet it may be that you are\nmistaken in regard to what my real feelings toward you are.\nIf I knew you were not, I should not have troubled you\nwith this letter. Perhaps any other man would know enough\nwithout information; but I consider it my peculiar right to\nplead ignorance, and your bounden duty to allow the plea.\nI want in all cases to do right; and most particularly so in\nall cases with women.\nI want, at this particular time, more than any thing else\nto do right with you; and if I knew it would be doing right,\nas I rather suspect it would, to let you alone I would do it.\nAnd, for the purpose of making the matter as plain as\npossible, I now say that you can drop the subject, dismiss\nyour thoughts (if you ever had any) from me for ever and\nleave this letter unanswered without calling forth one\naccusing murmur from me. And I will even go further and\n say that, if it will add anything to your comfort or peace of\nmind to do so, it is my sincere wish that you should. Do not\nunderstand by this that I wish to cut your acquaintance. I\nmean no such thing. What I do wish is that our further\nacquaintance shall depend upon yourself. If such further\nacquaintance would contribute nothing to your happiness, I\nam sure it would not to mine. If you feel yourself in any\ndegree bound to me, I am now willing to release you,\nprovided you wish it; while on the other hand I am willing\nand even anxious to bind you faster if I can be convinced\nthat it will, in any considerable degree, add to your\nhappiness. This, indeed, is the whole question with me.\nNothing would make me more miserable than to believe\nyou miserable, nothing more happy than to know you were\nso.\nIn what I have now said, I think I cannot be\nmisunderstood; and to make myself understood is the only\nobject of this letter.\nIf it suits you best not to answer this, farewell. A long life\nand a merry one attend you. But, if you conclude to write\nback, speak as plainly as I do. There can neither be harm\nnor danger in saying to me anything you think, just in the\nmanner you think it. My respects to your sister.\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\n   \nA   \nI  \n  \nI\n  .s. \nen. A\nA\nTO THE PEOPLE.\n\u201cSANGAMON JOURNAL,\u201d SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug.\n, .\nIn accordance with our determination, as expressed last\nweek, we present to the reader the articles which were\npublished in hand-bill form, in reference to the case of the\nheirs of Joseph Anderson vs. James Adams. These articles\ncan now be read unin\ufb02uenced by personal or party feeling,\nand with the sole motive of learning the truth. When that is\ndone, the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters\nat issue.\nWe only regret in this case, that the publications were\nnot made some weeks before the election. Such a course\nmight have prevented the expressions of regret, which have\noften been heard since, from di\ufb00erent individuals, on\naccount of the disposition they made of their votes.\nTo the Public:\nIt is well known to most of you, that there is existing at\nthis time considerable excitement in regard to Gen.\nAdams\u2019s titles to certain tracts of land, and the manner in\nwhich he acquired them. As I understand, the Gen. charges\nthat the whole has been gotten up by a knot of lawyers to\ninjure his election; and as I am one of the knot to which he\n refers, and as I happen to be in possession of facts\nconnected with the matter, I will, in as brief a manner as\npossible, make a statement of them, together with the\nmeans by which I arrived at the knowledge of them.\nSometime in May or June last, a widow woman, by the\nname of Anderson, and her son, who resides in Fulton\ncounty, came to Spring\ufb01eld, for the purpose as they said of\nselling a ten acre lot of ground lying near town, which they\nclaimed as the property of the deceased husband and\nfather.\nWhen they reached town they found the land was\nclaimed by Gen. Adams. John T. Stuart and myself were\nemployed to look into the matter, and if it was thought we\ncould do so with any prospect of success, to commence a\nsuit for the land. I went immediately to the recorder\u2019s o\ufb00ice\nto examine Adams\u2019s title, and found that the land had been\nentered by one Dixon, deeded by Dixon to Thomas, by\nThomas to one Miller, and by Miller to Gen. Adams. The\noldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven years\nold, and the latest more than \ufb01ve, all recorded at the same\ntime, and that within less than one year. This I thought a\nsuspicious circumstance, and I was thereby induced to\nexamine the deeds very closely, with a view to the discovery\nof some defect by which to overturn the title, being almost\nconvinced then it was founded in fraud. I discovered that in\nthe deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller\u2019s name\nstood in a sort of marginal note on the record book, it was\nnowhere in the deed itself. I told the fact to Talbott, the\nrecorder, and proposed to him that he should go to Gen.\n Adams\u2019s and get the original deed, and compare it with the\nrecord, and thereby ascertain whether the defect was in\nthe original or there was merely an error in the recording.\nAs Talbott afterwards told me, he went to the General\u2019s, but\nnot \ufb01nding him at home, got the deed from his son, which,\nwhen compared with the record, proved what we had\ndiscovered was merely an error of the recorder. After Mr.\nTalbott corrected the record, he brought the original to our\no\ufb00ice, as I then thought and think yet, to show us that it\nwas right. When he came into the room he handed the deed\nto me, remarking that the fault was all his own. On opening\nit, another paper fell out of it, which on examination proved\nto be an assignment of a judgment in the Circuit Court of\nSangamon County from Joseph Anderson, the late husband\nof the widow above named, to James Adams, the judgment\nbeing in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller.\nKnowing that this judgment had some connection with the\nland a\ufb00air, I immediately took a copy of it, which is word\nfor word, letter for letter and cross for cross as follows:\nJoseph Anderson, vs. Joseph Miller.\nJudgment in Sangamon Circuit Court against Joseph\nMiller obtained on a note originally  dolls and interest\nthereon accrued. I assign all my right, title and interest to\nJames Adams which is in consideration of a debt I owe said\nAdams.\nhis JOSEPH x ANDERSON. mark.\nAs the copy shows, it bore date May , ; although\nthe judgment assigned by it was not obtained until the\nOctober afterwards, as may be seen by any one on the\n records \nof \nthe \nCircuit \nCourt. \nTwo \nother \nstrange\ncircumstances attended it which cannot be represented by\na copy. One of them was, that the date \u201c\u201d had \ufb01rst\nbeen made \u201c\u201d and, without the \ufb01gure \u201c,\u201d being fully\nobliterated, the \ufb01gure \u201c\u201d had afterwards been made on\ntop of it; the other was that, although the date was ten\nyears old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its\nappearance, was thought by many, and I believe by all who\nsaw it, not to be more than a week old. The paper on which\nit was written had a very old appearance; and there were\nsome old \ufb01gures on the back of it which made the freshness\nof the writing on the face of it much more striking than I\nsuppose it otherwise might have been. The reader\u2019s\ncuriosity is no doubt excited to know what connection this\nassignment had with the land in question. The story is this:\nDixon sold and deeded the land to Thomas; Thomas sold it\nto Anderson; but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it to\nMiller, and took Miller\u2019s note for the purchase money. When\nthis note became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and\nMiller procured an injunction from the Court of Chancery\nto stay the collection of the money until he should get a\ndeed for the land. Gen. Adams was employed as an attorney\nby Anderson in this chancery suit, and at the October term,\n, the injunction was dissolved, and a judgment given in\nfavor of Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that\nThomas was to execute a deed for the land in favor of\nMiller and deliver it to Gen. Adams, to be held up by him\ntill Miller paid the judgment, and then to deliver it to him.\nMiller left the county without paying the judgment.\n Anderson moved to Fulton county, where he has since died\nWhen the widow came to Spring\ufb01eld last May or June, as\nbefore mentioned, and found the land deeded to Gen.\nAdams by Miller, she was naturally led to inquire why the\nmoney due upon the judgment had not been sent to them,\ninasmuch as he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver\nThomas\u2019s deed to Miller until the money was paid. Then it\nwas the General told her, or perhaps her son, who came\nwith her, that Anderson, in his lifetime, had assigned the\njudgment to him, Gen. Adams. I am now told that the\nGeneral is exhibiting an assignment of the same judgment\nbearing date \u201c\u201d and in other respects di\ufb00ering from\nthe one described; and that he is asserting that no such\nassignment as the one copied by me ever existed; or if\nthere did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers,\nand slipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him.\nNow, I can only say that I know precisely such a one did\nexist, and that Ben. Talbott, Wm. Butler, C.R. Matheny, John\nT. Stuart, Judge Logan, Robert Irwin, P. C. Canedy and S. M.\nTinsley, all saw and examined it, and that at least one half\nof them will swear that IT WAS IN GENERAL ADAMS\u2019S\nHANDWRITING!! And further, I know that Talbott will\nswear that he got it out of the General\u2019s possession, and\nreturned it into his possession again. The assignment which\nthe General is now exhibiting purports to have been by\nAnderson in writing. The one I copied was signed with a\ncross.\nI am told that Gen. Neale says that he will swear that he\nheard Gen. Adams tell young Anderson that the assignment\n made by his father was signed with a cross.\nThe above are \u2018facts,\u2019 as stated. I leave them without\ncomment. I have given the names of persons who have\nknowledge of these facts, in order that any one who\nchooses may call on them and ascertain how far they will\ncorroborate my statements. I have only made these\nstatements because I am known by many to be one of the\nindividuals against whom the charge of forging the\nassignment and slipping it into the General\u2019s papers has\nbeen made, and because our silence might be construed\ninto a confession of its truth. I shall not subscribe my name;\nbut I hereby authorize the editor of the Journal to give it up\nto any one that may call for it.\n  I\n \n \n A\n  A  \n   I\n        \n \n \n.\nA\nA\n .\n\u201cSANGAMON JOURNAL,\u201d SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Oct. ,\n.\nIN THE REPUBLICAN of this morning a publication of Gen.\nAdams\u2019s appears, in which my name is used quite\nunreservedly. For this I thank the General. I thank him\nbecause it gives me an opportunity, without appearing\nobtrusive, of explaining a part of a former publication of\nmine, which appears to me to have been misunderstood by\nmany.\nIn the former publication alluded to, I stated, in\nsubstance, that Mr. Talbott got a deed from a son of Gen.\nAdams\u2019s for the purpose of correcting a mistake that had\noccurred on the record of the said deed in the recorder\u2019s\no\ufb00ice; that he corrected the record, and brought the deed\nand handed it to me, and that on opening the deed, another\npaper, being the assignment of a judgment, fell out of it.\nThis statement Gen. Adams and the editor of the\nRepublican have seized upon as a most palpable evidence\nof fabrication and falsehood. They set themselves gravely\nabout proving that the assignment could not have been in\nthe deed when Talbott got it from young Adams, as he,\nTalbott, would have seen it when he opened the deed to\n correct the record. Now, the truth is, Talbott did see the\nassignment when he opened the deed, or at least he told\nme he did on the same day; and I only omitted to say so, in\nmy former publication, because it was a matter of such\npalpable and necessary inference. I had stated that Talbott\nhad corrected the record by the deed; and of course he\nmust have opened it; and, just as the General and his\nfriends argue, must have seen the assignment. I omitted to\nstate the fact of Talbott\u2019s seeing the assignment, because\nits existence was so necessarily connected with other facts\nwhich I did state, that I thought the greatest dunce could\nnot but understand it. Did I say Talbott had not seen it? Did\nI say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it\nbefore? Most certainly I did neither; and if I did not, what\nbecomes of the argument? These logical gentlemen can\nsustain their argument only by assuming that I did say\nnegatively everything that I did not say a\ufb00irmatively; and\nupon the same assumption, we may expect to \ufb01nd the\nGeneral, if a little harder pressed for argument, saying that\nI said Talbott came to our o\ufb00ice with his head downward,\nnot that I actually said so, but because I omitted to say he\ncame feet downward.\nIn his publication to-day, the General produces the\na\ufb00idavit of Reuben Radford, in which it is said that Talbott\ntold Radford that he did not \ufb01nd the assignment in the\ndeed, in the recording of which the error was committed,\nbut that he found it wrapped in another paper in the\nrecorder\u2019s \no\ufb00ice, \nupon \nwhich \nstatement \nthe \nGenl.\ncomments as follows, to wit: \u201cIf it be true as stated by\n Talbott to Radford, that he found the assignment wrapped\nup in another paper at his o\ufb00ice, that contradicts the\nstatement of Lincoln that it fell out of the deed.\u201d\nIs common sense to be abused with such sophistry? Did I\nsay what Talbott found it in? If Talbott did \ufb01nd it in another\npaper at his o\ufb00ice, is that any reason why he could not have\nfolded it in a deed and brought it to my o\ufb00ice? Can any one\nbe so far duped as to be made believe that what may have\nhappened at Talbot\u2019s o\ufb00ice at one time is inconsistent with\nwhat happened at my o\ufb00ice at another time?\nNow Talbott\u2019s statement of the case as he makes it to me\nis this, that he got a bunch of deeds from young Adams, and\nthat he knows he found the assignment in the bunch, but he\nis not certain which particular deed it was in, nor is he\ncertain whether it was folded in the same deed out of which\nit was taken, or another one, when it was brought to my\no\ufb00ice. Is this a mysterious story? Is there anything\nsuspicious about it?\n\u201cBut it is useless to dwell longer on this point. Any man\nwho is not wilfully blind can see at a \ufb02ash, that there is no\ndiscrepancy, and Lincoln has shown that they are not only\ninconsistent with truth, but each other\u201d \u2014 I can only say,\nthat I have shown that he has done no such thing; and if the\nreader is disposed to require any other evidence than the\nGeneral\u2019s assertion, he will be of my opinion.\nExcepting \nthe \nGeneral\u2019s \nmost \n\ufb02imsy \nattempt \nat\nmysti\ufb01cation, in regard to a discrepance between Talbott\nand myself, he has not denied a single statement that I\nmade in my hand-bill. Every material statement that I made\n has been sworn to by men who, in former times, were\nthought as respectable as General Adams. I stated that an\nassignment of a judgment, a copy of which I gave, had\nexisted \u2014 Benj. Talbott, C. R. Matheny, Wm. Butler, and\nJudge Logan swore to its existence. I stated that it was said\nto be in Gen. Adams\u2019s handwriting \u2014 the same men swore\nit was in his handwriting. I stated that Talbott would swear\nthat he got it out of Gen. Adams\u2019s possession \u2014 Talbott\ncame forward and did swear it.\nBidding adieu to the former publication, I now propose to\nexamine the General\u2019s last gigantic production. I now\npropose to point out some discrepancies in the General\u2019s\naddress; and such, too, as he shall not be able to escape\nfrom. Speaking of the famous assignment, the General\nsays: \u201cThis last charge, which was their last resort, their\ndying e\ufb00ort to render my character infamous among my\nfellow citizens, was manufactured at a certain lawyer\u2019s\no\ufb00ice in the town, printed at the o\ufb00ice of the Sangamon\nJournal, and found its way into the world some time\nbetween two days just before the last election.\u201d Now turn\nto Mr. Keys\u2019 a\ufb00idavit, in which you will \ufb01nd the following,\nviz.: \u201cI certify that some time in May or the early part of\nJune, , I saw at Williams\u2019s corner a paper purporting\nto be an assignment from Joseph Anderson to James\nAdams, which assignment was signed by a mark to\nAnderson\u2019s name,\u201d etc. Now mark, if Keys saw the\nassignment on the last of May or \ufb01rst of June, Gen. Adams\ntells a falsehood when he says it was manufactured just\nbefore the election, which was on the th of August; and if\n it was manufactured just before the election, Keys tells a\nfalsehood when he says he saw it on the last of May or \ufb01rst\nof June. Either Keys or the General is irretrievably in for it;\nand in the General\u2019s very condescending language, I say\n\u201cLet them settle it between them.\u201d\nNow again, let the reader, bearing in mind that General\nAdams has unequivocally said, in one part of his address,\nthat the charge in relation to the assignment was\nmanufactured just before the election, turn to the a\ufb00idavit\nof Peter S. Weber, where the following will be found viz.: \u201cI,\nPeter S. Weber, do certify that from the best of my\nrecollection, on the day or day after Gen. Adams started for\nthe Illinois Rapids, in May last, that I was at the house of\nGen. Adams, sitting in the kitchen, situated on the back\npart of the house, it being in the afternoon, and that\nBenjamin Talbott came around the house, back into the\nkitchen, and appeared wild and confused, and that he laid a\npackage of papers on the kitchen table and requested that\nthey should be handed to Lucian. He made no apology for\ncoming to the kitchen, nor for not handing them to Lucian\nhimself, but showed the token of being frightened and\nconfused both in demeanor and speech and for what cause\nI could not apprehend.\u201d\nCommenting on Weber\u2019s a\ufb00idavit, Gen. Adams asks,\n\u201cWhy this fright and confusion?\u201d I reply that this is a\nquestion for the General himself. Weber says that it was in\nMay, and if so, it is most clear that Talbott was not\nfrightened on account of the assignment, unless the\nGeneral lies when he says the assignment charge was\n manufactured just before the election. Is it not a strong\nevidence, that the General is not traveling with the pole-\nstar of truth in his front, to see him in one part of his\naddress roundly asserting that the assignment was\nmanufactured just before the election, and then, forgetting\nthat position, procuring Weber\u2019s most foolish a\ufb00idavit, to\nprove that Talbott had been engaged in manufacturing it\ntwo months before?\nIn another part of his address, Gen. Adams says: \u201cThat I\nhold an assignment of said judgment, dated the th of\nMay, , and signed by said Anderson, I have never\npretended to deny or conceal, but stated that fact in one of\nmy circulars previous to the election, and also in answer to\na bill in chancery.\u201d Now I pronounce this statement\nunquali\ufb01edly false, and shall not rely on the word or oath of\nany man to sustain me in what I say; but will let the whole\nbe decided by reference to the circular and answer in\nchancery of which the General speaks. In his circular he did\nspeak of an assignment; but he did not say it bore date th\nof May, ; nor did he say it bore any date. In his answer\nin chancery, he did say that he had an assignment; but he\ndid not say that it bore date the th May, ; but so far\nfrom it, he said on oath (for he swore to the answer) that as\nwell as recollected, he obtained it in . If any one\ndoubts, let him examine the circular and answer for\nhimself. They are both accessible.\nIt will readily be observed that the principal part of\nAdams\u2019s defense rests upon the argument that if he had\nbeen base enough to forge an assignment he would not\n have been fool enough to forge one that would not cover\nthe case. This argument he used in his circular before the\nelection. The Republican has used it at least once, since\nthen; and Adams uses it again in his publication of to-day.\nNow I pledge myself to show that he is just such a fool that\nhe and his friends have contended it was impossible for him\nto be. Recollect \u2014 he says he has a genuine assignment;\nand that he got Joseph Klein\u2019s a\ufb00idavit, stating that he had\nseen it, and that he believed the signature to have been\nexecuted by the same hand that signed Anderson\u2019s name to\nthe answer in chancery. Luckily Klein took a copy of this\ngenuine assignment, which I have been permitted to see;\nand hence I know it does not cover the case. In the \ufb01rst\nplace it is headed \u201cJoseph Anderson vs. Joseph Miller,\u201d and\nheads o\ufb00 \u201cJudgment in Sangamon Circuit Court.\u201d Now,\nmark, there never was a case in Sangamon Circuit Court\nentitled Joseph Anderson vs. Joseph Miller. The case\nmentioned in my former publication, and the only one\nbetween these parties that ever existed in the Circuit\nCourt, was entitled Joseph Miller vs. Joseph Anderson,\nMiller being the plainti\ufb00. What then becomes of all their\nsophistry about Adams not being fool enough to forge an\nassignment that would not cover the case? It is certain that\nthe present one does not cover the case; and if he got it\nhonestly, it is still clear that he was fool enough to pay for\nan assignment that does not cover the case.\nThe General asks for the proof of disinterested witnesses.\nWhom does he consider disinterested? None can be more\nso than those who have already testi\ufb01ed against him. No\n one of them had the least interest on earth, so far as I can\nlearn, to injure him. True, he says they had conspired\nagainst him; but if the testimony of an angel from Heaven\nwere introduced against him, he would make the same\ncharge of conspiracy. And now I put the question to every\nre\ufb02ecting man, Do you believe that Benjamin Talbott, Chas.\nR. Matheny, William Butler and Stephen T. Logan, all\nsustaining high and spotless characters, and justly proud of\nthem, would deliberately perjure themselves, without any\nmotive whatever, except to injure a man\u2019s election; and\nthat, too, a man who had been a candidate, time out of\nmind, and yet who had never been elected to any o\ufb00ice?\nAdams\u2019s \nassurance, \nin \ndemanding \ndisinterested\ntestimony, is surpassing. He brings in the a\ufb00idavit of his\nown son, and even of Peter S. Weber, with whom I am not\nacquainted, but who, I suppose, is some black or mulatto\nboy, from his being kept in the kitchen, to prove his points;\nbut when such a man as Talbott, a man who, but two years\nago, ran against Gen. Adams for the o\ufb00ice of Recorder and\nbeat him more than four votes to one, is introduced against\nhim, he asks the community, with all the consequence of a\nlord, to reject his testimony.\nI \nmight \neasily \nwrite \na \nvolume, \npointing \nout\ninconsistencies between the statements in Adams\u2019s last\naddress with one another, and with other known facts; but I\nam aware the reader must already be tired with the length\nof this article. His opening statements, that he was \ufb01rst\naccused of being a Tory, and that he refuted that; that then\nthe Sampson\u2019s ghost story was got up, and he refuted that;\n that as a last resort, a dying e\ufb00ort, the assignment charge\nwas got up is all as false as hell, as all this community must\nknow. Sampson\u2019s ghost \ufb01rst made its appearance in print,\nand that, too, after Keys swears he saw the assignment, as\nany one may see by reference to the \ufb01les of papers; and\nGen. Adams himself, in reply to the Sampson\u2019s ghost story,\nwas the \ufb01rst man that raised the cry of toryism, and it was\nonly by way of set-o\ufb00, and never in seriousness, that it was\nbandied back at him. His e\ufb00ort is to make the impression\nthat his enemies \ufb01rst made the charge of toryism and he\ndrove them from that, then Sampson\u2019s ghost, he drove\nthem from that, then \ufb01nally the assignment charge was\nmanufactured just before election. Now, the only general\nreply he ever made to the Sampson\u2019s ghost and tory\ncharges he made at one and the same time, and not in\nsuccession as he states; and the date of that reply will\nshow, that it was made at least a month after the date on\nwhich Keys swears he saw the Anderson assignment. But\nenough. In conclusion I will only say that I have a character\nto defend as well as Gen. Adams, but I disdain to whine\nabout it as he does. It is true I have no children nor kitchen\nboys; and if I had, I should scorn to lug them in to make\na\ufb00idavits for me.\nA. LINCOLN, September , .\n  \n. A\nA\n   \n  \n      \n  \n I\n \nTO THE PUBLIC.\n\u201cSANGAMON JOURNAL,\u201d SPRINGFIELD, Ill, Oct.,\n.\nSuch is the turn which things have taken lately, that\nwhen Gen. Adams writes a book, I am expected to write a\ncommentary on it. In the Republican of this morning he has\npresented the world with a new work of six columns in\nlength; in consequence of which I must beg the room of one\ncolumn in the Journal. It is obvious that a minute reply\ncannot be made in one column to everything that can be\nsaid in six; and, consequently, I hope that expectation will\nbe answered if I reply to such parts of the General\u2019s\npublication as are worth replying to.\nIt may not be improper to remind the reader that in his\npublication of Sept. th General Adams said that the\nassignment charge was manufactured just before the\nelection; and that in reply I proved that statement to be\nfalse by Keys, his own witness. Now, without attempting to\nexplain, he furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by\nwhich the same thing is proved, to wit, that the assignment\nwas not manufactured just before the election; but that it\nwas some weeks before. Let it be borne in mind that Adams\nmade this statement \u2014 has himself furnished two witnesses\n to prove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or\nexplain it. Before going farther, let a pin be stuck here,\nlabeled \u201cOne lie proved and confessed.\u201d On the th of\nSeptember he said he had before stated in the hand-bill\nthat he held an assignment dated May th, , which in\nreply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill\nfor the truth of what I said. This week he forgets to make\nany explanation of this. Let another pin be stuck here,\nlabelled as before. I mention these things because, if, when\nI convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted to shift his\nground and pass it by in silence, there can be no end to this\ncontroversy.\nThe \ufb01rst thing that attracts my attention in the General\u2019s\npresent production is the information he is pleased to give\nto \u201cthose who are made to su\ufb00er at his (my) hands.\u201d\nUnder present circumstances, this cannot apply to me,\nfor I am not a widow nor an orphan: nor have I a wife or\nchildren who might by possibility become such. Such,\nhowever, I have no doubt, have been, and will again be\nmade to su\ufb00er at his hands! Hands! Yes, they are the\nmischievous agents. The next thing I shall notice is his\nfavorite expression, \u201cnot of lawyers, doctors and others,\u201d\nwhich he is so fond of applying to all who dare expose his\nrascality. Now, let it be remembered that when he \ufb01rst\ncame to this country he attempted to impose himself upon\nthe community as a lawyer, and actually carried the\nattempt so far as to induce a man who was under a charge\nof murder to entrust the defence of his life in his hands,\nand \ufb01nally took his money and got him hanged. Is this the\n man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing\nlawyers? If he is not himself a lawyer, it is for the lack of\nsense, and not of inclination. If he is not a lawyer, he is a\nliar, for he proclaimed himself a lawyer, and got a man\nhanged by depending on him.\nPassing over such parts of the article as have neither fact\nnor argument in them, I come to the question asked by\nAdams whether any person ever saw the assignment in his\npossession. This is an insult to common sense. Talbott has\nsworn once and repeated time and again, that he got it out\nof Adams\u2019s possession and returned it into the same\npossession. Still, as though he was addressing fools, he has\nassurance to ask if any person ever saw it in his possession.\nNext I quote a sentence, \u201cNow my son Lucian swears\nthat when Talbott called for the deed, that he, Talbott,\nopened it and pointed out the error.\u201d True. His son Lucian\ndid swear as he says; and in doing so, he swore what I will\nprove by his own a\ufb00idavit to be a falsehood. Turn to\nLucian\u2019s a\ufb00idavit, and you will there see that Talbott called\nfor the deed by which to correct an error on the record.\nThus it appears that the error in question was on the\nrecord, and not in the deed. How then could Talbott open\nthe deed and point out the error? Where a thing is not, it\ncannot be pointed out. The error was not in the deed, and\nof course could not be pointed out there. This does not\nmerely prove that the error could not be pointed out, as\nLucian swore it was; but it proves, too, that the deed was\nnot opened in his presence with a special view to the error,\nfor if it had been, he could not have failed to see that there\n was no error in it. It is easy enough to see why Lucian\nswore this. His object was to prove that the assignment was\nnot in the deed when Talbott got it: but it was discovered\nhe could not swear this safely, without \ufb01rst swearing the\ndeed was opened \u2014 and if he swore it was opened, he must\nshow a motive for opening it, and the conclusion with him\nand his father was that the pointing out the error would\nappear the most plausible.\nFor the purpose of showing that the assignment was not\nin the bundle when Talbott got it, is the story introduced\ninto Lucian\u2019s a\ufb00idavit that the deeds were counted. It is a\nremarkable fact, and one that should stand as a warning to\nall liars and fabricators, that in this short a\ufb00idavit of\nLucian\u2019s he only attempted to depart from the truth, so far\nas I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, in the\nopening the deed and pointing out the error and the\ncounting of the deeds, \u2014 and in both of these he caught\nhimself. About the counting, he caught himself thus \u2014 after\nsaying the bundle contained \ufb01ve deeds and a lease, he\nproceeds, \u201cand I saw no other papers than the said deed\nand lease.\u201d First he has six papers, and then he saw none\nbut two; for \u201cmy son Lucian\u2019s\u201d bene\ufb01t, let a pin be stuck\nhere.\nAdams again adduces the argument, that he could not\nhave forged the assignment, for the reason that he could\nhave had no motive for it. With those that know the facts\nthere is no absence of motive. Admitting the paper which\nhe has \ufb01led in the suit to be genuine, it is clear that it\ncannot answer the purpose for which he designs it. Hence\n his motive for making one that he supposed would answer\nis obvious. His making the date too old is also easily\nenough accounted for. The records were not in his hands,\nand then, there being some considerable talk upon this\nparticular subject, he knew he could not examine the\nrecords to ascertain the precise dates without subjecting\nhimself to suspicion; and hence he concluded to try it by\nguess, and, as it turned out, missed it a little. About Miller\u2019s\ndeposition I have a word to say. In the \ufb01rst place, Miller\u2019s\nanswer to the \ufb01rst question shows upon its face that he had\nbeen tampered with, and the answer dictated to him. He\nwas asked if he knew Joel Wright and James Adams; and\nabove three-fourths of his answer consists of what he knew\nabout Joseph Anderson, a man about whom nothing had\nbeen asked, nor a word said in the question \u2014 a fact that\ncan only be accounted for upon the supposition that Adams\nhad secretly told him what he wished him to swear to.\nAnother of Miller\u2019s answers I will prove both by common\nsense and the Court of Record is untrue. To one question he\nanswers, \u201cAnderson brought a suit against me before James\nAdams, then an acting justice of the peace in Sangamon\nCounty, before whom he obtained a judgment.\n\u201cQ. \u2014 Did you remove the same by injunction to the\nSangamon Circuit Court? Ans. \u2014 I did remove it.\u201d\nNow mark \u2014 it is said he removed it by injunction. The\nword \u201cinjunction\u201d in common language imports a command\nthat some person or thing shall not move or be removed; in\nlaw it has the same meaning. An injunction issuing out of\nchancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to\n stop all proceedings in a named case until further orders. It\nis not an order to remove but to stop or stay something that\nis already moving. Besides this, the records of the\nSangamon Circuit Court show that the judgment of which\nMiller swore was never removed into said Court by\ninjunction or otherwise.\nI have now to take notice of a part of Adams\u2019s address\nwhich in the order of time should have been noticed before.\nIt is in these words: \u201cI have now shown, in the opinion of\ntwo competent judges, that the handwriting of the forged\nassignment di\ufb00ered from mine, and by one of them that it\ncould not be mistaken for mine.\u201d That is false. Tinsley no\ndoubt is the judge referred to; and by reference to his\ncerti\ufb01cate it will be seen that he did not say the\nhandwriting of the assignment could not be mistaken for\nAdams\u2019s \n\u2014 \nnor \ndid \nhe \nuse \nany \nother \nexpression\nsubstantially, or anything near substantially, the same. But\nif Tinsley had said the handwriting could not be mistaken\nfor Adams\u2019s, it would have been equally unfortunate for\nAdams: for it then would have contradicted Keys, who says,\n\u201cI looked at the writing and judged it the said Adams\u2019s or a\ngood imitation.\u201d\nAdams speaks with much apparent con\ufb01dence of his\nsuccess \non \nattending \nlawsuits, \nand \nthe \nultimate\nmaintenance of his title to the land in question. Without\nwishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream, I would say to\nhim that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to\nsing a di\ufb00erent song in relation to the matter.\n At the end of Miller\u2019s deposition, Adams asks, \u201cWill Mr.\nLincoln now say that he is almost convinced my title to this\nten acre tract of land is founded in fraud?\u201d I answer, I will\nnot. I will now change the phraseology so as to make it run\n\u2014 I am quite convinced, \nc. I cannot pass in silence\nAdams\u2019s assertion that he has proved that the forged\nassignment was not in the deed when it came from his\nhouse by Talbott, the recorder. In this, although Talbott has\nsworn that the assignment was in the bundle of deeds when\nit came from his house, Adams has the unaccountable\nassurance to say that he has proved the contrary by\nTalbott. Let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he\nproved any such thing by Talbott.\nIn his publication of the th of September he hinted to\nTalbott, that he might be mistaken. In his present, speaking\nof Talbott and me he says \u201cThey may have been imposed\nupon.\u201d Can any man of the least penetration fail to see the\nobject of this? After he has stormed and raged till he hopes\nand imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to\nsoftly whisper in our ears, \u201cIf you\u2019ll quit I will.\u201d If he could\nget us to say that some unknown, unde\ufb01ned being had\nslipped the assignment into our hands without our\nknowledge, not a doubt remains but that he would\nimmediately discover that we were the purest men on\nearth. This is the ground he evidently wishes us to\nunderstand he is willing to compromise upon. But we ask\nno such charity at his hands. We are neither mistaken nor\nimposed upon. We have made the statements we have\n because we know them to be true and we choose to live or\ndie by them.\nEsq. Carter, who is Adams\u2019s friend, personal and\npolitical, will recollect, that, on the th of this month, he\n(Adams), with a great a\ufb00ectation of modesty, declared that\nhe would never introduce his own child as a witness.\nNotwithstanding this a\ufb00ectation of modesty, he has in his\npresent publication introduced his child as witness; and as\nif to show with how much contempt he could treat his own\ndeclaration, he has had this same Esq. Carter to administer\nthe oath to him. And so important a witness does he\nconsider him, and so entirely does the whole of his entire\npresent production depend upon the testimony of his child,\nthat in it he has mentioned \u201cmy son,\u201d \u201cmy son Lucian,\u201d\n\u201cLucian, my son,\u201d and the like expressions no less than\n\ufb01fteen di\ufb00erent times. Let it be remembered here, that I\nhave shown the a\ufb00idavit of \u201cmy darling son Lucian\u201d to be\nfalse by the evidence apparent on its own face; and I now\nask if that a\ufb00idavit be taken away what foundation will the\nfabric have left to stand upon?\nGeneral Adams\u2019s publications and out-door maneuvering,\ntaken in connection with the editorial articles of the\nRepublican, are not more foolish and contradictory than\nthey are ludicrous and amusing. One week the Republican\nnoti\ufb01es the public that Gen. Adams is preparing an\ninstrument that will tear, rend, split, rive, blow up,\nconfound, overwhelm, annihilate, extinguish, exterminate,\nburst asunder, and grind to powder all its slanderers, and\n particularly Talbott and Lincoln \u2014 all of which is to be done\nin due time.\nThen for two or three weeks all is calm \u2014 not a word\nsaid. Again the Republican comes forth with a mere passing\nremark that \u201cpublic\u201d opinion has decided in favor of Gen.\nAdams, and intimates that he will give himself no more\ntrouble about the matter. In the meantime Adams himself is\nprowling about and, as Burns says of the devil, \u201cFor prey,\nand holes and corners tryin\u2019,\u201d and in one instance goes so\nfar as to take an old acquaintance of mine several steps\nfrom a crowd and, apparently weighed down with the\nimportance of his business, gravely and solemnly asks him\nif \u201che ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist.\u201d\nAnon the Republican comes again. \u201cWe invite the\nattention of the public to General Adams\u2019s communication,\u201d\nc. \u201cThe victory is a great one, the triumph is\noverwhelming.\u201d I really believe the editor of the Illinois\nRepublican is fool enough to think General Adams leads o\ufb00\n\u2014 \u201cAuthors most egregiously mistaken \nc. Most woefully\nshall their presumption be punished,\u201d \nc. (Lord have\nmercy on us.) \u201cThe hour is yet to come, yea, nigh at hand \u2014\n(how long \ufb01rst do you reckon?) \u2014 when the Journal and its\njunto shall say, I have appeared too early.\u201d \u201cTheir infamy\nshall be laid bare to the public gaze.\u201d Suddenly the General\nappears to relent at the severity with which he is treating\nus and he exclaims: \u201cThe condemnation of my enemies is\nthe inevitable result of my own defense.\u201d For your health\u2019s\nsake, dear Gen., do not permit your tenderness of heart to\na\ufb04ict you so much on our account. For some reason\n (perhaps because we are killed so quickly) we shall never\nbe sensible of our su\ufb00ering.\nFarewell, General. I will see you again at court if not\nbefore \u2014 when and where we will settle the question\nwhether you or the widow shall have the land.\nA. LINCOLN. October , .\n",
    "1838-1845": "     \n   \nA    \n  A   \n   \n  I   A\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, January , .\nMR. LINCOLN, FROM Committee on Finance, to which the\nsubject was referred, made a report on the subject of\npurchasing of the United States all the unsold lands lying\nwithin the limits of the State of Illinois, accompanied by\nresolutions that this State propose to purchase all unsold\nlands at twenty-\ufb01ve cents per acre, and pledging the faith\nof the State to carry the proposal into e\ufb00ect if the\ngovernment accept the same within two years.\nMr. Lincoln thought the resolutions ought to be seriously\nconsidered. In reply to the gentleman from Adams, he said\nthat it was not to enrich the State. The price of the lands\nmay be raised, it was thought by some; by others, that it\nwould be reduced. The conclusion in his mind was that the\nrepresentatives in this Legislature from the country in\nwhich the lands lie would be opposed to raising the price,\nbecause it would operate against the settlement of the\nlands. He referred to the lands in the military tract. They\nhad fallen into the hands of large speculators in\nconsequence of the low price. He was opposed to a low\nprice of land. He thought it was adverse to the interests of\nthe poor settler, because speculators buy them up. He was\nopposed to a reduction of the price of public lands.\n Mr. \nLincoln \nreferred \nto \nsome \no\ufb00icial \ndocuments\nemanating from Indiana, and compared the progressive\npopulation of the two States. Illinois had gained upon that\nState under the public land system as it is. His conclusion\nwas that ten years from this time Illinois would have no\nmore public land unsold than Indiana now has. He referred\nalso to Ohio. That State had sold nearly all her public lands.\nShe was but twenty years ahead of us, and as our lands\nwere equally salable \u2014 more so, as he maintained \u2014 we\nshould have no more twenty years from now than she has\nat present.\nMr. Lincoln referred to the canal lands, and supposed\nthat the policy of the State would be di\ufb00erent in regard to\nthem, if the representatives from that section of country\ncould themselves choose the policy; but the representatives\nfrom other parts of the State had a veto upon it, and\nregulated the policy. He thought that if the State had all the\nlands, the policy of the Legislature would be more liberal to\nall sections.\nHe referred to the policy of the General Government. He\nthought that if the national debt had not been paid, the\nexpenses of the government would not have doubled, as\nthey had done since that debt was paid.\n  \n \n \n  \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, June ,  DEAR ROW: \nMR. REDMAN INFORMS me that you wish me to write you\nthe particulars of a conversation between Dr. Felix and\nmyself relative to you. The Dr. overtook me between\nRushville and Beardstown.\nHe, after learning that I had lived at Spring\ufb01eld, asked if\nI was acquainted with you. I told him I was. He said you\nhad lately been elected constable in Adams, but that you\nnever would be again. I asked him why. He said the people\nthere had found out that you had been sheri\ufb00 or deputy\nsheri\ufb00 in Sangamon County, and that you came o\ufb00 and left\nyour securities to su\ufb00er. He then asked me if I did not know\nsuch to be the fact. I told him I did not think you had ever\nbeen sheri\ufb00 or deputy sheri\ufb00 in Sangamon, but that I\nthought you had been constable. I further told him that if\nyou had left your securities to su\ufb00er in that or any other\ncase, I had never heard of it, and that if it had been so, I\nthought I would have heard of it.\nIf the Dr. is telling that I told him anything against you\nwhatever, I authorize you to contradict it \ufb02atly. We have no\nnews here.\nYour friend, as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n      H \n \nA I\nA   A\nIN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, DECEMBER , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 It is peculiarly embarrassing to\nme to attempt a continuance of the discussion, on this\nevening, which has been conducted in this hall on several\npreceding ones. It is so because on each of those evenings\nthere was a much fuller attendance than now, without any\nreason for its being so, except the greater interest the\ncommunity feel in the speakers who addressed them then\nthan they do in him who is to do so now. I am, indeed,\napprehensive that the few who have attended have done so\nmore to spare me morti\ufb01cation than in the hope of being\ninterested in anything I may be able to say. This\ncircumstance casts a damp upon my spirits, which I am\nsure I shall be unable to overcome during the evening. But\nenough of preface.\nThe subject heretofore and now to be discussed is the\nsubtreasury scheme of the present administration, as a\nmeans \nof \ncollecting, \nsafe-keeping, \ntransferring, \nand\ndisbursing, the revenues of the nation, as contrasted with a\nnational bank for the same purposes. Mr. Douglas has said\nthat we (the Whigs) have not dared to meet them (the\nLocos) in argument on this question. I protest against this\n assertion. I assert that we have again and again, during\nthis discussion, urged facts and arguments against the\nsubtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor\nattempted to answer. But lest some may be led to believe\nthat we really wish to avoid the question, I now propose, in\nmy humble way, to urge those arguments again; at the\nsame time begging the audience to mark well the positions\nI shall take and the proof I shall o\ufb00er to sustain them, and\nthat they will not again permit Mr. Douglas or his friends to\nescape the force of them by a round and groundless\nassertion that we \u201cdare not meet them in argument.\u201d\nOf the subtreasury, then, as contrasted with a national\nbank for the before-enumerated purposes, I lay down the\nfollowing propositions, to wit: () It will injuriously a\ufb00ect\nthe community by its operation on the circulating medium.\n() It will be a more expensive \ufb01scal agent. () It will be a\nless secure depository of the public money. To show the\ntruth of the \ufb01rst proposition, let us take a short review of\nour condition under the operation of a national bank. It was\nthe depository of the public revenues. Between the\ncollection of those revenues and the disbursement of them\nby the government, the bank was permitted to and did\nactually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large\namount of money actually collected for revenue purposes,\nwhich by any other plan would have been idle a great\nportion of the time, was kept almost constantly in\ncirculation. Any person who will re\ufb02ect that money is only\nvaluable while in circulation will readily perceive that any\ndevice which will keep the government revenues in\n constant circulation, instead of being locked up in idleness,\nis no inconsiderable advantage. By the subtreasury the\nrevenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until the\ngovernment wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the\npeople of the use of it, while the government does not itself\nneed it, and while the money is performing no nobler o\ufb00ice\nthan that of rusting in iron boxes. The natural e\ufb00ect of this\nchange of policy, every one will see, is to reduce the\nquantity of money in circulation. But, again, by the\nsubtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in\nspecie. I anticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to\nhear it said that it is not the policy of the administration to\ncollect the revenue in specie. If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van\nBuren, in his message recommending the subtreasury,\nexpended nearly a column of that document in an attempt\nto persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the\nrevenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these\nwords:\n\u201cIt may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience\nto the citizens requires the reception of bank paper.\u201d In\naddition to this, Mr. Silas Wright, Senator from New York,\nand the political, personal and con\ufb01dential friend of Mr.\nVan Buren, drafted and introduced into the Senate the \ufb01rst\nsubtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately\ncollecting the revenue in specie. It is true, I know, that that\nclause was stricken from the bill, but it was done by the\nvotes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren\nsenators. No subtreasury bill has yet become a law, though\ntwo or three have been considered by Congress, some with\n and some without the specie clause; so that I admit there is\nroom for quibbling upon the question of whether the\nadministration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not;\nbut I take it that the fact that the President at \ufb01rst urged\nthe specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the\n\ufb01rst bill introduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it\nas the policy of the party until their head as publicly\nrecants it as he at \ufb01rst espoused it. I repeat, then, that by\nthe subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie.\nNow mark what the e\ufb00ect of this must be. By all estimates\never made there are but between sixty and eighty millions\nof specie in the United States. The expenditures of the\nGovernment for the year  \u2014 the last for which we have\nhad the report \u2014 were forty millions. Thus it is seen that if\nthe whole revenue be collected in specie, it will take more\nthan half of all the specie in the nation to do it. By this\nmeans more than half of all the specie belonging to the\n\ufb01fteen millions of souls who compose the whole population\nof the country is thrown into the hands of the public o\ufb00ice-\nholders, and other public creditors comprising in number\nperhaps not more than one quarter of a million, leaving the\nother fourteen millions and three quarters to get along as\nthey best can, with less than one half of the specie of the\ncountry, and whatever rags and shinplasters they may be\nable to put, and keep, in circulation. By this means, every\no\ufb00ice-holder and other public creditor may, and most likely\nwill, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the\nspecie-men have of it, \u2014 each specie-man, upon a fair\ndivision, having to his share the \ufb02eecing of about \ufb01fty-nine\n rag-men. In all candor let me ask, was such a system for\nbene\ufb01ting the few at the expense of the many ever before\ndevised? And was the sacred name of Democracy ever\nbefore made to indorse such an enormity against the rights\nof the people?\nI have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the\nquantity \nof \nmoney \nin \ncirculation. \nThis \nposition \nis\nstrengthened by the recollection that the revenue is to be\ncollected in Specie, so that the mere amount of revenue is\nnot all that is withdrawn, but the amount of paper\ncirculation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to\nis withdrawn, which would be in a sound state at least one\nhundred millions. When one hundred millions, or more, of\nthe circulation we now have shall be withdrawn, who can\ncontemplate without terror the distress, ruin, bankruptcy,\nand beggary that must follow? The man who has purchased\nany article \u2014 say a horse \u2014 on credit, at one hundred\ndollars, when there are two hundred millions circulating in\nthe country, if the quantity be reduced to one hundred\nmillions by the arrival of pay-day, will \ufb01nd the horse but\nsu\ufb00icient to pay half the debt; and the other half must\neither be paid out of his other means, and thereby become\na clear loss to him, or go unpaid, and thereby become a\nclear loss to his creditor. What I have here said of a single\ncase of the purchase of a horse will hold good in every case\nof a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of\nmoney occurs, by whomsoever, and for whatsoever, it may\nhave been contracted. It may be said that what the debtor\nloses the creditor gains by this operation; but on\n examination this will be found true only to a very limited\nextent. It is more generally true that all lose by it \u2014 the\ncreditor by losing more of his debts than he gains by the\nincreased value of those he collects; the debtor by either\nparting with more of his property to pay his debts than he\nreceived in contracting them, or by entirely breaking up his\nbusiness, and thereby being thrown upon the world in\nidleness.\nThe general distress thus created will, to be sure, be\ntemporary, because, whatever change may occur in the\nquantity of money in any community, time will adjust the\nderangement produced; but while that adjustment is\nprogressing, all su\ufb00er more or less, and very many lose\neverything that renders life desirable. Why, then, shall we\nsu\ufb00er a severe di\ufb00iculty, even though it be but temporary,\nunless we receive some equivalent for it?\nWhat I have been saying as to the e\ufb00ect produced by a\nreduction of the quantity of money relates to the whole\ncountry. I now propose to show that it would produce a\npeculiar and permanent hardship upon the citizens of those\nStates and Territories in which the public lands lie. The\nland-o\ufb00ices in those States and Territories, as all know,\nform the great gulf by which all, or nearly all, the money in\nthem is swallowed up. When the quantity of money shall be\nreduced, and consequently everything under individual\ncontrol brought down in proportion, the price of those\nlands, being \ufb01xed by law, will remain as now. Of necessity it\nwill follow that the produce or labor that now raises money\nsu\ufb00icient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but\n su\ufb00icient to purchase forty, or perhaps not that much; and\nthis di\ufb00iculty and hardship will last as long, in some\ndegree, as any portion of these lands shall remain\nundisposed of. Knowing, as I well do, the di\ufb00iculty that\npoor people now encounter in procuring homes, I hesitate\nnot to say that when the price of the public lands shall be\ndoubled or trebled, or, which is the same thing, produce\nand labor cut down to one half or one third of their present\nprices, it will be little less than impossible for them to\nprocure those homes at all....\nWell, then, what did become of him? (Postmaster General\nBarry) Why, the President immediately expressed his high\ndisapprobation of his almost unequaled incapacity and\ncorruption by appointing him to a foreign mission, with a\nsalary and out\ufb01t of  , a year! The party now attempt\nto throw Barry o\ufb00, and to avoid the responsibility of his\nsins. Did not the President indorse those sins when, on the\nvery heel of their commission, he appointed their author to\nthe very highest and most honorable o\ufb00ice in his gift, and\nwhich is but a single step behind the very goal of American\npolitical ambition?\nI return to another of Mr. Douglas\u2019s excuses for the\nexpenditures of , at the same time announcing the\npleasing intelligence that this is the last one. He says that\nten millions of that year\u2019s expenditure was a contingent\nappropriation, to prosecute an anticipated war with Great\nBritain on the Maine boundary question. Few words will\nsettle this. First, that the ten millions appropriated was not\nmade till , and consequently could not have been\n expended in ; second, although it was appropriated, it\nhas never been expended at all. Those who heard Mr.\nDouglas \nrecollect \nthat \nhe \nindulged \nhimself \nin \na\ncontemptuous expression of pity for me. \u201cNow he\u2019s got\nme,\u201d thought I. But when he went on to say that \ufb01ve\nmillions of the expenditure of  were payments of the\nFrench indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that \ufb01ve\nmillions had been for the post-o\ufb00ice, which I knew to be\nuntrue; that ten millions had been for the Maine boundary\nwar, which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely\nridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough\nto hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious\nassertions to go unexposed, \u2014 I readily consented that, on\nthe score both of veracity and sagacity, the audience should\njudge whether he or I were the more deserving of the\nworld\u2019s contempt.\nMr. Lamborn insists that the di\ufb00erence between the Van\nBuren party and the Whigs is that, although the former\nsometimes err in practice, they are always correct in\nprinciple, whereas the latter are wrong in principle; and,\nbetter to impress this proposition, he uses a \ufb01gurative\nexpression in these words: \u201cThe Democrats are vulnerable\nin the heel, but they are sound in the head and the heart.\u201d\nThe \ufb01rst branch of the \ufb01gure \u2014 that is, that the Democrats\nare vulnerable in the heel \u2014 I admit is not merely\n\ufb01guratively, but literally true. Who that looks but for a\nmoment \nat \ntheir \nSwartwouts, \ntheir \nPrices, \ntheir\nHarringtons, and their hundreds of others, scampering\naway with the public money to Texas, to Europe, and to\n every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to \ufb01nd\nrefuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most\ndistressingly a\ufb00ected in their heels with a species of\n\u201crunning itch\u201d? It seems that this malady of their heels\noperates on these sound-headed and honest-hearted\ncreatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song did\non its owner: which, when he had once got started on it,\nthe more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away. At\nthe hazard of wearing this point threadbare, I will relate an\nanecdote which seems too strikingly in point to be omitted.\nA witty Irish soldier, who was always boasting of his\nbravery when no danger was near, but who invariably\nretreated without orders at the \ufb01rst charge of an\nengagement, being asked by his captain why he did so,\nreplied: \u201cCaptain, I have as brave a heart as Julius Caesar\never had; but, somehow or other, whenever danger\napproaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it.\u201d So\nwith Mr. Lamborn\u2019s party. They take the public money into\ntheir hand for the most laudable purpose that wise heads\nand honest hearts can dictate; but before they can possibly\nget it out again, their rascally \u201cvulnerable heels\u201d will run\naway with them.\nSeriously this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing\nmore or less than a request that his party may be tried by\ntheir professions instead of their practices. Perhaps no\nposition that the party assumes is more liable to or more\ndeserving of exposure than this very modest request; and\nnothing but the unwarrantable length to which I have\n already extended these remarks forbids me now attempting\nto expose it. For the reason given, I pass it by.\nI shall advert to but one more point. Mr. Lamborn refers\nto the late elections in the States, and from their results\ncon\ufb01dently predicts that every State in the Union will vote\nfor Mr. Van Buren at the next Presidential election. Address\nthat argument to cowards and to knaves; with the free and\nthe brave it will e\ufb00ect nothing. It may be true; if it must, let\nit. Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours may\nlose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that\nI was the last to desert, but that I never deserted her. I\nknow that the great volcano at Washington, aroused and\ndirected by the evil spirit that reigns there, is belching\nforth the lava of political corruption in a current broad and\ndeep, which is sweeping with frightful velocity over the\nwhole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to leave\nunscathed no green spot or living thing; while on its bosom\nare riding, like demons on the waves of hell, the imps of\nthat evil spirit, and \ufb01endishly taunting all those who dare\nresist its destroying course with the hopelessness of their\ne\ufb00ort; and, knowing this, I cannot deny that all may be\nswept away. Broken by it I, too, may be; bow to it I never\nwill. The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought\nnot to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be\njust; it shall not deter me. If ever I feel the soul within me\nelevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly\nunworthy of its almighty Architect, it is when I contemplate\nthe cause of my country deserted by all the world beside,\nand I standing up boldly and alone, and hurling de\ufb01ance at\n her victorious oppressors. Here, without contemplating\nconsequences, before high heaven and in the face of the\nworld, I swear eternal \ufb01delity to the just cause, as I deem\nit, of the land of my life, my liberty, and my love. And who\nthat thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I\ntake? Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may\nsucceed. But if, after all, we shall fail, be it so. We still shall\nhave the proud consolation of saying to our consciences,\nand to the departed shade of our country\u2019s freedom, that\nthe cause approved of our judgment, and adored of our\nhearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death, we never\nfaltered in defending.\n  \n  \nH\n  .    A  .\nSPRINGFIELD, December , .\nDEAR STUART:\nDr. Henry will write you all the political news. I write this\nabout some little matters of business. You recollect you told\nme you had drawn the Chicago Masark money, and sent it\nto the claimants. A hawk-billed Yankee is here besetting me\nat every turn I take, saying that Robert Kinzie never\nreceived the eighty dollars to which he was entitled. Can\nyou tell me anything about the matter? Again, old Mr.\nWright, who lives up South Fork somewhere, is teasing me\ncontinually about some deeds which he says he left with\nyou, but which I can \ufb01nd nothing of. Can you tell me where\nthey are? The Legislature is in session and has su\ufb00ered the\nbank to forfeit its charter without bene\ufb01t of clergy. There\nseems to be little disposition to resuscitate it.\nWhenever a letter comes from you to Mrs. I carry it to\nher, and then I see Betty; she is a tolerable nice \u201cfellow\u201d\nnow. Maybe I will write again when I get more time.\nYour friend as ever, A. LINCOLN\nP. S. \u2014 The Democratic giant is here, but he is not much\nworth talking about. A.L.\n     \n  I  \n A    \n \nHI\n  \nI    .\nCon\ufb01dential.\nJANUARY , .\nTo MESSRS \u2014\u2014 \u2014\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 In obedience to a resolution of the\nWhig State convention, we have appointed you the Central\nWhig Committee of your county. The trust con\ufb01ded to you\nwill be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope the\nglory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt\npowers that now control our beloved country will be a\nsu\ufb00icient reward for the time and labor you will devote to\nit. Our Whig brethren throughout the Union have met in\nconvention, \nand \nafter \ndue \ndeliberation \nand \nmutual\nconcessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and\nVice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of\nthe support of every true patriot who would have our\ncountry redeemed, and her institutions honestly and\nfaithfully administered. To overthrow the trained bands\nthat are opposed to us whose salaried o\ufb00icers are ever on\nthe watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready\nto obey their smallest commands, every Whig must not only\nknow his duty, but must \ufb01rmly resolve, whatever of time\nand labor it may cost, boldly and faithfully to do it. Our\nintention is to organize the whole State, so that every Whig\n can be brought to the polls in the coming Presidential\ncontest. We cannot do this, however, without your co-\noperation; and as we do our duty, so we shall expect you to\ndo yours. After due deliberation, the following is the plan of\norganization, and the duties required of each county\ncommittee:\n() To divide their county into small districts, and to\nappoint in each a subcommittee, whose duty it shall be to\nmake a perfect list of all the voters in their respective\ndistricts, and to ascertain with certainty for whom they will\nvote. If they meet with men who are doubtful as to the man\nthey will support, such voters should be designated in\nseparate lines, with the name of the man they will probably\nsupport.\n() It will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a\nconstant watch on the doubtful voters, and from time to\ntime have them talked to by those in whom they have the\nmost con\ufb01dence, and also to place in their hands such\ndocuments as will enlighten and in\ufb02uence them.\n() It will also be their duty to report to you, at least once\na month, the progress they are making, and on election\ndays see that every Whig is brought to the polls.\n() The subcommittees should be appointed immediately;\nand by the last of April, at least, they should make their\n\ufb01rst report.\n() On the \ufb01rst of each month hereafter we shall expect\nto hear from you. After the \ufb01rst report of your\nsubcommittees, unless there should be found a great many\ndoubtful voters, you can tell pretty accurately the manner\n in which your county will vote. In each of your letters to us,\nyou will state the number of certain votes both for and\nagainst us, as well as the number of doubtful votes, with\nyour opinion of the manner in which they will be cast.\n() When we have heard from all the counties, we shall\nbe able to tell with similar accuracy the political\ncomplexion of the State. This information will be forwarded\nto you as soon as received.\n() Inclosed is a prospectus for a newspaper to be\ncontinued until after the Presidential election. It will be\nsuperintended by ourselves, and every Whig in the State\nmust take it. It will be published so low that every one can\na\ufb00ord it. You must raise a fund and forward us for extra\ncopies, \u2014 every county ought to send \u2014 \ufb01fty or one\nhundred dollars, \u2014 and the copies will be forwarded to you\nfor distribution among our political opponents. The paper\nwill be devoted exclusively to the great cause in which we\nare engaged. Procure subscriptions, and forward them to\nus immediately.\n() Immediately after any election in your county, you\nmust inform us of its results; and as early as possible after\nany general election we will give you the like information.\n() A senator in Congress is to be elected by our next\nLegislature. Let no local interests divide you, but select\ncandidates that can succeed.\n() Our plan of operations will of course be concealed\nfrom every one except our good friends who of right ought\nto know them.\n Trusting much in our good cause, the strength of our\ncandidates, and the determination of the Whigs everywhere\nto do their duty, we go to the work of organization in this\nState con\ufb01dent of success. We have the numbers, and if\nproperly organized and exerted, with the gallant Harrison\nat our head, we shall meet our foes and conquer them in all\nparts of the Union.\nAddress your letters to Dr. A. G. Henry, R. F, Barrett; A.\nLincoln, E. D. Baker, J. F. Speed.\n  \n  \nH\n  .    A  .\nSPRINGFIELD, March , \nDEAR STUART:\nI have never seen the prospects of our party so bright in\nthese parts as they are now. We shall carry this county by a\nlarger majority than we did in , when you ran against\nMay. I do not think my prospects, individually, are very\n\ufb02attering, for I think it probable I shall not be permitted to\nbe a candidate; but the party ticket will succeed\ntriumphantly. Subscriptions to the \u201cOld Soldier\u201d pour in\nwithout abatement. This morning I took from the post o\ufb00ice\na letter from Dubois enclosing the names of sixty\nsubscribers, and on carrying it to Francis I found he had\nreceived one hundred and forty more from other quarters\nby the same day\u2019s mail. That is but an average specimen of\nevery day\u2019s receipts. Yesterday Douglas, having chosen to\nconsider himself insulted by something in the Journal,\nundertook to cane Francis in the street. Francis caught him\nby the hair and jammed him back against a market cart\nwhere the matter ended by Francis being pulled away from\nhim. The whole a\ufb00air was so ludicrous that Francis and\neverybody else (Douglass excepted) have been laughing\nabout it ever since.\n I send you the names of some of the V.B. men who have\ncome out for Harrison about town, and suggest that you\nsend them some documents.\nMoses Co\ufb00man (he let us appoint him a delegate\nyesterday), Aaron Co\ufb00man, George Gregory, H. M. Briggs,\nJohnson (at Birchall\u2019s Bookstore), Michael Glyn, Armstrong\n(not Hosea nor Hugh, but a carpenter), Thomas Hunter,\nMoses Pileher (he was always a Whig and deserves\nattention), Matthew Crowder Jr., Greenberry Smith; John\nFagan, George Fagan, William Fagan (these three fell out\nwith us about Early, and are doubtful now), John M.\nCartmel, Noah Rickard, John Rickard, Walter Marsh.\nThe foregoing should be addressed at Spring\ufb01eld.\nAlso send some to Solomon Miller and John Auth at\nSalisbury. Also to Charles Harper, Samuel Harper, and B. C.\nHarper, and T. J. Scroggins, John Scroggins at Pulaski,\nLogan County.\nSpeed says he wrote you what Jo Smith said about you as\nhe passed here. We will procure the names of some of his\npeople here, and send them to you before long. Speed also\nsays you must not fail to send us the New York Journal he\nwrote for some time since.\nEvan Butler is jealous that you never send your\ncompliments to him. You must not neglect him next time.\nYour friend, as ever, A. LINCOLN\n    \n \n I\n I\n  H  I  I\nI    \nI  A \n  .\nNovember , .\nIN THE ILLINOIS House of Representatives, November ,\n, Mr. Lincoln o\ufb00ered the following: Resolved, That so\nmuch of the governor\u2019s message as relates to fraudulent\nvoting, and other fraudulent practices at elections, be\nreferred to the Committee on Elections, with instructions to\nsaid committee to prepare and report to the House a bill for\nsuch an act as may in their judgment a\ufb00ord the greatest\npossible protection of the elective franchise against all\nfrauds of all sorts whatever.\n    \n \n I\n I\n  H  I  I\nI    \nI  A \n  .\nDecember , .\nRESOLVED, \nTHAT \nTHE \nCommittee \non \nEducation \nbe\ninstructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by\nlaw for the examination as to the quali\ufb01cation of persons\no\ufb00ering themselves as school teachers, that no teacher\nshall receive any part of the public school fund who shall\nnot have successfully passed such examination, and that\nthey report by bill or otherwise.\n   \nA    I\n  H  I  I\nI    \nI  A \n  .\nDecember , \nIN THE HOUSE of Representatives, Illinois, December ,\n, on presentation of a report respecting petition of H.\nN. Purple, claiming the seat of Mr. Phelps from Peoria, Mr.\nLincoln moved that the House resolve itself into Committee\nof the Whole on the question, and take it up immediately.\nMr. Lincoln considered the question of the highest\nimportance whether an individual had a right to sit in this\nHouse or not. The course he should propose would be to\ntake up the evidence and decide upon the facts seriatim.\nMr. Drummond wanted time; they could not decide in the\nheat of debate, etc.\nMr. Lincoln thought that the question had better be gone\ninto now. In courts of law jurors were required to decide on\nevidence, without previous study or examination. They\nwere required to know nothing of the subject until the\nevidence was laid before them for their immediate decision.\nHe thought that the heat of party would be augmented by\ndelay.\nThe Speaker called Mr. Lincoln to order as being\nirrelevant; no mention had been made of party heat.\nMr. Drummond said he had only spoken of debate. Mr.\nLincoln asked what caused the heat, if it was not party? Mr.\n Lincoln concluded by urging that the question would be\ndecided now better than hereafter, and he thought with less\nheat and excitement.\n(Further debate, in which Lincoln participated.)\n   \nA    I\n  H  I  I\nI    \nI  A \n  .\nDecember , .\nIN THE ILLINOIS House of Representatives, December ,\n, House in Committee of the Whole on the bill\nproviding for payment of interest on the State debt, \u2014 Mr.\nLincoln moved to strike out the body and amendments of\nthe bill, and insert in lieu thereof an amendment which in\nsubstance was that the governor be authorized to issue\nbonds for the payment of the interest; that these be called\n\u201cinterest bonds\u201d; that the taxes accruing on Congress lands\nas they become taxable be irrevocably set aside and\ndevoted as a fund to the payment of the interest bonds. Mr.\nLincoln went into the reasons which appeared to him to\nrender this plan preferable to that of hypothecating the\nState bonds. By this course we could get along till the next\nmeeting of the Legislature, which was of great importance.\nTo the objection which might be urged that these interest\nbonds could not be cashed, he replied that if our other\nbonds could, much more could these, which o\ufb00ered a\nperfect security, a fund being irrevocably set aside to\nprovide for their redemption. To another objection, that we\nshould be paying compound interest, he would reply that\nthe rapid growth and increase of our resources was in so\ngreat a ratio as to outstrip the di\ufb00iculty; that his object was\n to do the best that could be done in the present emergency.\nAll agreed that the faith of the State must be preserved;\nthis plan appeared to him preferable to a hypothecation of\nbonds, which would have to be redeemed and the interest\npaid. How this was to be done, he could not see; therefore\nhe had, after turning the matter over in every way, devised\nthis measure, which would carry us on till the next\nLegislature.\n(Mr. Lincoln spoke at some length, advocating his\nmeasure.) Lincoln advocated his measure, December ,\n.\nDecember , , he had thought some permanent\nprovision ought to be made for the bonds to be\nhypothecated, but was satis\ufb01ed taxation and revenue could\nnot be connected with it now.\n     \n    \n \n I\n  A  A \nHI\n \n   I\n A\n   I\n I  \n  I  I\nI   \nA  H        .\nTHE OBJECT OF the meeting was stated by Mr. Lincoln of\nSpring\ufb01eld, who o\ufb00ered the following resolutions, which\nwere unanimously adopted: Resolved, That a tari\ufb00 of duties\non imported goods, producing su\ufb00icient revenue for the\npayment of the necessary expenditures of the National\nGovernment, and so adjusted as to protect American\nindustry, is indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the\nAmerican people.\nResolved, That we are opposed to direct taxation for the\nsupport of the National Government.\nResolved, That a national bank, properly restricted, is\nhighly necessary and proper to the establishment and\nmaintenance of a sound currency, and for the cheap and\nsafe collection, keeping, and disbursing of the public\nrevenue.\nResolved, That the distribution of the proceeds of the\nsales of the public lands, upon the principles of Mr. Clay\u2019s\nbill, accords with the best interests of the nation, and\nparticularly with those of the State of Illinois.\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of each\nCongressional district of the State to nominate and support\nat the approaching election a candidate of their own\nprinciples, regardless of the chances of success.\n Resolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of all\nportions of the State to adopt and rigidly adhere to the\nconvention system of nominating candidates.\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of each\nCongressional district to hold a district convention on or\nbefore the \ufb01rst Monday of May next, to be composed of a\nnumber of delegates from each county equal to double the\nnumber of its representatives in the General Assembly,\nprovided, each county shall have at least one delegate. Said\ndelegates to be chosen by primary meetings of the Whigs,\nat such times and places as they in their respective\ncounties may see \ufb01t. Said district conventions each to\nnominate one candidate for Congress, and one delegate to\na national convention for the purpose of nominating\ncandidates for President and Vice-President of the United\nStates. The seven delegates so nominated to a national\nconvention to have power to add two delegates to their own\nnumber, and to \ufb01ll all vacancies.\nResolved, That A. T. Bledsoe, S. T. Logan, and A. Lincoln\nbe appointed a committee to prepare an address to the\npeople of the State.\nResolved, That N. W. Edwards, A. G. Henry, James H.\nMatheny, John C. Doremus, and James C. Conkling be\nappointed a Whig Central State Committee, with authority\nto \ufb01ll any vacancy that may occur in the committee.\n  I  \n A    \n \nHI\n  \nI    .\nAddress to the People of Illinois.\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:-BY A RESOLUTION of a meeting of\nsuch of the Whigs of the State as are now at Spring\ufb01eld,\nwe, the undersigned, were appointed to prepare an address\nto you. The performance of that task we now undertake.\nSeveral resolutions were adopted by the meeting; and\nthe chief object of this address is to show brie\ufb02y the\nreasons for their adoption.\nThe \ufb01rst of those resolutions declares a tari\ufb00 of duties\nupon foreign importations, producing su\ufb00icient revenue for\nthe support of the General Government, and so adjusted as\nto protect American industry, to be indispensably necessary\nto the prosperity of the American people; and the second\ndeclares direct taxation for a national revenue to be\nimproper. Those two resolutions are kindred in their\nnature, and therefore proper and convenient to be\nconsidered together. The question of protection is a subject\nentirely too broad to be crowded into a few pages only,\ntogether with several other subjects. On that point we\ntherefore content ourselves with giving the following\nextracts from the writings of Mr. Je\ufb00erson, General\nJackson, and the speech of Mr. Calhoun:\n \u201cTo be independent for the comforts of life, we must\nfabricate them ourselves. We must now place the\nmanufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist. The grand\ninquiry now is, Shall we make our own comforts, or go\nwithout them at the will of a foreign nation? He, therefore,\nwho is now against domestic manufactures must be for\nreducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation, or\nto be clothed in skins and to live like wild beasts in dens\nand caverns. I am not one of those; experience has taught\nme that manufactures are now as necessary to our\nindependence as to our comfort.\u201d Letter of Mr. Je\ufb00erson to\nBenjamin Austin.\n\u201cI ask, What is the real situation of the agriculturalist?\nWhere has the American farmer a market for his surplus\nproduce? Except for cotton, he has neither a foreign nor a\nhome market. Does not this clearly prove, when there is no\nmarket at home or abroad, that there [is] too much labor\nemployed in agriculture? Common sense at once points out\nthe remedy. Take from agriculture six hundred thousand\nmen, women, and children, and you will at once give a\nmarket for more breadstu\ufb00s than all Europe now furnishes.\nIn short, we have been too long subject to the policy of\nBritish merchants. It is time we should become a little more\nAmericanized, and instead of feeding the paupers and\nlaborers of England, feed our own; or else in a short time,\nby continuing our present policy, we shall all be rendered\npaupers ourselves.\u201d \u2014 General Jackson\u2019s Letter to Dr.\nColeman.\n \u201cWhen our manufactures are grown to a certain\nperfection, as they soon will be, under the fostering care of\ngovernment, the farmer will \ufb01nd a ready market for his\nsurplus produce, and \u2014 what is of equal consequence \u2014 a\ncertain and cheap supply of all he wants; his prosperity will\ndi\ufb00use itself to every class of the community.\u201d Speech of\nHon. J. C. Calhoun on the Tari\ufb00.\nThe question of revenue we will now brie\ufb02y consider. For\nseveral years past the revenues of the government have\nbeen unequal to its expenditures, and consequently loan\nafter loan, sometimes direct and sometimes indirect in\nform, has been resorted to. By this means a new national\ndebt has been created, and is still growing on us with a\nrapidity fearful to contemplate \u2014 a rapidity only reasonably\nto be expected in time of war. This state of things has been\nproduced by a prevailing unwillingness either to increase\nthe tari\ufb00 or resort to direct taxation. But the one or the\nother must come. Coming expenditures must be met, and\nthe present debt must be paid; and money cannot always\nbe borrowed for these objects. The system of loans is but\ntemporary in its nature, and must soon explode. It is a\nsystem not only ruinous while it lasts, but one that must\nsoon fail and leave us destitute. As an individual who\nundertakes to live by borrowing soon \ufb01nds his original\nmeans devoured by interest, and, next, no one left to\nborrow from, so must it be with a government.\nWe repeat, then, that a tari\ufb00 su\ufb00icient for revenue, or a\ndirect tax, must soon be resorted to; and, indeed, we\nbelieve this alternative is now denied by no one. But which\n system shall be adopted? Some of our opponents, in theory,\nadmit the propriety of a tari\ufb00 su\ufb00icient for a revenue, but\neven they will not in practice vote for such a tari\ufb00; while\nothers boldly advocate direct taxation. Inasmuch, therefore,\nas some of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the\nrest \u2014 or so nearly all as to make exceptions needless \u2014\nrefuse to adopt the tari\ufb00, we think it is doing them no\ninjustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation.\nIndeed, we believe they are only delaying an open avowal\nof the system till they can assure themselves that the\npeople will tolerate it. Let us, then, brie\ufb02y compare the two\nsystems. The tari\ufb00 is the cheaper system, because the\nduties, being collected in large parcels at a few commercial\npoints, will require comparatively few o\ufb00icers in their\ncollection; while by the direct-tax system the land must be\nliterally covered with assessors and collectors, going forth\nlike swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of\ngrass and other green thing. And, again, by the tari\ufb00\nsystem the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of\nforeign goods, and those chie\ufb02y the luxuries, and not the\nnecessaries, of life. By this system the man who contents\nhimself to live upon the products of his own country pays\nnothing at all. And surely that country is extensive enough,\nand its products abundant and varied enough, to answer all\nthe real wants of its people. In short, by this system the\nburthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and\nluxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many who\nlive at home, and upon home products, go entirely free. By\nthe direct-tax system none can escape. However strictly the\n citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries,\n\u2014 \ufb01ne cloths, \ufb01ne silks, rich wines, golden chains, and\ndiamond rings, \u2014 still, for the possession of his house, his\nbarn, and his homespun, he is to be perpetually haunted\nand harassed by the tax-gatherer. With these views we\nleave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are\nthe more truly democratic on the subject.\nThe third resolution declares the necessity and propriety\nof a national bank. During the last \ufb01fty years so much has\nbeen said and written both as to the constitutionality and\nexpediency of such an institution, that we could not hope to\nimprove in the least on former discussions of the subject,\nwere we to undertake it. We, therefore, upon the question\nof constitutionality content ourselves with remarking the\nfacts that the \ufb01rst national bank was established chie\ufb02y by\nthe same men who formed the Constitution, at a time when\nthat instrument was but two years old, and receiving the\nsanction, as President, of the immortal Washington; that\nthe second received the sanction, as President, of Mr.\nMadison, to whom common consent has awarded the proud\ntitle of \u201cFather of the Constitution\u201d; and subsequently the\nsanction of the Supreme Court, the most enlightened\njudicial tribunal in the world. Upon the question of\nexpediency, we only ask you to examine the history of the\ntimes during the existence of the two banks, and compare\nthose times with the miserable present.\nThe fourth resolution declares the expediency of Mr.\nClay\u2019s land bill. Much incomprehensible jargon is often\nused against the constitutionality of this measure. We\n forbear, in this place, attempting an answer to it, simply\nbecause, in our opinion, those who urge it are through\nparty zeal resolved not to see or acknowledge the truth.\nThe question of expediency, at least so far as Illinois is\nconcerned, seems to us the clearest imaginable. By the bill\nwe are to receive annually a large sum of money, no part of\nwhich we otherwise receive. The precise annual sum\ncannot be known in advance; it doubtless will vary in\ndi\ufb00erent years. Still it is something to know that in the last\nyear \u2014 a year of almost unparalleled pecuniary pressure \u2014\nit amounted to more than forty thousand dollars. This\nannual income, in the midst of our almost insupportable\ndi\ufb00iculties, in the days of our severest necessity, our\npolitical opponents are furiously resolving to take and keep\nfrom us. And for what? Many silly reasons are given, as is\nusual in cases where a single good one is not to be found.\nOne is that by giving us the proceeds of the lands we\nimpoverish the national treasury, and thereby render\nnecessary an increase of the tari\ufb00. This may be true; but if\nso, the amount of it only is that those whose pride, whose\nabundance \nof \nmeans, \nprompt \nthem \nto \nspurn \nthe\nmanufactures of our country, and to strut in British cloaks\nand coats and pantaloons, may have to pay a few cents\nmore on the yard for the cloth that makes them. A terrible\nevil, truly, to the Illinois farmer, who never wore, nor ever\nexpects to wear, a single yard of British goods in his whole\nlife. Another of their reasons is that by the passage and\ncontinuance of Mr. Clay\u2019s bill, we prevent the passage of a\nbill which would give us more. This, if it were sound in\n itself, is waging destructive war with the former position;\nfor if Mr. Clay\u2019s bill impoverishes the treasury too much,\nwhat shall be said of one that impoverishes it still more?\nBut it is not sound in itself. It is not true that Mr. Clay\u2019s bill\nprevents the passage of one more favorable to us of the\nnew States. Considering the strength and opposite interest\nof the old States, the wonder is that they ever permitted\none to pass so favorable as Mr. Clay\u2019s. The last twenty-odd\nyears\u2019 e\ufb00orts to reduce the price of the lands, and to pass\ngraduation bills and cession bills, prove the assertion to be\ntrue; and if there were no experience in support of it, the\nreason itself is plain. The States in which none, or few, of\nthe public lands lie, and those consequently interested\nagainst parting with them except for the best price, are the\nmajority; and a moment\u2019s re\ufb02ection will show that they\nmust ever continue the majority, because by the time one of\nthe original new States (Ohio, for example) becomes\npopulous and gets weight in Congress, the public lands in\nher limits are so nearly sold out that in every point material\nto this question she becomes an old State. She does not\nwish the price reduced, because there is none left for her\ncitizens to buy; she does not wish them ceded to the States\nin which they lie, because they no longer lie in her limits,\nand she will get nothing by the cession. In the nature of\nthings, the States interested in the reduction of price, in\ngraduation, in cession, and in all similar projects, never can\nbe the majority. Nor is there reason to hope that any of\nthem can ever succeed as a Democratic party measure,\nbecause we have heretofore seen that party in full power,\n year after year, with many of their leaders making loud\nprofessions in favor of these projects, and yet doing\nnothing. What reason, then, is there to believe they will\nhereafter do better? In every light in which we can view\nthis question, it amounts simply to this: Shall we accept our\nshare of the proceeds under Mr. Clay\u2019s bill, or shall we\nrather reject that and get nothing?\nThe \ufb01fth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate\nfor Congress be run in every district, regardless of the\nchances of success. We are aware that it is sometimes a\ntemporary grati\ufb01cation, when a friend cannot succeed, to\nbe able to choose between opponents; but we believe that\nthat grati\ufb01cation is the seed-time which never fails to be\nfollowed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness. By this\npolicy we entangle ourselves. By voting for our opponents,\nsuch of us as do it in some measure estop ourselves to\ncomplain of their acts, however glaringly wrong we may\nbelieve them to be. By this policy no one portion of our\nfriends can ever be certain as to what course another\nportion may adopt; and by this want of mutual and perfect\nunderstanding our political identity is partially frittered\naway and lost. And, again, those who are thus elected by\nour aid ever become our bitterest persecutors. Take a few\nprominent examples. In  Reynolds was elected\nGovernor; in  we exerted our whole strength to elect\nJudge Young to the United States Senate, which e\ufb00ort,\nthough failing, gave him the prominence that subsequently\nelected him; in  General Ewing, was so elected to the\nUnited States Senate; and yet let us ask what three men\n have been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults\nupon all our men and measures than they? During the last\nsummer the whole State was covered with pamphlet\neditions of misrepresentations against us, methodized into\nchapters and verses, written by two of these same men, \u2014\nReynolds and Young, in which they did not stop at charging\nus with error merely, but roundly denounced us as the\ndesigning enemies of human liberty, itself. If it be the will of\nHeaven that such men shall politically live, be it so; but\nnever, never again permit them to draw a particle of their\nsustenance from us.\nThe sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the\nconvention system for the nomination of candidates. This\nwe believe to be of the very \ufb01rst importance. Whether the\nsystem is right in itself we do not stop to inquire;\ncontenting ourselves with trying to show that, while our\nopponents use it, it is madness in us not to defend\nourselves with it. Experience has shown that we cannot\nsuccessfully defend ourselves without it. For examples, look\nat the elections of last year. Our candidate for governor,\nwith the approbation of a large portion of the party, took\nthe \ufb01eld without a nomination, and in open opposition to\nthe system. Wherever in the counties the Whigs had held\nconventions and nominated candidates for the Legislature,\nthe aspirants who were not nominated were induced to\nrebel against the nominations, and to become candidates,\nas is said, \u201con their own hook.\u201d And, go where you would\ninto a large Whig county, you were sure to \ufb01nd the Whigs\nnot contending shoulder to shoulder against the common\n enemy, but divided into factions, and \ufb01ghting furiously with\none another. The election came, and what was the result?\nThe governor beaten, the Whig vote being decreased many\nthousands since , although the Democratic vote had\nnot increased any. Beaten almost everywhere for members\nof the Legislature, \u2014 Tazewell, with her four hundred Whig\nmajority, sending a delegation half Democratic; Vermillion,\nwith her \ufb01ve hundred, doing the same; Coles, with her four\nhundred, sending two out of three; and Morgan, with her\ntwo hundred and \ufb01fty, sending three out of four, \u2014 and this\nto say nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples;\nthe whole winding up with the aggregate number of\ntwenty-seven Democratic representatives sent from Whig\ncounties. As to the senators, too, the result was of the same\ncharacter. And it is most worthy to be remembered that of\nall the Whigs in the State who ran against the regular\nnominees, a single one only was elected. Although they\nsucceeded in defeating the nominees almost by scores, they\ntoo were defeated, and the spoils chucklingly borne o\ufb00 by\nthe common enemy.\nWe do not mention the fact of many of the Whigs\nopposing the convention system heretofore for the purpose\nof censuring them. Far from it. We expressly protest\nagainst such a conclusion. We know they were generally,\nperhaps universally, as good and true Whigs as we\nourselves claim to be.\nWe mention it merely to draw attention to the disastrous\nresult it produced, as an example forever hereafter to be\navoided. That \u201cunion is strength\u201d is a truth that has been\n known, illustrated, and declared in various ways and forms\nin all ages of the world. That great fabulist and philosopher\nAesop illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks; and\nhe whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers has\ndeclared that \u201ca house divided against itself cannot stand.\u201d\nIt is to induce our friends to act upon this important and\nuniversally acknowledged truth that we urge the adoption\nof the convention system. Re\ufb02ection will prove that there is\nno other way of practically applying it. In its application we\nknow there will be incidents temporarily painful; but, after\nall, those incidents will be fewer and less intense with than\nwithout the system. If two friends aspire to the same o\ufb00ice\nit is certain that both cannot succeed. Would it not, then, be\nmuch less painful to have the question decided by mutual\nfriends some time before, than to snarl and quarrel until\nthe day of election, and then both be beaten by the common\nenemy?\nBefore leaving this subject, we think proper to remark\nthat we do not understand the resolution as intended to\nrecommend the application of the convention system to the\nnomination of candidates for the small o\ufb00ices no way\nconnected with politics; though we must say we do not\nperceive that such an application of it would be wrong.\nThe seventh resolution recommends the holding of\ndistrict conventions in May next, for the purpose of\nnominating candidates for Congress. The propriety of this\nrests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth, and\ntherefore needs no further discussion.\n The eighth and ninth also relate merely to the practical\napplication of the foregoing, and therefore need no\ndiscussion.\nBefore closing, permit us to add a few re\ufb02ections on the\npresent condition and future prospects of the Whig party. In\nalmost all the States we have fallen into the minority, and\ndespondency seems to prevail universally among us. Is\nthere just cause for this? In  we carried the nation by\nmore than a hundred and forty thousand majority. Our\nopponents charged that we did it by fraudulent voting; but\nwhatever they may have believed, we know the charge to\nbe untrue. Where, now, is that mighty host? Have they gone\nover to the enemy? Let the results of the late elections\nanswer. Every State which has fallen o\ufb00 from the Whig\ncause since  has done so not by giving more\nDemocratic votes than they did then, but by giving fewer\nWhig. Bouck, who was elected Democratic Governor of\nNew York last fall by more than , majority, had not\nthen as many votes as he had in , when he was beaten\nby seven or eight thousand. And so has it been in all the\nother States which have fallen away from our cause. From\nthis it is evident that tens of thousands in the late elections\nhave not voted at all. Who and what are they? is an\nimportant question, as respects the future. They can come\nforward and give us the victory again. That all, or nearly\nall, of them are Whigs is most apparent. Our opponents,\nstung to madness by the defeat of , have ever since\nrallied with more than their usual unanimity. It has not\nbeen they that have been kept from the polls. These facts\n show what the result must be, once the people again rally\nin their entire strength. Proclaim these facts, and predict\nthis result; and although unthinking opponents may smile\nat us, the sagacious ones will \u201cbelieve and tremble.\u201d And\nwhy shall the Whigs not all rally again? Are their principles\nless dear now than in ? Have any of their doctrines\nsince then been discovered to be untrue? It is true, the\nvictory of  did not produce the happy results\nanticipated; but it is equally true, as we believe, that the\nunfortunate death of General Harrison was the cause of the\nfailure. It was not the election of General Harrison that was\nexpected to produce happy e\ufb00ects, but the measures to be\nadopted by his administration. By means of his death, and\nthe unexpected course of his successor, those measures\nwere never adopted. How could the fruits follow? The\nconsequences we always predicted would follow the failure\nof those measures have followed, and are now upon us in\nall their horrors. By the course of Mr. Tyler the policy of\nour opponents has continued in operation, still leaving\nthem with the advantage of charging all its evils upon us as\nthe results of a Whig administration. Let none be deceived\nby this somewhat plausible, though entirely false charge. If\nthey ask us for the su\ufb00icient and sound currency we\npromised, let them be answered that we only promised it\nthrough the medium of a national bank, which they, aided\nby Mr. Tyler, prevented our establishing. And let them be\nreminded, too, that their own policy in relation to the\ncurrency has all the time been, and still is, in full operation.\nLet us then again come forth in our might, and by a second\n victory accomplish that which death prevented in the \ufb01rst.\nWe can do it. When did the Whigs ever fail if they were fully\naroused and united? Even in single States, under such\ncircumstances, defeat seldom overtakes them. Call to mind\nthe contested elections within the last few years, and\nparticularly those of Moore and Letcher from Kentucky,\nNewland and Graham from North Carolina, and the famous\nNew Jersey case. In all these districts Locofocoism had\nstalked omnipotent before; but when the whole people\nwere aroused by its enormities on those occasions, they put\nit down, never to rise again.\nWe declare it to be our solemn conviction, that the Whigs\nare always a majority of this nation; and that to make them\nalways successful needs but to get them all to the polls and\nto vote unitedly. This is the great desideratum. Let us make\nevery e\ufb00ort to attain it. At every election, let every Whig\nact as though he knew the result to depend upon his action.\nIn the great contest of  some more than twenty one\nhundred thousand votes were cast, and so surely as there\nshall be that many, with the ordinary increase added, cast\nin  that surely will a Whig be elected President of the\nUnited States.\nA. LINCOLN. S. T. LOGAN. A. T. BLEDSOE.\nMarch , .\n  \n  \nH\n   \n   .\nSPRINGFIELD, March , .\nFRIEND BENNETT: Your letter of this day was handed\nme by Mr. Miles. It is too late now to e\ufb00ect the object you\ndesire. On yesterday morning the most of the Whig\nmembers from this district got together and agreed to hold\nthe convention at Tremont in Tazewell County. I am sorry to\nhear that any of the Whigs of your county, or indeed of any\ncounty, should longer be against conventions. On last\nWednesday evening a meeting of all the Whigs then here\nfrom all parts of the State was held, and the question of the\npropriety of conventions was brought up and fully\ndiscussed, and at the end of the discussion a resolution\nrecommending the system of conventions to all the Whigs\nof the State was unanimously adopted. Other resolutions\nwere also passed, all of which will appear in the next\nJournal. The meeting also appointed a committee to draft\nan address to the people of the State, which address will\nalso appear in the next journal.\nIn it you will \ufb01nd a brief argument in favor of\nconventions \u2014 and although I wrote it myself I will say to\nyou that it is conclusive upon the point and can not be\nreasonably answered. The right way for you to do is hold\nyour meeting and appoint delegates any how, and if there\n be any who will not take part, let it be so. The matter will\nwork so well this time that even they who now oppose will\ncome in next time.\nThe convention is to be held at Tremont on the th of\nApril and according to the rule we have adopted your\ncounty is to have delegates \u2014 being double your\nrepresentation.\nIf there be any good Whig who is disposed to stick out\nagainst conventions get him at least to read the arguement\nin their favor in the address.\nYours as ever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n H A  .     \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, March , .\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 We had a meeting of the Whigs of the\ncounty here on last Monday to appoint delegates to a\ndistrict convention; and Baker beat me, and got the\ndelegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite of\nmy attempt to decline it, appointed me one of the\ndelegates; so that in getting Baker the nomination I shall be\n\ufb01xed a good deal like a fellow who is made a groomsman to\na man that has cut him out and is marrying his own dear\n\u201cgal.\u201d About the prospects of your having a namesake at\nour town, can\u2019t say exactly yet.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \nA  I\n \n. \n  I .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., March , .\nFRIEND MORRIS: Your letter of the a  d, was received\non yesterday morning, and for which (instead of an excuse,\nwhich you thought proper to ask) I tender you my sincere\nthanks. It is truly gratifying to me to learn that, while the\npeople of Sangamon have cast me o\ufb00, my old friends of\nMenard, who have known me longest and best, stick to me.\nIt would astonish, if not amuse, the older citizens to learn\nthat I (a stranger, friendless, uneducated, penniless boy,\nworking on a \ufb02atboat at ten dollars per month) have been\nput down here as the candidate of pride, wealth, and\naristocratic family distinction. Yet so, chie\ufb02y, it was. There\nwas, too, the strangest combination of church in\ufb02uence\nagainst me. Baker is a Campbellite; and therefore, as I\nsuppose, with few exceptions got all that church. My wife\nhas some relations in the Presbyterian churches, and some\nwith the Episcopal churches; and therefore, wherever it\nwould tell, I was set down as either the one or the other,\nwhile it was everywhere contended that no Christian ought\nto go for me, because I belonged to no church, was\nsuspected of being a deist, and had talked about \ufb01ghting a\nduel. With all these things, Baker, of course, had nothing to\ndo. Nor do I complain of them. As to his own church going\n for him, I think that was right enough, and as to the\nin\ufb02uences I have spoken of in the other, though they were\nvery strong, it would be grossly untrue and unjust to\ncharge that they acted upon them in a body or were very\nnear so. I only mean that those in\ufb02uences levied a tax of a\nconsiderable per cent. upon my strength throughout the\nreligious controversy. But enough of this.\nYou say that in choosing a candidate for Congress you\nhave an equal right with Sangamon, and in this you are\nundoubtedly correct. In agreeing to withdraw if the Whigs\nof Sangamon should go against me, I did not mean that\nthey alone were worth consulting, but that if she, with her\nheavy delegation, should be against me, it would be\nimpossible for me to succeed, and therefore I had as well\ndecline. And in relation to Menard having rights, permit me\nfully to recognize them, and to express the opinion that, if\nshe and Mason act circumspectly, they will in the\nconvention be able so far to enforce their rights as to\ndecide absolutely which one of the candidates shall be\nsuccessful. Let me show the reason of this. Hardin, or some\nother Morgan candidate, will get Putnam, Marshall,\nWoodford, Tazewell, and Logan \u2014 making sixteen. Then you\nand Mason, having three, can give the victory to either\nside.\nYou say you shall instruct your delegates for me, unless I\nobject. I certainly shall not object. That would be too\npleasant a compliment for me to tread in the dust. And\nbesides, if anything should happen (which, however, is not\nprobable) by which Baker should be thrown out of the \ufb01ght,\n I would be at liberty to accept the nomination if I could get\nit. I do, however, feel myself bound not to hinder him in any\nway from getting the nomination. I should despise myself\nwere I to attempt it. I think, then, it would be proper for\nyour meeting to appoint three delegates and to instruct\nthem to go for some one as the \ufb01rst choice, some one else\nas a second, and perhaps some one as a third; and if in\nthose instructions I were named as the \ufb01rst choice, it would\ngratify me very much. If you wish to hold the balance of\npower, it is important for you to attend to and secure the\nvote of Mason also: You should be sure to have men\nappointed delegates that you know you can safely con\ufb01de\nin. If yourself and James Short were appointed from your\ncounty, all would be safe; but whether Jim\u2019s woman a\ufb00air a\nyear ago might not be in the way of his appointment is a\nquestion. I don\u2019t know whether you know it, but I know him\nto be as honorable a man as there is in the world. You have\nmy permission, and even request, to show this letter to\nShort; but to no one else, unless it be a very particular\nfriend who you know will not speak of it.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\nP. S Will you write me again?\n  \n \nA  I\n \n. \n  I .\nApril , .\nFRIEND MORRIS: I have heard it intimated that Baker\nhas been attempting to get you or Miles, or both of you, to\nviolate the instructions of the meeting that appointed you,\nand to go for him. I have insisted, and still insist, that this\ncannot be true. Surely Baker would not do the like. As well\nmight Hardin ask me to vote for him in the convention.\nAgain, it is said there will be an attempt to get up\ninstructions in your county requiring you to go for Baker.\nThis is all wrong. Upon the same rule, Why might not I \ufb02y\nfrom the decision against me in Sangamon, and get up\ninstructions to their delegates to go for me? There are at\nleast twelve hundred Whigs in the county that took no part,\nand yet I would as soon put my head in the \ufb01re as to\nattempt it. Besides, if any one should get the nomination by\nsuch extraordinary means, all harmony in the district would\ninevitably be lost. Honest Whigs (and very nearly all of\nthem are honest) would not quietly abide such enormities. I\nrepeat, such an attempt on Baker\u2019s part cannot be true.\nWrite me at Spring\ufb01eld how the matter is. Don\u2019t show or\nspeak of this letter.\nA. LINCOLN\n  \n \n \n.  .  . HA \nI\n.\nSPRINGFIELD, May , .\nFRIEND HARDIN: Butler informs me that he received a\nletter from you, in which you expressed some doubt\nwhether the Whigs of Sangamon will support you cordially.\nYou may, at once, dismiss all fears on that subject. We have\nalready resolved to make a particular e\ufb00ort to give you the\nvery largest majority possible in our county. From this, no\nWhig of the county dissents. We have many objects for\ndoing it. We make it a matter of honor and pride to do it;\nwe do it because we love the Whig cause; we do it because\nwe like you personally; and last, we wish to convince you\nthat we do not bear that hatred to Morgan County that you\npeople have so long seemed to imagine. You will see by the\njournals of this week that we propose, upon pain of losing a\nbarbecue, to give you twice as great a majority in this\ncounty as you shall receive in your own.

To remain as I am is impossible. I must\ndie or be better, as it appears to me.... I fear I shall be\nunable to attend any business here, and a change of scene\nmight help me. If I could be myself, I would rather remain\nat home with Judge Logan. I can write no more.\n   \nA    I\n  H  I  I\nI    \nI  A \n  .\nJanuary , \nIN THE HOUSE of Representatives January , , while\ndiscussing the continuation of the Illinois and Michigan\nCanal, Mr. Moore was afraid the holders of the \u201cscrip\u201d\nwould lose.\nMr. Napier thought there was no danger of that; and Mr.\nLincoln said he had not examined to see what amount of\nscrip would probably be needed. The principal point in his\nmind was this, that nobody was obliged to take these\ncerti\ufb01cates. It is altogether voluntary on their part, and if\nthey apprehend it will fall in their hands they will not take\nit. Further the loss, if any there be, will fall on the citizens\nof that section of the country.\nThis scrip is not going to circulate over an extensive\nrange of country, but will be con\ufb01ned chie\ufb02y to the vicinity\nof the canal. Now, we \ufb01nd the representatives of that\nsection of the country are all in favor of the bill.\nWhen we propose to protect their interests, they say to\nus: Leave us to take care of ourselves; we are willing to run\nthe risk. And this is reasonable; we must suppose they are\ncompetent to protect their own interests, and it is only fair\nto let them do it.\n  I  \n A    \n \nHI\n  \nI    .\nFebruary , .\nAPPEAL TO THE People of the State of Illinois.\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 When the General Assembly, now\nabout adjourning, assembled in November last, from the\nbankrupt state of the public treasury, the pecuniary\nembarrassments prevailing in every department of society,\nthe dilapidated state of the public works, and the\nimpending danger of the degradation of the State, you had\na right to expect that your representatives would lose no\ntime in devising and adopting measures to avert threatened\ncalamities, alleviate the distresses of the people, and allay\nthe fearful apprehensions in regard to the future prosperity\nof the State. It was not expected by you that the spirit of\nparty would take the lead in the councils of the State, and\nmake every interest bend to its demands. Nor was it\nexpected that any party would assume to itself the entire\ncontrol of legislation, and convert the means and o\ufb00ices of\nthe State, and the substance of the people, into aliment for\nparty subsistence. Neither could it have been expected by\nyou that party spirit, however strong its desires and\nunreasonable \nits \ndemands, \nwould \nhave \npassed \nthe\nsanctuary of the Constitution, and entered with its\n unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the\njudiciary system.\nAt the early period of the session, measures were\nadopted by the dominant party to take possession of the\nState, to \ufb01ll all public o\ufb00ices with party men, and make\nevery measure a\ufb00ecting the interests of the people and the\ncredit of the State operate in furtherance of their party\nviews. The merits of men and measures therefore became\nthe subject of discussion in caucus, instead of the halls of\nlegislation, and decisions there made by a minority of the\nLegislature have been executed and carried into e\ufb00ect by\nthe force of party discipline, without any regard whatever\nto the rights of the people or the interests of the State. The\nSupreme Court of the State was organized, and judges\nappointed, according to the provisions of the Constitution,\nin . The people have never complained of the\norganization of that court; no attempt has ever before been\nmade to change that department. Respect for public\nopinion, and regard for the rights and liberties of the\npeople, have hitherto restrained the spirit of party from\nattacks upon the independence and integrity of the\njudiciary. The same judges have continued in o\ufb00ice since\n; their decisions have not been the subject of\ncomplaint among the people; the integrity and honesty of\nthe court have not been questioned, and it has never been\nsupposed that the court has ever permitted party prejudice\nor party considerations to operate upon their decisions. The\ncourt was made to consist of four judges, and by the\nConstitution two form a quorum for the transaction of\n business. With this tribunal, thus constituted, the people\nhave been satis\ufb01ed for near sixteen years. The same law\nwhich \norganized \nthe \nSupreme \nCourt \nin \n \nalso\nestablished and organized circuit courts to be held in each\ncounty in the State, and \ufb01ve circuit judges were appointed\nto hold those courts. In  the Legislature abolished\nthese circuit courts, repealed the judges out of o\ufb00ice, and\nrequired the judges of the Supreme Court to hold the\ncircuit courts. The reasons assigned for this change were,\n\ufb01rst, that the business of the country could be better\nattended to by the four judges of the Supreme Court than\nby the two sets of judges; and, second, the state of the\npublic treasury forbade the employment of unnecessary\no\ufb00icers. In  a circuit was established north of the\nIllinois River, in order to meet the wants of the people, and\na circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that\ncircuit.\nIn  the circuit-court system was again established\nthroughout the State, circuit judges appointed to hold the\ncourts, and the judges of the Supreme Court were relieved\nfrom the performance of circuit court duties. The change\nwas recommended by the then acting governor of the State,\nGeneral W. L. D. Ewing, in the following terms: \u201cThe\naugmented population of the State, the multiplied number\nof organized counties, as well as the increase of business in\nall, has long since convinced every one conversant with this\ndepartment of our government of the indispensable\nnecessity of an alteration in our judiciary system, and the\nsubject is therefore recommended to the earnest patriotic\n consideration of the Legislature. The present system has\nnever been exempt from serious and weighty objections.\nThe idea of appealing from the circuit court to the same\njudges in the Supreme Court is recommended by little\nhopes of redress to the injured party below. The duties of\nthe circuit, too, it may be added, consume one half of the\nyear, leaving a small and inadequate portion of time (when\nthat required for domestic purposes is deducted) to erect,\nin the decisions of the Supreme Court, a judicial monument\nof legal learning and research, which the talent and ability\nof the court might otherwise be entirely competent to.\u201d\nWith this organization of circuit courts the people have\nnever complained. The only complaints which we have\nheard have come from circuits which were so large that the\njudges could not dispose of the business, and the circuits in\nwhich Judges Pearson and Ralston lately presided.\nWhilst the honor and credit of the State demanded\nlegislation upon the subject of the public debt, the canal,\nthe un\ufb01nished public works, and the embarrassments of\nthe people, the judiciary stood upon a basis which required\nno change \u2014 no legislative action. Yet the party in power,\nneglecting every interest requiring legislative action, and\nwholly disregarding the rights, wishes, and interests of the\npeople, has, for the unholy purpose of providing places for\nits partisans and supplying them with large salaries,\ndisorganized that department of the government. Provision\nis made for the election of \ufb01ve party judges of the Supreme\nCourt, the proscription of four circuit judges, and the\nappointment of party clerks in more than half the counties\n of the State. Men professing respect for public opinion, and\nacknowledged to be leaders of the party, have avowed in\nthe halls of legislation that the change in the judiciary was\nintended to produce political results favorable to their\nparty and party friends. The immutable principles of justice\nare to make way for party interests, and the bonds of social\norder are to be rent in twain, in order that a desperate\nfaction may be sustained at the expense of the people. The\nchange proposed in the judiciary was supported upon\ngrounds so destructive to the institutions of the country,\nand so entirely at war with the rights and liberties of the\npeople, that the party could not secure entire unanimity in\nits support, three Democrats of the Senate and \ufb01ve of the\nHouse voting against the measure. They were unwilling to\nsee the temples of justice and the seats of independent\njudges occupied by the tools of faction. The declarations of\nthe party leaders, the selection of party men for judges, and\nthe total disregard for the public will in the adoption of the\nmeasure, prove conclusively that the object has been not\nreform, but destruction; not the advancement of the\nhighest interests of the State, but the predominance of\nparty.\nWe cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the\nobjections to this party measure; we present you with those\nstated by the Council of Revision upon returning the bill,\nand we ask for them a candid consideration.\nBelieving that the independence of the judiciary has been\ndestroyed, that hereafter our courts will be independent of\nthe people, and entirely dependent upon the Legislature;\n that our rights of property and liberty of conscience can no\nlonger be regarded as safe from the encroachments of\nunconstitutional legislation; and knowing of no other\nremedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace\nand good order of society, we call upon you to avail\nyourselves of the opportunity a\ufb00orded, and, at the next\ngeneral election, vote for a convention of the people.\nS.

It would\ntake a quire of paper to give you anything like a full\naccount of it, and I therefore only propose a brief outline.\nThe chief personages in the drama are Archibald Fisher,\nsupposed to be murdered, and Archibald Trailor, Henry\nTrailor, and William Trailor, supposed to have murdered\nhim. The three Trailors are brothers: the \ufb01rst, Arch., as you\nknow, lives in town; the second, Henry, in Clary\u2019s Grove;\nand the third, William, in Warren County; and Fisher, the\nsupposed murdered, being without a family, had made his\nhome with William. On Saturday evening, being the th of\nMay, Fisher and William came to Henry\u2019s in a one-horse\ndearborn, and there stayed over Sunday; and on Monday all\nthree came to Spring\ufb01eld (Henry on horseback) and joined\nArchibald at Myers\u2019s, the Dutch carpenter. That evening at\nsupper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some\nine\ufb00ectual search was made for him; and on Tuesday, at\none o\u2019clock P.M., William and Henry started home without\n him. In a day or two Henry and one or two of his Clary-\nGrove neighbors came back for him again, and advertised\nhis disappearance in the papers. The knowledge of the\nmatter thus far had not been general, and here it dropped\nentirely, till about the th instant, when Keys received a\nletter from the postmaster in Warren County, that William\nhad arrived at home, and was telling a very mysterious and\nimprobable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which\ninduced the community there to suppose he had been\ndisposed of unfairly. Keys made this letter public, which\nimmediately set the whole town and adjoining county agog.\nAnd so it has continued until yesterday. The mass of the\npeople commenced a systematic search for the dead body,\nwhile Wickersham was despatched to arrest Henry Trailor\nat the Grove, and Jim Maxcy to Warren to arrest William.\nOn Monday last, Henry was brought in, and showed an\nevident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be\ndead, and that Arch. and William had killed him. He said he\nguessed the body could be found in Spring Creek, between\nthe Beardstown road and Hickox\u2019s mill. Away the people\nswept like a herd of bu\ufb00alo, and cut down Hickox\u2019s mill-\ndam nolens volens, to draw the water out of the pond, and\nthen went up and down and down and up the creek, \ufb01shing\nand raking, and raking and ducking and diving for two\ndays, and, after all, no dead body found.\nIn the meantime a sort of scu\ufb04ing-ground had been\nfound in the brush in the angle, or point, where the road\nleading into the woods past the brewery and the one\nleading in past the brick-yard meet. From the scu\ufb04e-\n ground was the sign of something about the size of a man\nhaving been dragged to the edge of the thicket, where it\njoined the track of some small-wheeled carriage drawn by\none horse, as shown by the road-tracks. The carriage-track\nled o\ufb00 toward Spring Creek. Near this drag-trail Dr.\nMerryman found two hairs, which, after a long scienti\ufb01c\nexamination, he pronounced to be triangular human hairs,\nwhich term, he says, includes within it the whiskers, the\nhair growing under the arms and on other parts of the\nbody; and he judged that these two were of the whiskers,\nbecause the ends were cut, showing that they had\n\ufb02ourished in the neighborhood of the razor\u2019s operations.\nOn Thursday last Jim Maxcy brought in William Trailor\nfrom Warren. On the same day Arch. was arrested and put\nin jail. Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his\nexamining trial before May and Lovely. Archibald and\nHenry were both present. Lamborn prosecuted, and Logan,\nBaker, and your humble servant defended. A great many\nwitnesses were introduced and examined, but I shall only\nmention those whose testimony seemed most important.\nThe \ufb01rst of these was Captain Ransdell. He swore that\nwhen William and Henry left Spring\ufb01eld for home on\nTuesday before mentioned they did not take the direct\nroute, \u2014 which, you know, leads by the butcher shop, \u2014 but\nthat they followed the street north until they got opposite,\nor nearly opposite, May\u2019s new house, after which he could\nnot see them from where he stood; and it was afterwards\nproved that in about an hour after they started, they came\ninto the street by the butcher shop from toward the\n brickyard. Dr. Merryman and others swore to what is stated\nabout the scu\ufb04e-ground, drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage\ntracks. Henry was then introduced by the prosecution. He\nswore that when they started for home they went out north,\nas Ransdell stated, and turned down west by the brick-yard\ninto the woods, and there met Archibald; that they\nproceeded a small distance farther, when he was placed as\na sentinel to watch for and announce the approach of any\none that might happen that way; that William and Arch.\ntook the dearborn out of the road a small distance to the\nedge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw them\nlift the body of a man into it; that they then moved o\ufb00 with\nthe carriage in the direction of Hickox\u2019s mill, and he\nloitered about for something like an hour, when William\nreturned with the carriage, but without Arch., and said they\nhad put him in a safe place; that they went somehow he did\nnot know exactly how \u2014 into the road close to the brewery,\nand proceeded on to Clary\u2019s Grove. He also stated that\nsome time during the day William told him that he and\nArch. had killed Fisher the evening before; that the way\nthey did it was by him William knocking him down with a\nclub, and Arch. then choking him to death.\nAn old man from Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then\nintroduced on the part of the defense. He swore that he had\nknown Fisher for several years; that Fisher had resided at\nhis house a long time at each of two di\ufb00erent spells \u2014 once\nwhile he built a barn for him, and once while he was\ndoctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years\nago Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of\n a gun, since which he had been subject to continued bad\nhealth and occasional aberration of mind. He also stated\nthat on last Tuesday, being the same day that Maxcy\narrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home in\nthe early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven\no\u2019clock, found Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently\nvery unwell; that he asked him how he came from\nSpring\ufb01eld; that Fisher said he had come by Peoria, and\nalso told of several other places he had been at more in the\ndirection of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of\nspeaking did not know where he had been wandering about\nin a state of derangement. He further stated that in about\ntwo hours he received a note from one of Trailor\u2019s friends,\nadvising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go on to\nSpring\ufb01eld as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher\u2019s\nhealth in former times; that he immediately set o\ufb00, calling\nup two of his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening\nand all night, overtook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in\nFulton County; that Maxcy refusing to discharge Trailor\nupon his statement, his two neighbors returned and he\ncame on to Spring\ufb01eld. Some question being made as to\nwhether the doctor\u2019s story was not a fabrication, several\nacquaintances of his (among whom was the same\npostmaster who wrote Keys, as before mentioned) were\nintroduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they\nknew the doctor to be of good character for truth and\nveracity, and generally of good character in every way.\nHere the testimony ended, and the Trailors were\ndischarged, Arch. and William expressing both in word and\n manner their entire con\ufb01dence that Fisher would be found\nalive at the doctor\u2019s by Galloway, Mallory, and Myers, who a\nday before had been despatched for that purpose; which\nHenry still protested that no power on earth could ever\nshow Fisher alive. Thus stands this curious a\ufb00air. When the\ndoctor\u2019s story was \ufb01rst made public, it was amusing to scan\nand contemplate the countenances and hear the remarks of\nthose who had been actively in search for the dead body:\nsome looked quizzical, some melancholy, and some\nfuriously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he\nalways knew the man was not dead, and that he had not\nstirred an inch to hunt for him; Langford, who had taken\nthe lead in cutting down Hickox\u2019s mill-dam, and wanted to\nhang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully woebegone:\nhe seemed the \u201cvictim of unrequited a\ufb00ection,\u201d as\nrepresented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over;\nand Hart, the little drayman that hauled Molly home once,\nsaid it was too damned bad to have so much trouble, and no\nhanging after all.\nI commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I\nreceived yours of the th. I stick to my promise to come to\nLouisville. Nothing new here except what I have written. I\nhave not seen since my last trip, and I am going out there\nas soon as I mail this letter.\nYours forever, LINCOLN.\n   A  \n \n  A \n  HA    \nI  \n.\nJune , \nIT HAVING BEEN charged in some of the public prints that\nHarry Wilton, late United States marshal for the district of\nIllinois, had used his o\ufb00ice for political e\ufb00ect, in the\nappointment of deputies for the taking of the census for the\nyear , we, the undersigned, were called upon by Mr.\nWilton to examine the papers in his possession relative to\nthese appointments, and to ascertain therefrom the\ncorrectness \nor \nincorrectness \nof \nsuch \ncharge. \nWe\naccompanied Mr. Wilton to a room, and examined the\nmatter as fully as we could with the means a\ufb00orded us. The\nonly sources of information bearing on the subject which\nwere submitted to us were the letters, etc., recommending\nand opposing the various appointments made, and Mr.\nWilton\u2019s verbal statements concerning the same. From\nthese letters, etc., it appears that in some instances\nappointments \nwere \nmade \nin \naccordance \nwith \nthe\nrecommendations of leading Whigs, and in opposition to\nthose of leading Democrats; among which instances the\nappointments at Scott, Wayne, Madison, and Lawrence are\nthe strongest. According to Mr. Wilton\u2019s statement of the\nseventy-six appointments we examined, \ufb01fty-four were of\n Democrats, eleven of Whigs, and eleven of unknown\npolitics.\nThe chief ground of complaint against Mr. Wilton, as we\nhad understood it, was because of his appointment of so\nmany Democratic candidates for the Legislature, thus\ngiving them a decided advantage over their Whig\nopponents; and consequently our attention was directed\nrather particularly to that point. We found that there were\nmany such appointments, among which were those in\nTazewell, \nMcLean, \nIroquois, \nColes, \nMenard, \nWayne,\nWashington, Fayette, etc.; and we did not learn that there\nwas one instance in which a Whig candidate for the\nLegislature had been appointed. There was no written\nevidence before us showing us at what time those\nappointments were made; but Mr. Wilton stated that they\nall with one exception were made before those appointed\nbecame candidates for the Legislature, and the letters, etc.,\nrecommending them all bear date before, and most of them\nlong before, those appointed were publicly announced\ncandidates.\nWe give the foregoing naked facts and draw no\nconclusions from them.\nBEND. S. EDWARDS, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \nI   \nA       \n \n   A  I A    A   \nBLOOMINGTON, ILL., September , .\nMISS MARY SPEED, Louisville, Ky.\nMY FRIEND: By the way, a \ufb01ne example was presented\non board the boat for contemplating the e\ufb00ect of condition\nupon human happiness. A gentleman had purchased twelve\nnegroes in di\ufb00erent parts of Kentucky, and was taking them\nto a farm in the South. They were chained six and six\ntogether. A small iron clevis was around the left wrist of\neach, and this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one,\nat a convenient distance from the others, so that the\nnegroes were strung together precisely like so many \ufb01sh\nupon a trotline. In this condition they were being separated\nforever from the scenes of their childhood, their friends,\ntheir fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, and\nmany of them from their wives and children, and going into\nperpetual slavery where the lash of the master is\nproverbially more ruthless and unrelenting than any other;\nand yet amid all these distressing circumstances, as we\nwould think them, they were the most cheerful and\napparently happy creatures on board. One, whose o\ufb00ence\nfor which he had been sold was an overfondness for his\nwife, played the \ufb01ddle almost continually, and the others\ndanced, sang, cracked jokes, and played various games\n with cards from day to day. How true it is that \u2018God\ntempers the wind to the shorn lamb,\u2019 or in other words,\nthat he renders the worst of human conditions tolerable,\nwhile he permits the best to be nothing better than\ntolerable. To return to the narrative: When we reached\nSpring\ufb01eld I stayed but one day, when I started on this\ntedious circuit where I now am. Do you remember my going\nto the city, while I was in Kentucky, to have a tooth\nextracted, and making a failure of it? Well, that same old\ntooth got to paining me so much that about a week since I\nhad it torn out, bringing with it a bit of the jawbone, the\nconsequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that\nI can neither talk nor eat.\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n  \n  \n H A  .     \n \n \n \nA  IA\nJanuary , .\nMY DEAR SPEED: \u2014 Feeling, as you know I do, the\ndeepest solicitude for the success of the enterprise you are\nengaged in, I adopt this as the last method I can adopt to\naid you, in case (which God forbid!) you shall need any aid.\nI do not place what I am going to say on paper because I\ncan say it better that way than I could by word of mouth,\nbut, were I to say it orally before we part, most likely you\nwould forget it at the very time when it might do you some\ngood. As I think it reasonable that you will feel very badly\nsome time between this and the \ufb01nal consummation of your\npurpose, it is intended that you shall read this just at such a\ntime. Why I say it is reasonable that you will feel very badly\nyet, is because of three special causes added to the general\none which I shall mention.\nThe general cause is, that you are naturally of a nervous\ntemperament; and this I say from what I have seen of you\npersonally, and what you have told me concerning your\nmother at various times, and concerning your brother\nWilliam at the time his wife died. The \ufb01rst special cause is\nyour exposure to bad weather on your journey, which my\nexperience clearly proves to be very severe on defective\nnerves. The second is the absence of all business and\n conversation of friends, which might divert your mind, give\nit occasional rest from the intensity of thought which will\nsometimes wear the sweetest idea threadbare and turn it to\nthe bitterness of death. The third is the rapid and near\napproach of that crisis on which all your thoughts and\nfeelings concentrate.\nIf from all these causes you shall escape and go through\ntriumphantly, without another \u201ctwinge of the soul,\u201d I shall\nbe most happily but most egregiously deceived. If, on the\ncontrary, you shall, as I expect you will at sometime, be\nagonized and distressed, let me, who have some reason to\nspeak with judgment on such a subject, beseech you to\nascribe it to the causes I have mentioned, and not to some\nfalse and ruinous suggestion of the Devil.\n\u201cBut,\u201d you will say, \u201cdo not your causes apply to every\none engaged in a like undertaking?\u201d By no means. The\nparticular causes, to a greater or less extent, perhaps do\napply in all cases; but the general one, \u2014 nervous debility,\nwhich is the key and conductor of all the particular ones,\nand without which they would be utterly harmless, \u2014\nthough it does pertain to you, does not pertain to one in a\nthousand. It is out of this that the painful di\ufb00erence\nbetween you and the mass of the world springs.\nI know what the painful point with you is at all times\nwhen you are unhappy; it is an apprehension that you do\nnot love her as you should. What nonsense! How came you\nto court her? Was it because you thought she deserved it,\nand that you had given her reason to expect it? If it was for\nthat why did not the same reason make you court Ann\n Todd, and at least twenty others of whom you can think,\nand to whom it would apply with greater force than to her?\nDid you court her for her wealth? Why, you know she had\nnone. But you say you reasoned yourself into it. What do\nyou mean by that? Was it not that you found yourself\nunable to reason yourself out of it? Did you not think, and\npartly form the purpose, of courting her the \ufb01rst time you\never saw her or heard of her? What had reason to do with it\nat that early stage? There was nothing at that time for\nreason to work upon. Whether she was moral, amiable,\nsensible, or even of good character, you did not, nor could\nthen know, except, perhaps, you might infer the last from\nthe company you found her in.\nAll you then did or could know of her was her personal\nappearance and deportment; and these, if they impress at\nall, impress the heart, and not the head.\nSay candidly, were not those heavenly black eyes the\nwhole basis of all your early reasoning on the subject? After\nyou and I had once been at the residence, did you not go\nand take me all the way to Lexington and back, for no other\npurpose but to get to see her again, on our return on that\nevening to take a trip for that express object? What earthly\nconsideration would you take to \ufb01nd her scouting and\ndespising you, and giving herself up to another? But of this\nyou have no apprehension; and therefore you cannot bring\nit home to your feelings.\nI shall be so anxious about you that I shall want you to\nwrite by every mail.\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\n  \n  \n H A  .     \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, February , .\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 Your letter of the th January came to\nhand to-day. You well know that I do not feel my own\nsorrows much more keenly than I do yours, when I know of\nthem; and yet I assure you I was not much hurt by what you\nwrote me of your excessively bad feeling at the time you\nwrote. Not that I am less capable of sympathizing with you\nnow than ever, not that I am less your friend than ever, but\nbecause I hope and believe that your present anxiety and\ndistress about her health and her life must and will forever\nbanish those horrid doubts which I know you sometimes\nfelt as to the truth of your a\ufb00ection for her. If they can once\nand forever be removed (and I almost feel a presentiment\nthat the Almighty has sent your present a\ufb04iction expressly\nfor that object), surely nothing can come in their stead to\n\ufb01ll their immeasurable measure of misery. The death-\nscenes of those we love are surely painful enough; but\nthese we are prepared for and expect to see: they happen\nto all, and all know they must happen. Painful as they are,\nthey are not an unlooked for sorrow. Should she, as you\nfear, be destined to an early grave, it is indeed a great\nconsolation to know that she is so well prepared to meet it.\nHer religion, which you once disliked so much, I will\n venture you now prize most highly. But I hope your\nmelancholy bodings as to her early death are not well\nfounded. I even hope that ere this reaches you she will have\nreturned with improved and still improving health, and that\nyou will have met her, and forgotten the sorrows of the past\nin the enjoyments of the present. I would say more if I\ncould, but it seems that I have said enough. It really\nappears to me that you yourself ought to rejoice, and not\nsorrow, at this indubitable evidence of your undying\na\ufb00ection for her. Why, Speed, if you did not love her\nalthough you might not wish her death, you would most\ncertainly be resigned to it. Perhaps this point is no longer a\nquestion with you, and my pertinacious dwelling upon it is\na rude intrusion upon your feelings. If so, you must pardon\nme. You know the hell I have su\ufb00ered on that point, and\nhow tender I am upon it. You know I do not mean wrong. I\nhave been quite clear of \u201chypo\u201d since you left, even better\nthan I was along in the fall. I have seen but once. She\nseemed very cheerful, and so I said nothing to her about\nwhat we spoke of.\nOld Uncle Billy Herndon is dead, and it is said this\nevening that Uncle Ben Ferguson will not live. This, I\nbelieve, is all the news, and enough at that unless it were\nbetter. Write me immediately on the receipt of this.\nYour friend, as ever, LINCOLN.\n  \n  \n H A  .     \n \n \n \n      I\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, February , .\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 Yours of the st instant came to hand\nthree or four days ago. When this shall reach you, you will\nhave been Fanny\u2019s husband several days. You know my\ndesire to befriend you is everlasting; that I will never cease\nwhile I know how to do anything. But you will always\nhereafter be on ground that I have never occupied, and\nconsequently, if advice were needed, I might advise wrong.\nI do fondly hope, however, that you will never again need\nany comfort from abroad. But should I be mistaken in this,\nshould excessive pleasure still be accompanied with a\npainful counterpart at times, still let me urge you, as I have\never done, to remember, in the depth and even agony of\ndespondency, that very shortly you are to feel well again. I\nam now fully convinced that you love her as ardently as you\nare capable of loving. Your ever being happy in her\npresence, and your intense anxiety about her health, if\nthere were nothing else, would place this beyond all\ndispute in my mind. I incline to think it probable that your\nnerves will fail you occasionally for a while; but once you\nget them \ufb01rmly guarded now that trouble is over forever. I\nthink, if I were you, in case my mind were not exactly right,\nI would avoid being idle. I would immediately engage in\n some business, or go to making preparations for it, which\nwould be the same thing. If you went through the ceremony\ncalmly, or even with su\ufb00icient composure not to excite\nalarm in any present, you are safe beyond question, and in\ntwo or three months, to say the most, will be the happiest\nof men.\nI would desire you to give my particular respects to\nFanny; but perhaps you will not wish her to know you have\nreceived this, lest she should desire to see it. Make her\nwrite me an answer to my last letter to her; at any rate I\nwould set great value upon a note or letter from her. Write\nme whenever you have leisure. Yours forever, A. LINCOLN.\nP. S. \u2014 I have been quite a man since you left.\n  \n \n.  .  H     .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Feb. , .\nG. B. SHELEDY, ESQ.:\nYours of the th is duly received. Judge Logan and\nmyself are doing business together now, and we are willing\nto attend to your cases as you propose. As to the terms, we\nare willing to attend each case you prepare and send us for\n  (when there shall be no opposition) to be sent in\nadvance, or you to know that it is safe. It takes  . of\ncost to start upon, that is,  . to clerk, and   to each of\ntwo publishers of papers. Judge Logan thinks it will take\nthe balance of   to carry a case through. This must be\nadvanced from time to time as the services are performed,\nas the o\ufb00icers will not act without. I do not know whether\nyou can be admitted an attorney of the Federal court in\nyour absence or not; nor is it material, as the business can\nbe done in our names.\nThinking it may aid you a little, I send you one of our\nblank forms of Petitions. It, you will see, is framed to be\nsworn to before the Federal court clerk, and, in your cases,\nwill have [to] be so far changed as to be sworn to before\nthe clerk of your circuit court; and his certi\ufb01cate must be\naccompanied with his o\ufb00icial seal. The schedules, too, must\nbe attended to. Be sure that they contain the creditors\u2019\n names, their residences, the amounts due each, the\ndebtors\u2019 names, their residences, and the amounts they\nowe, also all property and where located.\nAlso be sure that the schedules are all signed by the\napplicants as well as the Petition. Publication will have to\nbe made here in one paper, and in one nearest the\nresidence of the applicant. Write us in each case where the\nlast advertisement is to be sent, whether to you or to what\npaper.\nI believe I have now said everything that can be of any\nadvantage. Your friend as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n \n   .  I      \n A\n I    \n  \n H\nFebruary , .\nI NEVER ENCOURAGE deceit, and falsehood, especially if you\nhave got a bad memory, is the worst enemy a fellow can\nhave. The fact is truth is your truest friend, no matter what\nthe circumstances are. Notwithstanding this copy-book\npreamble, my boy, I am inclined to suggest a little prudence\non your part. You see I have a congenital aversion to\nfailure, and the sudden announcement to your Uncle\nAndrew of the success of your \u201clamp rubbing\u201d might\npossibly \nprevent \nyour \npassing \nthe \nsevere \nphysical\nexamination to which you will be subjected in order to\nenter the Military Academy. You see I should like to have a\nperfect soldier credited to dear old Illinois \u2014 no broken\nbones, scalp wounds, etc. So I think it might be wise to\nhand this letter from me in to your good uncle through his\nroom-window after he has had a comfortable dinner, and\nwatch its e\ufb00ect from the top of the pigeon-house.\nI have just told the folks here in Spring\ufb01eld on this th\nanniversary of the birth of him whose name, mightiest in\nthe cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in the cause of\nmoral reformation, we mention in solemn awe, in naked,\ndeathless splendor, that the one victory we can ever call\ncomplete will be that one which proclaims that there is not\n one slave or one drunkard on the face of God\u2019s green earth.\nRecruit for this victory.\nNow, boy, on your march, don\u2019t you go and forget the old\nmaxim that \u201cone drop of honey catches more \ufb02ies than a\nhalf-gallon of gall.\u201d Load your musket with this maxim, and\nsmoke it in your pipe.\n A\n        \n    H     I\n I  \nA HI\n \nIA\n   \n   A\n    \n I   \nFEBRUARY , .\nALTHOUGH THE TEMPERANCE cause has been in progress\nfor near twenty years, it is apparent to all that it is just now\nbeing \ncrowned \nwith \na \ndegree \nof \nsuccess \nhitherto\nunparalleled.\nThe list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of\n\ufb01fties, of hundreds, and of thousands. The cause itself\nseems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract theory to\na living, breathing, active, and powerful chieftain, going\nforth \u201cconquering and to conquer.\u201d The citadels of his great\nadversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his\ntemple and his altars, where the rites of his idolatrous\nworship have long been performed, and where human\nsacri\ufb01ces have long been wont to be made, are daily\ndesecrated and deserted. The triumph of the conqueror\u2019s\nfame is sounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from\nland to land, and calling millions to his standard at a blast.\nFor this new and splendid success we heartily rejoice.\nThat that success is so much greater now than heretofore is\ndoubtless owing to rational causes; and if we would have it\ncontinue, we shall do well to inquire what those causes are.\n The warfare heretofore waged against the demon\nintemperance has somehow or other been erroneous.\nEither the champions engaged or the tactics they adopted\nhave not been the most proper. These champions for the\nmost part have been preachers, lawyers, and hired agents.\nBetween these and the mass of mankind there is a want of\napproachability, if the term be admissible, partially, at least,\nfatal to their success. They are supposed to have no\nsympathy of feeling or interest with those very persons\nwhom it is their object to convince and persuade.\nAnd again, it is so common and so easy to ascribe\nmotives to men of these classes other than those they\nprofess to act upon. The preacher, it is said, advocates\ntemperance because he is a fanatic, and desires a union of\nthe Church and State; the lawyer from his pride and vanity\nof hearing himself speak; and the hired agent for his salary.\nBut when one who has long been known as a victim of\nintemperance bursts the fetters that have bound him, and\nappears before his neighbors \u201cclothed and in his right\nmind,\u201d a redeemed specimen of long-lost humanity, and\nstands up, with tears of joy trembling in his eyes, to tell of\nthe miseries once endured, now to be endured no more\nforever; of his once naked and starving children, now clad\nand fed comfortably; of a wife long weighed down with\nwoe, weeping, and a broken heart, now restored to health,\nhappiness, and a renewed a\ufb00ection; and how easily it is all\ndone, once it is resolved to be done; how simple his\nlanguage! there is a logic and an eloquence in it that few\nwith human feelings can resist. They cannot say that he\n desires a union of Church and State, for he is not a church\nmember; they cannot say he is vain of hearing himself\nspeak, for his whole demeanor shows he would gladly avoid\nspeaking at all; they cannot say he speaks for pay, for he\nreceives none, and asks for none. Nor can his sincerity in\nany way be doubted, or his sympathy for those he would\npersuade to imitate his example be denied.\nIn my judgment, it is to the battles of this new class of\nchampions that our late success is greatly, perhaps chie\ufb02y,\nowing. But, had the old-school champions themselves been\nof the most wise selecting, was their system of tactics the\nmost judicious? It seems to me it was not. Too much\ndenunciation against dram-sellers and dram-drinkers was\nindulged in. This I think was both impolitic and unjust. It\nwas impolitic, because it is not much in the nature of man\nto be driven to anything; still less to be driven about that\nwhich is exclusively his own business; and least of all where\nsuch driving is to be submitted to at the expense of\npecuniary interest or burning appetite. When the dram-\nseller and drinker were incessantly told not in accents of\nentreaty and persuasion, di\ufb00idently addressed by erring\nman to an erring brother, but in the thundering tones of\nanathema and denunciation with which the lordly judge\noften groups together all the crimes of the felon\u2019s life, and\nthrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence of\ndeath upon him that they were the authors of all the vice\nand misery and crime in the land; that they were the\nmanufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers\nand murderers that infest the earth; that their houses were\n the workshops of the devil; and that their persons should\nbe shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral\npestilences \u2014 I say, when they were told all this, and in this\nway, it is not wonderful that they were slow to acknowledge\nthe truth of such denunciations, and to join the ranks of\ntheir denouncers in a hue and cry against themselves.\nTo have expected them to do otherwise than they did to\nhave expected them not to meet denunciation with\ndenunciation, crimination with crimination, and anathema\nwith anathema \u2014 was to expect a reversal of human\nnature, which is God\u2019s decree and can never be reversed.\nWhen the conduct of men is designed to be in\ufb02uenced,\npersuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be\nadopted. It is an old and a true maxim that \u201ca drop of honey\ncatches more \ufb02ies than a gallon of gall.\u201d So with men. If\nyou would win a man to your cause, \ufb01rst convince him that\nyou are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that\ncatches his heart, which, say what he will, is the great\nhighroad to his reason; and which, when once gained, you\nwill \ufb01nd but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the\njustice of your cause, if indeed that cause really be a just\none. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his judgment, or\nto command his action, or to mark him as one to be\nshunned and despised, and he will retreat within himself,\nclose all the avenues to his head and his heart; and though\nyour cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the\nheaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than steel\ncan be made, and though you throw it with more than\nherculean force and precision, you shall be no more able to\n pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise\nwith a rye straw. Such is man, and so must he be\nunderstood by those who would lead him, even to his own\nbest interests.\nOn this point the Washingtonians greatly excel the\ntemperance advocates of former times. Those whom they\ndesire to convince and persuade are their old friends and\ncompanions. They know they are not demons, nor even the\nworst of men; they know that generally they are kind,\ngenerous, and charitable even beyond the example of their\nmore staid and sober neighbors. They are practical\nphilanthropists; and they glow with a generous and\nbrotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling.\nBenevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely; and\nout of the abundance of their hearts their tongues give\nutterance; \u201clove through all their actions runs, and all their\nwords are mild.\u201d In this spirit they speak and act, and in\nthe same they are heard and regarded. And when such is\nthe temper of the advocate, and such of the audience, no\ngood cause can be unsuccessful. But I have said that\ndenunciations against dramsellers and dram-drinkers are\nunjust, as well as impolitic. Let us see. I have not inquired\nat what period of time the use of intoxicating liquors\ncommenced; nor is it important to know. It is su\ufb00icient that,\nto all of us who now inhabit the world, the practice of\ndrinking them is just as old as the world itself that is, we\nhave seen the one just as long as we have seen the other.\nWhen all such of us as have now reached the years of\nmaturity \ufb01rst opened our eyes upon the stage of existence,\n we found intoxicating liquor recognized by everybody, used\nby everybody, repudiated by nobody. It commonly entered\ninto the \ufb01rst draught of the infant and the last draught of\nthe dying man. From the sideboard of the parson down to\nthe ragged pocket of the houseless loafer, it was constantly\nfound. Physicians proscribed it in this, that, and the other\ndisease; government provided it for soldiers and sailors;\nand to have a rolling or raising, a husking or \u201choedown,\u201d\nanywhere about without it was positively insu\ufb00erable. So,\ntoo, it was everywhere a respectable article of manufacture\nand merchandise. The making of it was regarded as an\nhonorable livelihood, and he who could make most was the\nmost enterprising and respectable. Large and small\nmanufactories of it were everywhere erected, in which all\nthe earthly goods of their owners were invested. Wagons\ndrew it from town to town; boats bore it from clime to\nclime, and the winds wafted it from nation to nation; and\nmerchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and retail, with\nprecisely the same feelings on the part of the seller, buyer,\nand bystander as are felt at the selling and buying of\nploughs, beef, bacon, or any other of the real necessaries of\nlife. Universal public opinion not only tolerated but\nrecognized and adopted its use.\nIt is true that even then it was known and acknowledged\nthat many were greatly injured by it; but none seemed to\nthink the injury arose from the use of a bad thing, but from\nthe abuse of a very good thing. The victims of it were to be\npitied and compassionated, just as are the heirs of\nconsumption and other hereditary diseases. Their failing\n was treated as a misfortune, and not as a crime, or even as\na disgrace. If, then, what I have been saying is true, is it\nwonderful that some should think and act now as all\nthought and acted twenty years ago? and is it just to assail,\ncondemn, or despise them for doing so? The universal\nsense of mankind on any subject is an argument, or at least\nan in\ufb02uence, not easily overcome. The success of the\nargument in favor of the existence of an overruling\nProvidence mainly depends upon that sense; and men\nought not in justice to be denounced for yielding to it in any\ncase, or giving it up slowly, especially when they are\nbacked by interest, \ufb01xed habits, or burning appetites.\nAnother error, as it seems to me, into which the old\nreformers fell, was the position that all habitual drunkards\nwere utterly incorrigible, and therefore must be turned\nadrift and damned without remedy in order that the grace\nof temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to\nall mankind some hundreds of years thereafter. There is in\nthis some thing so repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable,\nso cold-blooded and feelingless, that it, never did nor ever\ncan enlist the enthusiasm of a popular cause. We could not\nlove the man who taught it we could not hear him with\npatience. The heart could not throw open its portals to it,\nthe generous man could not adopt it \u2014 it could not mix with\nhis blood. It looked so \ufb01endishly sel\ufb01sh, so like throwing\nfathers and brothers overboard to lighten the boat for our\nsecurity, that the noble-minded shrank from the manifest\nmeanness of the thing. And besides this, the bene\ufb01ts of a\nreformation to be e\ufb00ected by such a system were too\n remote in point of time to warmly engage many in its\nbehalf. Few can be induced to labor exclusively for\nposterity, and none will do it enthusiastically. \u2014 Posterity\nhas done nothing for us; and, theorize on it as we may,\npractically we shall do very little for it, unless we are made\nto think we are at the same time doing something for\nourselves.\nWhat an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit to ask\nor to expect a whole community to rise up and labor for the\ntemporal happiness of others, after themselves shall be\nconsigned to the dust, a majority of which community take\nno pains whatever to secure their own eternal welfare at no\nmore distant day! Great distance in either time or space\nhas wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the\nhuman mind. Pleasures to be enjoyed, or pains to be\nendured, after we shall be dead and gone are but little\nregarded even in our own cases, and much less in the cases\nof others. Still, in addition to this there is something so\nludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way\no\ufb00 as to render the whole subject with which they are\nconnected easily turned into ridicule. \u201cBetter lay down that\nspade you are stealing, Paddy; if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll pay for it\nat the day of judgment.\u201d \u201cBe the powers, if ye\u2019ll credit me\nso long I\u2019ll take another jist.\u201d\nBy the Washingtonians this system of consigning the\nhabitual drunkard to hopeless ruin is repudiated. They\nadopt a more enlarged philanthropy; they go for present as\nwell as future good. They labor for all now living, as well as\nhereafter to live. They teach hope to all-despair to none. As\n applying to their cause, they deny the doctrine of\nunpardonable sin; as in Christianity it is taught, so in this\nthey teach\u2014 \u201cWhile \u2014 While the lamp holds out to burn,\nThe vilest sinner may return.\u201d And, what is a matter of\nmore profound congratulation, they, by experiment upon\nexperiment and example upon example, prove the maxim to\nbe no less true in the one case than in the other. On every\nhand we behold those who but yesterday were the chief of\nsinners, now the chief apostles of the cause. Drunken devils\nare cast out by ones, by sevens, by legions; and their\nunfortunate victims, like the poor possessed who were\nredeemed from their long and lonely wanderings in the\ntombs, are publishing to the ends of the earth how great\nthings have been done for them.\nTo these new champions and this new system of tactics\nour late success is mainly owing, and to them we must\nmainly look for the \ufb01nal consummation. The ball is now\nrolling gloriously on, and none are so able as they to\nincrease its speed and its bulk, to add to its momentum and\nits magnitude \u2014 even though unlearned in letters, for this\ntask none are so well educated. To \ufb01t them for this work\nthey have been taught in the true school. They have been in\nthat gulf from which they would teach others the means of\nescape. They have passed that prison wall which others\nhave long declared impassable; and who that has not shall\ndare to weigh opinions with them as to the mode of\npassing?\nBut if it be true, as I have insisted, that those who have\nsu\ufb00ered by intemperance personally, and have reformed,\n are the most powerful and e\ufb00icient instruments to push the\nreformation to ultimate success, it does not follow that\nthose who have not su\ufb00ered have no part left them to\nperform. Whether or not the world would be vastly\nbene\ufb01ted by a total and \ufb01nal banishment from it of all\nintoxicating drinks seems to me not now an open question.\nThree fourths of mankind confess the a\ufb00irmative with their\ntongues, and, I believe, all the rest acknowledge it in their\nhearts.\nOught any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good\nthe good of the whole demands? Shall he who cannot do\nmuch be for that reason excused if he do nothing? \u201cBut,\u201d\nsays one, \u201cwhat good can I do by signing the pledge? I\nnever drank, even without signing.\u201d This question has\nalready been asked and answered more than a million of\ntimes. Let it be answered once more. For the man suddenly\nor in any other way to break o\ufb00 from the use of drams, who\nhas indulged in them for a long course of years and until\nhis appetite for them has grown ten or a hundredfold\nstronger and more craving than any natural appetite can\nbe, requires a most powerful moral e\ufb00ort. In such an\nundertaking he needs every moral support and in\ufb02uence\nthat can possibly be brought to his aid and thrown around\nhim. And not only so, but every moral prop should be taken\nfrom whatever argument might rise in his mind to lure him\nto his backsliding. When he casts his eyes around him, he\nshould be able to see all that he respects, all that he\nadmires, all that he loves, kindly and anxiously pointing him\n onward, and none beckoning him back to his former\nmiserable \u201cwallowing in the mire.\u201d\nBut it is said by some that men will think and act for\nthemselves; that none will disuse spirits or anything else\nbecause his neighbors do; and that moral in\ufb02uence is not\nthat powerful engine contended for. Let us examine this.\nLet me ask the man who could maintain this position most\nsti\ufb04y, what compensation he will accept to go to church\nsome Sunday and sit during the sermon with his wife\u2019s\nbonnet upon his head? Not a tri\ufb02e, I\u2019ll venture. And why\nnot? There would be nothing irreligious in it, nothing\nimmoral, nothing uncomfortable \u2014 then why not? Is it not\nbecause \nthere \nwould \nbe \nsomething \negregiously\nunfashionable in it? Then it is the in\ufb02uence of fashion; and\nwhat is the in\ufb02uence of fashion but the in\ufb02uence that other\npeople\u2019s actions have on our actions \u2014 the strong\ninclination each of us feels to do as we see all our\nneighbors do? Nor is the in\ufb02uence of fashion con\ufb01ned to\nany particular thing or class of things; it is just as strong on\none subject as another. Let us make it as unfashionable to\nwithhold our names from the temperance cause as for\nhusbands to wear their wives\u2019 bonnets to church, and\ninstances will be just as rare in the one case as the other.\n\u201cBut,\u201d say some, \u201cwe are no drunkards, and we shall not\nacknowledge \nourselves \nsuch \nby \njoining \na \nreformed\ndrunkard\u2019s society, whatever our in\ufb02uence might be.\u201d\nSurely no Christian will adhere to this objection. If they\nbelieve as they profess, that Omnipotence condescended to\ntake on himself the form of sinful man, and as such to die\n an ignominious death for their sakes, surely they will not\nrefuse submission to the in\ufb01nitely lesser condescension, for\nthe temporal, and perhaps eternal, salvation of a large,\nerring, and unfortunate class of their fellow-creatures. Nor\nis the condescension very great. In my judgment such of us\nas have never fallen victims have been spared more by the\nabsence of appetite than from any mental or moral\nsuperiority over those who have. Indeed, I believe if we\ntake habitual drunkards as a class, their heads and their\nhearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of\nany other class. There seems ever to have been a\nproneness in the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this\nvice \u2014 the demon of intemperance ever seems to have\ndelighted in sucking the blood of genius and of generosity.\nWhat one of us but can call to mind some relative, more\npromising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a\nsacri\ufb01ce to his rapacity? He ever seems to have gone forth\nlike the Egyptian angel of death, commissioned to slay, if\nnot the \ufb01rst, the fairest born of every family. Shall he now\nbe arrested in his desolating career? In that arrest all can\ngive aid that will; and who shall be excused that can and\nwill not? Far around as human breath has ever blown he\nkeeps our fathers, our brothers, our sons, and our friends\nprostrate in the chains of moral death. To all the living\neverywhere we cry, \u201cCome sound the moral trump, that\nthese may rise and stand up an exceeding great army.\u201d\n\u201cCome from the four winds, O breath! and breathe upon\nthese slain that they may live.\u201d If the relative grandeur of\nrevolutions shall be estimated by the great amount of\n human misery they alleviate, and the small amount they\nin\ufb02ict, then indeed will this be the grandest the world shall\never have seen.\nOf our political revolution of \u2018 we are all justly proud.\nIt has given us a degree of political freedom far exceeding\nthat of any other nation of the earth. In it the world has\nfound a solution of the long-mooted problem as to the\ncapability of man to govern himself. In it was the germ\nwhich has vegetated, and still is to grow and expand into\nthe universal liberty of mankind. But, with all these\nglorious results, past, present, and to come, it had its evils\ntoo. It breathed forth famine, swam in blood, and rode in\n\ufb01re; and long, long after, the orphan\u2019s cry and the widow\u2019s\nwail continued to break the sad silence that ensued. These\nwere the price, the inevitable price, paid for the blessings it\nbought.\nTurn now to the temperance revolution. In it we shall\n\ufb01nd \na \nstronger \nbondage \nbroken, \na \nviler \nslavery\nmanumitted, a greater tyrant deposed; in it, more of want\nsupplied, more disease healed, more sorrow assuaged. By it\nno Orphans starving, no widows weeping. By it none\nwounded in feeling, none injured in interest; even the\ndrammaker and dram-seller will have glided into other\noccupations so gradually as never to have felt the change,\nand will stand ready to join all others in the universal song\nof gladness. And what a noble ally this to the cause of\npolitical freedom, with such an aid its march cannot fail to\nbe on and on, till every son of earth shall drink in rich\nfruition the sorrow-quenching draughts of perfect liberty.\n Happy day when-all appetites controlled, all poisons\nsubdued, all matter subjected-mind, all-conquering mind,\nshall live and move, the monarch of the world. Glorious\nconsummation! Hail, fall of fury! Reign of reason, all hail!\nAnd when the victory shall be complete, when there shall\nbe neither a slave nor a drunkard on the earth, how proud\nthe title of that land which may truly claim to be the\nbirthplace and the cradle of both those revolutions that\nshall have ended in that victory. How nobly distinguished\nthat people who shall have planted and nurtured to\nmaturity both the political and moral freedom of their\nspecies.\nThis is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the\nbirthday of Washington; we are met to celebrate this day.\nWashington is the mightiest name of earth long since\nmightiest in the cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in\nmoral reformation. On that name no eulogy is expected. It\ncannot be. To add brightness to the sun or glory to the\nname of Washington is alike impossible. Let none attempt\nit. In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked\ndeathless splendor leave it shining on.\n  \n  \n H A  .     \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, February , .\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 Yours of the th instant, announcing\nthat Miss Fanny and you are \u201cno more twain, but one\n\ufb02esh,\u201d reached me this morning. I have no way of telling\nyou how much happiness I wish you both, though I believe\nyou both can conceive it. I feel somewhat jealous of both of\nyou now: you will be so exclusively concerned for one\nanother, that I shall be forgotten entirely. My acquaintance\nwith Miss Fanny (I call her this, lest you should think I am\nspeaking of your mother) was too short for me to\nreasonably hope to long be remembered by her; and still I\nam sure I shall not forget her soon. Try if you cannot\nremind her of that debt she owes me \u2014 and be sure you do\nnot interfere to prevent her paying it.\nI regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to\nIllinois. I shall be very lonesome without you. How\nmiserably things seem to be arranged in this world! If we\nhave no friends, we have no pleasure; and if we have them,\nwe are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the loss.\nI did hope she and you would make your home here; but I\nown I have no right to insist. You owe obligations to her ten\nthousand times more sacred than you can owe to others,\nand in that light let them be respected and observed. It is\n natural that she should desire to remain with her relatives\nand friends. As to friends, however, she could not need\nthem anywhere: she would have them in abundance here.\nGive my kind remembrance to Mr. Williamson and his\nfamily, particularly Miss Elizabeth; also to your mother,\nbrother, and sisters. Ask little Eliza Davis if she will ride to\ntown with me if I come there again. And \ufb01nally, give Fanny\na double reciprocation of all the love she sent me. Write me\noften, and believe me\nYours forever, LINCOLN.\nP. S. Poor Easthouse is gone at last. He died awhile\nbefore day this morning. They say he was very loath to\ndie....\nL.\n  \n  \n H A  .     \n \n \n \nA  IA\n \n   \nSPRINGFIELD, February ,.\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 I received yours of the th written the\nday you went down to William\u2019s place, some days since, but\ndelayed answering it till I should receive the promised one\nof the th, which came last night. I opened the letter with\nintense anxiety and trepidation; so much so, that, although\nit turned out better than I expected, I have hardly yet, at a\ndistance of ten hours, become calm.\nI tell you, Speed, our forebodings (for which you and I\nare peculiar) are all the worst sort of nonsense. I fancied,\nfrom the time I received your letter of Saturday, that the\none of Wednesday was never to come, and yet it did come,\nand what is more, it is perfectly clear, both from its tone\nand handwriting, that you were much happier, or, if you\nthink the term preferable, less miserable, when you wrote\nit than when you wrote the last one before. You had so\nobviously improved at the very time I so much fancied you\nwould have grown worse. You say that something\nindescribably horrible and alarming still haunts you. You\nwill not say that three months from now, I will venture.\nWhen your nerves once get steady now, the whole trouble\nwill be over forever. Nor should you become impatient at\n their being even very slow in becoming steady. Again you\nsay, you much fear that that Elysium of which you have\ndreamed so much is never to be realized. Well, if it shall\nnot, I dare swear it will not be the fault of her who is now\nyour wife. I now have no doubt that it is the peculiar\nmisfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of Elysium\nfar exceeding all that anything earthly can realize. Far\nshort of your dreams as you may be, no woman could do\nmore to realize them than that same black-eyed Fanny. If\nyou could but contemplate her through my imagination, it\nwould appear ridiculous to you that any one should for a\nmoment think of being unhappy with her. My old father\nused to have a saying that \u201cIf you make a bad bargain, hug\nit all the tighter\u201d; and it occurs to me that if the bargain\nyou have just closed can possibly be called a bad one, it is\ncertainly the most pleasant one for applying that maxim to\nwhich my fancy can by any e\ufb00ort picture.\nI write another letter, enclosing this, which you can show\nher, if she desires it. I do this because she would think\nstrangely, perhaps, should you tell her that you received no\nletters from me, or, telling her you do, refuse to let her see\nthem. I close this, entertaining the con\ufb01dent hope that\nevery successive letter I shall have from you (which I here\npray may not be few, nor far between) may show you\npossessing a more steady hand and cheerful heart than the\nlast preceding it. As ever, your friend, LINCOLN.\n  \n  \n H A  .     \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, March , \nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 Yours of the th instant was received\nthree or four days since. You know I am sincere when I tell\nyou the pleasure its contents gave me was, and is,\ninexpressible. As to your farm matter, I have no sympathy\nwith you. I have no farm, nor ever expect to have, and\nconsequently have not studied the subject enough to be\nmuch interested with it. I can only say that I am glad you\nare satis\ufb01ed and pleased with it. But on that other subject,\nto me of the most intense interest whether in joy or sorrow,\nI never had the power to withhold my sympathy from you.\nIt cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you\nsay you are \u201cfar happier than you ever expected to be.\u201d\nThat much I know is enough. I know you too well to\nsuppose your expectations were not, at least, sometimes\nextravagant, and if the reality exceeds them all, I say,\nEnough, dear Lord. I am not going beyond the truth when I\ntell you that the short space it took me to read your last\nletter gave me more pleasure than the total sum of all I\nhave enjoyed since the fatal st of January, . Since\nthen it seems to me I should have been entirely happy, but\nfor the never-absent idea that there is one still unhappy\nwhom I have contributed to make so. That still kills my\n soul. I cannot but reproach myself for even wishing to be\nhappy while she is otherwise. She accompanied a large\nparty on the railroad cars to Jacksonville last Monday, and\non her return spoke, so that I heard of it, of having enjoyed\nthe trip exceedingly. God be praised for that.\nYou know with what sleepless vigilance I have watched\nyou ever since the commencement of your a\ufb00air; and\nalthough I am almost con\ufb01dent it is useless, I cannot\nforbear once more to say that I think it is even yet possible\nfor your spirits to \ufb02ag down and leave you miserable. If\nthey should, don\u2019t fail to remember that they cannot long\nremain so. One thing I can tell you which I know you will be\nglad to hear, and that is that I have seen \u2014 and scrutinized\nher feelings as well as I could, and am fully convinced she\nis far happier now than she has been for the last \ufb01fteen\nmonths past.\nYou will see by the last Sangamon Journal, that I made a\ntemperance speech on the d of February, which I claim\nthat Fanny and you shall read as an act of charity to me; for\nI cannot learn that anybody else has read it, or is likely to.\nFortunately it is not very long, and I shall deem it a\nsu\ufb00icient compliance with my request if one of you listens\nwhile the other reads it.\nAs to your Lockridge matter, it is only necessary to say\nthat there has been no court since you left, and that the\nnext commences to-morrow morning, during which I\nsuppose we cannot fail to get a judgment.\nI wish you would learn of Everett what he would take,\nover and above a discharge for all the trouble we have been\n at, to take his business out of our hands and give it to\nsomebody else. It is impossible to collect money on that or\nany other claim here now; and although you know I am not\na very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience\nwith Mr. Everett\u2019s importunity. It seems like he not only\nwrites all the letters he can himself, but gets everybody\nelse in Louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to us\nabout his claim. I have always said that Mr. Everett is a\nvery clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be\nobliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are\ninterested to collect his claim, and therefore would do it if\nwe could.\nI am neither joking nor in a pet when I say we would\nthank him to transfer his business to some other, without\nany compensation for what we have done, provided he will\nsee the court cost paid, for which we are security.\nThe sweet violet you inclosed came safely to hand, but it\nwas so dry, and mashed so \ufb02at, that it crumbled to dust at\nthe \ufb01rst attempt to handle it. The juice that mashed out of\nit stained a place in the letter, which I mean to preserve\nand cherish for the sake of her who procured it to be sent.\nMy renewed good wishes to her in particular, and generally\nto all such of your relations who know me.\nAs ever,\nLINCOLN.\n  \n  \n H A  .     \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, July , .\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 Yours of the th June was received\nonly a day or two since. It was not mailed at Louisville till\nthe th. You speak of the great time that has elapsed since\nI wrote you. Let me explain that. Your letter reached here a\nday or two after I started on the circuit. I was gone \ufb01ve or\nsix weeks, so that I got the letters only a few weeks before\nButler started to your country. I thought it scarcely worth\nwhile to write you the news which he could and would tell\nyou more in detail. On his return he told me you would\nwrite me soon, and so I waited for your letter. As to my\nhaving been displeased with your advice, surely you know\nbetter than that. I know you do, and therefore will not labor\nto convince you. True, that subject is painful to me; but it is\nnot your silence, or the silence of all the world, that can\nmake me forget it. I acknowledge the correctness of your\nadvice too; but before I resolve to do the one thing or the\nother, I must gain my con\ufb01dence in my own ability to keep\nmy resolves when they are made. In that ability you know I\nonce prided myself as the only or chief gem of my\ncharacter; that gem I lost \u2014 how and where you know too\nwell. I have not yet regained it; and until I do, I cannot trust\nmyself in any matter of much importance. I believe now\n that had you understood my case at the time as well as I\nunderstand yours afterward, by the aid you would have\ngiven me I should have sailed through clear, but that does\nnot now a\ufb00ord me su\ufb00icient con\ufb01dence to begin that or the\nlike of that again.\nYou make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to\nme for your present happiness. I am pleased with that\nacknowledgment. But a thousand times more am I pleased\nto know that you enjoy a degree of happiness worthy of an\nacknowledgment. The truth is, I am not sure that there was\nany merit with me in the part I took in your di\ufb00iculty; I was\ndrawn to it by a fate. If I would I could not have done less\nthan I did. I always was superstitious; I believe God made\nme one of the instruments of bringing your Fanny and you\ntogether, which union I have no doubt He had fore-\nordained. Whatever He designs He will do for me yet.\n\u201cStand still, and see the salvation of the Lord\u201d is my text\njust now. If, as you say, you have told Fanny all, I should\nhave no objection to her seeing this letter, but for its\nreference to our friend here: let her seeing it depend upon\nwhether she has ever known anything of my a\ufb00airs; and if\nshe has not, do not let her.\nI do not think I can come to Kentucky this season. I am so\npoor and make so little headway in the world, that I drop\nback in a month of idleness as much as I gain in a year\u2019s\nsowing. I should like to visit you again. I should like to see\nthat \u201csis\u201d of yours that was absent when I was there,\nthough I suppose she would run away again if she were to\nhear I was coming.\n My respects and esteem to all your friends there, and, by\nyour permission, my love to your Fanny.\nEver yours, LINCOLN.\n A          \n  H   \n    \n HI \nARTICLE WRITTEN BY Lincoln for the Sangamon Journal in\nridicule of James Shields, who, as State Auditor, had\ndeclined to receive State Bank notes in payment of taxes.\nThe above letter purported to come from a poor widow\nwho, though supplied with State Bank paper, could not\nobtain a receipt for her tax bill. This, and another\nsubsequent letter by Mary Todd, brought about the\n\u201cLincoln-Shields Duel.\u201d\n  \n    \n HI \nAugust , .\nDEAR MR. PRINTER:\nI see you printed that long letter I sent you a spell ago. I\n\u2018m quite encouraged by it, and can\u2019t keep from writing\nagain. I think the printing of my letters will be a good thing\nall round \u2014 it will give me the bene\ufb01t of being known by\nthe world, and give the world the advantage of knowing\nwhat\u2019s going on in the Lost Townships, and give your paper\nrespectability besides. So here comes another. Yesterday\nafternoon I hurried through cleaning up the dinner dishes\nand stepped over to neighbor S \u2014\u2014 \u2014 to see if his wife\nPeggy was as well as mout be expected, and hear what they\ncalled the baby. Well, when I got there and just turned\nround the corner of his log cabin, there he was, setting on\nthe doorstep reading a newspaper. \u201cHow are you, Je\ufb00?\u201d\nsays I. He sorter started when he heard me, for he hadn\u2019t\nseen me before. \u201cWhy,\u201d says he, \u201cI \u2018m mad as the devil,\nAunt \u2018Becca!\u201d \u201cWhat about?\u201d says I; \u201cain\u2019t its hair the right\ncolor? None of that nonsense, Je\ufb00; there ain\u2019t an honester\nwoman in the Lost Townships than...\u201d\u2014 \u201cThan who?\u201d says\nhe; \u201cwhat the mischief are you about?\u201d I began to see I was\nrunning the wrong trail, and so says I, \u201cOh! nothing: I\n guess I was mistaken a little, that\u2019s all. But what is it you\n\u2018re mad about?\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d says he, \u201cI\u2019ve been tugging ever since harvest,\ngetting out wheat and hauling it to the river to raise State\nBank paper enough to pay my tax this year and a little\nschool debt I owe; and now, just as I \u2018ve got it, here I open\nthis infernal Extra Register, expecting to \ufb01nd it full of\n\u2018Glorious Democratic Victories\u2019 and \u2018High Comb\u2019d Cocks,\u2019\nwhen, lo and behold! I \ufb01nd a set of fellows, calling\nthemselves o\ufb00icers of the State, have forbidden the tax\ncollectors, and school commissioners to receive State paper\nat all; and so here it is dead on my hands. I don\u2019t now\nbelieve all the plunder I\u2019ve got will fetch ready cash enough\nto pay my taxes and that school debt.\u201d\nI was a good deal thunderstruck myself; for that was the\n\ufb01rst I had heard of the proclamation, and my old man was\npretty much in the same \ufb01x with Je\ufb00. We both stood a\nmoment staring at one another without knowing what to\nsay. At last says I, \u201cMr. S \u2014\u2014 \u2014 let me look at that paper.\u201d\nHe handed it to me, when I read the proclamation over.\n\u201cThere now,\u201d says he, \u201cdid you ever see such a piece of\nimpudence and imposition as that?\u201d I saw Je\ufb00 was in a good\ntune for saying some ill-natured things, and so I tho\u2019t I\nwould just argue a little on the contrary side, and make him\nrant a spell if I could. \u201cWhy,\u201d says I, looking as digni\ufb01ed\nand thoughtful as I could, \u201cit seems pretty tough, to be\nsure, to have to raise silver where there\u2019s none to be\nraised; but then, you see, \u2018there will be danger of loss\u2019 if it\nain\u2019t done.\u201d\n \u201cLoss! damnation!\u201d says he. \u201cI defy Daniel Webster, I\ndefy King Solomon, I defy the world \u2014 I defy \u2014 I defy \u2014\nyes, I defy even you, Aunt \u2018Becca, to show how the people\ncan lose anything by paying their taxes in State paper.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cyou see what the o\ufb00icers of State say\nabout it, and they are a desarnin\u2019 set of men. But,\u201d says I, \u201cI\nguess you \u2018re mistaken about what the proclamation says.\nIt don\u2019t say the people will lose anything by the paper\nmoney being taken for taxes. It only says \u2018there will be\ndanger of loss\u2019; and though it is tolerable plain that the\npeople can\u2019t lose by paying their taxes in something they\ncan get easier than silver, instead of having to pay silver;\nand though it\u2019s just as plain that the State can\u2019t lose by\ntaking State Bank paper, however low it may be, while she\nowes the bank more than the whole revenue, and can pay\nthat paper over on her debt, dollar for dollar; \u2014 still there\nis danger of loss to the \u2018o\ufb00icers of State\u2019; and you know,\nJe\ufb00, we can\u2019t get along without o\ufb00icers of State.\u201d\n\u201cDamn o\ufb00icers of State!\u201d says he; \u201cthat\u2019s what Whigs are\nalways hurrahing for.\u201d\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t swear so, Je\ufb00,\u201d says I, \u201cyou know I belong to\nthe meetin\u2019, and swearin\u2019 hurts my feelings.\u201d\n\u201cBeg pardon, Aunt \u2018Becca,\u201d says he; \u201cbut I do say it\u2019s\nenough to make Dr. Goddard swear, to have tax to pay in\nsilver, for nothing only that Ford may get his two thousand\na year, and Shields his twenty-four hundred a year, and\nCarpenter his sixteen hundred a year, and all without\n\u2018danger of loss\u2019 by taking it in State paper. Yes, yes: it\u2019s\nplain enough now what these o\ufb00icers of State mean by\n \u2018danger of loss.\u2019 Wash, I s\u2019pose, actually lost \ufb01fteen\nhundred dollars out of the three thousand that two of these\n\u2018o\ufb00icers of State\u2019 let him steal from the treasury, by being\ncompelled to take it in State paper. Wonder if we don\u2019t have\na proclamation before long, commanding us to make up\nthis loss to Wash in silver.\u201d\nAnd so he went on till his breath run out, and he had to\nstop. I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say just then, and so I\nbegun to look over the paper again. \u201cAy! here\u2019s another\nproclamation, or something like it.\u201d\n\u201cAnother?\u201d says Je\ufb00; \u201cand whose egg is it, pray?\u201d\nI looked to the bottom of it, and read aloud, \u201cYour\nobedient servant, James Shields, Auditor.\u201d\n\u201cAha!\u201d says Je\ufb00, \u201cone of them same three fellows again.\nWell read it, and let\u2019s hear what of it.\u201d\nI read on till I came to where it says, \u201cThe object of this\nmeasure is to suspend the collection of the revenue for the\ncurrent year.\u201d\n\u201cNow stop, now stop!\u201d says he; \u201cthat\u2019s a lie a\u2019ready, and I\ndon\u2019t want to hear of it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, maybe not,\u201d says I.\n\u201cI say it-is-a-lie. Suspend the collection, indeed! Will the\ncollectors, that have taken their oaths to make the\ncollection, dare to end it? Is there anything in law requiring\nthem to perjure themselves at the bidding of James\nShields?\n\u201cWill the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satis\ufb01ed\nwith swallowing him instead of all of them, if they should\nventure to obey him? And would he not discover some\n \u2018danger of loss,\u2019 and be o\ufb00 about the time it came to taking\ntheir places?\n\u201cAnd suppose the people attempt to suspend, by refusing\nto pay; what then? The collectors would just jerk up their\nhorses and cows, and the like, and sell them to the highest\nbidder for silver in hand, without valuation or redemption.\nWhy, Shields didn\u2019t believe that story himself; it was never\nmeant for the truth. If it was true, why was it not writ till\n\ufb01ve days after the proclamation? Why did n\u2019t Carlin and\nCarpenter sign it as well as Shields? Answer me that, Aunt\n\u2018Becca. I say it\u2019s a lie, and not a well told one at that. It\ngrins out like a copper dollar. Shields is a fool as well as a\nliar. With him truth is out of the question; and as for getting\na good, bright, passable lie out of him, you might as well try\nto strike \ufb01re from a cake of tallow. I stick to it, it\u2019s all an\ninfernal Whig lie!\u201d\n\u201cA Whig lie! Highty tighty!\u201d\n\u201cYes, a Whig lie; and it\u2019s just like everything the cursed\nBritish Whigs do. First they\u2019ll do some divilment, and then\nthey\u2019ll tell a lie to hide it. And they don\u2019t care how plain a\nlie it is; they think they can cram any sort of a one down\nthe throats of the ignorant Locofocos, as they call the\nDemocrats.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Je\ufb00, you \u2018re crazy: you don\u2019t mean to say Shields is\na Whig!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, look here! the proclamation is in your own\nDemocratic paper, as you call it.\u201d\n \u201cI know it; and what of that? They only printed it to let us\nDemocrats see the deviltry the Whigs are at.\u201d\n\u201cWell, but Shields is the auditor of this Loco \u2014 I mean\nthis Democratic State.\u201d\n\u201cSo he is, and Tyler appointed him to o\ufb00ice.\u201d\n\u201cTyler appointed him?\u201d\n\u201cYes (if you must chaw it over), Tyler appointed him; or, if\nit was n\u2019t him, it was old Granny Harrison, and that\u2019s all\none. I tell you, Aunt \u2018Becca, there\u2019s no mistake about his\nbeing a Whig. Why, his very looks shows it; everything\nabout him shows it: if I was deaf and blind, I could tell him\nby the smell. I seed him when I was down in Spring\ufb01eld\nlast winter. They had a sort of a gatherin\u2019 there one night\namong the grandees, they called a fair. All the gals about\ntown was there, and all the handsome widows and married\nwomen, \ufb01nickin\u2019 about trying to look like gals, tied as tight\nin the middle, and pu\ufb00ed out at both ends, like bundles of\nfodder that had n\u2019t been stacked yet, but wanted stackin\u2019\npretty bad. And then they had tables all around the house\nkivered over with [ \u2014\u2014 \u2014 ] caps and pincushions and ten\nthousand such little knick-knacks, tryin\u2019 to sell \u2019em to the\nfellows that were bowin\u2019, and scrapin\u2019 and kungeerin\u2019\nabout \u2019em. They would n\u2019t let no Democrats in, for fear\nthey\u2019d disgust the ladies, or scare the little gals, or dirty\nthe \ufb02oor. I looked in at the window, and there was this\nsame fellow Shields \ufb02oatin\u2019 about on the air, without heft or\nearthly substances, just like a lock of cat fur where cats had\nbeen \ufb01ghting.\n \u201cHe was paying his money to this one, and that one, and\nt\u2019 other one, and su\ufb00erin\u2019 great loss because it was n\u2019t\nsilver instead of State paper; and the sweet distress he\nseemed to be in, \u2014 his very features, in the ecstatic agony\nof his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly, \u2018Dear girls, it is\ndistressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know how\nmuch you su\ufb00er; but do, do remember, it is not my fault\nthat I am so handsome and so interesting.\u2019\n\u201cAs this last was expressed by a most exquisite\ncontortion of his face, he seized hold of one of their hands,\nand squeezed, and held on to it about a quarter of an hour.\n\u2018Oh, my good fellow!\u2019 says I to myself, \u2018if that was one of\nour Democratic gals in the Lost Townships, the way you \u2018d\nget a brass pin let into you would be about up to the head.\u2019\nHe a Democrat! Fiddlesticks! I tell you, Aunt \u2018Becca, he\u2019s a\nWhig, and no mistake; nobody but a Whig could make such\na conceity dunce of himself.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cmaybe he is; but, if he is, I \u2018m mistaken\nthe worst sort. Maybe so, maybe so; but, if I am, I\u2019ll su\ufb00er\nby it; I\u2019ll be a Democrat if it turns out that Shields is a\nWhig, considerin\u2019 you shall be a Whig if he turns out a\nDemocrat.\u201d\n\u201cA bargain, by jingoes!\u201d says he; \u201cbut how will we \ufb01nd\nout?\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d says I, \u201cwe\u2019ll just write and ax the printer.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed again!\u201d says he; \u201cand by thunder! if it does turn\nout that Shields is a Democrat, I never will \u2014 \u2014\u201d\n\u201cJe\ufb00erson! Je\ufb00erson!\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want, Peggy?\u201d\n \u201cDo get through your everlasting clatter some time, and\nbring me a gourd of water; the child\u2019s been crying for a\ndrink this livelong hour.\u201d\n\u201cLet it die, then; it may as well die for water as to be\ntaxed to death to fatten o\ufb00icers of State.\u201d\nJe\ufb00 run o\ufb00 to get the water, though, just like he hadn\u2019t\nbeen saying anything spiteful, for he\u2019s a raal good-hearted\nfellow, after all, once you get at the foundation of him.\nI walked into the house, and, \u201cWhy, Peggy,\u201d says I, \u201cI\ndeclare we like to forgot you altogether.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d says she, \u201cwhen a body can\u2019t help themselves,\neverybody soon forgets \u2019em; but, thank God! by day after\nto-morrow I shall be well enough to milk the cows, and pen\nthe calves, and wring the contrary ones\u2019 tails for \u2019em, and\nno thanks to nobody.\u201d\n\u201cGood evening, Peggy,\u201d says I, and so I sloped, for I seed\nshe was mad at me for making Je\ufb00 neglect her so long.\nAnd now, Mr. Printer, will you be sure to let us know in\nyour next paper whether this Shields is a Whig or a\nDemocrat? I don\u2019t care about it for myself, for I know well\nenough how it is already; but I want to convince Je\ufb00. It may\ndo some good to let him, and others like him, know who\nand what these o\ufb00icers of State are. It may help to send the\npresent hypocritical set to where they belong, and to \ufb01ll the\nplaces they now disgrace with men who will do more work\nfor less pay, and take fewer airs while they are doing it. It\nain\u2019t sensible to think that the same men who get us in\ntrouble will change their course; and yet it\u2019s pretty plain if\nsome change for the better is not made, it\u2019s not long that\n either Peggy or I or any of us will have a cow left to milk, or\na calf\u2019s tail to wring.\nYours truly,\nREBECCA \u2014\u2014 \u2014 .\n I\n I A I\n  \n H \n     A .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug , .\nHON.

If our information in\nthis is correct we hope you will not deny us the pleasure of\nseeing you in our State. We are aware of the toil necessarily\nincident to a journey by one circumstanced as you are; but\nonce you have embarked, as you have already determined\nto do, the toil would not be greatly augmented by extending\nthe journey to our capital. The season of the year will be\nmost favorable for good roads, and pleasant weather; and\nalthough we cannot but believe you would be highly\ngrati\ufb01ed with such a visit to the prairie-land, the pleasure it\nwould give us and thousands such as we is beyond all\nquestion. You have never visited Illinois, or at least this\nportion of it; and should you now yield to our request, we\npromise you such a reception as shall be worthy of the man\non whom are now turned the fondest hopes of a great and\nsu\ufb00ering nation.\nPlease inform us at the earliest convenience whether we\nmay expect you.\nVery respectfully your obedient servants, A.

LINCOLN, ESQ.: \u2014 I regret that my absence on\npublic business compelled me to postpone a matter of\nprivate consideration a little longer than I could have\ndesired. It will only be necessary, however, to account for it\nby informing you that I have been to Quincy on business\nthat would not admit of delay. I will now state brie\ufb02y the\nreasons of my troubling you with this communication, the\ndisagreeable nature of which I regret, as I had hoped to\navoid any di\ufb00iculty with any one in Spring\ufb01eld while\nresiding there, by endeavoring to conduct myself in such a\nway amongst both my political friends and opponents as to\nescape the necessity of any. Whilst thus abstaining from\ngiving provocation, I have become the object of slander,\nvituperation, and personal abuse, which were I capable of\nsubmitting to, I would prove myself worthy of the whole of\nit.\nIn two or three of the last numbers of the Sangamon\nJournal, articles of the most personal nature and calculated\nto degrade me have made their appearance. On inquiring, I\nwas informed by the editor of that paper, through the\nmedium of my friend General Whitesides, that you are the\n author of those articles. This information satis\ufb01es me that I\nhave become by some means or other the object of your\nsecret hostility. I will not take the trouble of inquiring into\nthe reason of all this; but I will take the liberty of requiring\na full, positive, and absolute retraction of all o\ufb00ensive\nallusions used by you in these communications, in relation\nto my private character and standing as a man, as an\napology for the insults conveyed in them.\nThis may prevent consequences which no one will regret\nmore than myself.\nYour obedient servant, JAS. SHIELDS.\n  \n  .  HI  \n .\nTREMONT, September , \nJAS. SHIELDS, ESQ.: \u2014 Your note of to-day was handed\nme by General Whitesides. In that note you say you have\nbeen informed, through the medium of the editor of the\nJournal, that I am the author of certain articles in that\npaper which you deem personally abusive of you; and\nwithout stopping to inquire whether I really am the author,\nor to point out what is o\ufb00ensive in them, you demand an\nunquali\ufb01ed retraction of all that is o\ufb00ensive, and then\nproceed to hint at consequences.\nNow, sir, there is in this so much assumption of facts and\nso much of menace as to consequences, that I cannot\nsubmit to answer that note any further than I have, and to\nadd that the consequences to which I suppose you allude\nwould be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly\ncould to you.\nRespectfully, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n A.  I\n \n \n   \n  A .  HI  \nTREMONT, September , .\nABRA. LINCOLN, ESQ.: \u2014 In reply to my note of this\ndate, you intimate that I assume facts and menace\nconsequences, and that you cannot submit to answer it\nfurther. As now, sir, you desire it, I will be a little more\nparticular. The editor of the Sangamon Journal gave me to\nunderstand that you are the author of an article which\nappeared, I think, in that paper of the d September\ninstant, headed \u201cThe Lost Townships,\u201d and signed Rebecca\nor \u2018Becca. I would therefore take the liberty of asking\nwhether you are the author of said article, or any other\nover the same signature which has appeared in any of the\nlate numbers of that paper. If so, I repeat my request of an\nabsolute retraction of all o\ufb00ensive allusions contained\ntherein in relation to my private character and standing. If\nyou are not the author of any of these articles, your denial\nwill be su\ufb00icient. I will say further, it is not my intention to\nmenace, but to do myself justice.\nYour obedient servant, JAS. SHIELDS.\n  \n A\n \n  I\n   \n  I\n   \n  . H.\n    \nA\nLincoln\u2019s Second,\nSEPTEMBER , .\nIn case Whitesides shall signify a wish to adjust this\na\ufb00air without further di\ufb00iculty, let him know that if the\npresent papers be withdrawn, and a note from Mr. Shields\nasking to know if I am the author of the articles of which he\ncomplains, and asking that I shall make him gentlemanly\nsatisfaction if I am the author, and this without menace, or\ndictation as to what that satisfaction shall be, a pledge is\nmade that the following answer shall be given: \u201cI did write\nthe \u2018Lost Townships\u2019 letter which appeared in the Journal of\nthe d instant, but had no participation in any form in any\nother article alluding to you. I wrote that wholly for\npolitical e\ufb00ect \u2014 I had no intention of injuring your\npersonal or private character or standing as a man or a\ngentleman; and I did not then think, and do not now think,\nthat that article could produce or has produced that e\ufb00ect\nagainst you; and had I anticipated such an e\ufb00ect I would\nhave forborne to write it. And I will add that your conduct\ntoward me, so far as I know, had always been gentlemanly;\nand that I had no personal pique against you, and no cause\nfor any.\u201d\n If this should be done, I leave it with you to arrange what\nshall and what shall not be published. If nothing like this is\ndone, the preliminaries of the \ufb01ght are to be \u2014 First.\nWeapons: Cavalry broadswords of the largest size, precisely\nequal in all respects, and such as now used by the cavalry\ncompany at Jacksonville.\nSecond. Position: A plank ten feet long, and from nine to\ntwelve inches broad, to be \ufb01rmly \ufb01xed on edge, on the\nground, as the line between us, which neither is to pass his\nfoot over upon forfeit of his life. Next a line drawn on the\nground on either side of said plank and parallel with it,\neach at the distance of the whole length of the sword and\nthree feet additional from the plank; and the passing of his\nown such line by either party during the \ufb01ght shall be\ndeemed a surrender of the contest.\nThird. Time: On Thursday evening at \ufb01ve o\u2019clock, if you\ncan get it so; but in no case to be at a greater distance of\ntime than Friday evening at \ufb01ve o\u2019clock.\nFourth.

Day before yesterday Shields challenged\nButler, who accepted, and proposed \ufb01ghting next morning\nat sunrise in Bob Allen\u2019s meadow, one hundred yards\u2019\ndistance, with ri\ufb02es. To this Whitesides, Shields\u2019s second,\nsaid \u201cNo,\u201d because of the law. Thus ended duel No. .\nYesterday Whitesides chose to consider himself insulted by\nDr. Merryman, so sent him a kind of quasi-challenge,\ninviting him to meet him at the Planter\u2019s House in St. Louis\non the next Friday, to settle their di\ufb00iculty. Merryman made\nme his friend, and sent Whitesides a note, inquiring to\nknow if he meant his note as a challenge, and if so, that he\nwould, according to the law in such case made and\nprovided, prescribe the terms of the meeting. Whitesides\nreturned for answer that if Merryman would meet him at\nthe Planter\u2019s House as desired, he would challenge him.\nMerryman replied in a note that he denied Whitesides\u2019s\nright to dictate time and place, but that he (Merryman)\nwould waive the question of time, and meet him at\nLouisiana, Missouri. Upon my presenting this note to\nWhitesides and stating verbally its contents, he declined\n receiving it, saying he had business in St. Louis, and it was\nas near as Louisiana. Merryman then directed me to notify\nWhitesides that he should publish the correspondence\nbetween them, with such comments as he thought \ufb01t. This I\ndid. Thus it stood at bedtime last night. This morning\nWhitesides, by his friend Shields, is praying for a new trial,\non the ground that he was mistaken in Merryman\u2019s\nproposition to meet him at Louisiana, Missouri, thinking it\nwas the State of Louisiana. This Merryman hoots at, and is\npreparing his publication; while the town is in a ferment,\nand a street \ufb01ght somewhat anticipated.\nBut I began this letter not for what I have been writing,\nbut to say something on that subject which you know to be\nof such in\ufb01nite solicitude to me. The immense su\ufb00erings\nyou endured from the \ufb01rst days of September till the\nmiddle of February you never tried to conceal from me, and\nI well understood. You have now been the husband of a\nlovely woman nearly eight months. That you are happier\nnow than the day you married her I well know, for without\nyou could not be living. But I have your word for it, too, and\nthe returning elasticity of spirits which is manifested in\nyour letters. But I want to ask a close question, \u201cAre you\nnow in feeling as well as judgment glad that you are\nmarried as you are?\u201d From anybody but me this would be\nan impudent question, not to be tolerated; but I know you\nwill pardon it in me. Please answer it quickly, as I am\nimpatient to know. I have sent my love to your Fanny so\noften, I fear she is getting tired of it. However, I venture to\ntender it again.\n Yours forever, LINCOLN.\n  \n  A\n    . I \nI\n.\nSPRINGFIELD, November , .\nJAS. S. IRWIN ESQ.: Owing to my absence, yours of the\nnd ult. was not received till this moment. Judge Logan\nand myself are willing to attend to any business in the\nSupreme Court you may send us. As to fees, it is impossible\nto establish a rule that will apply in all, or even a great\nmany cases. We believe we are never accused of being very\nunreasonable in this particular; and we would always be\neasily satis\ufb01ed, provided we could see the money \u2014 but\nwhatever fees we earn at a distance, if not paid before, we\nhave noticed, we never hear of after the work is done. We,\ntherefore, are growing a little sensitive on that point.\nYours etc., A. LINCOLN.\n     \n  I     HI \nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED. SPRINGFIELD, May , .\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 Yours of the th instant is duly\nreceived, which I do not meet as a \u201cbore,\u201d but as a most\nwelcome visitor. I will answer the business part of it \ufb01rst.\nIn relation to our Congress matter here, you were right\nin supposing I would support the nominee. Neither Baker\nnor I, however, is the man, but Hardin, so far as I can judge\nfrom present appearances. We shall have no split or trouble\nabout the matter; all will be harmony. In relation to the\n\u201ccoming events\u201d about which Butler wrote you, I had not\nheard one word before I got your letter; but I have so much\ncon\ufb01dence in the judgment of Butler on such a subject that\nI incline to think there may be some reality in it. What day\ndoes Butler appoint? By the way, how do \u201cevents\u201d of the\nsame sort come on in your family? Are you possessing\nhouses and lands, and oxen and asses, and men-servants\nand maid-servants, and begetting sons and daughters? We\nare not keeping house, but boarding at the Globe Tavern,\nwhich is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of\nBeck. Our room (the same that Dr. Wallace occupied there)\nand boarding only costs us four dollars a week. Ann Todd\nwas married something more than a year since to a fellow\nby the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says, is pretty\n much of a \u201cdunce,\u201d though he has a little money and\nproperty. They live in Boonville, Missouri, and have not\nbeen heard from lately enough for me to say anything\nabout her health. I reckon it will scarcely be in our power\nto visit Kentucky this year. Besides poverty and the\nnecessity of attending to business, those \u201ccoming events,\u201d I\nsuspect, would be somewhat in the way. I most heartily\nwish you and your Fanny would not fail to come. Just let us\nknow the time, and we will have a room provided for you at\nour house, and all be merry together for a while. Be sure to\ngive my respects to your mother and family; assure her that\nif ever I come near her, I will not fail to call and see her.\nMary joins in sending love to your Fanny and you.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n  \n \n \n.  .  . HA \nI\n.\nSPRINGFIELD, May , .\nDEAR HARDIN: KNOWING that you have correspondents\nenough, I have forborne to trouble you heretofore; and I\nnow only do so to get you to set a matter right which has\ngot wrong with one of our best friends. It is old Uncle\nThomas Campbell of Spring Creek \u2014 (Berlin P.O.). He has\nreceived several documents from you, and he says they are\nold newspapers and documents, having no sort of interest\nin them. He is, therefore, getting a strong impression that\nyou treat him with disrespect. This, I know, is a mistaken\nimpression; and you must correct it. The way, I leave to\nyourself. Rob\u2019t W. Can\ufb01eld says he would like to have a\ndocument or two from you.\nThe Locos (Democrats) here are in considerable trouble\nabout Van Buren\u2019s letter on Texas, and the Virginia\nelectors. They are growing sick of the Tari\ufb00 question; and\nconsequently are much confounded at V.B.\u2019s cutting them\no\ufb00 from the new Texas question. Nearly half the leaders\nswear they won\u2019t stand it. Of those are Ford, T. Campbell,\nEwing, Calhoun and others. They don\u2019t exactly say they\nwon\u2019t vote for V.B., but they say he will not be the\ncandidate, and that they are for Texas anyhow.\nAs ever yours, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n       I\n \n   \n    I\nA   A\nI\nA  \nTO Gen. J. J. HARDIN, SPRINGFIELD, Jany. , .\nDEAR GENERAL:\nI do not wish to join in your proposal of a new plan for\nthe selection of a Whig candidate for Congress because:\nst. I am entirely satis\ufb01ed with the old system under which\nyou and Baker were successively nominated and elected to\nCongress; and because the Whigs of the district are well\nacquainted with the system, and, so far as I know or\nbelieve, are well satis\ufb01ed with it. If the old system be\nthought to be vague, as to all the delegates of the county\nvoting the same way, or as to instructions to them as to\nwhom they are to vote for, or as to \ufb01lling vacancies, I am\nwilling to join in a provision to make these matters certain.\nd. As to your proposals that a poll shall be opened in\nevery precinct, and that the whole shall take place on the\nsame day, I do not personally object. They seem to me to be\nnot unfair; and I forbear to join in proposing them only\nbecause I choose to leave the decision in each county to the\nWhigs of the county, to be made as their own judgment and\nconvenience may dictate.\nd. As to your proposed stipulation that all the\ncandidates shall remain in their own counties, and restrain\ntheir friends in the same it seems to me that on re\ufb02ection\n you will see the fact of your having been in Congress has,\nin various ways, so spread your name in the district as to\ngive you a decided advantage in such a stipulation. I\nappreciate your desire to keep down excitement; and I\npromise you to \u201ckeep cool\u201d under all circumstances.\nth. I have already said I am satis\ufb01ed with the old system\nunder which such good men have triumphed and that I\ndesire no departure from its principles. But if there must be\na departure from it, I shall insist upon a more accurate and\njust apportionment of delegates, or representative votes, to\nthe constituent body, than exists by the old, and which you\npropose to retain in your new plan. If we take the entire\npopulation of the counties as shown by the late census, we\nshall see by the old plan, and by your proposed new plan,\nMorgan County, with a population ,, has but ....... \nvotes While Sangamon with , \u2014  greater has but\n.......  \u201c\nSo Scott with  has .................................  \u201c\nWhile Tazewell with   greater has but ..........  \u201c\nSo Mason with  has .................................  vote\nWhile Logan with ,  greater, has but ............  \u201c\nAnd so on in a less degree the matter runs through all\nthe counties, being not only wrong in principle, but the\nadvantage of it being all manifestly in your favor with one\nslight exception, in the comparison of two counties not here\nmentioned.\nAgain, if we take the Whig votes of the counties as shown\nby the late Presidential election as a basis, the thing is still\nworse.\n It seems to me most obvious that the old system needs\nadjustment in nothing so much as in this; and still, by your\nproposal, no notice is taken of it. I have always been in the\nhabit of acceding to almost any proposal that a friend\nwould make and I am truly sorry that I cannot in this. I\nperhaps ought to mention that some friends at di\ufb00erent\nplaces are endeavoring to secure the honor of the sitting of\nthe convention at their towns respectively, and I fear that\nthey would not feel much complimented if we shall make a\nbargain that it should sit nowhere.\nYours as ever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n \nI  IA\n \nSPRINGFIELD, March , .\nFRIEND WILLIAMS: The Supreme Court adjourned this\nmorning for the term. Your cases of Reinhardt vs. Schuyler,\nBunce vs. Schuyler, Dickhut vs. Dunell, and Sullivan vs.\nAndrews are continued. Hinman vs. Pope I wrote you\nconcerning some time ago. McNutt et al. vs. Bean and\nThompson is reversed and remanded.\nFitzpatrick vs. Brady et al. is reversed and remanded\nwith leave to complainant to amend his bill so as to show\nthe real consideration given for the land.\nBunce against Graves the court con\ufb01rmed, wherefore, in\naccordance with your directions, I moved to have the case\nremanded to enable you to take a new trial in the court\nbelow. The court allowed the motion; of which I am glad,\nand I guess you are.\nThis, I believe, is all as to court business. The canal men\nhave got their measure through the Legislature pretty\nmuch or quite in the shape they desired. Nothing else now.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n A \n I I\n \n  \n \nTO WILLIAMSON DURLEY.\nSPRINGFIELD, OCTOBER , \nWhen I saw you at home, it was agreed that I should\nwrite to you and your brother Madison. Until I then saw\nyou I was not aware of your being what is generally called\nan abolitionist, or, as you call yourself, a Liberty man,\nthough I well knew there were many such in your country.\nI was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring\nabout, at the next election in Putnam, a Union of the Whigs\nproper and such of the Liberty men as are Whigs in\nprinciple on all questions save only that of slavery. So far as\nI can perceive, by such union neither party need yield\nanything on the point in di\ufb00erence between them. If the\nWhig abolitionists of New York had voted with us last fall,\nMr. Clay would now be President, Whig principles in the\nascendant, and Texas not annexed; whereas, by the\ndivision, all that either had at stake in the contest was lost.\nAnd, indeed, it was extremely probable, beforehand, that\nsuch would be the result. As I always understood, the\nLiberty men deprecated the annexation of Texas extremely;\nand this being so, why they should refuse to cast their votes\n[so] as to prevent it, even to me seemed wonderful. What\nwas their process of reasoning, I can only judge from what\n a single one of them told me. It was this: \u201cWe are not to do\nevil that good may come.\u201d This general proposition is\ndoubtless correct; but did it apply? If by your votes you\ncould have prevented the extension, etc., of slavery would\nit not have been good, and not evil, so to have used your\nvotes, even though it involved the casting of them for a\nslaveholder? By the fruit the tree is to be known. An evil\ntree cannot bring forth good fruit. If the fruit of electing\nMr. Clay would have been to prevent the extension of\nslavery, could the act of electing have been evil?\nBut I will not argue further. I perhaps ought to say that\nindividually I never was much interested in the Texas\nquestion. I never could see much good to come of\nannexation, inasmuch as they were already a free\nrepublican people on our own model. On the other hand, I\nnever could very clearly see how the annexation would\naugment the evil of slavery. It always seemed to me that\nslaves would be taken there in about equal numbers, with\nor without annexation. And if more were taken because of\nannexation, still there would be just so many the fewer left\nwhere they were taken from. It is possibly true, to some\nextent, that, with annexation, some slaves may be sent to\nTexas and continued in slavery that otherwise might have\nbeen liberated. To whatever extent this may be true, I think\nannexation an evil. I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in\nthe free States, due to the Union of the States, and perhaps\nto liberty itself (paradox though it may seem), to let the\nslavery of the other States alone; while, on the other hand,\nI hold it to be equally clear that we should never knowingly\n lend ourselves, directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery\nfrom dying a natural death \u2014 to \ufb01nd new places for it to\nlive in when it can no longer exist in the old. Of course I am\nnot now considering what would be our duty in cases of\ninsurrection among the slaves. To recur to the Texas\nquestion, I understand the Liberty men to have viewed\nannexation as a much greater evil than ever I did; and I\nwould like to convince you, if I could, that they could have\nprevented it, if they had chosen. I intend this letter for you\nand Madison together; and if you and he or either shall\nthink \ufb01t to drop me a line, I shall be pleased.\nYours with respect, A. LINCOLN.\n",

LINCOLN SAID he had not risen for the purpose of\nmaking a speech, but only for the purpose of meeting some\nof the objections to the bill. If he understood those\nobjections, the \ufb01rst was that if the bill were to become a\nlaw, it would be used to lock large portions of the public\nlands from sale, without at last e\ufb00ecting the ostensible\nobject of the bill \u2014 the construction of railroads in the new\nStates; and secondly, that Congress would be forced to the\nabandonment of large portions of the public lands to the\nStates for which they might be reserved, without their\npaying for them. This he understood to be the substance of\nthe objections of the gentleman from Ohio to the passage of\nthe bill.\nIf he could get the attention of the House for a few\nminutes, he would ask gentlemen to tell us what motive\ncould induce any State Legislature, or individual, or\ncompany of individuals, of the new States, to expend money\nin surveying roads which they might know they could not\nmake.\n(A voice: They are not required to make the road.)\n Mr. Lincoln continued: That was not the case he was\nmaking. What motive would tempt any set of men to go into\nan extensive survey of a railroad which they did not intend\nto make? What good would it do? Did men act without\nmotive? \nDid \nbusiness \nmen \ncommonly \ngo \ninto \nan\nexpenditure of money which could be of no account to\nthem? He generally found that men who have money were\ndisposed to hold on to it, unless they could see something\nto be made by its investment. He could not see what motive\nof advantage to the new States could be subserved by\nmerely keeping the public lands out of market, and\npreventing their settlement. As far as he could see, the new\nStates were wholly without any motive to do such a thing.\nThis, then, he took to be a good answer to the \ufb01rst\nobjection.\nIn relation to the fact assumed, that after a while, the\nnew States having got hold of the public lands to a certain\nextent, they would turn round and compel Congress to\nrelinquish all claim to them, he had a word to say, by way of\nrecurring to the history of the past. When was the time to\ncome (he asked) when the States in which the public lands\nwere \nsituated \nwould \ncompose \na \nmajority \nof \nthe\nrepresentation in Congress, or anything like it? A majority\nof Representatives would very soon reside west of the\nmountains, he admitted; but would they all come from\nStates in which the public lands were situated? They\ncertainly would not; for, as these Western States grew\nstrong in Congress, the public lands passed away from\nthem, and they got on the other side of the question; and\n the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Vinton] was an example\nattesting that fact.\nMr. Vinton interrupted here to say that he had stood on\nthis question just where he was now, for \ufb01ve and twenty\nyears.\nMr. Lincoln was not making an argument for the purpose\nof convicting the gentleman of any impropriety at all. He\nwas speaking of a fact in history, of which his State was an\nexample. He was referring to a plain principle in the nature\nof things. The State of Ohio had now grown to be a giant.\nShe had a large delegation on that \ufb02oor; but was she now\nin favor of granting lands to the new States, as she used to\nbe? The New England States, New York, and the Old\nThirteen were all rather quiet upon the subject; and it was\nseen just now that a member from one of the new States\nwas the \ufb01rst man to rise up in opposition. And such would\nbe with the history of this question for the future. There\nnever would come a time when the people residing in the\nStates embracing the public lands would have the entire\ncontrol of this subject; and so it was a matter of certainty\nthat Congress would never do more in this respect than\nwhat \nwould \nbe \ndictated \nby \na \njust \nliberality. \nThe\napprehension, therefore, that the public lands were in\ndanger of being wrested from the General Government by\nthe strength of the delegation in Congress from the new\nStates, was utterly futile. There never could be such a\nthing. If we take these lands (said he) it will not be without\nyour consent. We can never outnumber you. The result is\nthat all fear of the new States turning against the right of\n Congress to the public domain must be e\ufb00ectually quelled,\nas those who are opposed to that interest must always hold\na vast majority here, and they will never surrender the\nwhole or any part of the public lands unless they\nthemselves choose to do so. That was all he desired to say.\n    \n  A   \n I I A  A  \nI\n \n \n \nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\nWASHINGTON, MARCH , .\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\nDEAR SIR: Colonel R. D.

We have reason to think the\nWhigs of that State hold us responsible, to some extent, for\nthe appointments which may be made of our citizens. We\ndo not know you personally, and our e\ufb00orts to you have so\nfar been unavailing. I therefore hope I am not obtrusive in\nsaying in this way, for him and myself, that when a citizen\nof Illinois is to be appointed in your department, to an\no\ufb00ice either in or out of the State, we most respectfully ask\nto be heard.\nYour obedient servant, A.

SECRETARY OF STATE.\nSIR: \u2014 There are several applicants for the o\ufb00ice of\nUnited States Marshal for the District of Illinois. Among the\nmost prominent of them are Benjamin Bond, Esq., of\nCarlyle, and Thomas, Esq., of Galena. Mr. Bond I know to\nbe personally every way worthy of the o\ufb00ice; and he is very\nnumerously and most respectably recommended. His\npapers I send to you; and I solicit for his claims a full and\nfair consideration.\nHaving said this much, I add that in my individual\njudgment the appointment of Mr. Thomas would be the\nbetter.\nYour obedient servant,\nA. LINCOLN.\n(Indorsed on Mr. Bond\u2019s papers.) In this and the\naccompanying envelope are the recommendations of about\ntwo hundred good citizens of all parts of Illinois, that\nBenjamin Bond be appointed marshal for that district. They\ninclude the names of nearly all our Whigs who now are, or\nhave ever been, members of the State Legislature, besides\nforty-six of the Democratic members of the present\n Legislature, and many other good citizens. I add that from\npersonal knowledge I consider Mr. Bond every way worthy\nof the o\ufb00ice, and quali\ufb01ed to \ufb01ll it. Holding the individual\nopinion that the appointment of a di\ufb00erent gentleman\nwould be better, I ask especial attention and consideration\nfor his claims, and for the opinions expressed in his favor\nby those over whom I can claim no superiority.\nA.

SECRETARY OF THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 I recommend that Walter Davis be\nappointed receiver of the land-o\ufb00ice at this place,\nwhenever there shall be a vacancy. I cannot say that Mr.\nHerndon, the present incumbent, has failed in the proper\ndischarge of any of the duties of the o\ufb00ice. He is a very\nwarm partisan, and openly and actively opposed to the\nelection of General Taylor. I also understand that since\nGeneral Taylor\u2019s election he has received a reappointment\nfrom Mr. Polk, his old commission not having expired.\nWhether this is true the records of the department will\nshow. I may add that the Whigs here almost universally\ndesire his removal.\nI give no opinion of my own, but state the facts, and\nexpress the hope that the department will act in this as in\nall other cases on some proper general rule.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\nP.

Ellis be\nappointed postmaster at this place, whenever there shall be\na vacancy. J. R. Diller, the present incumbent, I cannot say\nhas failed in the proper discharge of any of the duties of the\no\ufb00ice. He, however, has been an active partisan in\nopposition to us.\nLocated at the seat of government of the State, he has\nbeen, for part if not the whole of the time he has held the\no\ufb00ice, a member of the Democratic State Central\nCommittee, signing his name to their addresses and\nmanifestoes; and has been, as I understand, reappointed by\nMr. Polk since General Taylor\u2019s election. These are the facts\nof the case as I understand them, and I give no opinion of\nmine as to whether he should or should not be removed.\nMy wish is that the department may adopt some proper\ngeneral rule for such cases, and that Mr. Diller may not be\nmade an exception to it, one way or the other.\nYour obedient servant, A.

This o\ufb00ice is not con\ufb01ned\nto my district, but pertains to the whole State; so that\nColonel Baker has an equal right with myself to be heard\nconcerning it.

This morning it is openly\navowed that my supposed in\ufb02uence at Washington shall be\nbroken down generally, and King\u2019s prospects defeated in\nparticular. Now, what I have done in this matter I have\ndone at the request of you and some other friends in\nTazewell; and I therefore ask you to either admit it is wrong\nor come forward and sustain me. If the truth will permit, I\npropose that you sustain me in the following manner: copy\nthe inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and get\neverybody (not three or four, but three or four hundred) to\nsign it, and then send it to me. Also, have six, eight or ten\nof our best known Whig friends there write to me individual\nletters, stating the truth in this matter as they understand\nit. Don\u2019t neglect or delay in the matter. I understand\ninformation of an indictment having been found against him\nabout three years ago, for gaming or keeping a gaming\nhouse, has been sent to the department. I shall try to take\ncare of it at the department till your action can be had and\nforwarded on.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  H        A   \n   H  I\n   I\n .\nSPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS. May , .\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 I regret troubling you so often in relation\nto the land-o\ufb00ices here, but I hope you will perceive the\nnecessity of it, and excuse me. On the th of April I wrote\nyou recommending Turner R. King for register, and Walter\nDavis for receiver. Subsequently I wrote you that, for a\nprivate reason, I had concluded to transpose them. That\nprivate reason was the request of an old personal friend\nwho himself desired to be receiver, but whom I felt it my\nduty to refuse a recommendation. He said if I would\ntranspose King and Davis he would be satis\ufb01ed. I thought it\na whim, but, anxious to oblige him, I consented.\nImmediately he commenced an assault upon King\u2019s\ncharacter, \nintending, \nas \nI \nsuppose, \nto \ndefeat \nhis\nappointment, and thereby secure another chance for\nhimself. This double o\ufb00ence of bad faith to me and slander\nupon a good man is so totally outrageous that I now ask to\nhave King and Davis placed as I originally recommended, \u2014\nthat is, King for register and Davis for receiver.\nAn e\ufb00ort is being made now to have Mr. Barret, the\npresent register, retained. I have already said he has done\nthe duties of the o\ufb00ice well, and I now add he is a\n gentleman in the true sense. Still, he submits to be the\ninstrument of his party to injure us. His high character\nenables him to do it more e\ufb00ectually. Last year he presided\nat the convention which nominated the Democratic\ncandidate for Congress in this district, and afterward ran\nfor the State Senate himself, not desiring the seat, but\navowedly to aid and strengthen his party. He made speech\nafter speech with a degree of \ufb01erceness and coarseness\nagainst General Taylor not quite consistent with his\nhabitually gentlemanly deportment. At least one (and I\nthink more) of those who are now trying to have him\nretained was himself an applicant for this very o\ufb00ice, and,\nfailing to get my recommendation, now takes this turn.\nIn writing you a third time in relation to these o\ufb00ices, I\nstated that I supposed charges had been forwarded to you\nagainst King, and that I would inquire into the truth of\nthem. I now send you herewith what I suppose will be an\nample defense against any such charges. I ask attention to\nall the papers, but particularly to the letters of Mr. David\nMack, and the paper with the long list of names. There is\nno mistake about King\u2019s being a good man. After the unjust\nassault upon him, and considering the just claims of\nTazewell County, as indicated in the letters I inclose you, it\nwould in my opinion be injustice, and withal a blunder, not\nto appoint him, at least as soon as any one is appointed to\neither of the o\ufb00ices here.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  . \nI     I .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., May , .\nDEAR GILLESPIE: Butter\ufb01eld will be commissioner of\nthe Gen\u2019l Land O\ufb00ice, unless prevented by strong and\nspeedy e\ufb00orts. Ewing is for him, and he is only not\nappointed yet because Old Zach. hangs \ufb01re.\nI have reliable information of this. Now, if you agree with\nme that this appointment would dissatisfy rather than\ngratify the Whigs of this State, that it would slacken their\nenergies in future contests, that his appointment in \u2018 is\nan old sore with them which they will not patiently have\nreopened, \u2014 in a word that his appointment now would be\na fatal blunder to the administration and our political men\nhere in Illinois, write Crittenden to that e\ufb00ect. He can\ncontrol the matter. Were you to write Ewing I fear the\nPresident would never hear of your letter. This may be\nmere suspicion. You might write directly to Old Zach. You\nwill be the best judge of the propriety of that. Not a\nmoment\u2019s time is to be lost.\nLet this be con\ufb01dential except with Mr. Edwards and a\nfew others whom you know I would trust just as I do you.\nYours as ever, A.

EMBREE\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 I am about to ask a favor of you, one which\nI hope will not cost you much. I understand the General\nLand-O\ufb00ice is about to be given to Illinois, and that Mr.\nEwing desires Justin Butter\ufb01eld, of Chicago, to be the man.\nI give you my word, the appointment of Mr. Butter\ufb01eld will\nbe an egregious political blunder. It will give o\ufb00ence to the\nwhole Whig party here, and be worse than a dead loss to\nthe administration of so much of its patronage. Now, if you\ncan conscientiously do so, I wish you to write General\nTaylor at once, saying that either I or the man I recommend\nshould in your opinion be appointed to that o\ufb00ice, if any\none from Illinois shall be. I restrict my request to Illinois\nbecause you may have a man from your own State, and I do\nnot ask to interfere with that.\nYour friend as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n   \n     \n  A  A  \nIMPROVED METHOD OF LIFTING VESSELS OVER\nSHOALS.\nAPPLICATION FOR PATENT: What I claim as my invention,\nand desire to secure by letters patent, is the combination of\nexpansible buoyant chambers placed at the sides of a\nvessel with the main shaft or shafts by means of the sliding\nspars, which pass down through the buoyant chambers and\nare made fast to their bottoms and the series of ropes and\npulleys or their equivalents in such a manner that by\nturning the main shaft or shafts in one direction the\nbuoyant chambers will be forced downward into the water,\nand at the same time expanded and \ufb01lled with air for\nbuoying up the vessel by the displacement of water, and by\nturning the shafts in an opposite direction the buoyant\nchambers will be contracted into a small space and secured\nagainst injury.\nA.

If any one man is\nbetter quali\ufb01ed for such an o\ufb00ice than all others, Dr. Stapp\nis that man; still, I believe a large majority of the Whigs of\nthe district prefer Mr. Remann, who also is a good man.\nPerhaps the papers on \ufb01le will enable you to judge better\nthan I can.

There must be some mistake about\nWalter Davis saying I promised him the post-o\ufb00ice. I did not\nso promise him. I did tell him that if the distribution of the\no\ufb00ices should fall into my hands, he should have\nsomething; and if I shall be convinced he has said any more\nthan this, I shall be disappointed. I said this much to him\nbecause, as I understand, he is of good character, is one of\nthe young men, is of the mechanics, and always faithful and\nnever troublesome; a Whig, and is poor, with the support of\na widow mother thrown almost exclusively on him by the\ndeath of his brother. If these are wrong reasons, then I\nhave been wrong; but I have certainly not been sel\ufb01sh in it,\nbecause in my greatest need of friends he was against me,\nand for Baker.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\nP. S. Let the above be con\ufb01dential.\n  \n  . \nI     I .\nDEAR GILLESPIE: \nMR. EDWARDS IS unquestionably o\ufb00ended with me in\nconnection with the matter of the General Land-O\ufb00ice. He\nwrote a letter against me which was \ufb01led at the\ndepartment.\nThe better part of one\u2019s life consists of his friendships;\nand, of them, mine with Mr. Edwards was one of the most\ncherished. I have not been false to it. At a word I could\nhave had the o\ufb00ice any time before the department was\ncommitted to Mr. Butter\ufb01eld, at least Mr. Ewing and the\nPresident say as much. That word I forbore to speak, partly\nfor other reasons, but chie\ufb02y for Mr. Edwards\u2019 sake, losing\nthe o\ufb00ice (that he might gain it) I was always for; but to\nlose his friendship, by the e\ufb00ort for him, would oppress me\nvery \nmuch, \nwere \nI \nnot \nsustained \nby \nthe \nutmost\nconsciousness of rectitude. I \ufb01rst determined to be an\napplicant, unconditionally, on the nd of June; and I did so\nthen upon being informed by a telegraphic despatch that\nthe question was narrowed down to Mr. B and myself, and\nthat the Cabinet had postponed the appointment three\nweeks, for my bene\ufb01t. Not doubting that Mr. Edwards was\nwholly out of the question I, nevertheless, would not then\nhave become an applicant had I supposed he would thereby\nbe brought to suspect me of treachery to him. Two or three\n days afterwards a conversation with Levi Davis convinced\nme Mr. Edwards was dissatis\ufb01ed; but I was then too far in\nto get out. His own letter, written on the th of April, after\nI had fully informed him of all that had passed, up to within\na few days of that time, gave assurance I had that entire\ncon\ufb01dence from him which I felt my uniform and strong\nfriendship for him entitled me to. Among other things it\nsays, \u201cWhatever course your judgment may dictate as\nproper to be pursued, shall never be excepted to by me.\u201d I\nalso had had a letter from Washington, saying Chambers, of\nthe Republic, had brought a rumor then, that Mr. E had\ndeclined in my favor, which rumor I judged came from Mr.\nE himself, as I had not then breathed of his letter to any\nliving creature. In saying I had never, before the nd of\nJune, determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, I\nmean to admit that, before then, I had said substantially I\nwould take the o\ufb00ice rather than it should be lost to the\nState, or given to one in the State whom the Whigs did not\nwant; but I aver that in every instance in which I spoke of\nmyself, I intended to keep, and now believe I did keep, Mr.\nE above myself. Mr. Edwards\u2019 \ufb01rst suspicion was that I had\nallowed Baker to overreach me, as his friend, in behalf of\nDon Morrison. I knew this was a mistake; and the result\nhas proved it. I understand his view now is, that if I had\ngone to open war with Baker I could have ridden him down,\nand had the thing all my own way. I believe no such thing.\nWith Baker and some strong man from the Military tract \nelsewhere for Morrison, and we and some strong man from\nthe Wabash \n elsewhere for Mr. E, it was not possible for\n either to succeed. I believed this in March, and I know it\nnow. The only thing which gave either any chance was the\nvery thing Baker \n I proposed, \u2014 an adjustment with\nthemselves.\nYou may wish to know how Butter\ufb01eld \ufb01nally beat me. I\ncan not tell you particulars now, but will when I see you.

WILLIAM FITHIAN, Danville, Ill.\nDEAR DOCTOR: \u2014 Your letter of the th was received a\nday or two ago. The notes and mortgages you enclosed me\nwere duly received. I also got the original Blanchard\nmortgage from Antrim Campbell, with whom Blanchard had\nleft it for you. I got a decree of foreclosure on the whole;\nbut, owing to there being no redemption on the sale to be\nunder the Blanchard mortgage, the court allowed Mobley\ntill the \ufb01rst of March to pay the money, before advertising\nfor sale. Stuart was empowered by Mobley to appear for\nhim, and I had to take such decree as he would consent to,\nor none at all. I cast the matter about in my mind and\nconcluded that as I could not get a decree we would put the\naccrued interest at interest, and thereby more than match\nthe fact of throwing the Blanchard debt back from twelve to\nsix per cent., it was better to do it. This is the present state\nof the case.\nI can well enough understand and appreciate your\nsuggestions about the Land-O\ufb00ice at Danville; but in my\npresent condition, I can do nothing.\nYours, as ever, A.

From the\nbeginning of our acquaintance I had felt the greatest\nkindness for you and had supposed it was reciprocated on\nyour part. Last summer, under circumstances which I\nmentioned to you, I was painfully constrained to withhold a\nrecommendation which you desired, and shortly afterwards\nI learned, in such a way as to believe it, that you were\nindulging in open abuse of me. Of course my feelings were\nwounded. On receiving your last letter the question\noccurred whether you were attempting to use me at the\nsame time you would injure me, or whether you might not\nhave been misrepresented to me. If the former, I ought not\nto answer you; if the latter, I ought, and so I have remained\nin suspense. I now enclose you the letter, which you may\nuse if you see \ufb01t.\nYours, etc., A. LINCOLN.\n     \n  \n \n   \n H \n     A \nDELIVERED IN THE STATE HOUSE AT SPRINGFIELD,\nILLINOIS, JULY , .\nON THE FOURTH day of July, , the people of a few\nfeeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain, inhabiting a\nportion of the Atlantic coast of North America, publicly\ndeclared their national independence, and made their\nappeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles\nfor the maintenance of that declaration. That people were\nfew in number and without resources, save only their wise\nheads and stout hearts. Within the \ufb01rst year of that\ndeclared independence, and while its maintenance was yet\nproblematical, while the bloody struggle between those\nresolute rebels and their haughty would-be masters was\nstill waging, \u2014 of undistinguished parents and in an\nobscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay was\nborn. The infant nation and the infant child began the race\nof life together. For three quarters of a century they have\ntravelled hand in hand. They have been companions ever.\nThe nation has passed its perils, and it is free, prosperous,\nand powerful. The child has reached his manhood, his\nmiddle age, his old age, and is dead. In all that has\nconcerned the nation the man ever sympathized; and now\nthe nation mourns the man.\n The day after his death one of the public journals,\nopposed to him politically, held the following pathetic and\nbeautiful language, which I adopt partly because such high\nand exclusive eulogy, originating with a political friend,\nmight o\ufb00end good taste, but chie\ufb02y because I could not in\nany language of my own so well express my thoughts:\n\u201cAlas, who can realize that Henry Clay is dead! Who can\nrealize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the\ncouncil-chambers of his country to beat back the storms of\nanarchy which may threaten, or pour the oil of peace upon\nthe troubled billows as they rage and menace around! Who\ncan realize that the workings of that mighty mind have\nceased, that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled,\nthat the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no\nmore, and the magic of that eloquent tongue, which spake\nas spake no other tongue besides, is hushed hushed for\never! Who can realize that freedom\u2019s champion, the\nchampion of a civilized world and of all tongues and\nkindreds of people, has indeed fallen! Alas, in those dark\nhours of peril and dread which our land has experienced,\nand which she may be called to experience again, to whom\nnow may her people look up for that counsel and advice\nwhich only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give,\nand which only the undoubting con\ufb01dence of a nation will\nreceive? Perchance in the whole circle of the great and\ngifted of our land there remains but one on whose\nshoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman\nmay fall; one who while we now write is doubtless pouring\nhis tears over the bier of his brother and friend brother,\n friend, ever, yet in political sentiment as far apart as party\ncould make them. Ah, it is at times like these that the petty\ndistinctions of mere party disappear. We see only the great,\nthe grand, the noble features of the departed statesman;\nand we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and\nmingle our tears with those who have ever been his\npolitical adherents \u2014 we do [not] beg this permission, we\nclaim it as a right, though we feel it as a privilege. Henry\nClay belonged to his country \u2014 to the world; mere party\ncannot claim men like him. His career has been national,\nhis fame has \ufb01lled the earth, his memory will endure to the\nlast syllable of recorded time.\n\u201cHenry Clay is dead! He breathed his last on yesterday,\nat twenty minutes after eleven, in his chamber at\nWashington. To those who followed his lead in public\na\ufb00airs, it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his\neulogy and pay speci\ufb01c honors to the memory of the\nillustrious dead. But all Americans may show the grief\nwhich his death inspires, for his character and fame are\nnational property. As on a question of liberty he knew no\nNorth, no South, no East, no West, but only the Union\nwhich held them all in its sacred circle, so now his\ncountrymen will know no grief that is not as wide-spread as\nthe bounds of the confederacy. The career of Henry Clay\nwas a public career. From his youth he has been devoted to\nthe public service, at a period, too, in the world\u2019s history\njustly regarded as a remarkable era in human a\ufb00airs. He\nwitnessed in the beginning the throes of the French\nRevolution. He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon. He was\n called upon to legislate for America and direct her policy\nwhen all Europe was the battle\ufb01eld of contending\ndynasties, and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled\nthe rights of all neutral nations. His voice spoke war and\npeace in the contest with Great Britain.\n\u201cWhen Greece rose against the Turks and struck for\nliberty, his name was mingled with the battle-cry of\nfreedom. When South America threw o\ufb00 the thraldom of\nSpain, his speeches were read at the head of her armies by\nBolivar. His name has been, and will continue to be,\nhallowed in two hemispheres, for it is\n\u201c\u2018One of the few, the immortal names\nThat were not born to die!\u2019\n\u201cTo the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added\na quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth. His\neloquence has not been surpassed. In the e\ufb00ective power to\nmove the heart of man, Clay was without an equal, and the\nheaven-born endowment, in the spirit of its origin, has been\nmost conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud. On at\nleast three important occasions he has quelled our civil\ncommotions by a power and in\ufb02uence which belonged to no\nother statesman of his age and times. And in our last\ninternal discord, when this Union trembled to its centre, in\nold age he left the shades of private life, and gave the\ndeath-blow to fraternal strife, with the vigor of his earlier\nyears, in a series of senatorial e\ufb00orts which in themselves\nwould bring immortality by challenging comparison with\nthe e\ufb00orts of any statesman in any age. He exorcised the\ndemon which possessed the body politic, and gave peace to\n a distracted land. Alas! the achievement cost him his life.\nHe sank day by day to the tomb his pale but noble brow\nbound with a triple wreath, put there by a grateful country.\nMay his ashes rest in peace, while his spirit goes to take its\nstation among the great and good men who preceded him.\u201d\nWhile it is customary and proper upon occasions like the\npresent to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased, in\nthe case of Mr. Clay it is less necessary than most others;\nfor his biography has been written and rewritten and read\nand reread for the last twenty-\ufb01ve years; so that, with the\nexception of a few of the latest incidents of his life, all is as\nwell known as it can be. The short sketch which I give is,\ntherefore, merely to maintain the connection of this\ndiscourse.\nHenry Clay was born on the twelfth day of April, , in\nHanover County, Virginia. Of his father, who died in the\nfourth or \ufb01fth year of Henry\u2019s age, little seems to be known,\nexcept that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the\nBaptist persuasion. Mr. Clay\u2019s education to the end of life\nwas comparatively limited. I say \u201cto the end of life,\u201d\nbecause I have understood that from time to time he added\nsomething to his education during the greater part of his\nwhole life. Mr. Clay\u2019s lack of a more perfect early\neducation, however it may be regretted generally, teaches\nat least one pro\ufb01table lesson: it teaches that in this country\none can scarcely be so poor but that, if he will, he can\nacquire su\ufb00icient education to get through the world\nrespectably. In his twenty-third year Mr. Clay was licensed\nto practise law, and emigrated to Lexington, Kentucky. Here\n he commenced and continued the practice till the year\n, when he was \ufb01rst elected to the Kentucky\nLegislature. By successive elections he was continued in\nthe Legislature till the latter part of , when he was\nelected to \ufb01ll a vacancy of a single session in the United\nStates Senate. In  he was again elected to the\nKentucky House of Representatives, and by that body\nchosen Speaker. In  he was re-elected to the same\nbody. In  he was again chosen to \ufb01ll a vacancy of two\nyears in the United States Senate. In  he was elected\nto the United States House of Representatives, and on the\n\ufb01rst day of taking his seat in that body he was chosen its\nSpeaker. In  he was again elected Speaker. Early in\n, being the period of our last British war, Mr. Clay was\nsent as commissioner, with others, to negotiate a treaty of\npeace, which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the\nsame year. On his return from Europe he was again elected\nto the lower branch of Congress, and on taking his seat in\nDecember, , was called to his old post-the Speaker\u2019s\nchair, a position in which he was retained by successive\nelections, with one brief intermission, till the inauguration\nof John Quincy Adams, in March, . He was then\nappointed Secretary of State, and occupied that important\nstation till the inauguration of General Jackson, in March,\n. After this he returned to Kentucky, resumed the\npractice of law, and continued it till the autumn of ,\nwhen he was by the Legislature of Kentucky again placed in\nthe United States Senate. By a reelection he was continued\nin the Senate till he resigned his seat and retired, in March,\n . In December, , he again took his seat in the\nSenate, which he again resigned only a few months before\nhis death.\nBy the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the\nbeginning of Mr. Clay\u2019s o\ufb00icial life in  to the end of\n is but one year short of half a century, and that the\nsum of all the intervals in it will not amount to ten years.\nBut mere duration of time in o\ufb00ice constitutes the smallest\npart of Mr. Clay\u2019s history. Throughout that long period he\nhas constantly been the most loved and most implicitly\nfollowed by friends, and the most dreaded by opponents, of\nall living American politicians. In all the great questions\nwhich have agitated the country, and particularly in those\nfearful crises, the Missouri question, the nulli\ufb01cation\nquestion, and the late slavery question, as connected with\nthe newly acquired territory, involving and endangering the\nstability of the Union, his has been the leading and most\nconspicuous part. In  he was \ufb01rst a candidate for the\nPresidency, and was defeated; and, although he was\nsuccessively defeated for the same o\ufb00ice in  and in\n, there has never been a moment since  till after\n when a very large portion of the American people did\nnot cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of\nstill elevating him to the Presidency. With other men, to be\ndefeated was to be forgotten; but with him defeat was but a\ntri\ufb02ing incident, neither changing him nor the world\u2019s\nestimate of him. Even those of both political parties who\nhave been preferred to him for the highest o\ufb00ice have run\nfar briefer courses than he, and left him still shining high in\n the heavens of the political world. Jackson, Van Buren,\nHarnson, Polk, and Taylor all rose after, and set long before\nhim. The spell \u2014 the long-enduring spell \u2014 with which the\nsouls of men were bound to him is a miracle. Who can\ncompass it? It is probably true he owed his pre-eminence to\nno one quality, but to a fortunate combination of several.\nHe was surpassingly eloquent; but many eloquent men fail\nutterly, and they are not, as a class, generally successful.\nHis judgment was excellent; but many men of good\njudgment live and die unnoticed. His will was indomitable;\nbut this quality often secures to its owner nothing better\nthan a character for useless obstinacy. These, then, were\nMr. Clay\u2019s leading qualities. No one of them is very\nuncommon; but all together are rarely combined in a single\nindividual, and this is probably the reason why such men as\nHenry Clay are so rare in the world.\nMr. Clay\u2019s eloquence did not consist, as many \ufb01ne\nspecimens of eloquence do, of types and \ufb01gures, of\nantithesis \nand \nelegant \narrangement \nof \nwords \nand\nsentences, \nbut \nrather \nof \nthat \ndeeply \nearnest \nand\nimpassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from\ngreat sincerity, and a thorough conviction in the speaker of\nthe justice and importance of his cause. This it is that truly\ntouches the chords of sympathy; and those who heard Mr.\nClay never failed to be moved by it, or ever afterward\nforgot the impression. All his e\ufb00orts were made for\npractical e\ufb00ect. He never spoke merely to be heard. He\nnever delivered a Fourth of July oration, or a eulogy on an\noccasion like this. As a politician or statesman, no one was\n so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground.\nWhatever he did he did for the whole country. In the\nconstruction of his measures, he ever carefully surveyed\nevery part of the \ufb01eld, and duly weighed every con\ufb02icting\ninterest. Feeling as he did, and as the truth surely is, that\nthe world\u2019s best hope depended on the continued union of\nthese States, he was ever jealous of and watchful for\nwhatever might have the slightest tendency to separate\nthem.\nMr. Clay\u2019s predominant sentiment, from \ufb01rst to last, was\na deep devotion to the cause of human liberty \u2014 a strong\nsympathy with the oppressed everywhere, and an ardent\nwish for their elevation. With him this was a primary and\nall-controlling passion. Subsidiary to this was the conduct\nof his whole life. He loved his country partly because it was\nhis own country, and mostly because it was a free country;\nand he burned with a zeal for its advancement, prosperity,\nand glory, because he saw in such the advancement,\nprosperity, and glory of human liberty, human right, and\nhuman \nnature. \nHe \ndesired \nthe \nprosperity \nof \nhis\ncountrymen, partly because they were his countrymen, but\nchie\ufb02y to show to the world that free men could be\nprosperous.\nThat his views and measures were always the wisest\nneeds not to be a\ufb00irmed; nor should it be on this occasion,\nwhere so many thinking di\ufb00erently join in doing honor to\nhis memory. A free people in times of peace and quiet when\npressed by no common danger-naturally divide into parties.\nAt such times the man who is of neither party is not, cannot\n be, of any consequence. Mr. Clay therefore was of a party.\nTaking a prominent part, as he did, in all the great political\nquestions of his country for the last half century, the\nwisdom of his course on many is doubted and denied by a\nlarge portion of his countrymen; and of such it is not now\nproper to speak particularly. But there are many others,\nabout his course upon which there is little or no\ndisagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic Americans.\nOf these last are the War of , the Missouri question,\nnulli\ufb01cation, and the now recent compromise measures. In\n Mr. Clay, though not unknown, was still a young man.\nWhether we should go to war with Great Britain being the\nquestion of the day, a minority opposed the declaration of\nwar by Congress, while the majority, though apparently\ninclined to war, had for years wavered, and hesitated to act\ndecisively. Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied, and\ngrew more daring and aggravated. By Mr. Clay more than\nany other man the struggle was brought to a decision in\nCongress. The question, being now fully before Congress,\ncame up in a variety of ways in rapid succession, on most of\nwhich occasions Mr. Clay spoke. Adding to all the logic of\nwhich the subject was susceptible that noble inspiration\nwhich came to him as it came to no other, he aroused and\nnerved and inspired his friends, and confounded and bore\ndown all opposition. Several of his speeches on these\noccasions were reported and are still extant, but the best of\nthem all never was. During its delivery the reporters forgot\ntheir vocation, dropped their pens, and sat enchanted from\nnear the beginning to quite the close. The speech now lives\n only in the memory of a few old men, and the enthusiasm\nwith which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely\nastonishing. The precise language of this speech we shall\nnever know; but we do know we cannot help knowing \u2014\nthat with deep pathos it pleaded the cause of the injured\nsailor, that it invoked the genius of the Revolution, that it\napostrophized the names of Otis, of Henry, and of\nWashington, that it appealed to the interests, the pride, the\nhonor, and the glory of the nation, that it shamed and\ntaunted the timidity of friends, that it scorned and scouted\nand withered the temerity of domestic foes, that it bearded\nand de\ufb01ed the British lion, and, rising and swelling and\nmaddening in its course, it sounded the onset, till the\ncharge, the shock, the steady struggle, and the glorious\nvictory all passed in vivid review before the entranced\nhearers.\nImportant and exciting as was the war question of ,\nit never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country\nfor the safety of the Republic as afterward did the Missouri\nquestion. This sprang from that unfortunate source of\ndiscord \u2014 negro slavery. When our Federal Constitution\nwas adopted, we owned no territory beyond the limits or\nownership of the States, except the territory northwest of\nthe River Ohio and east of the Mississippi. What has since\nbeen formed into the States of Maine, Kentucky and\nTennessee, was, I believe, within the limits of or owned by\nMassachusetts, Virginia, and North Carolina. As to the\nNorthwestern Territory, provision had been made even\nbefore the adoption of the Constitution that slavery should\n never go there. On the admission of States into the Union,\ncarved \nfrom \nthe \nterritory \nwe \nowned \nbefore \nthe\nConstitution, no question, or at most no considerable\nquestion, arose about slavery \u2014 those which were within\nthe limits of or owned by the old States following\nrespectively the condition of the parent State, and those\nwithin the Northwest Territory following the previously\nmade provision. But in  we purchased Louisiana of the\nFrench, and it included with much more what has since\nbeen formed into the State of Missouri. With regard to it,\nnothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery.\nWhen, therefore, in , Missouri, having formed a State\nconstitution without excluding slavery, and with slavery\nalready actually existing within its limits, knocked at the\ndoor of the Union for admission, almost the entire\nrepresentation of the non-slaveholding States objected. A\nfearful and angry struggle instantly followed. This alarmed\nthinking men more than any previous question, because,\nunlike all the former, it divided the country by geographical\nlines. Other questions had their opposing partisans in all\nlocalities of the country and in almost every family, so that\nno division of the Union could follow such without a\nseparation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of\nopponents. Not so with the Missouri question. On this a\ngeographical line could be traced, which in the main would\nseparate opponents only. This was the danger. Mr.\nJe\ufb00erson, then in retirement, wrote:\n\u201cI had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to\npay any attention to public a\ufb00airs, con\ufb01dent they were in\n good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to\nthe shore from which I am not distant. But this momentous\nquestion, like a \ufb01rebell in the night, awakened and \ufb01lled me\nwith terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the\nUnion. It is hushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a\nreprieve only, not a \ufb01nal sentence. A geographical line\ncoinciding with a marked principle, moral and political,\nonce conceived and held up to the angry passions of men,\nwill never be obliterated, and every irritation will mark it\ndeeper and deeper. I can say with conscious truth that\nthere is not a man on earth who would sacri\ufb01ce more than I\nwould to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any\npracticable way.\n\u201cThe cession of that kind of property \u2014 for it is so\nmisnamed \u2014 is a bagatelle which would not cost me a\nsecond thought if in that way a general emancipation and\nexpatriation could be e\ufb00ected, and gradually and with due\nsacri\ufb01ces I think it might be. But as it is, we have the wolf\nby the ears, and we can neither hold him nor safely let him\ngo. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the\nother.\u201d\nMr. Clay was in Congress, and, perceiving the danger, at\nonce engaged his whole energies to avert it. It began, as I\nhave said, in ; and it did not terminate till .\nMissouri would not yield the point; and Congress that is, a\nmajority in Congress \u2014 by repeated votes showed a\ndetermination not to admit the State unless it should yield.\nAfter several failures, and great labor on the part of Mr.\nClay to so present the question that a majority could\n consent to the admission, it was by a vote rejected, and, as\nall seemed to think, \ufb01nally. A sullen gloom hung over the\nnation. All felt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent\nto a dissolution of the Union, because those States which\nalready had what Missouri was rejected for refusing to\nrelinquish would go with Missouri. All deprecated and\ndeplored this, but none saw how to avert it. For the\njudgment of members to be convinced of the necessity of\nyielding was not the whole di\ufb00iculty; each had a\nconstituency to meet and to answer to. Mr. Clay, though\nworn down and exhausted, was appealed to by members to\nrenew his e\ufb00orts at compromise. He did so, and by some\njudicious modi\ufb01cations of his plan, coupled with laborious\ne\ufb00orts with individual members and his own overmastering\neloquence upon that \ufb02oor, he \ufb01nally secured the admission\nof the State. Brightly and captivating as it had previously\nshown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a\nmere embellishment, or at most but a helping hand to his\ninventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day\nof her extreme peril.\nAfter the settlement of the Missouri question, although a\nportion of the American people have di\ufb00ered with Mr. Clay,\nand a majority even appear generally to have been opposed\nto him on questions of ordinary administration, he seems\nconstantly to have been regarded by all as the man for the\ncrisis. Accordingly, in the days of nulli\ufb01cation, and more\nrecently in the reappearance of the slavery question\nconnected with our territory newly acquired of Mexico, the\ntask of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been\n cast upon Mr. Clay by common consent \u2014 and his\nperformance of the task in each case was little else than a\nliteral ful\ufb01lment of the public expectation.\nMr. Clay\u2019s e\ufb00orts in behalf of the South Americans, and\nafterward in behalf of the Greeks, in the times of their\nrespective struggles for civil liberty, are among the \ufb01nest\non record, upon the noblest of all themes, and bear ample\ncorroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion \u2014\na love of liberty and right, unsel\ufb01shly, and for their own\nsakes.\nHaving been led to allude to domestic slavery so\nfrequently already, I am unwilling to close without referring\nmore particularly to Mr. Clay\u2019s views and conduct in regard\nto it. He ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to\nslavery. The very earliest, and one of the latest, public\ne\ufb00orts of his life, separated by a period of more than \ufb01fty\nyears, were both made in favor of gradual emancipation.\nHe did not perceive that on a question of human right the\nnegroes were to be excepted from the human race. And yet\nMr. Clay was the owner of slaves. Cast into life when\nslavery was already widely spread and deeply seated, he\ndid not perceive, as I think no wise man has perceived, how\nit could be at once eradicated without producing a greater\nevil even to the cause of human liberty itself. His feeling\nand his judgment, therefore, ever led him to oppose both\nextremes of opinion on the subject. Those who would shiver\ninto fragments the Union of these States, tear to tatters its\nnow venerated Constitution, and even burn the last copy of\nthe Bible, rather than slavery should continue a single hour,\n together with all their more halting sympathizers, have\nreceived, and are receiving, their just execration; and the\nname and opinions and in\ufb02uence of Mr. Clay are fully and,\nas I trust, e\ufb00ectually and enduringly arrayed against them.\nBut I would also, if I could, array his name, opinions, and\nin\ufb02uence against the opposite extreme \u2014 against a few but\nan increasing number of men who, for the sake of\nperpetuating slavery, are beginning to assail and to ridicule\nthe white man\u2019s charter of freedom, the declaration that\n\u201call men are created free and equal.\u201d So far as I have\nlearned, the \ufb01rst American of any note to do or attempt this\nwas the late John C. Calhoun; and if I mistake not, it soon\nafter found its way into some of the messages of the\nGovernor of South Carolina. We, however, look for and are\nnot much shocked by political eccentricities and heresies in\nSouth Carolina. But only last year I saw with astonishment\nwhat purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and\nin\ufb02uential clergyman of Virginia, copied, with apparent\napprobation, into a St. Louis newspaper, containing the\nfollowing to me very unsatisfactory language:\n\u201cI am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that\nis not in mine. Professional abolitionists have made more\nuse of it than of any passage in the Bible. It came, however,\nas I trace it, from Saint Voltaire, and was baptized by\nThomas Je\ufb00erson, and since almost universally regarded as\ncanonical authority All men are born free and equal.\u2019\n\u201cThis is a genuine coin in the political currency of our\ngeneration. I am sorry to say that I have never seen two\nmen of whom it is true. But I must admit I never saw the\n Siamese Twins, and therefore will not dogmatically say that\nno man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism.\u201d\nThis sounds strangely in republican America. The like\nwas not heard in the fresher days of the republic. Let us\ncontrast with it the language of that truly national man\nwhose life and death we now commemorate and lament: I\nquote from a speech of Mr. Clay delivered before the\nAmerican Colonization Society in :\n\u201cWe are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation\nof this question. The society goes into no household to\ndisturb its domestic tranquillity. It addresses itself to no\nslaves to weaken their obligations of obedience. It seeks to\na\ufb00ect no man\u2019s property. It neither has the power nor the\nwill to a\ufb00ect the property of any one contrary to his\nconsent. The execution of its scheme would augment\ninstead of diminishing the value of property left behind.\nThe society, composed of free men, conceals itself only with\nthe free. Collateral consequences we are not responsible\nfor. It is not this society which has produced the great\nmoral revolution which the age exhibits. What would they\nwho thus reproach us have done? If they would repress all\ntendencies toward liberty and ultimate emancipation, they\nmust do more than put down the benevolent e\ufb00orts of this\nsociety. They must go back to the era of our liberty and\nindependence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its\nannual joyous return. They must renew the slave trade,\nwith all its train of atrocities. They must suppress the\nworkings of British philanthropy, seeking to meliorate the\ncondition of the unfortunate West Indian slave. They must\n arrest the career of South American deliverance from\nthraldom. They must blow out the moral lights around us\nand extinguish that greatest torch of all which America\npresents to a benighted world \u2014 pointing the way to their\nrights, their liberties, and their happiness. And when they\nhave achieved all those purposes their work will be yet\nincomplete. They must penetrate the human soul, and\neradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty. Then,\nand not till then, when universal darkness and despair\nprevail, can you perpetuate slavery and repress all\nsympathy and all humane and benevolent e\ufb00orts among\nfree men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race\ndoomed to bondage.\u201d\nThe American Colonization Society was organized in\n. Mr. Clay, though not its projector, was one of its\nearliest members; and he died, as for many preceding years\nhe had been, its president. It was one of the most cherished\nobjects of his direct care and consideration, and the\nassociation of his name with it has probably been its very\ngreatest collateral support. He considered it no demerit in\nthe society that it tended to relieve the slave-holders from\nthe troublesome presence of the free negroes; but this was\nfar from being its whole merit in his estimation. In the\nsame speech from which we have quoted he says:\n\u201cThere is a moral \ufb01tness in the idea of returning to Africa\nher children, whose ancestors have been torn from her by\nthe ruthless hand of fraud and violence. Transplanted in a\nforeign land, they will carry back to their native soil the\nrich fruits of religion, civilization, law, and liberty. May it\n not be one of the great designs of the Ruler of the universe,\nwhose ways are often inscrutable by short-sighted mortals,\nthus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to\nthat most unfortunate portion of the globe?\u201d\nThis suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of\nthe African race and African continent was made twenty-\n\ufb01ve years ago. Every succeeding year has added strength\nto the hope of its realization. May it indeed be realized.\nPharaoh\u2019s country was cursed with plagues, and his hosts\nwere lost in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive\npeople who had already served them more than four\nhundred years. May like disasters never befall us! If, as the\nfriends of colonization hope, the present and coming\ngenerations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed\nin freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery,\nand at the same time in restoring a captive people to their\nlong-lost fatherland with bright prospects for the future,\nand this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals\nshall have su\ufb00ered by the change, it will indeed be a\nglorious consummation. And if to such a consummation the\ne\ufb00orts of Mr. Clay shall have contributed, it will be what he\nmost ardently wished, and none of his labors will have been\nmore valuable to his country and his kind.\nBut Henry Clay is dead. His long and eventful life is\nclosed. Our country is prosperous and powerful; but could\nit have been quite all it has been, and is, and is to be,\nwithout Henry Clay? Such a man the times have demanded,\nand such in the providence of God was given us. But he is\ngone. Let us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the\n continued care of Divine Providence, trusting that in future\nnational emergencies He will not fail to provide us the\ninstruments of safety and security.\nNOTE.

Point out to them how the\nnominal winner is often a real loser \u2014 in fees, expenses,\nand waste of time. As a peace-maker the lawyer has a\nsuperior opportunity of being a good man. There will still\nbe business enough.\nNever stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be\nfound than one who does this. Who can be more nearly a\n\ufb01end than he who habitually over-hauls the register of\ndeeds in search of defects in titles, whereon to stir up\nstrife, and put money in his pocket? A moral tone ought to\nbe infused into the profession which should drive such men\nout of it.\nThe matter of fees is important, far beyond the mere\nquestion of bread and butter involved. Properly attended\nto, fuller justice is done to both lawyer and client. An\nexorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a general rule\nnever take your whole fee in advance, nor any more than a\nsmall retainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more\nthan a common mortal if you can feel the same interest in\nthe case as if something was still in prospect for you, as\n well as for your client. And when you lack interest in the\ncase the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the\nperformance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in\nadvance. Then you will feel that you are working for\nsomething, and you are sure to do your work faithfully and\nwell. Never sell a fee note \u2014 at least not before the\nconsideration service is performed. It leads to negligence\nand dishonesty \u2014 negligence by losing interest in the case,\nand dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have\nallowed the consideration to fail.\nThis idea of a refund or reduction of charges from the\nlawyer in a failed case is a new one to me \u2014 but not a bad\none.\n   HI \n  \nI\n  \n  A    A   \n   \n \nSEPTEMBER , \nMR. LINCOLN\u2019S REPLY.\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 There is very much in the\nprinciples that Judge Douglas has here enunciated that I\nmost cordially approve, and over which I shall have no\ncontroversy with him. In so far as he has insisted that all\nthe States have the right to do exactly as they please about\nall their domestic relations, including that of slavery, I\nagree entirely with him. He places me wrong in spite of all I\ncan tell him, though I repeat it again and again, insisting\nthat I have no di\ufb00erence with him upon this subject. I have\nmade a great many speeches, some of which have been\nprinted, and it will be utterly impossible for him to \ufb01nd\nanything that I have ever put in print contrary to what I\nnow \nsay \nupon \nthis \nsubject. \nI \nhold \nmyself \nunder\nconstitutional obligations to allow the people in all the\nStates, without interference, direct or indirect, to do\nexactly as they please; and I deny that I have any\ninclination to interfere with them, even if there were no\nsuch constitutional obligation. I can only say again that I\nam placed improperly \u2014 altogether improperly, in spite of\nall I can say \u2014 when it is insisted that I entertain any other\nview or purposes in regard to that matter.\n While I am upon this subject, I will make some answers\nbrie\ufb02y to certain propositions that Judge Douglas has put.\nHe says, \u201cWhy can\u2019t this Union endure permanently half\nslave and half free?\u201d I have said that I supposed it could\nnot, and I will try, before this new audience, to give brie\ufb02y\nsome of the reasons for entertaining that opinion. Another\nform of his question is, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we let it stand as our\nfathers placed it?\u201d That is the exact di\ufb00iculty between us. I\nsay that Judge Douglas and his friends have changed it\nfrom the position in which our fathers originally placed it. I\nsay, in the way our father\u2019s originally left the slavery\nquestion, the institution was in the course of ultimate\nextinction, and the public mind rested in the belief that it\nwas in the course of ultimate extinction. I say when this\ngovernment was \ufb01rst established it was the policy of its\nfounders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new\nTerritories of the United States, where it had not existed.\nBut Judge Douglas and his friends have broken up that\npolicy, and placed it upon a new basis, by which it is to\nbecome national and perpetual. All I have asked or desired\nanywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the\nbasis that the fathers of our government originally placed it\nupon. I have no doubt that it would become extinct, for all\ntime to come, if we but readopted the policy of the fathers,\nby restricting it to the limits it has already covered,\nrestricting it from the new Territories.\nI do not wish to dwell at great length on this branch of\nthe subject at this time, but allow me to repeat one thing\nthat I have stated before. Brooks \u2014 the man who assaulted\n Senator Sumner on the \ufb02oor of the Senate, and who was\ncomplimented with dinners, and silver pitchers, and gold-\nheaded canes, and a good many other things for that feat \u2014\nin one of his speeches declared that when this government\nwas originally established, nobody expected that the\ninstitution of slavery would last until this day. That was but\nthe opinion of one man, but it was such an opinion as we\ncan never get from Judge Douglas or anybody in favor of\nslavery, in the North, at all. You can sometimes get it from a\nSouthern man. He said at the same time that the framers of\nour \ngovernment \ndid \nnot \nhave \nthe \nknowledge \nthat\nexperience has taught us; that experience and the invention\nof the cotton-gin have taught us that the perpetuation of\nslavery is a necessity. He insisted, therefore, upon its being\nchanged from the basis upon which the fathers of the\ngovernment left it to the basis of its perpetuation and\nnationalization.\nI insist that this is the di\ufb00erence between Judge Douglas\nand myself, \u2014 that Judge Douglas is helping that change\nalong. I insist upon this government being placed where\nour fathers originally placed it.\nI remember Judge Douglas once said that he saw the\nevidences on the statute books of Congress of a policy in\nthe origin of government to divide slavery and freedom by a\ngeographical line; that he saw an indisposition to maintain\nthat policy, and therefore he set about studying up a way to\nsettle the institution on the right basis, \u2014 the basis which\nhe thought it ought to have been placed upon at \ufb01rst; and\nin that speech he confesses that he seeks to place it, not\n upon the basis that the fathers placed it upon, but upon one\ngotten up on \u201coriginal principles.\u201d When he asks me why\nwe cannot get along with it in the attitude where our\nfathers placed it, he had better clear up the evidences that\nhe has himself changed it from that basis, that he has\nhimself been chie\ufb02y instrumental in changing the policy of\nthe fathers. Any one who will read his speech of the d of\nlast March will see that he there makes an open confession,\nshowing that he set about \ufb01xing the institution upon an\naltogether di\ufb00erent set of principles. I think I have fully\nanswered him when he asks me why we cannot let it alone\nupon the basis where our fathers left it, by showing that he\nhas himself changed the whole policy of the government in\nthat regard.\nNow, fellow-citizens, in regard to this matter about a\ncontract that was made between Judge Trumbull and\nmyself, and all that long portion of Judge Douglas\u2019s speech\non this subject, \u2014 I wish simply to say what I have said to\nhim before, that he cannot know whether it is true or not,\nand I do know that there is not a word of truth in it. And I\nhave told him so before. I don\u2019t want any harsh language\nindulged in, but I do not know how to deal with this\npersistent insisting on a story that I know to be utterly\nwithout truth. It used to be a fashion amongst men that\nwhen a charge was made, some sort of proof was brought\nforward to establish it, and if no proof was found to exist,\nthe charge was dropped. I don\u2019t know how to meet this\nkind of an argument. I don\u2019t want to have a \ufb01ght with Judge\nDouglas, and I have no way of making an argument up into\n the consistency of a corn-cob and stopping his mouth with\nit. All I can do is \u2014 good-humoredly \u2014 to say that, from the\nbeginning to the end of all that story about a bargain\nbetween Judge Trumbull and myself, there is not a word of\ntruth in it. I can only ask him to show some sort of evidence\nof the truth of his story. He brings forward here and reads\nfrom what he contends is a speech by James H. Matheny,\ncharging such a bargain between Trumbull and myself. My\nown opinion is that Matheny did do some such immoral\nthing as to tell a story that he knew nothing about. I believe\nhe did. I contradicted it instantly, and it has been\ncontradicted \nby \nJudge \nTrumbull, \nwhile \nnobody \nhas\nproduced any proof, because there is none. Now, whether\nthe speech which the Judge brings forward here is really\nthe one Matheny made, I do not know, and I hope the Judge\nwill pardon me for doubting the genuineness of this\ndocument, since his production of those Spring\ufb01eld\nresolutions at Ottawa. I do not wish to dwell at any great\nlength upon this matter. I can say nothing when a long\nstory like this is told, except it is not true, and demand that\nhe who insists upon it shall produce some proof. That is all\nany man can do, and I leave it in that way, for I know of no\nother way of dealing with it.\n[In an argument on the lines of: \u201cYes, you did. \u2014 No, I\ndid not.\u201d It bears on the former to prove his point, not on\nthe negative to \u201cprove\u201d that he did not \u2014 even if he easily\ncan do so.]\nThe Judge has gone over a long account of the old Whig\nand Democratic parties, and it connects itself with this\n charge against Trumbull and myself. He says that they\nagreed upon a compromise in regard to the slavery\nquestion in ; that in a National Democratic Convention\nresolutions were passed to abide by that compromise as a\n\ufb01nality upon the slavery question. He also says that the\nWhig party in National Convention agreed to abide by and\nregard as a \ufb01nality the Compromise of . I understand\nthe Judge to be altogether right about that; I understand\nthat part of the history of the country as stated by him to be\ncorrect I recollect that I, as a member of that party,\nacquiesced \nin \nthat \ncompromise. \nI \nrecollect \nin \nthe\nPresidential election which followed, when we had General\nScott up for the presidency, Judge Douglas was around\nberating us Whigs as Abolitionists, precisely as he does to-\nday, \u2014 not a bit of di\ufb00erence. I have often heard him. We\ncould do nothing when the old Whig party was alive that\nwas not Abolitionism, but it has got an extremely good\nname since it has passed away.\n[It almost a natural law that, when dead \u2014 no matter\nhow bad we were \u2014 we are automatically beati\ufb01ed.]\nWhen that Compromise was made it did not repeal the\nold Missouri Compromise. It left a region of United States\nterritory half as large as the present territory of the United\nStates, north of the line of  degrees  minutes, in which\nslavery \nwas \nprohibited \nby \nAct \nof \nCongress. \nThis\nCompromise did not repeal that one. It did not a\ufb00ect or\npropose to repeal it. But at last it became Judge Douglas\u2019s\nduty, as he thought (and I \ufb01nd no fault with him), as\nChairman of the Committee on Territories, to bring in a bill\n for the organization of a territorial government, \u2014 \ufb01rst of\none, then of two Territories north of that line. When he did\nso, it ended in his inserting a provision substantially\nrepealing the Missouri Compromise. That was because the\nCompromise of  had not repealed it. And now I ask\nwhy he could not have let that Compromise alone? We were\nquiet from the agitation of the slavery question. We were\nmaking no fuss about it. All had acquiesced in the\nCompromise measures of . We never had been\nseriously disturbed by any Abolition agitation before that\nperiod. When he came to form governments for the\nTerritories north of the line of  degrees  minutes, why\ncould he not have let that matter stand as it was standing?\nWas it necessary to the organization of a Territory? Not at\nall. Iowa lay north of the line, and had been organized as a\nTerritory and come into the Union as a State without\ndisturbing that Compromise. There was no sort of necessity\nfor destroying it to organize these Territories. But,\ngentlemen, it would take up all my time to meet all the little\nquibbling arguments of Judge Douglas to show that the\nMissouri Compromise was repealed by the Compromise of\n. My own opinion is, that a careful investigation of all\nthe arguments to sustain the position that that Compromise\nwas virtually repealed by the Compromise of  would\nshow that they are the merest fallacies. I have the report\nthat Judge Douglas \ufb01rst brought into Congress at the time\nof the introduction of the Nebraska Bill, which in its\noriginal form did not repeal the Missouri Compromise, and\nhe there expressly stated that he had forborne to do so\n because it had not been done by the Compromise of . I\nclose this part of the discussion on my part by asking him\nthe question again, \u201cWhy, when we had peace under the\nMissouri Compromise, could you not have let it alone?\u201d\nIn complaining of what I said in my speech at Spring\ufb01eld,\nin which he says I accepted my nomination for the\nsenatorship (where, by the way, he is at fault, for if he will\nexamine it, he will \ufb01nd no acceptance in it), he again\nquotes that portion in which I said that \u201ca house divided\nagainst itself cannot stand.\u201d Let me say a word in regard to\nthat matter.\nHe tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in\nthe di\ufb00erent institutions of the States of the Union; that\nthat variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil,\nclimate, of the face of the country, and the di\ufb00erence in the\nnatural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have\nthese very matters ever produced any di\ufb00iculty amongst\nus? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact\nthat they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate the\ncommerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or\nbecause we have a di\ufb00erent class relative to the production\nof \ufb02our in this State? Have they produced any di\ufb00erences?\nNot at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They\ndon\u2019t make the house a house divided against itself. They\nare the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.\nBut has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we\nnot always had quarrels and di\ufb00iculties over it? And when\nwill we cease to have quarrels over it? Like causes produce\nlike e\ufb00ects. It is worth while to observe that we have\n generally \nhad \ncomparative \npeace \nupon \nthe \nslavery\nquestion, and that there has been no cause for alarm until\nit was excited by the e\ufb00ort to spread it into new territory.\nWhenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and\nthere has been no e\ufb00ort to spread it, there has been peace.\nAll the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from e\ufb00orts\nto spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of\nthe Missouri Compromise. It was so again with the\nannexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the\nMexican war; and it is so now. Whenever there has been an\ne\ufb00ort to spread it, there has been agitation and resistance.\nNow, I appeal to this audience (very few of whom are my\npolitical friends), as national men, whether we have reason\nto expect that the agitation in regard to this subject will\ncease while the causes that tend to reproduce agitation are\nactively at work? Will not the same cause that produced\nagitation in , when the Missouri Compromise was\nformed, that which produced the agitation upon the\nannexation of Texas, and at other times, work out the same\nresults always? Do you think that the nature of man will be\nchanged, that the same causes that produced agitation at\none time will not have the same e\ufb00ect at another?\nThis has been the result so far as my observation of the\nslavery question and my reading in history extends. What\nright have we then to hope that the trouble will cease, \u2014\nthat the agitation will come to an end, \u2014 until it shall either\nbe placed back where it originally stood, and where the\nfathers originally placed it, or, on the other hand, until it\nshall entirely master all opposition? This is the view I\n entertain, and this is the reason why I entertained it, as\nJudge Douglas has read from my Spring\ufb01eld speech.\nNow, my friends, there is one other thing that I feel\nmyself under some sort of obligation to mention. Judge\nDouglas has here to-day \u2014 in a very rambling way, I was\nabout saying \u2014 spoken of the platforms for which he seeks\nto hold me responsible. He says, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you come out\nand make an open avowal of principles in all places alike?\u201d\nand he reads from an advertisement that he says was used\nto notify the people of a speech to be made by Judge\nTrumbull at Waterloo. In commenting on it he desires to\nknow whether we cannot speak frankly and manfully, as he\nand his friends do. How, I ask, do his friends speak out their\nown sentiments? A Convention of his party in this State met\non the st of April at Spring\ufb01eld, and passed a set of\nresolutions which they proclaim to the country as their\nplatform. This does constitute their platform, and it is\nbecause Judge Douglas claims it is his platform \u2014 that\nthese are his principles and purposes \u2014 that he has a right\nto declare he speaks his sentiments \u201cfrankly and manfully.\u201d\nOn the th of June Colonel John Dougherty, Governor\nReynolds, \nand \nothers, \ncalling \nthemselves \nNational\nDemocrats, met in Spring\ufb01eld and adopted a set of\nresolutions which are as easily understood, as plain and as\nde\ufb01nite in stating to the country and to the world what they\nbelieved in and would stand upon, as Judge Douglas\u2019s\nplatform Now, what is the reason that Judge Douglas is not\nwilling that Colonel Dougherty and Governor Reynolds\nshould stand upon their own written and printed platform\n as well as he upon his? Why must he look farther than their\nplatform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?\nAgain, in reference to our platform: On the th of June\nthe Republicans had their Convention and published their\nplatform, which is as clear and distinct as Judge Douglas\u2019s.\nIn it they spoke their principles as plainly and as de\ufb01nitely\nto the world. What is the reason that Judge Douglas is not\nwilling I should stand upon that platform? Why must he go\naround hunting for some one who is supporting me or has\nsupported me at some time in his life, and who has said\nsomething at some time contrary to that platform? Does the\nJudge regard that rule as a good one? If it turn out that the\nrule is a good one for me \u2014 that I am responsible for any\nand every opinion that any man has expressed who is my\nfriend, \u2014 then it is a good rule for him. I ask, is it not as\ngood a rule for him as it is for me? In my opinion, it is not a\ngood rule for either of us. Do you think di\ufb00erently, Judge?\n[Mr. DOUGLAS: I do not.]\nJudge Douglas says he does not think di\ufb00erently. I am\nglad of it. Then can he tell me why he is looking up\nresolutions of \ufb01ve or six years ago, and insisting that they\nwere my platform, notwithstanding my protest that they\nare not, and never were my platform, and my pointing out\nthe platform of the State Convention which he delights to\nsay nominated me for the Senate? I cannot see what he\nmeans by parading these resolutions, if it is not to hold me\nresponsible for them in some way. If he says to me here\nthat he does not hold the rule to be good, one way or the\nother, I do not comprehend how he could answer me more\n fully if he answered me at greater length. I will therefore\nput in as my answer to the resolutions that he has hunted\nup against me, what I, as a lawyer, would call a good plea\nto a bad declaration. I understand that it is an axiom of law\nthat a poor plea may be a good plea to a bad declaration. I\nthink that the opinions the Judge brings from those who\nsupport me, yet di\ufb00er from me, is a bad declaration against\nme; but if I can bring the same things against him, I am\nputting in a good plea to that kind of declaration, and now I\npropose to try it.\nAt Freeport, Judge Douglas occupied a large part of his\ntime in producing resolutions and documents of various\nsorts, as I understood, to make me somehow responsible\nfor them; and I propose now doing a little of the same sort\nof thing for him. In  a very clever gentleman by the\nname of Thompson Campbell, a personal friend of Judge\nDouglas and myself, a political friend of Judge Douglas and\nopponent of mine, was a candidate for Congress in the\nGalena District. He was interrogated as to his views on this\nsame slavery question. I have here before me the\ninterrogatories, and Campbell\u2019s answers to them \u2014 I will\nread them:\n  I\n    \nA \n I  \n\u201cST. WILL YOU, if elected, vote for and cordially support a\nbill prohibiting slavery in the Territories of the United\nStates?\n\u201cd. Will you vote for and support a bill abolishing\nslavery in the District of Columbia?\n\u201cd. Will you oppose the admission of any Slave States\nwhich may be formed out of Texas or the Territories?\n\u201cth. Will you vote for and advocate the repeal of the\nFugitive Slave law passed at the recent session of\nCongress?\n\u201cth. Will you advocate and vote for the election of a\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives who shall be\nwilling to organize the committees of that House so as to\ngive the Free States their just in\ufb02uence in the business of\nlegislation?\n\u201cth. What are your views, not only as to the\nconstitutional right of Congress to prohibit the slave-trade\nbetween the States, but also as to the expediency of\nexercising that right immediately?\u201d\n  A\n             .\n\u201cTO THE FIRST and second interrogatories, I answer\nunequivocally in the a\ufb00irmative.\n\u201cTo the third interrogatory I reply, that I am opposed to\nthe admission of any more Slave States into the Union, that\nmay be formed out of Texas or any other Territory.\n\u201cTo the fourth and \ufb01fth interrogatories I unhesitatingly\nanswer in the a\ufb00irmative.\n\u201cTo the sixth interrogatory I reply, that so long as the\nSlave States continue to treat slaves as articles of\ncommerce, the Constitution confers power on Congress to\npass laws regulating that peculiar COMMERCE, and that\nthe protection of Human Rights imperatively demands the\ninterposition of every constitutional means to prevent this\nmost inhuman and iniquitous tra\ufb00ic.\n\u201cT. CAMPBELL.\u201d\nI want to say here that Thompson Campbell was elected\nto Congress on that platform, as the Democratic candidate\nin the Galena District, against Martin P. Sweet.\n[Judge DOUGLAS: Give me the date of the letter.]\nThe time Campbell ran was in . I have not the exact\ndate here. It was some time in  that these\ninterrogatories were put and the answer given. Campbell\nwas elected to Congress, and served out his term. I think a\n second election came up before he served out his term, and\nhe was not re-elected. Whether defeated or not nominated,\nI do not know. [Mr. Campbell was nominated for re-election\nby the Democratic party, by acclamation.] At the end of his\nterm his very good friend Judge Douglas got him a high\no\ufb00ice from President Pierce, and sent him o\ufb00 to California.\nIs not that the fact? Just at the end of his term in Congress\nit appears that our mutual friend Judge Douglas got our\nmutual friend Campbell a good o\ufb00ice, and sent him to\nCalifornia upon it. And not only so, but on the th of last\nmonth, when Judge Douglas and myself spoke at Freeport\nin joint discussion, there was his same friend Campbell,\ncome all the way from California, to help the Judge beat\nme; and there was poor Martin P. Sweet standing on the\nplatform, trying to help poor me to be elected. That is true\nof one of Judge Douglas\u2019s friends.\nSo again, in that same race of , there was a\nCongressional Convention assembled at Joliet, and it\nnominated R. S. Molony for Congress, and unanimously\nadopted the following resolution:\n\u201cResolved, That we are uncompromisingly opposed to the\nextension of slavery; and while we would not make such\nopposition a ground of interference with the interests of the\nStates where it exists, yet we moderately but \ufb01rmly insist\nthat it is the duty of Congress to oppose its extension into\nTerritory now free, by all means compatible with the\nobligations of the Constitution, and with good faith to our\nsister States; that these principles were recognized by the\nOrdinance of , which received the sanction of Thomas\n Je\ufb00erson, who is acknowledged by all to be the great oracle\nand expounder of our faith.\u201d\nSubsequently the same interrogatories were propounded\nto Dr. Molony which had been addressed to Campbell as\nabove, with the exception of the th, respecting the\ninterstate slave trade, to which Dr. Molony, the Democratic\nnominee for Congress, replied as follows:\n\u201cI received the written interrogatories this day, and, as\nyou will see by the La Salle Democrat and Ottawa Free\nTrader, I took at Peru on the th, and at Ottawa on the th,\nthe a\ufb00irmative side of interrogatories st and d; and in\nrelation to the admission of any more Slave States from\nFree Territory, my position taken at these meetings, as\ncorrectly reported in said papers, was emphatically and\ndistinctly opposed to it. In relation to the admission of any\nmore Slave States from Texas, whether I shall go against it\nor not will depend upon the opinion that I may hereafter\nform of the true meaning and nature of the resolutions of\nannexation. If, by said resolutions, the honor and good faith\nof the nation is pledged to admit more Slave States from\nTexas when she (Texas) may apply for the admission of such\nState, then I should, if in Congress, vote for their\nadmission. But if not so PLEDGED and bound by sacred\ncontract, then a bill for the admission of more Slave States\nfrom Texas would never receive my vote.\n\u201cTo your fourth interrogatory I answer most decidedly in\nthe a\ufb00irmative, and for reasons set forth in my reported\nremarks at Ottawa last Monday.\n \u201cTo your \ufb01fth interrogatory I also reply in the a\ufb00irmative\nmost cordially, and that I will use my utmost exertions to\nsecure the nomination and election of a man who will\naccomplish the objects of said interrogatories. I most\ncordially approve of the resolutions adopted at the Union\nmeeting held at Princeton on the th September ult.\n\u201cYours, etc., R. S. MOLONY.\u201d\nAll I have to say in regard to Dr. Molony is that he was\nthe \nregularly \nnominated \nDemocratic \ncandidate \nfor\nCongress in his district; was elected at that time; at the end\nof his term was appointed to a land-o\ufb00ice at Danville. (I\nnever heard anything of Judge Douglas\u2019s instrumentality in\nthis.) He held this o\ufb00ice a considerable time, and when we\nwere at Freeport the other day there were handbills\nscattered about notifying the public that after our debate\nwas over R. S. Molony would make a Democratic speech in\nfavor of Judge Douglas. That is all I know of my own\npersonal knowledge. It is added here to this resolution, and\ntruly I believe, that among those who participated in the\nJoliet Convention, and who supported its nominee, with his\nplatform as laid down in the resolution of the Convention\nand in his reply as above given, we call at random the\nfollowing names, all of which are recognized at this day as\nleading Democrats:\n\u201cCook County, \u2014 E. B. Williams, Charles McDonell, Arno\nVoss, Thomas Hoyne, Isaac Cook.\u201d\nI reckon we ought to except Cook.\n\u201cF. C. Sherman.\n\u201cWill, \u2014 Joel A. Matteson, S. W. Bowen.\n \u201cKane, \u2014 B. F. Hall, G. W. Renwick, A. M. Herrington,\nElijah Wilcox.\n\u201cMcHenry, \u2014 W. M. Jackson, Enos W. Smith, Neil\nDonnelly.\nLa Salle, \u2014 John Hise, William Reddick.\u201d\nWilliam Reddick! another one of Judge Douglas\u2019s friends\nthat stood on the stand with him at Ottawa, at the time the\nJudge says my knees trembled so that I had to be carried\naway. The names are all here:\n\u201cDu Page, \u2014 Nathan Allen.\n\u201cDe Kalb, \u2014 Z. B. Mayo.\u201d\nHere is another set of resolutions which I think are\napposite to the matter in hand.\nOn the th of February of the same year a Democratic\nDistrict Convention was held at Naperville to nominate a\ncandidate for Circuit Judge. Among the delegates were\nBowen and Kelly of Will; Captain Naper, H. H. Cody, Nathan\nAllen, of Du Page; W. M. Jackson, J. M. Strode, P. W. Platt,\nand Enos W. Smith of McHenry; J. Horssnan and others of\nWinnebago. Colonel Strode presided over the Convention.\nThe following resolutions were unanimously adopted, \u2014 the\n\ufb01rst on motion of P. W. Platt, the second on motion of\nWilliam M. Jackson:\n\u201cResolved, That this Convention is in favor of the Wilmot\nProviso, both in Principle and Practice, and that we know of\nno good reason why any person should oppose the largest\nlatitude in Free Soil, Free Territory and Free speech.\n\u201cResolved, That in the opinion of this Convention, the\ntime has arrived when all men should be free, whites as\n well as others.\u201d\n[Judge DOUGLAS: What is the date of those resolutions?]\nI understand it was in , but I do not know it. I do not\nstate a thing and say I know it, when I do not. But I have\nthe highest belief that this is so. I know of no way to arrive\nat the conclusion that there is an error in it. I mean to put a\ncase no stronger than the truth will allow. But what I was\ngoing to comment upon is an extract from a newspaper in\nDe Kalb County; and it strikes me as being rather singular,\nI confess, under the circumstances. There is a Judge Mayo\nin that county, who is a candidate for the Legislature, for\nthe purpose, if he secures his election, of helping to re-elect\nJudge Douglas. He is the editor of a newspaper [De Kalb\nCounty Sentinel], and in that paper I \ufb01nd the extract I am\ngoing to read. It is part of an editorial article in which he\nwas electioneering as \ufb01ercely as he could for Judge\nDouglas and against me. It was a curious thing, I think, to\nbe in such a paper. I will agree to that, and the Judge may\nmake the most of it:\n\u201cOur education has been such that we have been rather\nin favor of the equality of the blacks; that is, that they\nshould enjoy all the privileges of the whites where they\nreside. We are aware that this is not a very popular\ndoctrine. We have had many a confab with some who are\nnow strong \u2018Republicans\u2019 we taking the broad ground of\nequality, and they the opposite ground.\n\u201cWe were brought up in a State where blacks were\nvoters, and we do not know of any inconvenience resulting\nfrom it, though perhaps it would not work as well where\n the blacks are more numerous. We have no doubt of the\nright of the whites to guard against such an evil, if it is one.\nOur opinion is that it would be best for all concerned to\nhave the colored population in a State by themselves [in\nthis I agree with him]; but if within the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States, we say by all means they should have the\nright to have their Senators and Representatives in\nCongress, and to vote for President. With us \u2018worth makes\nthe man, and want of it the fellow.\u2019 We have seen many a\n\u2018nigger\u2019 that we thought more of than some white men.\u201d\nThat is one of Judge Douglas\u2019s friends. Now, I do not\nwant to leave myself in an attitude where I can be\nmisrepresented, so I will say I do not think the Judge is\nresponsible for this article; but he is quite as responsible\nfor it as I would be if one of my friends had said it. I think\nthat is fair enough.\nI have here also a set of resolutions passed by a\nDemocratic State Convention in Judge Douglas\u2019s own good\nState of Vermont, that I think ought to be good for him too:\n\u201cResolved, That liberty is a right inherent and inalienable\nin man, and that herein all men are equal.\n\u201cResolved, That we claim no authority in the Federal\nGovernment to abolish slavery in the several States, but we\ndo claim for it Constitutional power perpetually to prohibit\nthe introduction of slavery into territory now free, and\nabolish it wherever, under the jurisdiction of Congress, it\nexists.\n\u201cResolved, That this power ought immediately to be\nexercised in prohibiting the introduction and existence of\n slavery in New Mexico and California, in abolishing slavery\nand the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, on the high\nseas, and wherever else, under the Constitution, it can be\nreached.\n\u201cResolved, That no more Slave States should be admitted\ninto the Federal Union.\n\u201cResolved, That the Government ought to return to its\nancient policy, not to extend, nationalize, or encourage, but\nto limit, localize, and discourage slavery.\u201d\nAt Freeport I answered several interrogatories that had\nbeen propounded to me by Judge Douglas at the Ottawa\nmeeting. The Judge has not yet seen \ufb01t to \ufb01nd any fault\nwith the position that I took in regard to those seven\ninterrogatories, which were certainly broad enough, in all\nconscience, to cover the entire ground. In my answers,\nwhich have been printed, and all have had the opportunity\nof seeing, I take the ground that those who elect me must\nexpect that I will do nothing which will not be in\naccordance with those answers. I have some right to assert\nthat Judge Douglas has no fault to \ufb01nd with them. But he\nchooses to still try to thrust me upon di\ufb00erent ground,\nwithout paying any attention to my answers, the obtaining\nof which from me cost him so much trouble and concern. At\nthe same time I propounded four interrogatories to him,\nclaiming it as a right that he should answer as many\ninterrogatories for me as I did for him, and I would reserve\nmyself for a future instalment when I got them ready. The\nJudge, in answering me upon that occasion, put in what I\nsuppose he intends as answers to all four of my\n interrogatories. The \ufb01rst one of these interrogatories I have\nbefore me, and it is in these words:\n\u201cQuestion . \u2014 If the people of Kansas shall, by means\nentirely unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State\nconstitution, and ask admission into the Union under it,\nbefore they have the requisite number of inhabitants\naccording to the English bill,\u201d \u2014 some ninety-three\nthousand,\u2014 \u201cwill you vote to admit them?\u201d\nAs I read the Judge\u2019s answer in the newspaper, and as I\nremember it as pronounced at the time, he does not give\nany answer which is equivalent to yes or no, \u2014 I will or I\nwon\u2019t. He answers at very considerable length, rather\nquarreling with me for asking the question, and insisting\nthat Judge Trumbull had done something that I ought to say\nsomething about, and \ufb01nally getting out such statements as\ninduce me to infer that he means to be understood he will,\nin that supposed case, vote for the admission of Kansas. I\nonly bring this forward now for the purpose of saying that if\nhe chooses to put a di\ufb00erent construction upon his answer,\nhe may do it. But if he does not, I shall from this time\nforward assume that he will vote for the admission of\nKansas in disregard of the English bill. He has the right to\nremove any misunderstanding I may have. I only mention it\nnow, that I may hereafter assume this to be the true\nconstruction of his answer, if he does not now choose to\ncorrect me.\nThe second interrogatory that I propounded to him was\nthis:\n \u201cQuestion . \u2014 Can the people of a United States\nTerritory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen\nof the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to\nthe formation of a State Constitution?\u201d\nTo this Judge Douglas answered that they can lawfully\nexclude slavery from the Territory prior to the formation of\na constitution. He goes on to tell us how it can be done. As I\nunderstand him, he holds that it can be done by the\nTerritorial Legislature refusing to make any enactments for\nthe protection of slavery in the Territory, and especially by\nadopting unfriendly legislation to it. For the sake of\nclearness, I state it again: that they can exclude slavery\nfrom the Territory, st, by withholding what he assumes to\nbe an indispensable assistance to it in the way of\nlegislation; and, d, by unfriendly legislation. If I rightly\nunderstand him, I wish to ask your attention for a while to\nhis position.\nIn the \ufb01rst place, the Supreme Court of the United States\nhas decided that any Congressional prohibition of slavery in\nthe Territories is unconstitutional; that they have reached\nthis proposition as a conclusion from their former\nproposition, that the Constitution of the United States\nexpressly recognizes property in slaves, and from that\nother Constitutional provision, that no person shall be\ndeprived of property without due process of law. Hence\nthey reach the conclusion that as the Constitution of the\nUnited States expressly recognizes property in slaves, and\nprohibits any person from being deprived of property\nwithout due process of law, to pass an Act of Congress by\n which a man who owned a slave on one side of a line would\nbe deprived of him if he took him on the other side, is\ndepriving him of that property without due process of law.\nThat I understand to be the decision of the Supreme Court.\nI understand also that Judge Douglas adheres most \ufb01rmly\nto that decision; and the di\ufb00iculty is, how is it possible for\nany power to exclude slavery from the Territory, unless in\nviolation of that decision? That is the di\ufb00iculty.\nIn the Senate of the United States, in , Judge\nTrumbull, in a speech substantially, if not directly, put the\nsame interrogatory to Judge Douglas, as to whether the\npeople of a Territory had the lawful power to exclude\nslavery prior to the formation of a constitution. Judge\nDouglas then answered at considerable length, and his\nanswer will be found in the Congressional Globe, under\ndate of June th, . The Judge said that whether the\npeople could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a\nconstitution or not was a question to be decided by the\nSupreme Court. He put that proposition, as will be seen by\nthe Congressional Globe, in a variety of forms, all running\nto the same thing in substance, \u2014 that it was a question for\nthe Supreme Court. I maintain that when he says, after the\nSupreme Court have decided the question, that the people\nmay yet exclude slavery by any means whatever, he does\nvirtually say that it is not a question for the Supreme Court.\nHe shifts his ground. I appeal to you whether he did not say\nit was a question for the Supreme Court? Has not the\nSupreme Court decided that question? when he now says\nthe people may exclude slavery, does he not make it a\n question for the people? Does he not virtually shift his\nground and say that it is not a question for the Court, but\nfor the people? This is a very simple proposition, \u2014 a very\nplain and naked one. It seems to me that there is no\ndi\ufb00iculty in deciding it. In a variety of ways he said that it\nwas a question for the Supreme Court. He did not stop then\nto tell us that, whatever the Supreme Court decides, the\npeople can by withholding necessary \u201cpolice regulations\u201d\nkeep slavery out. He did not make any such answer I\nsubmit to you now whether the new state of the case has\nnot induced the Judge to sheer away from his original\nground. Would not this be the impression of every fair-\nminded man?\nI hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a\nnew country without police regulations is historically false.\nIt is not true at all. I hold that the history of this country\nshows that the institution of slavery was originally planted\nupon this continent without these \u201cpolice regulations,\u201d\nwhich the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual\nestablishment of it. Not only so, but is there not another\nfact: how came this Dred Scott decision to be made? It was\nmade upon the case of a negro being taken and actually\nheld in slavery in Minnesota Territory, claiming his freedom\nbecause the Act of Congress prohibited his being so held\nthere. Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held\nthere without police regulations? There is at least one\nmatter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the\nTerritory, not only without police regulations, but in the\nteeth of Congressional legislation supposed to be valid at\n the time. This shows that there is vigor enough in slavery to\nplant itself in a new country even against unfriendly\nlegislation. It takes not only law, but the enforcement of law\nto keep it out. That is the history of this country upon the\nsubject.\nI wish to ask one other question. It being understood that\nthe Constitution of the United States guarantees property\nin slaves in the Territories, if there is any infringement of\nthe right of that property, would not the United States\ncourts, organized for the government of the Territory, apply\nsuch remedy as might be necessary in that case? It is a\nmaxim held by the courts that there is no wrong without its\nremedy; and the courts have a remedy for whatever is\nacknowledged and treated as a wrong.\nAgain: I will ask you, my friends, if you were elected\nmembers of the Legislature, what would be the \ufb01rst thing\nyou would have to do before entering upon your duties?\nSwear to support the Constitution of the United States.\nSuppose you believe, as Judge Douglas does, that the\nConstitution of the United States guarantees to your\nneighbor the right to hold slaves in that Territory; that they\nare his property: how can you clear your oaths unless you\ngive him such legislation as is necessary to enable him to\nenjoy that property? What do you understand by supporting\nthe Constitution of a State, or of the United States? Is it not\nto give such constitutional helps to the rights established\nby that Constitution as may be practically needed? Can you,\nif you swear to support the Constitution, and believe that\nthe Constitution establishes a right, clear your oath,\n without giving it support? Do you support the Constitution\nif, knowing or believing there is a right established under it\nwhich \nneeds \nspeci\ufb01c \nlegislation, \nyou \nwithhold \nthat\nlegislation? Do you not violate and disregard your oath? I\ncan conceive of nothing plainer in the world. There can be\nnothing in the words \u201csupport the Constitution,\u201d if you may\nrun counter to it by refusing support to any right\nestablished under the Constitution. And what I say here will\nhold with still more force against the Judge\u2019s doctrine of\n\u201cunfriendly legislation.\u201d How could you, having sworn to\nsupport the Constitution, and believing it guaranteed the\nright to hold slaves in the Territories, assist in legislation\nintended to defeat that right? That would be violating your\nown view of the Constitution. Not only so, but if you were\nto do so, how long would it take the courts to hold your\nvotes unconstitutional and void? Not a moment.\nLastly, I would ask: Is not Congress itself under\nobligation to give legislative support to any right that is\nestablished under the United States Constitution? I repeat\nthe question: Is not Congress itself bound to give legislative\nsupport to any right that is established in the United States\nConstitution? A member of Congress swears to support the\nConstitution of the United States: and if he sees a right\nestablished by that Constitution which needs speci\ufb01c\nlegislative protection, can he clear his oath without giving\nthat protection? Let me ask you why many of us who are\nopposed to slavery upon principle give our acquiescence to\na Fugitive Slave law? Why do we hold ourselves under\nobligations to pass such a law, and abide by it when it is\n passed? Because the Constitution makes provision that the\nowners of slaves shall have the right to reclaim them. It\ngives the right to reclaim slaves; and that right is, as Judge\nDouglas says, a barren right, unless there is legislation that\nwill enforce it.\nThe mere declaration, \u201cNo person held to service or\nlabor in one State under the laws thereof, escaping into\nanother, shall in consequence of any law or regulation\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall\nbe delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service\nor labor may be due,\u201d is powerless without speci\ufb01c\nlegislation to enforce it. Now, on what ground would a\nmember of Congress, who is opposed to slavery in the\nabstract, vote for a Fugitive law, as I would deem it my duty\nto do? Because there is a constitutional right which needs\nlegislation to enforce it. And although it is distasteful to me,\nI have sworn to support the Constitution; and having so\nsworn, I cannot conceive that I do support it if I withhold\nfrom that right any necessary legislation to make it\npractical. And if that is true in regard to a Fugitive Slave\nlaw, is the right to have fugitive slaves reclaimed any better\n\ufb01xed in the Constitution than the right to hold slaves in the\nTerritories? For this decision is a just exposition of the\nConstitution, as Judge Douglas thinks. Is the one right any\nbetter than the other? Is there any man who, while a\nmember of Congress, would give support to the one any\nmore than the other? If I wished to refuse to give legislative\nsupport to slave property in the Territories, if a member of\nCongress, I could not do it, holding the view that the\n Constitution establishes that right. If I did it at all, it would\nbe because I deny that this decision properly construes the\nConstitution. But if I acknowledge, with Judge Douglas,\nthat this decision properly construes the Constitution, I\ncannot conceive that I would be less than a perjured man if\nI should refuse in Congress to give such protection to that\nproperty as in its nature it needed.\nAt the end of what I have said here I propose to give the\nJudge my \ufb01fth interrogatory, which he may take and answer\nat his leisure. My \ufb01fth interrogatory is this:\nIf the slaveholding citizens of a United States Territory\nshould need and demand Congressional legislation for the\nprotection of their slave property in such Territory, would\nyou, as a member of Congress, vote for or against such\nlegislation?\n[Judge DOUGLAS: Will you repeat that? I want to answer\nthat question.]\nIf the slaveholding citizens of a United States Territory\nshould need and demand Congressional legislation for the\nprotection of their slave property in such Territory, would\nyou, as a member of Congress, vote for or against such\nlegislation?\nI am aware that in some of the speeches Judge Douglas\nhas made, he has spoken as if he did not know or think that\nthe Supreme Court had decided that a Territorial\nLegislature cannot exclude slavery. Precisely what the\nJudge would say upon the subject \u2014 whether he would say\nde\ufb01nitely that he does not understand they have so\ndecided, or whether he would say he does understand that\n the court have so decided, \u2014 I do not know; but I know that\nin his speech at Spring\ufb01eld he spoke of it as a thing they\nhad not decided yet; and in his answer to me at Freeport,\nhe spoke of it, so far, again, as I can comprehend it, as a\nthing that had not yet been decided. Now, I hold that if the\nJudge does entertain that view, I think that he is not\nmistaken in so far as it can be said that the court has not\ndecided anything save the mere question of jurisdiction. I\nknow the legal arguments that can be made, \u2014 that after a\ncourt has decided that it cannot take jurisdiction in a case,\nit then has decided all that is before it, and that is the end\nof it. A plausible argument can be made in favor of that\nproposition; but I know that Judge Douglas has said in one\nof his speeches that the court went forward, like honest\nmen as they were, and decided all the points in the case. If\nany points are really extra-judicially decided, because not\nnecessarily before them, then this one as to the power of\nthe Territorial Legislature, to exclude slavery is one of\nthem, as also the one that the Missouri Compromise was\nnull and void. They are both extra-judicial, or neither is,\naccording as the court held that they had no jurisdiction in\nthe case between the parties, because of want of capacity\nof one party to maintain a suit in that court. I want, if I\nhave su\ufb00icient time, to show that the court did pass its\nopinion; but that is the only thing actually done in the case.\nIf they did not decide, they showed what they were ready to\ndecide whenever the matter was before them. What is that\nopinion? After having argued that Congress had no power\nto pass a law excluding slavery from a United States\n Territory, they then used language to this e\ufb00ect: That\ninasmuch as Congress itself could not exercise such a\npower, it followed as a matter of course that it could not\nauthorize a Territorial government to exercise it; for the\nTerritorial Legislature can do no more than Congress could\ndo. Thus it expressed its opinion emphatically against the\npower of a Territorial Legislature to exclude slavery,\nleaving us in just as little doubt on that point as upon any\nother point they really decided.\nNow, my fellow-citizens, I will detain you only a little\nwhile longer; my time is nearly out. I \ufb01nd a report of a\nspeech made by Judge Douglas at Joliet, since we last met\nat Freeport, \u2014 published, I believe, in the Missouri\nRepublican, on the th of this month, in which Judge\nDouglas says:\n\u201cYou know at Ottawa I read this platform, and asked him\nif he concurred in each and all of the principles set forth in\nit. He would not answer these questions. At last I said\nfrankly, I wish you to answer them, because when I get\nthem up here where the color of your principles are a little\ndarker than in Egypt, I intend to trot you down to\nJonesboro. The very notice that I was going to take him\ndown to Egypt made him tremble in his knees so that he\nhad to be carried from the platform. He laid up seven days,\nand in the meantime held a consultation with his political\nphysicians; they had Lovejoy and Farnsworth and all the\nleaders of the Abolition party, they consulted it all over, and\nat last Lincoln came to the conclusion that he would\nanswer, so he came up to Freeport last Friday.\u201d\n Now, that statement altogether furnishes a subject for\nphilosophical contemplation. I have been treating it in that\nway, and I have really come to the conclusion that I can\nexplain it in no other way than by believing the Judge is\ncrazy. If he was in his right mind I cannot conceive how he\nwould have risked disgusting the four or \ufb01ve thousand of\nhis own friends who stood there and knew, as to my having\nbeen carried from the platform, that there was not a word\nof truth in it.\n[Judge DOUGLAS: Did n\u2019t they carry you o\ufb00?]\nThere that question illustrates the character of this man\nDouglas exactly. He smiles now, and says, \u201cDid n\u2019t they\ncarry you o\ufb00?\u201d but he said then \u201che had to be carried o\ufb00\u201d;\nand he said it to convince the country that he had so\ncompletely broken me down by his speech that I had to be\ncarried away. Now he seeks to dodge it, and asks, \u201cDid n\u2019t\nthey carry you o\ufb00?\u201d Yes, they did. But, Judge Douglas, why\ndidn\u2019t you tell the truth? I would like to know why you did\nn\u2019t tell the truth about it. And then again \u201cHe laid up seven\ndays.\u201d He put this in print for the people of the country to\nread as a serious document. I think if he had been in his\nsober senses he would not have risked that barefacedness\nin the presence of thousands of his own friends who knew\nthat I made speeches within six of the seven days at Henry,\nMarshall County, Augusta, Hancock County, and Macomb,\nMcDonough County, including all the necessary travel to\nmeet him again at Freeport at the end of the six days. Now\nI say there is no charitable way to look at that statement,\nexcept to conclude that he is actually crazy. There is\n another thing in that statement that alarmed me very\ngreatly as he states it, that he was going to \u201ctrot me down\nto Egypt.\u201d Thereby he would have you infer that I would not\ncome to Egypt unless he forced me \u2014 that I could not be\ngot here unless he, giant-like, had hauled me down here.\nThat statement he makes, too, in the teeth of the\nknowledge that I had made the stipulation to come down\nhere and that he himself had been very reluctant to enter\ninto the stipulation. More than all this: Judge Douglas,\nwhen he made that statement, must have been crazy and\nwholly out of his sober senses, or else he would have known\nthat when he got me down here, that promise \u2014 that windy\npromise \u2014 of his powers to annihilate me, would n\u2019t\namount to anything. Now, how little do I look like being\ncarried away trembling? Let the Judge go on; and after he\nis done with his half-hour, I want you all, if I can\u2019t go home\nmyself, to let me stay and rot here; and if anything happens\nto the Judge, if I cannot carry him to the hotel and put him\nto bed, let me stay here and rot. I say, then, here is\nsomething extraordinary in this statement. I ask you if you\nknow any other living man who would make such a\nstatement? I will ask my friend Casey, over there, if he\nwould do such a thing? Would he send that out and have his\nmen take it as the truth? Did the Judge talk of trotting me\ndown to Egypt to scare me to death? Why, I know this\npeople better than he does. I was raised just a little east of\nhere. I am a part of this people. But the Judge was raised\nfarther north, and perhaps he has some horrid idea of what\nthis people might be induced to do. But really I have talked\n about this matter perhaps longer than I ought, for it is no\ngreat thing; and yet the smallest are often the most di\ufb00icult\nthings to deal with. The Judge has set about seriously\ntrying to make the impression that when we meet at\ndi\ufb00erent places I am literally in his clutches \u2014 that I am a\npoor, helpless, decrepit mouse, and that I can do nothing at\nall. This is one of the ways he has taken to create that\nimpression. I don\u2019t know any other way to meet it except\nthis. I don\u2019t want to quarrel with him \u2014 to call him a liar;\nbut when I come square up to him I don\u2019t know what else to\ncall him if I must tell the truth out. I want to be at peace,\nand reserve all my \ufb01ghting powers for necessary occasions.\nMy time now is very nearly out, and I give up the tri\ufb02e that\nis left to the Judge, to let him set my knees trembling again,\nif he can.\n   I  H  \nI\n  \n  A    A  \nA    \n \nH\n  \n          \nMR. LINCOLN\u2019S REPLY.\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS: A very large portion of the\nspeech which Judge Douglas has addressed to you has\npreviously been delivered and put in print. I do not mean\nthat for a hit upon the Judge at all. \u2014 If I had not been\ninterrupted, I was going to say that such an answer as I\nwas able to make to a very large portion of it had already\nbeen more than once made and published. There has been\nan opportunity a\ufb00orded to the public to see our respective\nviews upon the topics discussed in a large portion of the\nspeech which he has just delivered. I make these remarks\nfor the purpose of excusing myself for not passing over the\nentire ground that the Judge has traversed. I however\ndesire to take up some of the points that he has attended\nto, and ask your attention to them, and I shall follow him\nbackwards upon some notes which I have taken, reversing\nthe order, by beginning where he concluded.\nThe \nJudge \nhas \nalluded \nto \nthe \nDeclaration \nof\nIndependence, and insisted that negroes are not included\nin that Declaration; and that it is a slander upon the\nframers of that instrument to suppose that negroes were\nmeant therein; and he asks you: Is it possible to believe\n that Mr. Je\ufb00erson, who penned the immortal paper, could\nhave supposed himself applying the language of that\ninstrument to the negro race, and yet held a portion of that\nrace in slavery? Would he not at once have freed them? I\nonly have to remark upon this part of the Judge\u2019s speech\n(and that, too, very brie\ufb02y, for I shall not detain myself, or\nyou, upon that point for any great length of time), that I\nbelieve the entire records of the world, from the date of the\nDeclaration of Independence up to within three years ago,\nmay be searched in vain for one single a\ufb00irmation, from\none single man, that the negro was not included in the\nDeclaration of Independence; I think I may defy Judge\nDouglas to show that he ever said so, that Washington ever\nsaid so, that any President ever said so, that any member of\nCongress ever said so, or that any living man upon the\nwhole earth ever said so, until the necessities of the\npresent policy of the Democratic party, in regard to slavery,\nhad to invent that a\ufb00irmation. And I will remind Judge\nDouglas and this audience that while Mr. Je\ufb00erson was the\nowner of slaves, as undoubtedly he was, in speaking upon\nthis very subject he used the strong language that \u201che\ntrembled for his country when he remembered that God\nwas just\u201d; and I will o\ufb00er the highest premium in my power\nto Judge Douglas if he will show that he, in all his life, ever\nuttered a sentiment at all akin to that of Je\ufb00erson.\nThe next thing to which I will ask your attention is the\nJudge\u2019s comments upon the fact, as he assumes it to be,\nthat we cannot call our public meetings as Republican\nmeetings; and he instances Tazewell County as one of the\n places where the friends of Lincoln have called a public\nmeeting and have not dared to name it a Republican\nmeeting. He instances Monroe County as another, where\nJudge Trumbull and Jehu Baker addressed the persons\nwhom the Judge assumes to be the friends of Lincoln\ncalling them the \u201cFree Democracy.\u201d I have the honor to\ninform Judge Douglas that he spoke in that very county of\nTazewell last Saturday, and I was there on Tuesday last;\nand when he spoke there, he spoke under a call not\nventuring to use the word \u201cDemocrat.\u201d [Turning to Judge\nDouglas.] what think you of this?\nSo, again, there is another thing to which I would ask the\nJudge\u2019s attention upon this subject. In the contest of \nhis party delighted to call themselves together as the\n\u201cNational Democracy\u201d; but now, if there should be a notice\nput \nup \nanywhere \nfor \na \nmeeting \nof \nthe \n\u201cNational\nDemocracy,\u201d Judge Douglas and his friends would not\ncome. They would not suppose themselves invited. They\nwould understand that it was a call for those hateful\npostmasters whom he talks about.\nNow a few words in regard to these extracts from\nspeeches of mine which Judge Douglas has read to you, and\nwhich he supposes are in very great contrast to each other.\nThose speeches have been before the public for a\nconsiderable time, and if they have any inconsistency in\nthem, if there is any con\ufb02ict in them, the public have been\nable to detect it. When the Judge says, in speaking on this\nsubject, that I make speeches of one sort for the people of\nthe northern end of the State, and of a di\ufb00erent sort for the\n southern people, he assumes that I do not understand that\nmy speeches will be put in print and read north and south. I\nknew all the while that the speech that I made at Chicago,\nand the one I made at Jonesboro and the one at Charleston,\nwould all be put in print, and all the reading and intelligent\nmen in the community would see them and know all about\nmy opinions. And I have not supposed, and do not now\nsuppose, that there is any con\ufb02ict whatever between them.\nBut the Judge will have it that if we do not confess that\nthere is a sort of inequality between the white and black\nraces which justi\ufb01es us in making them slaves, we must\nthen insist that there is a degree of equality that requires\nus to make them our wives. Now, I have all the while taken\na broad distinction in regard to that matter; and that is all\nthere is in these di\ufb00erent speeches which he arrays here;\nand the entire reading of either of the speeches will show\nthat that distinction was made. Perhaps by taking two parts\nof the same speech he could have got up as much of a\ncon\ufb02ict as the one he has found. I have all the while\nmaintained that in so far as it should be insisted that there\nwas an equality between the white and black races that\nshould produce a perfect social and political equality, it was\nan impossibility. This you have seen in my printed speeches,\nand with it I have said that in their right to \u201clife, liberty,\nand the pursuit of happiness,\u201d as proclaimed in that old\nDeclaration, the inferior races are our equals. And these\ndeclarations I have constantly made in reference to the\nabstract moral question, to contemplate and consider when\nwe are legislating about any new country which is not\n already cursed with the actual presence of the evil, \u2014\nslavery. I have never manifested any impatience with the\nnecessities that spring from the actual presence of black\npeople amongst us, and the actual existence of slavery\namongst us where it does already exist; but I have insisted\nthat, in legislating for new countries where it does not exist\nthere is no just rule other than that of moral and abstract\nright! With reference to those new countries, those maxims\nas to the right of a people to \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness\u201d were the just rules to be constantly referred to.\nThere is no misunderstanding this, except by men\ninterested to misunderstand it. I take it that I have to\naddress an intelligent and reading community, who will\nperuse what I say, weigh it, and then judge whether I\nadvanced improper or unsound views, or whether I\nadvanced hypocritical, and deceptive, and contrary views in\ndi\ufb00erent portions of the country. I believe myself to be\nguilty of no such thing as the latter, though, of course, I\ncannot claim that I am entirely free from all error in the\nopinions I advance.\nThe Judge has also detained us awhile in regard to the\ndistinction between his party and our party. His he assumes\nto be a national party, ours a sectional one. He does this in\nasking the question whether this country has any interest\nin the maintenance of the Republican party. He assumes\nthat our party is altogether sectional, that the party to\nwhich he adheres is national; and the argument is, that no\nparty can be a rightful party \u2014 and be based upon rightful\nprinciples \u2014 unless it can announce its principles\n everywhere. I presume that Judge Douglas could not go\ninto Russia and announce the doctrine of our national\nDemocracy; he could not denounce the doctrine of kings\nand emperors and monarchies in Russia; and it may be true\nof this country that in some places we may not be able to\nproclaim a doctrine as clearly true as the truth of\ndemocracy, because there is a section so directly opposed\nto it that they will not tolerate us in doing so. Is it the true\ntest of the soundness of a doctrine that in some places\npeople won\u2019t let you proclaim it? Is that the way to test the\ntruth of any doctrine? Why, I understood that at one time\nthe people of Chicago would not let Judge Douglas preach a\ncertain favorite doctrine of his. I commend to his\nconsideration the question whether he takes that as a test\nof the unsoundness of what he wanted to preach.\nThere is another thing to which I wish to ask attention\nfor a little while on this occasion. What has always been the\nevidence brought forward to prove that the Republican\nparty is a sectional party? The main one was that in the\nSouthern portion of the Union the people did not let the\nRepublicans proclaim their doctrines amongst them. That\nhas been the main evidence brought forward, \u2014 that they\nhad no supporters, or substantially none, in the Slave\nStates. The South have not taken hold of our principles as\nwe announce them; nor does Judge Douglas now grapple\nwith those principles. We have a Republican State Platform,\nlaid down in Spring\ufb01eld in June last stating our position all\nthe way through the questions before the country. We are\nnow far advanced in this canvass. Judge Douglas and I have\n made perhaps forty speeches apiece, and we have now for\nthe \ufb01fth time met face to face in debate, and up to this day\nI have not found either Judge Douglas or any friend of his\ntaking hold of the Republican platform, or laying his \ufb01nger\nupon anything in it that is wrong. I ask you all to recollect\nthat. Judge Douglas turns away from the platform of\nprinciples to the fact that he can \ufb01nd people somewhere\nwho will not allow us to announce those principles. If he\nhad great con\ufb01dence that our principles were wrong, he\nwould take hold of them and demonstrate them to be\nwrong. But he does not do so. The only evidence he has of\ntheir being wrong is in the fact that there are people who\nwon\u2019t allow us to preach them. I ask again, is that the way\nto test the soundness of a doctrine?\nI ask his attention also to the fact that by the rule of\nnationality he is himself fast becoming sectional. I ask his\nattention to the fact that his speeches would not go as\ncurrent now south of the Ohio River as they have formerly\ngone there I ask his attention to the fact that he felicitates\nhimself to-day that all the Democrats of the free States are\nagreeing with him, while he omits to tell us that the\nDemocrats of any slave State agree with him. If he has not\nthought of this, I commend to his consideration the\nevidence in his own declaration, on this day, of his\nbecoming sectional too. I see it rapidly approaching.\nWhatever may be the result of this ephemeral contest\nbetween Judge Douglas and myself, I see the day rapidly\napproaching when his pill of sectionalism, which he has\n been thrusting down the throats of Republicans for years\npast, will be crowded down his own throat.\nNow, in regard to what Judge Douglas said (in the\nbeginning of his speech) about the Compromise of \ncontaining the principles of the Nebraska Bill, although I\nhave often presented my views upon that subject, yet as I\nhave not done so in this canvass, I will, if you please, detain\nyou a little with them. I have always maintained, so far as I\nwas able, that there was nothing of the principle of the\nNebraska Bill in the Compromise of  at all, \u2014 nothing\nwhatever. Where can you \ufb01nd the principle of the Nebraska\nBill in that Compromise? If anywhere, in the two pieces of\nthe Compromise organizing the Territories of New Mexico\nand Utah. It was expressly provided in these two acts that\nwhen they came to be admitted into the Union they should\nbe admitted with or without slavery, as they should choose,\nby their own constitutions. Nothing was said in either of\nthose acts as to what was to be done in relation to slavery\nduring the Territorial existence of those Territories, while\nHenry Clay constantly made the declaration (Judge Douglas\nrecognizing him as a leader) that, in his opinion, the old\nMexican laws would control that question during the\nTerritorial existence, and that these old Mexican laws\nexcluded slavery. How can that be used as a principle for\ndeclaring that during the Territorial existence as well as at\nthe time of framing the constitution the people, if you\nplease, might have slaves if they wanted them? I am not\ndiscussing the question whether it is right or wrong; but\nhow are the New Mexican and Utah laws patterns for the\n Nebraska Bill? I maintain that the organization of Utah and\nNew Mexico did not establish a general principle at all. It\nhad no feature of establishing a general principle. The acts\nto which I have referred were a part of a general system of\nCompromises. They did not lay down what was proposed as\na regular policy for the Territories, only an agreement in\nthis particular case to do in that way, because other things\nwere done that were to be a compensation for it. They were\nallowed to come in in that shape, because in another way it\nwas paid for, considering that as a part of that system of\nmeasures called the Compromise of , which \ufb01nally\nincluded half-a-dozen acts. It included the admission of\nCalifornia as a free State, which was kept out of the Union\nfor half a year because it had formed a free constitution. It\nincluded the settlement of the boundary of Texas, which\nhad been unde\ufb01ned before, which was in itself a slavery\nquestion; for if you pushed the line farther west, you made\nTexas larger, and made more slave territory; while, if you\ndrew the line toward the east, you narrowed the boundary\nand diminished the domain of slavery, and by so much\nincreased free territory. It included the abolition of the\nslave trade in the District of Columbia. It included the\npassage of a new Fugitive Slave law. All these things were\nput together, and, though passed in separate acts, were\nnevertheless, in legislation (as the speeches at the time will\nshow), made to depend upon each other. Each got votes\nwith the understanding that the other measures were to\npass, and by this system of compromise, in that series of\nmeasures, those two bills \u2014 the New Mexico and Utah bills\n \u2014 were passed: and I say for that reason they could not be\ntaken as models, framed upon their own intrinsic principle,\nfor all future Territories. And I have the evidence of this in\nthe fact that Judge Douglas, a year afterward, or more than\na year afterward, perhaps, when he \ufb01rst introduced bills for\nthe purpose of framing new Territories, did not attempt to\nfollow these bills of New Mexico and Utah; and even when\nhe introduced this Nebraska Bill, I think you will discover\nthat he did not exactly follow them. But I do not wish to\ndwell at great length upon this branch of the discussion.\nMy own opinion is, that a thorough investigation will show\nmost plainly that the New Mexico and Utah bills were part\nof a system of compromise, and not designed as patterns\nfor future Territorial legislation; and that this Nebraska Bill\ndid not follow them as a pattern at all.\nThe Judge tells, in proceeding, that he is opposed to\nmaking any odious distinctions between free and slave\nStates. I am altogether unaware that the Republicans are in\nfavor of making any odious distinctions between the free\nand slave States. But there is still a di\ufb00erence, I think,\nbetween Judge Douglas and the Republicans in this. I\nsuppose that the real di\ufb00erence between Judge Douglas\nand his friends, and the Republicans on the contrary, is,\nthat the Judge is not in favor of making any di\ufb00erence\nbetween slavery and liberty; that he is in favor of\neradicating, of pressing out of view, the questions of\npreference in this country for free or slave institutions; and\nconsequently every sentiment he utters discards the idea\nthat there is any wrong in slavery. Everything that\n emanates from him or his coadjutors in their course of\npolicy carefully excludes the thought that there is anything\nwrong in slavery. All their arguments, if you will consider\nthem, will be seen to exclude the thought that there is\nanything whatever wrong in slavery. If you will take the\nJudge\u2019s speeches, and select the short and pointed\nsentences expressed by him, \u2014 as his declaration that he\n\u201cdon\u2019t care whether slavery is voted up or down,\u201d \u2014 you\nwill see at once that this is perfectly logical, if you do not\nadmit that slavery is wrong. If you do admit that it is\nwrong, Judge Douglas cannot logically say he don\u2019t care\nwhether a wrong is voted up or voted down. Judge Douglas\ndeclares that if any community wants slavery they have a\nright to have it. He can say that logically, if he says that\nthere is no wrong in slavery; but if you admit that there is a\nwrong in it, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right\nto do wrong. He insists that upon the score of equality the\nowners of slaves and owners of property \u2014 of horses and\nevery other sort of property \u2014 should be alike, and hold\nthem alike in a new Territory. That is perfectly logical if the\ntwo species of property are alike and are equally founded in\nright. But if you admit that one of them is wrong, you\ncannot institute any equality between right and wrong. And\nfrom this di\ufb00erence of sentiment, \u2014 the belief on the part\nof one that the institution is wrong, and a policy springing\nfrom that belief which looks to the arrest of the\nenlargement of that wrong, and this other sentiment, that it\nis no wrong, and a policy sprung from that sentiment,\nwhich will tolerate no idea of preventing the wrong from\n growing larger, and looks to there never being an end to it\nthrough all the existence of things, \u2014 arises the real\ndi\ufb00erence between Judge Douglas and his friends on the\none hand and the Republicans on the other. Now, I confess\nmyself as belonging to that class in the country who\ncontemplate slavery as a moral, social, and political evil,\nhaving due regard for its actual existence amongst us and\nthe di\ufb00iculties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way,\nand to all the constitutional obligations which have been\nthrown about it; but, nevertheless, desire a policy that\nlooks to the prevention of it as a wrong, and looks hopefully\nto the time when as a wrong it may come to an end.\nJudge Douglas has again, for, I believe, the \ufb01fth time, if\nnot the seventh, in my presence, reiterated his charge of a\nconspiracy or combination between the National Democrats\nand Republicans. What evidence Judge Douglas has upon\nthis subject I know not, inasmuch as he never favors us\nwith any. I have said upon a former occasion, and I do not\nchoose to suppress it now, that I have no objection to the\ndivision in the Judge\u2019s party. He got it up himself. It was all\nhis and their work. He had, I think, a great deal more to do\nwith the steps that led to the Lecompton Constitution than\nMr. Buchanan had; though at last, when they reached it,\nthey quarreled over it, and their friends divided upon it. I\nam very free to confess to Judge Douglas that I have no\nobjection to the division; but I defy the Judge to show any\nevidence that I have in any way promoted that division,\nunless he insists on being a witness himself in merely\nsaying so. I can give all fair friends of Judge Douglas here\n to understand exactly the view that Republicans take in\nregard to that division. Don\u2019t you remember how two years\nago the opponents of the Democratic party were divided\nbetween Fremont and Fillmore? I guess you do. Any\nDemocrat who remembers that division will remember also\nthat he was at the time very glad of it, and then he will be\nable to see all there is between the National Democrats and\nthe Republicans. What we now think of the two divisions of\nDemocrats, you then thought of the Fremont and Fillmore\ndivisions. That is all there is of it.\nBut if the Judge continues to put forward the declaration\nthat there is an unholy and unnatural alliance between the\nRepublicans and the National Democrats, I now want to\nenter my protest against receiving him as an entirely\ncompetent witness upon that subject. I want to call to the\nJudge\u2019s attention an attack he made upon me in the \ufb01rst\none of these debates, at Ottawa, on the st of August. In\norder to \ufb01x extreme Abolitionism upon me, Judge Douglas\nread a set of resolutions which he declared had been\npassed by a Republican State Convention, in October, ,\nat Spring\ufb01eld, Illinois, and he declared I had taken part in\nthat Convention. It turned out that although a few men\ncalling themselves an anti-Nebraska State Convention had\nsat at Spring\ufb01eld about that time, yet neither did I take any\npart in it, nor did it pass the resolutions or any such\nresolutions as Judge Douglas read. So apparent had it\nbecome that the resolutions which he read had not been\npassed at Spring\ufb01eld at all, nor by a State Convention in\nwhich I had taken part, that seven days afterward, at\n Freeport, Judge Douglas declared that he had been misled\nby Charles H. Lanphier, editor of the State Register, and\nThomas L. Harris, member of Congress in that district, and\nhe promised in that speech that when he went to\nSpring\ufb01eld he would investigate the matter. Since then\nJudge Douglas has been to Spring\ufb01eld, and I presume has\nmade the investigation; but a month has passed since he\nhas been there, and, so far as I know, he has made no\nreport of the result of his investigation. I have waited as I\nthink su\ufb00icient time for the report of that investigation, and\nI have some curiosity to see and hear it. A fraud, an\nabsolute forgery was committed, and the perpetration of it\nwas traced to the three, \u2014 Lanphier, Harris, and Douglas.\nWhether it can be narrowed in any way so as to exonerate\nany one of them, is what Judge Douglas\u2019s report would\nprobably show.\nIt is true that the set of resolutions read by Judge\nDouglas were published in the Illinois State Register on the\nth of October, , as being the resolutions of an anti-\nNebraska Convention which had sat in that same month of\nOctober, at Spring\ufb01eld. But it is also true that the\npublication in the Register was a forgery then, and the\nquestion is still behind, which of the three, if not all of\nthem, committed that forgery. The idea that it was done by\nmistake is absurd. The article in the Illinois State Register\ncontains part of the real proceedings of that Spring\ufb01eld\nConvention, showing that the writer of the article had the\nreal proceedings before him, and purposely threw out the\ngenuine \nresolutions \npassed \nby \nthe \nConvention \nand\n fraudulently substituted the others. Lanphier then, as now,\nwas the editor of the Register, so that there seems to be but\nlittle room for his escape. But then it is to be borne in mind\nthat Lanphier had less interest in the object of that forgery\nthan either of the other two. The main object of that forgery\nat that time was to beat Yates and elect Harris to Congress,\nand that object was known to be exceedingly dear to Judge\nDouglas at that time. Harris and Douglas were both in\nSpring\ufb01eld when the Convention was in session, and\nalthough they both left before the fraud appeared in the\nRegister, subsequent events show that they have both had\ntheir eyes \ufb01xed upon that Convention.\nThe fraud having been apparently successful upon the\noccasion, both Harris and Douglas have more than once\nsince then been attempting to put it to new uses. As the\n\ufb01sherman\u2019s wife, whose drowned husband was brought\nhome with his body full of eels, said when she was asked\nwhat was to be done with him, \u201cTake the eels out and set\nhim again,\u201d so Harris and Douglas have shown a disposition\nto take the eels out of that stale fraud by which they gained\nHarris\u2019s election, and set the fraud again more than once.\nOn the th of July, , Douglas attempted a repetition of\nit upon Trumbull on the \ufb02oor of the Senate of the United\nStates, \nas \nwill \nappear \nfrom \nthe \nappendix \nof \nthe\nCongressional Globe of that date.\nOn the th of August, Harris attempted it again upon\nNorton in the House of Representatives, as will appear by\nthe same documents, \u2014 the appendix to the Congressional\nGlobe of that date. On the st of August last, all three \u2014\n Lanphier, Douglas, and Harris \u2014 reattempted it upon me at\nOttawa. It has been clung to and played out again and\nagain as an exceedingly high trump by this blessed trio.\nAnd now that it has been discovered publicly to be a fraud\nwe \ufb01nd that Judge Douglas manifests no surprise at it at\nall. He makes no complaint of Lanphier, who must have\nknown it to be a fraud from the beginning. He, Lanphier,\nand Harris are just as cozy now and just as active in the\nconcoction of new schemes as they were before the general\ndiscovery of this fraud. Now, all this is very natural if they\nare all alike guilty in that fraud, and it is very unnatural if\nany one of them is innocent. Lanphier perhaps insists that\nthe rule of honor among thieves does not quite require him\nto take all upon himself, and consequently my friend Judge\nDouglas \ufb01nds it di\ufb00icult to make a satisfactory report upon\nhis investigation. But meanwhile the three are agreed that\neach is \u201ca most honorable man.\u201d\nJudge Douglas requires an indorsement of his truth and\nhonor by a re-election to the United States Senate, and he\nmakes and reports against me and against Judge Trumbull,\nday after day, charges which we know to be utterly untrue,\nwithout for a moment seeming to think that this one\nunexplained fraud, which he promised to investigate, will\nbe the least drawback to his claim to belief. Harris ditto. He\nasks a re-election to the lower House of Congress without\nseeming to remember at all that he is involved in this\ndishonorable fraud! The Illinois State Register, edited by\nLanphier, then, as now, the central organ of both Harris\nand Douglas, continues to din the public ear with this\n assertion, without seeming to suspect that these assertions\nare at all lacking in title to belief.\nAfter all, the question still recurs upon us, How did that\nfraud originally get into the State Register? Lanphier then,\nas now, was the editor of that paper. Lanphier knows.\nLanphier cannot be ignorant of how and by whom it was\noriginally concocted. Can he be induced to tell, or, if he has\ntold, can Judge Douglas be induced to tell how it originally\nwas concocted? It may be true that Lanphier insists that\nthe two men for whose bene\ufb01t it was originally devised\nshall at least bear their share of it! How that is, I do not\nknow, and while it remains unexplained I hope to be\npardoned if I insist that the mere fact of Judge Douglas\nmaking charges against Trumbull and myself is not quite\nsu\ufb00icient evidence to establish them!\nWhile we were at Freeport, in one of these joint\ndiscussions, I answered certain interrogatories which Judge\nDouglas had propounded to me, and then in turn\npropounded some to him, which he in a sort of way\nanswered. The third one of these interrogatories I have\nwith me, and wish now to make some comments upon it. It\nwas in these words: \u201cIf the Supreme Court of States cannot\nexclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of\nacquiescing in, adhering to, and following such decision as\na rule of political action?\u201d\nTo this interrogatory Judge Douglas made no answer in\nany just sense of the word. He contented himself with\nsneering at the thought that it was possible for the\nSupreme Court ever to make such a decision. He sneered\n at me for propounding the interrogatory. I had not\npropounded it without some re\ufb02ection, and I wish now to\naddress to this audience some remarks upon it.\nIn the second clause of the sixth article, I believe it is, of\nthe Constitution of the United States, we \ufb01nd the following\nlanguage:\n\u201cThis Constitution and the laws of the United States\nwhich shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties\nmade, or which shall be made, under the authority of the\nUnited States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the\njudges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in\nthe Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\nnotwithstanding.\u201d\nThe essence of the Dred Scott case is compressed into\nthe sentence which I will now read:\n\u201cNow, as we have already said in an earlier part of this\nopinion, upon a di\ufb00erent point, the right of property in a\nslave \nis \ndistinctly \nand \nexpressly \na\ufb00irmed \nin \nthe\nConstitution.\u201d\nI repeat it, \u201cThe right of property in a slave is distinctly\nand expressly a\ufb00irmed in the Constitution\u201d! What is it to be\n\u201ca\ufb00irmed\u201d \nin \nthe \nConstitution? \nMade \n\ufb01rm \nin \nthe\nConstitution, so made that it cannot be separated from the\nConstitution without breaking the Constitution; durable as\nthe Constitution, and part of the Constitution. Now,\nremembering the provision of the Constitution which I have\nread \u2014 a\ufb00irming that that instrument is the supreme law of\nthe land; that the judges of every State shall be bound by it,\nany law or constitution of any State to the contrary\n notwithstanding; that the right of property in a slave is\na\ufb00irmed in that Constitution, is made, formed into, and\ncannot be separated from it without breaking it; durable as\nthe instrument; part of the instrument; \u2014 what follows as a\nshort and even syllogistic argument from it? I think it\nfollows, and I submit to the consideration of men capable of\narguing whether, as I state it, in syllogistic form, the\nargument has any fault in it:\nNothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can\ndestroy a right distinctly and expressly a\ufb00irmed in the\nConstitution of the United States.\nThe right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly\na\ufb00irmed in the Constitution of the United States.\nTherefore, nothing in the Constitution or laws of any\nState can destroy the right of property in a slave.\nI believe that no fault can be pointed out in that\nargument; assuming the truth of the premises, the\nconclusion, so far as I have capacity at all to understand it,\nfollows inevitably. There is a fault in it as I think, but the\nfault is not in the reasoning; but the falsehood in fact is a\nfault of the premises. I believe that the right of property in\na slave is not distinctly and expressly a\ufb00irmed in the\nConstitution, and Judge Douglas thinks it is. I believe that\nthe Supreme Court and the advocates of that decision may\nsearch in vain for the place in the Constitution where the\nright of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly\na\ufb00irmed I say, therefore, that I think one of the premises is\nnot true in fact. But it is true with Judge Douglas. It is true\nwith the Supreme Court who pronounced it. They are\n estopped from denying it, and being estopped from denying\nit, the conclusion follows that, the Constitution of the\nUnited States being the supreme law, no constitution or law\ncan interfere with it. It being a\ufb00irmed in the decision that\nthe right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly\na\ufb00irmed in the Constitution, the conclusion inevitably\nfollows that no State law or constitution can destroy that\nright. I then say to Judge Douglas and to all others that I\nthink it will take a better answer than a sneer to show that\nthose who have said that the right of property in a slave is\ndistinctly and expressly a\ufb00irmed in the Constitution, are\nnot prepared to show that no constitution or law can\ndestroy that right. I say I believe it will take a far better\nargument than a mere sneer to show to the minds of\nintelligent men that whoever has so said is not prepared,\nwhenever public sentiment is so far advanced as to justify\nit, to say the other. This is but an opinion, and the opinion\nof one very humble man; but it is my opinion that the Dred\nScott decision, as it is, never would have been made in its\npresent form if the party that made it had not been\nsustained previously by the elections. My own opinion is,\nthat the new Dred Scott decision, deciding against the right\nof the people of the States to exclude slavery, will never be\nmade if that party is not sustained by the elections. I\nbelieve, further, that it is just as sure to be made as to-\nmorrow is to come, if that party shall be sustained. I have\nsaid, upon a former occasion, and I repeat it now, that the\ncourse of arguement that Judge Douglas makes use of upon\nthis subject (I charge not his motives in this), is preparing\n the public mind for that new Dred Scott decision. I have\nasked him again to point out to me the reasons for his \ufb01rst\nadherence to the Dred Scott decision as it is. I have turned\nhis attention to the fact that General Jackson di\ufb00ered with\nhim in regard to the political obligation of a Supreme Court\ndecision. I have asked his attention to the fact that\nJe\ufb00erson di\ufb00ered with him in regard to the political\nobligation of a Supreme Court decision. Je\ufb00erson said that\n\u201cJudges are as honest as other men, and not more so.\u201d And\nhe said, substantially, that whenever a free people should\ngive up in absolute submission to any department of\ngovernment, retaining for themselves no appeal from it,\ntheir liberties were gone. I have asked his attention to the\nfact that the Cincinnati platform, upon which he says he\nstands, disregards a time-honored decision of the Supreme\nCourt, in denying the power of Congress to establish a\nNational Bank. I have asked his attention to the fact that he\nhimself was one of the most active instruments at one time\nin breaking down the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois\nbecause it had made a decision distasteful to him, \u2014 a\nstruggle ending in the remarkable circumstance of his\nsitting down as one of the new Judges who were to\noverslaugh that decision; getting his title of Judge in that\nvery way.\nSo far in this controversy I can get no answer at all from\nJudge Douglas upon these subjects. Not one can I get from\nhim, except that he swells himself up and says, \u201cAll of us\nwho stand by the decision of the Supreme Court are the\nfriends of the Constitution; all you fellows that dare\n question it in any way are the enemies of the Constitution.\u201d\nNow, in this very devoted adherence to this decision, in\nopposition to all the great political leaders whom he has\nrecognized as leaders, in opposition to his former self and\nhistory, there is something very marked. And the manner in\nwhich he adheres to it, \u2014 not as being right upon the\nmerits, as he conceives (because he did not discuss that at\nall), but as being absolutely obligatory upon every one\nsimply because of the source from whence it comes, as that\nwhich no man can gainsay, whatever it may be, \u2014 this is\nanother marked feature of his adherence to that decision. It\nmarks it in this respect, that it commits him to the next\ndecision, whenever it comes, as being as obligatory as this\none, since he does not investigate it, and won\u2019t inquire\nwhether this opinion is right or wrong. So he takes the next\none without inquiring whether it is right or wrong. He\nteaches men this doctrine, and in so doing prepares the\npublic mind to take the next decision when it comes,\nwithout any inquiry. In this I think I argue fairly (without\nquestioning motives at all) that Judge Douglas is most\ningeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to\ntake that decision when it comes; and not only so, but he is\ndoing it in various other ways. In these general maxims\nabout liberty, in his assertions that he \u201cdon\u2019t care whether\nslavery is voted up or voted down,\u201d; that \u201cwhoever wants\nslavery has a right to have it\u201d; that \u201cupon principles of\nequality it should be allowed to go everywhere\u201d; that \u201cthere\nis no inconsistency between free and slave institutions\u201d \u2014\nin this he is also preparing (whether purposely or not) the\n way for making the institution of slavery national! I repeat\nagain, for I wish no misunderstanding, that I do not charge\nthat he means it so; but I call upon your minds to inquire, if\nyou were going to get the best instrument you could, and\nthen set it to work in the most ingenious way, to prepare\nthe public mind for this movement, operating in the free\nStates, where there is now an abhorrence of the institution\nof slavery, could you \ufb01nd an instrument so capable of doing\nit as Judge Douglas, or one employed in so apt a way to do\nit?\nI have said once before, and I will repeat it now, that Mr.\nClay, when he was once answering an objection to the\nColonization Society, that it had a tendency to the ultimate\nemancipation of the slaves, said that:\n\u201cThose who would repress all tendencies to liberty and\nultimate emancipation must do more than put down the\nbenevolent e\ufb00orts of the Colonization Society: they must go\nback to the era of our liberty and independence, and\nmuzzle the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return;\nthey must blow out the moral lights around us; they must\npenetrate the human soul, and eradicate the light of reason\nand the love of liberty!\u201d\nAnd I do think \u2014 I repeat, though I said it on a former\noccasion \u2014 that Judge Douglas and whoever, like him,\nteaches that the negro has no share, humble though it may\nbe, in the Declaration of Independence, is going back to the\nera of our liberty and independence, and, so far as in him\nlies, muzzling the cannon that thunders its annual joyous\nreturn; that he is blowing out the moral lights around us,\n when he contends that whoever wants slaves has a right to\nhold them; that he is penetrating, so far as lies in his power,\nthe human soul, and eradicating the light of reason and the\nlove of liberty, when he is in every possible way preparing\nthe public mind, by his vast in\ufb02uence, for making the\ninstitution of slavery perpetual and national.\nThere is, my friends, only one other point to which I will\ncall your attention for the remaining time that I have left\nme, and perhaps I shall not occupy the entire time that I\nhave, as that one point may not take me clear through it.\nAmong \nthe \ninterrogatories \nthat \nJudge \nDouglas\npropounded to me at Freeport, there was one in about this\nlanguage:\n\u201cAre you opposed to the acquisition of any further\nterritory to the United States, unless slavery shall \ufb01rst be\nprohibited therein?\u201d\nI answered, as I thought, in this way: that I am not\ngenerally opposed to the acquisition of additional territory,\nand that I would support a proposition for the acquisition of\nadditional territory according as my supporting it was or\nwas not calculated to aggravate this slavery question\namongst us. I then proposed to Judge Douglas another\ninterrogatory, which was correlative to that: \u201cAre you in\nfavor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how it\nmay a\ufb00ect us upon the slavery question?\u201d Judge Douglas\nanswered, \u2014 that is, in his own way he answered it. I\nbelieve that, although he took a good many words to\nanswer it, it was a little more fully answered than any\nother. The substance of his answer was that this country\n would continue to expand; that it would need additional\nterritory; that it was as absurd to suppose that we could\ncontinue upon our present territory, enlarging in population\nas we are, as it would be to hoop a boy twelve years of age,\nand expect him to grow to man\u2019s size without bursting the\nhoops. I believe it was something like that. Consequently,\nhe was in favor of the acquisition of further territory as fast\nas we might need it, in disregard of how it might a\ufb00ect the\nslavery question. I do not say this as giving his exact\nlanguage, but he said so substantially; and he would leave\nthe question of slavery, where the territory was acquired, to\nbe settled by the people of the acquired territory. [\u201cThat\u2019s\nthe doctrine.\u201d] May be it is; let us consider that for a while.\nThis will probably, in the run of things, become one of the\nconcrete manifestations of this slavery question. If Judge\nDouglas\u2019s policy upon this question succeeds, and gets\nfairly settled down, until all opposition is crushed out, the\nnext thing will be a grab for the territory of poor Mexico,\nan invasion of the rich lands of South America, then the\nadjoining islands will follow, each one of which promises\nadditional slave-\ufb01elds. And this question is to be left to the\npeople of those countries for settlement. When we get\nMexico, I don\u2019t know whether the Judge will be in favor of\nthe Mexican people that we get with it settling that\nquestion for themselves and all others; because we know\nthe Judge has a great horror for mongrels, and I\nunderstand that the people of Mexico are most decidedly a\nrace of mongrels. I understand that there is not more than\none person there out of eight who is pure white, and I\n suppose from the Judge\u2019s previous declaration that when\nwe get Mexico, or any considerable portion of it, that he\nwill be in favor of these mongrels settling the question,\nwhich would bring him somewhat into collision with his\nhorror of an inferior race.\nIt is to be remembered, though, that this power of\nacquiring additional territory is a power con\ufb01ded to the\nPresident and the Senate of the United States. It is a power\nnot under the control of the representatives of the people\nany further than they, the President and the Senate, can be\nconsidered the representatives of the people. Let me\nillustrate that by a case we have in our history. When we\nacquired the territory from Mexico in the Mexican War, the\nHouse of Representatives, composed of the immediate\nrepresentatives of the people, all the time insisted that the\nterritory thus to be acquired should be brought in upon\ncondition that slavery should be forever prohibited therein,\nupon the terms and in the language that slavery had been\nprohibited from coming into this country. That was insisted\nupon constantly and never failed to call forth an assurance\nthat \nany \nterritory \nthus \nacquired \nshould \nhave \nthat\nprohibition in it, so far as the House of Representatives was\nconcerned. But at last the President and Senate acquired\nthe territory without asking the House of Representatives\nanything about it, and took it without that prohibition. They\nhave the power of acquiring territory without the\nimmediate representatives of the people being called upon\nto say anything about it, and thus furnishing a very apt and\npowerful means of bringing new territory into the Union,\n and, when it is once brought into the country, involving us\nanew in this slavery agitation. It is therefore, as I think, a\nvery important question for due consideration of the\nAmerican people, whether the policy of bringing in\nadditional territory, without considering at all how it will\noperate upon the safety of the Union in reference to this\none great disturbing element in our national politics, shall\nbe adopted as the policy of the country. You will bear in\nmind that it is to be acquired, according to the Judge\u2019s\nview, as fast as it is needed, and the inde\ufb01nite part of this\nproposition is that we have only Judge Douglas and his\nclass of men to decide how fast it is needed. We have no\nclear and certain way of determining or demonstrating how\nfast territory is needed by the necessities of the country.\nWhoever wants to go out \ufb01libustering, then, thinks that\nmore territory is needed. Whoever wants wider slave-\ufb01elds\nfeels sure that some additional territory is needed as slave\nterritory. Then it is as easy to show the necessity of\nadditional slave-territory as it is to assert anything that is\nincapable of absolute demonstration. Whatever motive a\nman or a set of men may have for making annexation of\nproperty or territory, it is very easy to assert, but much less\neasy to disprove, that it is necessary for the wants of the\ncountry.\nAnd now it only remains for me to say that I think it is a\nvery grave question for the people of this Union to consider,\nwhether, in view of the fact that this slavery question has\nbeen the only one that has ever endangered our Republican\ninstitutions, the only one that has ever threatened or\n menaced a dissolution of the Union, that has ever disturbed\nus in such a way as to make us fear for the perpetuity of\nour liberty, \u2014 in view of these facts, I think it is an\nexceedingly interesting and important question for this\npeople to consider whether we shall engage in the policy of\nacquiring additional territory, discarding altogether from\nour consideration, while obtaining new territory, the\nquestion how it may a\ufb00ect us in regard to this, the only\nendangering \nelement \nto \nour \nliberties \nand \nnational\ngreatness. The Judge\u2019s view has been expressed. I, in my\nanswer to his question, have expressed mine. I think it will\nbecome an important and practical question. Our views are\nbefore the public. I am willing and anxious that they should\nconsider them fully; that they should turn it about and\nconsider the importance of the question, and arrive at a\njust conclusion as to whether it is or is not wise in the\npeople of this Union, in the acquisition of new territory, to\nconsider whether it will add to the disturbance that is\nexisting amongst us \u2014 whether it will add to the one only\ndanger that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the\nUnion or our own liberties. I think it is extremely important\nthat they shall decide, and rightly decide, that question\nbefore entering upon that policy.\nAnd now, my friends, having said the little I wish to say\nupon this head, whether I have occupied the whole of the\nremnant of my time or not, I believe I could not enter upon\nany new topic so as to treat it fully, without transcending\nmy time, which I would not for a moment think of doing. I\ngive way to Judge Douglas.\n   A   \n  A    A  A  \n  \n  \n           \nMR. LINCOLN\u2019S REPLY\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 I have been somewhat,\nin my own mind, complimented by a large portion of Judge\nDouglas\u2019s speech, \u2014 I mean that portion which he devotes\nto the controversy between himself and the present\nAdministration. This is the seventh time Judge Douglas and\nmyself have met in these joint discussions, and he has been\ngradually improving in regard to his war with the\nAdministration. At Quincy, day before yesterday, he was a\nlittle more severe upon the Administration than I had heard\nhim upon any occasion, and I took pains to compliment him\nfor it. I then told him to give it to them with all the power\nhe had; and as some of them were present, I told them I\nwould be very much obliged if they would give it to him in\nabout the same way. I take it he has now vastly improved\nupon the attack he made then upon the Administration. I\n\ufb02atter myself he has really taken my advice on this subject.\nAll I can say now is to re-commend to him and to them what\nI then commended, \u2014 to prosecute the war against one\nanother in the most vigorous manner. I say to them again:\n\u201cGo it, husband! \u2014 Go it, bear!\u201d\nThere is one other thing I will mention before I leave this\nbranch of the discussion, \u2014 although I do not consider it\n much of my business, anyway. I refer to that part of the\nJudge\u2019s remarks where he undertakes to involve Mr.\nBuchanan in an inconsistency. He reads something from\nMr. Buchanan, from which he undertakes to involve him in\nan inconsistency; and he gets something of a cheer for\nhaving done so. I would only remind the Judge that while\nhe is very valiantly \ufb01ghting for the Nebraska Bill and the\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise, it has been but a little\nwhile since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri\nCompromise. I want to know if Buchanan has not as much\nright to be inconsistent as Douglas has? Has Douglas the\nexclusive right, in this country, of being on all sides of all\nquestions? Is nobody allowed that high privilege but\nhimself? Is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject?\nSo far as Judge Douglas addressed his speech to me, or\nso far as it was about me, it is my business to pay some\nattention to it. I have heard the Judge state two or three\ntimes what he has stated to-day, that in a speech which I\nmade at Spring\ufb01eld, Illinois, I had in a very especial\nmanner complained that the Supreme Court in the Dred\nScott case had decided that a negro could never be a\ncitizen of the United States. I have omitted by some\naccident heretofore to analyze this statement, and it is\nrequired of me to notice it now. In point of fact it is untrue.\nI never have complained especially of the Dred Scott\ndecision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen,\nand the Judge is always wrong when he says I ever did so\ncomplain of it. I have the speech here, and I will thank him\nor any of his friends to show where I said that a negro\n should be a citizen, and complained especially of the Dred\nScott decision because it declared he could not be one. I\nhave done no such thing; and Judge Douglas, so\npersistently insisting that I have done so, has strongly\nimpressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his\npart to misrepresent me. He could not get his foundation\nfor insisting that I was in favor of this negro equality\nanywhere else as well as he could by assuming that untrue\nproposition. Let me tell this audience what is true in regard\nto that matter; and the means by which they may correct\nme if I do not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the\nspeech itself. I spoke of the Dred Scott decision in my\nSpring\ufb01eld speech, and I was then endeavoring to prove\nthat the Dred Scott decision was a portion of a system or\nscheme to make slavery national in this country. I pointed\nout what things had been decided by the court. I mentioned\nas a fact that they had decided that a negro could not be a\ncitizen; that they had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the\nnegro, under all circumstances, of the remotest possibility\nof ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a\ncitizen of the United States under a certain clause of the\nConstitution. I stated that, without making any complaint of\nit at all. I then went on and stated the other points decided\nin the case; namely, that the bringing of a negro into the\nState of Illinois and holding him in slavery for two years\nhere was a matter in regard to which they would not decide\nwhether it would make him free or not; that they decided\nthe further point that taking him into a United States\nTerritory where slavery was prohibited by Act of Congress\n did not make him free, because that Act of Congress, as\nthey held, was unconstitutional. I mentioned these three\nthings as making up the points decided in that case. I\nmentioned them in a lump, taken in connection with the\nintroduction of the Nebraska Bill, and the amendment of\nChase, o\ufb00ered at the time, declaratory of the right of the\npeople of the Territories to exclude slavery, which was\nvoted down by the friends of the bill. I mentioned all these\nthings together, as evidence tending to prove a combination\nand conspiracy to make the institution of slavery national.\nIn that connection and in that way I mentioned the decision\non the point that a negro could not be a citizen, and in no\nother connection.\nOut of this Judge Douglas builds up his beautiful\nfabrication of my purpose to introduce a perfect social and\npolitical equality between the white and black races. His\nassertion that I made an \u201cespecial objection\u201d (that is his\nexact language) to the decision on this account is untrue in\npoint of fact.\nNow, while I am upon this subject, and as Henry Clay has\nbeen alluded to, I desire to place myself, in connection with\nMr. Clay, as nearly right before this people as may be. I am\nquite aware what the Judge\u2019s object is here by all these\nallusions. He knows that we are before an audience having\nstrong sympathies southward, by relationship, place of\nbirth, and so on. He desires to place me in an extremely\nAbolition attitude. He read upon a former occasion, and\nalludes, without reading, to-day to a portion of a speech\nwhich I delivered in Chicago. In his quotations from that\n speech, as he has made them upon former occasions, the\nextracts were taken in such a way as, I suppose, brings\nthem within the de\ufb01nition of what is called garbling, \u2014\ntaking portions of a speech which, when taken by\nthemselves, do not present the entire sense of the speaker\nas expressed at the time. I propose, therefore, out of that\nsame speech, to show how one portion of it which he\nskipped over (taking an extract before and an extract after)\nwill give a di\ufb00erent idea, and the true idea I intended to\nconvey. It will take me some little time to read it, but I\nbelieve I will occupy the time that way.\nYou have heard him frequently allude to my controversy\nwith him in regard to the Declaration of Independence. I\nconfess that I have had a struggle with Judge Douglas on\nthat matter, and I will try brie\ufb02y to place myself right in\nregard to it on this occasion. I said \u2014 and it is between the\nextracts Judge Douglas has taken from this speech, and put\nin his published speeches:\n\u201cIt may be argued that there are certain conditions that\nmake necessities and impose them upon us, and to the\nextent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must\nsubmit to it. I think that was the condition in which we\nfound ourselves when we established this government. We\nhad slaves among us, we could not get our Constitution\nunless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could\nnot secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more;\nand having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not\ndestroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let\nthe charter remain as our standard.\u201d\n Now, I have upon all occasions declared as strongly as\nJudge Douglas against the disposition to interfere with the\nexisting institution of slavery. You hear me read it from the\nsame speech from which he takes garbled extracts for the\npurpose of proving upon me a disposition to interfere with\nthe institution of slavery, and establish a perfect social and\npolitical equality between negroes and white people.\nAllow me while upon this subject brie\ufb02y to present one\nother extract from a speech of mine, more than a year ago,\nat Spring\ufb01eld, in discussing this very same question, soon\nafter Judge Douglas took his ground that negroes were, not\nincluded in the Declaration of Independence:\n\u201cI think the authors of that notable instrument intended\nto include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men\nequal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were\nequal in color, size, intellect, moral development, or social\ncapacity. They de\ufb01ned with tolerable distinctness in what\nthey did consider all men created equal, \u2014 equal in certain\ninalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness. This they said, and this they meant.\nThey did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all\nwere then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they\nwere about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact they\nhad no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to\ndeclare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow\nas fast as circumstances should permit.\n\u201cThey meant to set up a standard maxim for free society\nwhich should be familiar to all, \u2014 constantly looked to,\nconstantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly\n attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly\nspreading and deepening its in\ufb02uence, and augmenting the\nhappiness and value of life to all people, of all colors,\neverywhere.\u201d\nThere again are the sentiments I have expressed in\nregard to the Declaration of Independence upon a former\noccasion, \u2014 sentiments which have been put in print and\nread wherever anybody cared to know what so humble an\nindividual as myself chose to say in regard to it.\nAt Galesburgh, the other day, I said, in answer to Judge\nDouglas, that three years ago there never had been a man,\nso far as I knew or believed, in the whole world, who had\nsaid that the Declaration of Independence did not include\nnegroes in the term \u201call men.\u201d I reassert it to-day. I assert\nthat Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the whole\nrecords of the country, and it will be a matter of great\nastonishment to me if they shall be able to \ufb01nd that one\nhuman being three years ago had ever uttered the\nastounding sentiment that the term \u201call men\u201d in the\nDeclaration did not include the negro. Do not let me be\nmisunderstood. I know that more than three years ago\nthere were men who, \ufb01nding this assertion constantly in\nthe way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency\nand perpetuation of slavery, denied the truth of it. I know\nthat Mr. Calhoun and all the politicians of his school denied\nthe truth of the Declaration. I know that it ran along in the\nmouth of some Southern men for a period of years, ending\nat last in that shameful, though rather forcible, declaration\nof Pettit of Indiana, upon the \ufb02oor of the United States\n Senate, that the Declaration of Independence was in that\nrespect \u201ca self-evident lie,\u201d rather than a self-evident truth.\nBut I say, with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at\nthe Declaration without directly attacking it, that three\nyears ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to\nassail it in the sneaking way of pretending to believe it, and\nthen asserting it did not include the negro. I believe the\n\ufb01rst man who ever said it was Chief Justice Taney in the\nDred Scott case, and the next to him was our friend\nStephen A. Douglas. And now it has become the catchword\nof the entire party. I would like to call upon his friends\neverywhere to consider how they have come in so short a\ntime to view this matter in a way so entirely di\ufb00erent from\ntheir former belief; to ask whether they are not being borne\nalong by an irresistible current, \u2014 whither, they know not.\nIn answer to my proposition at Galesburgh last week, I\nsee that some man in Chicago has got up a letter,\naddressed to the Chicago Times, to show, as he professes,\nthat somebody had said so before; and he signs himself \u201cAn\nOld-Line Whig,\u201d if I remember correctly. In the \ufb01rst place, I\nwould say he was not an old-line Whig. I am somewhat\nacquainted with old-line Whigs from the origin to the end of\nthat party; I became pretty well acquainted with them, and\nI know they always had some sense, whatever else you\ncould ascribe to them. I know there never was one who had\nnot more sense than to try to show by the evidence he\nproduces that some men had, prior to the time I named,\nsaid that negroes were not included in the term \u201call men\u201d\nin the Declaration of Independence. What is the evidence\n he produces? I will bring forward his evidence, and let you\nsee what he o\ufb00ers by way of showing that somebody more\nthan three years ago had said negroes were not included in\nthe Declaration. He brings forward part of a speech from\nHenry Clay, \u2014 the part of the speech of Henry Clay which I\nused to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary. I\nguess we are surrounded to some extent to-day by the old\nfriends of Mr. Clay, and they will be glad to hear anything\nfrom that authority. While he was in Indiana a man\npresented a petition to liberate his negroes, and he (Mr.\nClay) made a speech in answer to it, which I suppose he\ncarefully wrote out himself and caused to be published. I\nhave before me an extract from that speech which\nconstitutes the evidence this pretended \u201cOld-Line Whig\u201d at\nChicago brought forward to show that Mr. Clay did n\u2019t\nsuppose the negro was included in the Declaration of\nIndependence. Hear what Mr. Clay said:\n\u201cAnd what is the foundation of this appeal to me in\nIndiana to liberate the slaves under my care in Kentucky? It\nis a general declaration in the act announcing to the world\nthe independence of the thirteen American colonies, that\nall men are created equal. Now, as an abstract principle,\nthere is no doubt of the truth of that declaration; and it is\ndesirable, in the original construction of society and in\norganized societies, to keep it in view as a great\nfundamental principle. But, then, I apprehend that in no\nsociety that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was or\ncan the equality asserted among the members of the\nhuman race be practically enforced and carried out. There\n are portions, large portions, women, minors, insane,\nculprits, transient sojourners, that will always probably\nremain subject to the government of another portion of the\ncommunity.\n\u201cThat declaration, whatever may be the extent of its\nimport, was made by the delegations of the thirteen States.\nIn most of them slavery existed, and had long existed, and\nwas established by law. It was introduced and forced upon\nthe colonies by the paramount law of England. Do you\nbelieve that in making that declaration the States that\nconcurred in it intended that it should be tortured into a\nvirtual emancipation of all the slaves within their respective\nlimits? Would Virginia and other Southern States have ever\nunited in a declaration which was to be interpreted into an\nabolition of slavery among them? Did any one of the\nthirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation? To\nimpute such a secret and unavowed purpose, would be to\ncharge a political fraud upon the noblest band of patriots\nthat ever assembled in council, \u2014 a fraud upon the\nConfederacy of the Revolution; a fraud upon the union of\nthose States whose Constitution not only recognized the\nlawfulness of slavery, but permitted the importation of\nslaves from Africa until the year .\u201d\nThis is the entire quotation brought forward to prove that\nsomebody previous to three years ago had said the negro\nwas not included in the term \u201call men\u201d in the Declaration.\nHow does it do so? In what way has it a tendency to prove\nthat? Mr. Clay says it is true as an abstract principle that all\nmen are created equal, but that we cannot practically apply\n it in all eases. He illustrates this by bringing forward the\ncases of females, minors, and insane persons, with whom it\ncannot be enforced; but he says it is true as an abstract\nprinciple in the organization of society as well as in\norganized society and it should be kept in view as a\nfundamental principle. Let me read a few words more\nbefore I add some comments of my own. Mr. Clay says, a\nlittle further on:\n\u201cI desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the\ninstitution of slavery. I look upon it as a great evil, and\ndeeply lament that we have derived it from the parental\ngovernment and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in\nthe United States was in the country of his ancestors. But\nhere they are, and the question is, How can they be best\ndealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about\nto lay the foundations of society, no man would be more\nstrongly opposed than I should be to incorporate the\ninstitution of slavery amongst its elements.\u201d\nNow, here in this same book, in this same speech, in this\nsame extract, brought forward to prove that Mr. Clay held\nthat the negro was not included in the Declaration of\nIndependence, is no such statement on his part, but the\ndeclaration that it is a great fundamental truth which\nshould be constantly kept in view in the organization of\nsociety and in societies already organized. But if I say a\nword about it; if I attempt, as Mr. Clay said all good men\nought to do, to keep it in view; if, in this \u201corganized\nsociety,\u201d I ask to have the public eye turned upon it; if I ask,\nin relation to the organization of new Territories, that the\n public eye should be turned upon it, forthwith I am vili\ufb01ed\nas you hear me to-day. What have I done that I have not the\nlicense of Henry Clay\u2019s illustrious example here in doing?\nHave I done aught that I have not his authority for, while\nmaintaining that in organizing new Territories and societies\nthis fundamental principle should be regarded, and in\norganized society holding it up to the public view and\nrecognizing what he recognized as the great principle of\nfree government?\nAnd when this new principle \u2014 this new proposition that\nno human being ever thought of three years ago \u2014 is\nbrought forward, I combat it as having an evil tendency, if\nnot an evil design. I combat it as having a tendency to\ndehumanize the negro, to take away from him the right of\never striving to be a man. I combat it as being one of the\nthousand things constantly done in these days to prepare\nthe public mind to make property, and nothing but property,\nof the negro in all the States of this Union.\nBut there is a point that I wish, before leaving this part of\nthe discussion, to ask attention to. I have read and I repeat\nthe words of Henry Clay:\n\u201cI desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the\ninstitution of slavery. I look upon it as a great evil, and\ndeeply lament that we have derived it from the parental\ngovernment and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in\nthe United States was in the country of his ancestors. But\nhere they are, and the question is, How can they be best\ndealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about\nto lay the foundations of society, no man would be more\n strongly opposed than I should be to incorporate the\ninstitution of slavery amongst its elements.\u201d\nThe principle upon which I have insisted in this canvass\nis in relation to laying the foundations of new societies. I\nhave never sought to apply these principles to the old\nStates for the purpose of abolishing slavery in those States.\nIt is nothing but a miserable perversion of what I have said,\nto assume that I have declared Missouri, or any other slave\nState, shall emancipate her slaves; I have proposed no such\nthing. But when Mr. Clay says that in laying the foundations\nof society in our Territories where it does not exist, he\nwould be opposed to the introduction of slavery as an\nelement, I insist that we have his warrant \u2014 his license \u2014\nfor insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he\ndeclared in such strong and emphatic language was most\nhurtful to him.\nJudge Douglas has again referred to a Spring\ufb01eld speech\nin which I said \u201ca house divided against itself cannot\nstand.\u201d The Judge has so often made the entire quotation\nfrom that speech that I can make it from memory. I used\nthis language:\n\u201cWe are now far into the \ufb01fth year since a policy was\ninitiated with the avowed object and con\ufb01dent promise of\nputting an end to the slavery agitation. Under the operation\nof this policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has\nconstantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until\na crisis shall have been reached and passed. \u2018A house\ndivided \nagainst \nitself \ncannot \nstand.\u2019 \nI \nbelieve \nthis\ngovernment cannot endure permanently, half slave and half\n free. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect it will\ncease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the\nother. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the\nfurther spread of it, and place it where the public mind\nshall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate\nextinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall\nbecome alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new,\nNorth as well as South.\u201d\nThat extract and the sentiments expressed in it have\nbeen extremely o\ufb00ensive to Judge Douglas. He has warred\nupon them as Satan wars upon the Bible. His perversions\nupon it are endless. Here now are my views upon it in brief:\nI said we were now far into the \ufb01fth year since a policy\nwas initiated with the avowed object and con\ufb01dent promise\nof putting an end to the slavery agitation. Is it not so? When\nthat Nebraska Bill was brought forward four years ago last\nJanuary, was it not for the \u201cavowed object\u201d of putting an\nend to the slavery agitation? We were to have no more\nagitation in Congress; it was all to be banished to the\nTerritories. By the way, I will remark here that, as Judge\nDouglas is very fond of complimenting Mr. Crittenden in\nthese days, Mr. Crittenden has said there was a falsehood\nin that whole business, for there was no slavery agitation at\nthat time to allay. We were for a little while quiet on the\ntroublesome thing, and that very allaying plaster of Judge\nDouglas\u2019s stirred it up again. But was it not understood or\nintimated with the \u201ccon\ufb01dent promise\u201d of putting an end to\nthe slavery agitation? Surely it was. In every speech you\nheard Judge Douglas make, until he got into this\n \u201cimbroglio,\u201d as they call it, with the Administration about\nthe \nLecompton \nConstitution, \nevery \nspeech \non \nthat\nNebraska Bill was full of his felicitations that we were just\nat the end of the slavery agitation. The last tip of the last\njoint of the old serpent\u2019s tail was just drawing out of view.\nBut has it proved so? I have asserted that under that policy\nthat agitation \u201chas not only not ceased, but has constantly\naugmented.\u201d When was there ever a greater agitation in\nCongress than last winter? When was it as great in the\ncountry as to-day?\nThere was a collateral object in the introduction of that\nNebraska policy, which was to clothe the people of the\nTerritories with a superior degree of self-government,\nbeyond what they had ever had before. The \ufb01rst object and\nthe main one of conferring upon the people a higher degree\nof \u201cself-government\u201d is a question of fact to be determined\nby you in answer to a single question. Have you ever heard\nor known of a people anywhere on earth who had as little\nto do as, in the \ufb01rst instance of its use, the people of\nKansas had with this same right of \u201cself-government \u201c? In\nits main policy and in its collateral object, it has been\nnothing but a living, creeping lie from the time of its\nintroduction till to-day.\nI have intimated that I thought the agitation would not\ncease until a crisis should have been reached and passed. I\nhave stated in what way I thought it would be reached and\npassed. I have said that it might go one way or the other.\nWe might, by arresting the further spread of it, and placing\nit where the fathers originally placed it, put it where the\n public mind should rest in the belief that it was in the\ncourse of ultimate extinction. Thus the agitation may cease.\nIt may be pushed forward until it shall become alike lawful\nin all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South.\nI have said, and I repeat, my wish is that the further spread\nof it may be arrested, and that it may be where the public\nmind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of\nultimate extinction \u2014 I have expressed that as my wish I\nentertain the opinion, upon evidence su\ufb00icient to my mind,\nthat the fathers of this government placed that institution\nwhere the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in\nthe course of ultimate extinction. Let me ask why they\nmade provision that the source of slavery \u2014 the African\nslave-trade \u2014 should be cut o\ufb00 at the end of twenty years?\nWhy did they make provision that in all the new territory\nwe owned at that time slavery should be forever inhibited?\nWhy stop its spread in one direction, and cut o\ufb00 its source\nin another, if they did not look to its being placed in the\ncourse of its ultimate extinction?\nAgain: the institution of slavery is only mentioned in the\nConstitution of the United States two or three times, and in\nneither of these cases does the word \u201cslavery\u201d or \u201cnegro\nrace\u201d occur; but covert language is used each time, and for\na purpose full of signi\ufb01cance. What is the language in\nregard to the prohibition of the African slave-trade? It runs\nin about this way:\n\u201cThe migration or importation of such persons as any of\nthe States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall\n not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one\nthousand eight hundred and eight.\u201d\nThe next allusion in the Constitution to the question of\nslavery and the black race is on the subject of the basis of\nrepresentation, and there the language used is:\n\u201cRepresentatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned\namong the several States which may be included within\nthis Union, according to their respective numbers, which\nshall be determined by adding to the whole number of free\npersons, including those bound to service for a term of\nyears, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-\ufb01fths of all\nother persons.\u201d\nIt says \u201cpersons,\u201d not slaves, not negroes; but this\n\u201cthree-\ufb01fths\u201d can be applied to no other class among us\nthan the negroes.\nLastly, in the provision for the reclamation of fugitive\nslaves, it is said:\n\u201cNo person held to service or labor in one State, under\nthe \nlaws \nthereof, \nescaping \ninto \nanother, \nshall \nin\nconsequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged\nfrom such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on\nclaim of the party to whom such service or labor may be\ndue.\u201d\nThere again there is no mention of the word \u201cnegro\u201d or\nof slavery. In all three of these places, being the only\nallusions to slavery in the instrument, covert language is\nused. Language is used not suggesting that slavery existed\nor that the black race were among us. And I understand the\ncontemporaneous history of those times to be that covert\n language was used with a purpose, and that purpose was\nthat in our Constitution, which it was hoped and is still\nhoped will endure forever, \u2014 when it should be read by\nintelligent and patriotic men, after the institution of slavery\nhad passed from among us, \u2014 there should be nothing on\nthe face of the great charter of liberty suggesting that such\na thing as negro slavery had ever existed among us. This is\npart of the evidence that the fathers of the government\nexpected and intended the institution of slavery to come to\nan end. They expected and intended that it should be in the\ncourse of ultimate extinction. And when I say that I desire\nto see the further spread of it arrested, I only say I desire\nto see that done which the fathers have \ufb01rst done. When I\nsay I desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest\nin the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, I\nonly say I desire to see it placed where they placed it. It is\nnot true that our fathers, as Judge Douglas assumes, made\nthis government part slave and part free. Understand the\nsense in which he puts it. He assumes that slavery is a\nrightful thing within itself, \u2014 was introduced by the\nframers of the Constitution. The exact truth is, that they\nfound the institution existing among us, and they left it as\nthey found it. But in making the government they left this\ninstitution with many clear marks of disapprobation upon\nit. They found slavery among them, and they left it among\nthem because of the di\ufb00iculty \u2014 the absolute impossibility\n\u2014 of its immediate removal. And when Judge Douglas asks\nme why we cannot let it remain part slave and part free, as\nthe fathers of the government made it, he asks a question\n based upon an assumption which is itself a falsehood; and I\nturn upon him and ask him the question, when the policy\nthat the fathers of the government had adopted in relation\nto this element among us was the best policy in the world,\nthe only wise policy, the only policy that we can ever safely\ncontinue upon that will ever give us peace, unless this\ndangerous element masters us all and becomes a national\ninstitution, \u2014 I turn upon him and ask him why he could\nnot leave it alone. I turn and ask him why he was driven to\nthe necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to it. He\nhas himself said he introduced a new policy. He said so in\nhis speech on the d of March of the present year, . I\nask him why he could not let it remain where our fathers\nplaced it. I ask, too, of Judge Douglas and his friends why\nwe shall not again place this institution upon the basis on\nwhich the fathers left it. I ask you, when he infers that I am\nin favor of setting the free and slave States at war, when\nthe institution was placed in that attitude by those who\nmade the Constitution, did they make any war? If we had\nno war out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of\nbelief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that\npolicy? Have we had any peace upon this matter springing\nfrom any other basis? I maintain that we have not. I have\nproposed nothing more than a return to the policy of the\nfathers.\nI confess, when I propose a certain measure of policy, it\nis not enough for me that I do not intend anything evil in\nthe result, but it is incumbent on me to show that it has not\na tendency to that result. I have met Judge Douglas in that\n point of view. I have not only made the declaration that I do\nnot mean to produce a con\ufb02ict between the States, but I\nhave tried to show by fair reasoning, and I think I have\nshown to the minds of fair men, that I propose nothing but\nwhat has a most peaceful tendency. The quotation that I\nhappened to make in that Spring\ufb01eld Speech, that \u201ca house\ndivided against itself cannot stand,\u201d and which has proved\nso o\ufb00ensive to the judge, was part and parcel of the same\nthing. He tries to show that variety in the democratic\ninstitutions of the di\ufb00erent States is necessary and\nindispensable. I do not dispute it. I have no controversy\nwith Judge Douglas about that. I shall very readily agree\nwith him that it would be foolish for us to insist upon\nhaving a cranberry law here in Illinois, where we have no\ncranberries, because they have a cranberry law in Indiana,\nwhere they have cranberries. I should insist that it would\nbe exceedingly wrong in us to deny to Virginia the right to\nenact oyster laws, where they have oysters, because we\nwant no such laws here. I understand, I hope, quite as well\nas Judge Douglas or anybody else, that the variety in the\nsoil and climate and face of the country, and consequent\nvariety in the industrial pursuits and productions of a\ncountry, require systems of law conforming to this variety\nin the natural features of the country. I understand quite as\nwell as Judge Douglas that if we here raise a barrel of \ufb02our\nmore than we want, and the Louisianians raise a barrel of\nsugar more than they want, it is of mutual advantage to\nexchange. That produces commerce, brings us together,\nand makes us better friends. We like one another the more\n for it. And I understand as well as Judge Douglas, or\nanybody else, that these mutual accommodations are the\ncements which bind together the di\ufb00erent parts of this\nUnion; that instead of being a thing to \u201cdivide the house,\u201d\n\u2014 \ufb01guratively expressing the Union, \u2014 they tend to sustain\nit; they are the props of the house, tending always to hold it\nup.\nBut when I have admitted all this, I ask if there is any\nparallel between these things and this institution of\nslavery? I do not see that there is any parallel at all\nbetween them. Consider it. When have we had any\ndi\ufb00iculty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry\nlaws of Indiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia, or the pine-\nlumber laws of Maine, or the fact that Louisiana produces\nsugar, and Illinois \ufb02our? When have we had any quarrels\nover these things? When have we had perfect peace in\nregard to this thing which I say is an element of discord in\nthis Union? We have sometimes had peace, but when was\nit? It was when the institution of slavery remained quiet\nwhere it was. We have had di\ufb00iculty and turmoil whenever\nit has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not. I\nask, then, if experience does not speak in thunder-tones\ntelling us that the policy which has given peace to the\ncountry heretofore, being returned to, gives the greatest\npromise of peace again. You may say, and Judge Douglas\nhas intimated the same thing, that all this di\ufb00iculty in\nregard to the institution of slavery is the mere agitation of\no\ufb00ice-seekers and ambitious Northern politicians. He\nthinks we want to get \u201chis place,\u201d I suppose. I agree that\n there are o\ufb00ice-seekers amongst us. The Bible says\nsomewhere that we are desperately sel\ufb01sh. I think we\nwould have discovered that fact without the Bible. I do not\nclaim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I\ndo claim that I am not more sel\ufb01sh than Judge Douglas.\nBut is it true that all the di\ufb00iculty and agitation we have\nin regard to this institution of slavery spring from o\ufb00ice-\nseeking, from the mere ambition of politicians? Is that the\ntruth? How many times have we had danger from this\nquestion? Go back to the day of the Missouri Compromise.\nGo back to the nulli\ufb01cation question, at the bottom of\nwhich lay this same slavery question. Go back to the time of\nthe annexation of Texas. Go back to the troubles that led to\nthe Compromise of . You will \ufb01nd that every time, with\nthe single exception of the Nulli\ufb01cation question, they\nsprung from an endeavor to spread this institution. There\nnever was a party in the history of this country, and there\nprobably never will be, of su\ufb00icient strength to disturb the\ngeneral peace of the country. Parties themselves may be\ndivided and quarrel on minor questions, yet it extends not\nbeyond the parties themselves. But does not this question\nmake a disturbance outside of political circles? Does it not\nenter into the churches and rend them asunder? What\ndivided the great Methodist Church into two parts, North\nand South? What has raised this constant disturbance in\nevery Presbyterian General Assembly that meets? What\ndisturbed the Unitarian Church in this very city two years\nago? What has jarred and shaken the great American Tract\nSociety recently, not yet splitting it, but sure to divide it in\n the end? Is it not this same mighty, deep-seated power that\nsomehow operates on the minds of men, exciting and\nstirring them up in every avenue of society, \u2014 in politics, in\nreligion, in literature, in morals, in all the manifold\nrelations of life? Is this the work of politicians? Is that\nirresistible power, which for \ufb01fty years has shaken the\ngovernment and agitated the people, to be sti\ufb02ed and\nsubdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple\nthing, and we ought not to talk about it? If you will get\neverybody else to stop talking about it, I assure you I will\nquit before they have half done so. But where is the\nphilosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can\nquiet that disturbing element in our society which has\ndisturbed us for more than half a century, which has been\nthe \nonly \nserious \ndanger \nthat \nhas \nthreatened \nour\ninstitutions, \u2014 I say, where is the philosophy or the\nstatesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit\ntalking about it, and that the public mind is all at once to\ncease being agitated by it? Yet this is the policy here in the\nNorth that Douglas is advocating, that we are to care\nnothing about it! I ask you if it is not a false philosophy. Is it\nnot a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a\nsystem of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the\nvery thing that everybody does care the most about \u2014 a\nthing which all experience has shown we care a very great\ndeal about?\nThe Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks\nto the exclusive right which the States have to decide the\nwhole thing for themselves. I agree with him very readily\n that the di\ufb00erent States have that right. He is but \ufb01ghting a\nman of straw when he assumes that I am contending\nagainst the right of the States to do as they please about it.\nOur controversy with him is in regard to the new\nTerritories. We agree that when the States come in as\nStates they have the right and the power to do as they\nplease. We have no power as citizens of the free-States, or\nin our Federal capacity as members of the Federal Union\nthrough the General Government, to disturb slavery in the\nStates where it exists. We profess constantly that we have\nno more inclination than belief in the power of the\ngovernment to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to\ndefend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring\nupon the rights of the Sates. What I insist upon is, that the\nnew Territories shall be kept free from it while in the\nTerritorial condition. Judge Douglas assumes that we have\nno interest in them, \u2014 that we have no right whatever to\ninterfere. I think we have some interest. I think that as\nwhite men we have. Do we not wish for an outlet for our\nsurplus population, if I may so express myself? Do we not\nfeel an interest in getting to that outlet with such\ninstitutions as we would like to have prevail there? If you\ngo to the Territory opposed to slavery, and another man\ncomes upon the same ground with his slave, upon the\nassumption that the things are equal, it turns out that he\nhas the equal right all his way, and you have no part of it\nyour way. If he goes in and makes it a slave Territory, and\nby consequence a slave State, is it not time that those who\ndesire to have it a free State were on equal ground? Let me\n suggest it in a di\ufb00erent way. How many Democrats are\nthere about here [\u201cA thousand\u201d] who have left slave States\nand come into the free State of Illinois to get rid of the\ninstitution of slavery? [Another voice: \u201cA thousand and\none.\u201d] I reckon there are a thousand and one. I will ask you,\nif the policy you are now advocating had prevailed when\nthis country was in a Territorial condition, where would you\nhave gone to get rid of it? Where would you have found\nyour free State or Territory to go to? And when hereafter,\nfor any cause, the people in this place shall desire to \ufb01nd\nnew homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where\nwill they \ufb01nd the place to go to?\nNow, irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as\nto whether there is a right or wrong in enslaving a negro, I\nam still in favor of our new Territories being in such a\ncondition that white men may \ufb01nd a home, \u2014 may \ufb01nd\nsome spot where they can better their condition; where\nthey can settle upon new soil and better their condition in\nlife. I am in favor of this, not merely (I must say it here as I\nhave elsewhere) for our own people who are born amongst\nus, but as an outlet for free white people everywhere the\nworld over \u2014 in which Hans, and Baptiste, and Patrick, and\nall other men from all the world, may \ufb01nd new homes and\nbetter their conditions in life.\nI have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well\nstate again, what I understand to be the real issue in this\ncontroversy between Judge Douglas and myself. On the\npoint of my wanting to make war between the free and the\nslave States, there has been no issue between us. So, too,\n when he assumes that I am in favor of producing a perfect\nsocial and political equality between the white and black\nraces. These are false issues, upon which Judge Douglas\nhas tried to force the controversy. There is no foundation in\ntruth for the charge that I maintain either of these\npropositions. The real issue in this controversy \u2014 the one\npressing upon every mind \u2014 is the sentiment on the part of\none class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a\nwrong, and of another class that does not look upon it as a\nwrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of\nslavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the\nRepublican party. It is the sentiment around which all their\nactions, all their arguments, circle, from which all their\npropositions radiate. They look upon it as being a moral,\nsocial, and political wrong; and while they contemplate it as\nsuch, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual\nexistence among us, and the di\ufb00iculties of getting rid of it\nin any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional\nobligations thrown about it. Yet, having a due regard for\nthese, they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its\nnot creating any more danger. They insist that it should, as\nfar as may be, be treated as a wrong; and one of the\nmethods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that\nit shall grow no larger. They also desire a policy that looks\nto a peaceful end of slavery at some time. These are the\nviews they entertain in regard to it as I understand them;\nand \nall \ntheir \nsentiments, \nall \ntheir \narguments \nand\npropositions, are brought within this range. I have said,\nand I repeat it here, that if there be a man amongst us who\n does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any\none of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is misplaced,\nand ought not to be with us. And if there be a man amongst\nus who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its\nactual presence among us and the di\ufb00iculty of getting rid of\nit suddenly in a satisfactory way, and to disregard the\nconstitutional obligations thrown about it, that man is\nmisplaced if he is on our platform. We disclaim sympathy\nwith him in practical action. He is not placed properly with\nus.\nOn this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its\nspread, let me say a word. Has anything ever threatened\nthe existence of this Union save and except this very\ninstitution of slavery? What is it that we hold most dear\namongst us? Our own liberty and prosperity. What has ever\nthreatened our liberty and prosperity, save and except this\ninstitution of slavery? If this is true, how do you propose to\nimprove the condition of things by enlarging slavery, by\nspreading it out and making it bigger? You may have a wen\nor cancer upon your person, and not be able to cut it out,\nlest you bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure it, to\nengraft it and spread it over your whole body. That is no\nproper way of treating what you regard a wrong. You see\nthis peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong, restricting\nthe spread of it, and not allowing it to go into new countries\nwhere it has not already existed. That is the peaceful way,\nthe old-fashioned way, the way in which the fathers\nthemselves set us the example.\n On the other hand, I have said there is a sentiment which\ntreats it as not being wrong. That is the Democratic\nsentiment of this day. I do not mean to say that every man\nwho stands within that range positively asserts that it is\nright. That class will include all who positively assert that it\nis right, and all who, like Judge Douglas, treat it as\nindi\ufb00erent and do not say it is either right or wrong. These\ntwo classes of men fall within the general class of those\nwho do not look upon it as a wrong. And if there be among\nyou anybody who supposes that he, as a Democrat, can\nconsider himself \u201cas much opposed to slavery as anybody,\u201d\nI would like to reason with him. You never treat it as a\nwrong. What other thing that you consider as a wrong do\nyou deal with as you deal with that? Perhaps you say it is\nwrong \u2014 but your leader never does, and you quarrel with\nanybody who says it is wrong. Although you pretend to say\nso yourself, you can \ufb01nd no \ufb01t place to deal with it as a\nwrong. You must not say anything about it in the free\nStates, because it is not here. You must not say anything\nabout it in the slave States, because it is there. You must\nnot say anything about it in the pulpit, because that is\nreligion, and has nothing to do with it. You must not say\nanything about it in politics, because that will disturb the\nsecurity of \u201cmy place.\u201d There is no place to talk about it as\nbeing a wrong, although you say yourself it is a wrong. But,\n\ufb01nally, you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the\npeople of the slave States should adopt a system of gradual\nemancipation on the slavery question, you would be in\nfavor of it. You would be in favor of it. You say that is\n getting it in the right place, and you would be glad to see it\nsucceed. But you are deceiving yourself. You all know that\nFrank Blair and Gratz Brown, down there in St. Louis,\nundertook to introduce that system in Missouri. They\nfought as valiantly as they could for the system of gradual\nemancipation which you pretend you would be glad to see\nsucceed. Now, I will bring you to the test. After a hard \ufb01ght\nthey were beaten, and when the news came over here, you\nthrew up your hats and hurrahed for Democracy. More than\nthat, take all the argument made in favor of the system you\nhave proposed, and it carefully excludes the idea that there\nis anything wrong in the institution of slavery. The\narguments to sustain that policy carefully exclude it. Even\nhere to-day you heard Judge Douglas quarrel with me\nbecause I uttered a wish that it might sometime come to an\nend. Although Henry Clay could say he wished every slave\nin the United States was in the country of his ancestors, I\nam denounced by those pretending to respect Henry Clay\nfor uttering a wish that it might sometime, in some\npeaceful way, come to an end. The Democratic policy in\nregard to that institution will not tolerate the merest\nbreath, the slightest hint, of the least degree of wrong\nabout it. Try it by some of Judge Douglas\u2019s arguments. He\nsays he \u201cdon\u2019t care whether it is voted up or voted down\u201d in\nthe Territories. I do not care myself, in dealing with that\nexpression, whether it is intended to be expressive of his\nindividual sentiments on the subject, or only of the national\npolicy he desires to have established. It is alike valuable for\nmy purpose. Any man can say that who does not see\n anything wrong in slavery; but no man can logically say it\nwho does see a wrong in it, because no man can logically\nsay he don\u2019t care whether a wrong is voted up or voted\ndown. He may say he don\u2019t care whether an indi\ufb00erent\nthing is voted up or down, but he must logically have a\nchoice between a right thing and a wrong thing. He\ncontends that whatever community wants slaves has a right\nto have them. So they have, if it is not a wrong. But if it is a\nwrong, he cannot say people have a right to do wrong. He\nsays that upon the score of equality slaves should be\nallowed to go in a new Territory, like other property. This is\nstrictly logical if there is no di\ufb00erence between it and other\nproperty. If it and other property are equal, this argument\nis entirely logical. But if you insist that one is wrong and\nthe other right, there is no use to institute a comparison\nbetween right and wrong. You may turn over everything in\nthe Democratic policy from beginning to end, whether in\nthe shape it takes on the statute book, in the shape it takes\nin the Dred Scott decision, in the shape it takes in\nconversation, or the shape it takes in short maxim-like\narguments, \u2014 it everywhere carefully excludes the idea\nthat there is anything wrong in it.\nThat is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue\nin this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas\nand myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between\nthese two principles \u2014 right and wrong \u2014 throughout the\nworld. They are the two principles that have stood face to\nface from the beginning of time, and will ever continue to\nstruggle. The one is the common right of humanity, and the\n other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in\nwhatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that\nsays, \u201cYou work and toil and earn bread, and I\u2019ll eat it.\u201d No\nmatter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of\na king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation\nand live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men\nas an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same\ntyrannical principle. I was glad to express my gratitude at\nQuincy, and I re-express it here, to Judge Douglas, \u2014 that\nhe looks to no end of the institution of slavery. That will\nhelp the people to see where the struggle really is. It will\nhereafter place with us all men who really do wish the\nwrong may have an end. And whenever we can get rid of\nthe fog which obscures the real question, when we can get\nJudge Douglas and his friends to avow a policy looking to\nits perpetuation, \u2014 we can get out from among that class of\nmen and bring them to the side of those who treat it as a\nwrong. Then there will soon be an end of it, and that end\nwill be its \u201cultimate extinction.\u201d Whenever the issue can be\ndistinctly made, and all extraneous matter thrown out so\nthat men can fairly see the real di\ufb00erence between the\nparties, this controversy will soon be settled, and it will be\ndone peaceably too. There will be no war, no violence. It\nwill be placed again where the wisest and best men of the\nworld placed it. Brooks of South Carolina once declared\nthat when this Constitution was framed its framers did not\nlook to the institution existing until this day. When he said\nthis, I think he stated a fact that is fully borne out by the\nhistory of the times. But he also said they were better and\n wiser men than the men of these days, yet the men of these\ndays had experience which they had not, and by the\ninvention of the cotton-gin it became a necessity in this\ncountry that slavery should be perpetual. I now say that,\nwillingly or unwillingly \u2014 purposely or without purpose,\nJudge Douglas has been the most prominent instrument in\nchanging the position of the institution of slavery, \u2014 which\nthe fathers of the government expected to come to an end\nere this, and putting it upon Brooks\u2019s cotton-gin basis;\nplacing it where he openly confesses he has no desire there\nshall ever be an end of it.\nI understand I have ten minutes yet. I will employ it in\nsaying something about this argument Judge Douglas uses,\nwhile he sustains the Dred Scott decision, that the people\nof the Territories can still somehow exclude slavery. The\n\ufb01rst thing I ask attention to is the fact that Judge Douglas\nconstantly said, before the decision, that whether they\ncould or not, was a question for the Supreme Court. But\nafter the court had made the decision he virtually says it is\nnot a question for the Supreme Court, but for the people.\nAnd how is it he tells us they can exclude it? He says it\nneeds \u201cpolice regulations,\u201d and that admits of \u201cunfriendly\nlegislation.\u201d Although it is a right established by the\nConstitution of the United States to take a slave into a\nTerritory of the United States and hold him as property, yet\nunless \nthe \nTerritorial \nLegislature \nwill \ngive \nfriendly\nlegislation, and more especially if they adopt unfriendly\nlegislation, they can practically exclude him. Now, without\nmeeting this proposition as a matter of fact, I pass to\n consider the real constitutional obligation. Let me take the\ngentleman who looks me in the face before me, and let us\nsuppose that he is a member of the Territorial Legislature.\nThe \ufb01rst thing he will do will be to swear that he will\nsupport the Constitution of the United States. His neighbor\nby his side in the Territory has slaves and needs Territorial\nlegislation to enable him to enjoy that constitutional right.\nCan he withhold the legislation which his neighbor needs\nfor the enjoyment of a right which is \ufb01xed in his favor in the\nConstitution of the United States which he has sworn to\nsupport? Can he withhold it without violating his oath?\nAnd, more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to\nviolate his oath? Why, this is a monstrous sort of talk about\nthe Constitution of the United States! There has never been\nas outlandish or lawless a doctrine from the mouth of any\nrespectable man on earth. I do not believe it is a\nconstitutional right to hold slaves in a Territory of the\nUnited States. I believe the decision was improperly made\nand I go for reversing it. Judge Douglas is furious against\nthose who go for reversing a decision. But he is for\nlegislating it out of all force while the law itself stands. I\nrepeat that there has never been so monstrous a doctrine\nuttered from the mouth of a respectable man.\nI suppose most of us (I know it of myself) believe that the\npeople \nof \nthe \nSouthern \nStates \nare \nentitled \nto \na\nCongressional Fugitive Slave law, \u2014 that is a right \ufb01xed in\nthe Constitution. But it cannot be made available to them\nwithout Congressional legislation. In the Judge\u2019s language,\nit is a \u201cbarren right,\u201d which needs legislation before it can\n become e\ufb00icient and valuable to the persons to whom it is\nguaranteed. And as the right is constitutional, I agree that\nthe legislation shall be granted to it, and that not that we\nlike the institution of slavery. We profess to have no taste\nfor running and catching niggers, at least, I profess no\ntaste for that job at all. Why then do I yield support to a\nFugitive Slave law? Because I do not understand that the\nConstitution, which guarantees that right, can be supported\nwithout it. And if I believed that the right to hold a slave in\na Territory was equally \ufb01xed in the Constitution with the\nright to reclaim fugitives, I should be bound to give it the\nlegislation necessary to support it. I say that no man can\ndeny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to\nsupport slavery in a Territory, who believes it is a\nconstitutional right to have it there. No man can, who does\nnot give the Abolitionists an argument to deny the\nobligation enjoined by the Constitution to enact a Fugitive\nState law. Try it now. It is the strongest Abolition argument\never made. I say if that Dred Scott decision is correct, then\nthe right to hold slaves in a Territory is equally a\nconstitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have\nhis runaway returned. No one can show the distinction\nbetween them. The one is express, so that we cannot deny\nit. The other is construed to be in the Constitution, so that\nhe who believes the decision to be correct believes in the\nright. And the man who argues that by unfriendly\nlegislation, in spite of that constitutional right, slavery may\nbe driven from the Territories, cannot avoid furnishing an\nargument by which Abolitionists may deny the obligation to\n return fugitives, and claim the power to pass laws\nunfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his\nfugitive. I do not know how such an arguement may strike a\npopular assembly like this, but I defy anybody to go before\na body of men whose minds are educated to estimating\nevidence and reasoning, and show that there is an iota of\ndi\ufb00erence between the constitutional right to reclaim a\nfugitive and the constitutional right to hold a slave, in a\nTerritory, provided this Dred Scott decision is correct, I\ndefy any man to make an argument that will justify\nunfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right\nto hold his slave in a Territory, that will not equally, in all its\nlength, breadth, and thickness, furnish an argument for\nnullifying the Fugitive Slave law. Why, there is not such an\nAbolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all!\n     \n          \n  A\nI   \n \n   \n  \n  \nH\n \n.  \nH\n  \n.\nJanuary , \nDEAR JOHNSTON: \u2014 Your request for eighty dollars I\ndo not think it best to comply with now. At the various\ntimes when I have helped you a little you have said to me,\n\u201cWe can get along very well now\u201d; but in a very short time I\n\ufb01nd you in the same di\ufb00iculty again. Now, this can only\nhappen by some defect in your conduct. What that defect\nis, I think I know. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler.\nI doubt whether, since I saw you, you have done a good\nwhole day\u2019s work in any one day. You do not very much\ndislike to work, and still you do not work much merely\nbecause it does not seem to you that you could get much\nfor it. This habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole\ndi\ufb00iculty; it is vastly important to you, and still more so to\nyour children, that you should break the habit. It is more\nimportant to them, because they have longer to live, and\ncan keep out of an idle habit before they are in it, easier\nthan they can get out after they are in.\nYou are now in need of some money; and what I propose\nis, that you shall go to work, \u201ctooth and nail,\u201d for somebody\nwho will give you money for it. Let father and your boys\ntake charge of your things at home, prepare for a crop, and\nmake the crop, and you go to work for the best money\n wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can\nget; and, to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now\npromise you, that for every dollar you will, between this\nand the \ufb01rst of May, get for your own labor, either in money\nor as your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other\ndollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month,\nfrom me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a\nmonth for your work. In this I do not mean you shall go o\ufb00\nto St. Louis, or the lead mines, or the gold mines in\nCalifornia, but I mean for you to go at it for the best wages\nyou can get close to home in Coles County. Now, if you will\ndo this, you will be soon out of debt, and, what is better,\nyou will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt\nagain. But, if I should now clear you out of debt, next year\nyou would be just as deep in as ever. You say you would\nalmost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty\ndollars. Then you value your place in heaven very cheap,\nfor I am sure you can, with the o\ufb00er I make, get the seventy\nor eighty dollars for four or \ufb01ve months\u2019 work. You say if I\nwill furnish you the money you will deed me the land, and,\nif you don\u2019t pay the money back, you will deliver\npossession. Nonsense! If you can\u2019t now live with the land,\nhow will you then live without it? You have always been\nkind to me, and I do not mean to be unkind to you. On the\ncontrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will \ufb01nd it\nworth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you.\nA\ufb00ectionately your brother, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  . H\n  .\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. , .\nC. HOYT, ESQ.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Our case is decided against us. The\ndecision was announced this morning. Very sorry, but there\nis no help. The history of the case since it came here is this.\nOn Friday morning last, Mr. Joy \ufb01led his papers, and\nentered his motion for a mandamus, and urged me to take\nup the motion as soon as possible. I already had the points\nand authority sent me by you and by Mr. Goodrich, but had\nnot studied them. I began preparing as fast as possible.\nThe evening of the same day I was again urged to take\nup the case. I refused on the ground that I was not ready,\nand on which plea I also got o\ufb00 over Saturday. But on\nMonday (the th) I had to go into it. We occupied the\nwhole day, I using the large part. I made every point and\nused every authority sent me by yourself and by Mr.\nGoodrich; and in addition all the points I could think of and\nall the authorities I could \ufb01nd myself. When I closed the\nargument on my part, a large package was handed me,\nwhich proved to be the plat you sent me.\nThe court received it of me, but it was not di\ufb00erent from\nthe plat already on the record. I do not think I could ever\nhave argued the case better than I did. I did nothing else,\n but prepare to argue and argue this case, from Friday\nmorning till Monday evening. Very sorry for the result; but I\ndo not think it could have been prevented.\nYour friend, as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \nH\n \n.  \nH\n  \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, January , \nDEAR BROTHER: \u2014 On the day before yesterday I\nreceived a letter from Harriet, written at Greenup. She says\nshe has just returned from your house, and that father is\nvery low and will hardly recover. She also says you have\nwritten me two letters, and that, although you do not\nexpect me to come now, you wonder that I do not write.\nI received both your letters, and although I have not\nanswered them it is not because I have forgotten them, or\nbeen uninterested about them, but because it appeared to\nme that I could write nothing which would do any good. You\nalready know I desire that neither father nor mother shall\nbe in want of any comfort, either in health or sickness,\nwhile they live; and I feel sure you have not failed to use my\nname, if necessary, to procure a doctor, or anything else for\nfather in his present sickness. My business is such that I\ncould hardly leave home now, if it was not as it is, that my\nown wife is sick abed. (It is a case of baby-sickness, and I\nsuppose is not dangerous.) I sincerely hope father may\nrecover his health, but at all events, tell him to remember\nto call upon and con\ufb01de in our great and good and merciful\nMaker, who will not turn away from him in any extremity.\nHe notes the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our\n heads, and He will not forget the dying man who puts his\ntrust in Him. Say to him that if we could meet now it is\ndoubtful whether it would not be more painful than\npleasant, but that if it be his lot to go now, he will soon\nhave a joyous meeting with many loved ones gone before,\nand where the rest of us, through the help of God, hope ere\nlong to join them.\nWrite to me again when you receive this.\nA\ufb00ectionately, A. LINCOLN.\n    I I\n \n   HA   \n  \n   \n H A \nI  \nTO THE JUDGE OF THE SANGAMON COUNTY COURT,\nMAY , . TO THE HONORABLE, THE JUDGE OF\nTHE COUNTY COURT IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF\nSANGAMON AND STATE OF ILLINOIS:\nYour Petitioner, Joshua Gipson, respectfully represents\nthat on or about the st day of December, , a\njudgment was rendered against your Petitioner for costs, by\nJ. C. Spugg, one of the Justices of the Peace in and for said\nCounty of Sangamon, in a suit wherein your Petitioner was\nplainti\ufb00 and James L. and C. B. Gerard were defendants;\nthat said judgment was not the result of negligence on the\npart of your Petitioner; that said judgment, in his opinion, is\nunjust and erroneous in this, that the defendants were at\nthat time and are indebted to this Petitioner in the full\namount of the principal and interest of the note sued on,\nthe principal being, as a\ufb00iant remembers and believes,\nthirty-one dollars and eighty two cents; and that, as a\ufb00iant\nis informed and believes, the defendants succeeded in the\ntrial of said cause by proving old claims against your\npetitioner, in set-o\ufb00 against said note, which claims had\nbeen settled, adjusted and paid before said note was\nexecuted. Your Petitioner further states that the reasons of\nhis not being present at said trial, as he was not, and of its\n not being in his power to take an appeal in the ordinary\nway, as it was not, were that your Petitioner then resided in\nEdgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from\nwhere defendants resided; that a very short time before the\nsuit was commenced your Petitioner was in Sangamon\nCounty for the purpose of collecting debts due him, and\nwith the rest, the note in question, which note had then\nbeen given more than a year, that your Petitioner then saw\nthe defendant J. L. Gerard who is the principal in said note,\nand solicited payment of the same; that said defendant then\nmade no pretense that he did not owe the same, but on the\ncontrary expressly promised that he would come into\nSpring\ufb01eld, in a very few days and either pay the money, or\ngive a new note, payable by the then next Christmas; that\nyour Petitioner accordingly left said note with said J. C.\nSpugg, with directions to give defendant full time to pay\nthe money or give the new note as above, and if he did\nneither to sue; and then a\ufb00iant came home to Edgar\nCounty, not having the slightest suspicion that if suit should\nbe brought, the defendants would make any defense\nwhatever; and your Petitioner never did in any way learn\nthat said suit had been commenced until more than twenty\ndays after it had been decided against him. He therefore\nprays for a writ of Certiorari.\nHIS\nJOSHUA x GIPSON\nMARK\n  \n  . \n.  \nH\n  \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. , \nDEAR BROTHER: INCLOSED is the deed for the land. We\nare all well, and have nothing in the way of news. We have\nhad no Cholera here for about two weeks.\nGive my love to all, and especially to Mother.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  . \n.  \nH\n  \n.\nSHELBYVILLE, Nov. , \nDEAR BROTHER: When I came into Charleston day\nbefore yesterday I learned that you are anxious to sell the\nland where you live, and move to Missouri. I have been\nthinking of this ever since, and cannot but think such a\nnotion is utterly foolish. What can you do in Missouri better\nthan here? Is the land richer? Can you there, any more than\nhere, raise corn and wheat and oats without work? Will\nanybody there, any more than here, do your work for you?\nIf you intend to go to work, there is no better place than\nright where you are; if you do not intend to go to work you\ncannot get along anywhere. Squirming and crawling about\nfrom place to place can do no good. You have raised no\ncrop this year, and what you really want is to sell the land,\nget the money and spend it. Part with the land you have,\nand, my life upon it, you will never after own a spot big\nenough to bury you in. Half you will get for the land you\nspend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat\nand drink and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought.\nNow I feel it is my duty to have no hand in such a piece of\nfoolery. I feel that it is so even on your own account, and\nparticularly on Mother\u2019s account. The eastern forty acres I\nintend to keep for Mother while she lives; if you will not\n cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her; at least it\nwill rent for something. Her dower in the other two forties\nshe can let you have, and no thanks to me.\nNow do not misunderstand this letter. I do not write it in\nany unkindness. I write it in order, if possible, to get you to\nface the truth, which truth is, you are destitute because you\nhave idled away all your time. Your thousand pretenses for\nnot getting along better are all nonsense; they deceive\nnobody but yourself.

I still think as I did, but if the land can\nbe sold so that I get three hundred dollars to put to interest\nfor Mother, I will not object, if she does not. But before I\nwill make a deed, the money must be had, or secured\nbeyond all doubt, at ten per cent.\nAs to Abram, I do not want him, on my own account; but I\nunderstand he wants to live with me, so that he can go to\nschool and get a fair start in the world, which I very much\nwish him to have. When I reach home, if I can make it\nconvenient to take, I will take him, provided there is no\nmistake between us as to the object and terms of my taking\nhim. In haste, as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \nH\n \n.  \nH\n  \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, November , .\nDEAR BROTHER: \u2014 Your letter of the d is just\nreceived. Your proposal about selling the east forty acres of\nland is all that I want or could claim for myself; but I am\nnot satis\ufb01ed with it on Mother\u2019s account \u2014 I want her to\nhave her living, and I feel that it is my duty, to some extent,\nto see that she is not wronged. She had a right of dower\n(that is, the use of one-third for life) in the other two\nforties; but, it seems, she has already let you take that,\nhook and line. She now has the use of the whole of the east\nforty, as long as she lives; and if it be sold, of course she is\nentitled to the interest on all the money it brings, as long as\nshe lives; but you propose to sell it for three hundred\ndollars, take one hundred away with you, and leave her two\nhundred at  per cent., making her the enormous sum of \ndollars a year. Now, if you are satis\ufb01ed with treating her in\nthat way, I am not. It is true that you are to have that forty\nfor two hundred dollars, at Mother\u2019s death, but you are not\nto have it before. I am con\ufb01dent that land can be made to\nproduce for Mother at least   a year, and I can not, to\noblige any living person, consent that she shall be put on an\nallowance of sixteen dollars a year.\nYours, etc., A.

STANFORD.\nSIR: \u2014 I hope the subject-matter of this letter will appear\na su\ufb00icient apology to you for the liberty I, a total stranger,\ntake in addressing you. The persons here holding two lots\nunder a conveyance made by you, as the attorney of Daniel\nM. Baily, now nearly twenty-two years ago, are in great\ndanger of losing the lots, and very much, perhaps all, is to\ndepend on the testimony you give as to whether you did or\ndid not account to Baily for the proceeds received by you\non this sale of the lots. I, therefore, as one of the counsel,\nbeg of you to fully refresh your recollection by any means\nin your power before the time you may be called on to\ntestify. If persons should come about you, and show a\ndisposition to pump you on the subject, it may be no more\nthan prudent to remember that it may be possible they\ndesign to misrepresent you and embarrass the real\ntestimony you may ultimately give. It may be six months or\na year before you are called on to testify.\nRespectfully, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n   \n     \n   \n I I A   \n  \n \nTO Dr. ROBERT BOAL. SPRINGFIELD, January , .\nDR. ROBERT BOAL, Lacon, Ill.\nDEAR DOCTOR: \u2014 Since I saw you last fall, I have often\nthought of writing to you, as it was then understood I\nwould, but, on re\ufb02ection, I have always found that I had\nnothing new to tell you. All has happened as I then told you\nI expected it would \u2014 Baker\u2019s declining, Hardin\u2019s taking\nthe track, and so on.\nIf Hardin and I stood precisely equal, if neither of us had\nbeen to Congress, or if we both had, it would only accord\nwith what I have always done, for the sake of peace, to give\nway to him; and I expect I should do it. That I can\nvoluntarily postpone my pretensions, when they are no\nmore than equal to those to which they are postponed, you\nhave yourself seen. But to yield to Hardin under present\ncircumstances seems to me as nothing else than yielding to\none who would gladly sacri\ufb01ce me altogether. This I would\nrather not submit to. That Hardin is talented, energetic,\nusually generous and magnanimous, I have before this\na\ufb00irmed to you and do not deny. You know that my only\nargument is that \u201cturn about is fair play.\u201d This he,\npractically at least, denies.\n If it would not be taxing you too much, I wish you would\nwrite me, telling the aspect of things in your country, or\nrather your district; and also, send the names of some of\nyour Whig neighbors, to whom I might, with propriety,\nwrite. Unless I can get some one to do this, Hardin, with his\nold franking list, will have the advantage of me. My reliance\nfor a fair shake (and I want nothing more) in your country\nis chie\ufb02y on you, because of your position and standing,\nand because I am acquainted with so few others. Let me\nhear from you soon.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \nH\n   \n   .\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. , .\nJOHN BENNETT. FRIEND JOHN: Nathan Dresser is\nhere, and speaks as though the contest between Hardin\nand me is to be doubtful in Menard County. I know he is\ncandid and this alarms me some. I asked him to tell me the\nnames of the men that were going strong for Hardin, he\nsaid Morris was about as strong as any-now tell me, is\nMorris going it openly? You remember you wrote me that\nhe would be neutral. Nathan also said that some man,\nwhom he could not remember, had said lately that Menard\nCounty was going to decide the contest and that made the\ncontest very doubtful. Do you know who that was? Don\u2019t\nfail to write me instantly on receiving this, telling me all \u2014\nparticularly the names of those who are going strong\nagainst me.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n.  .  \n  \n   .\nSPRINGFIELD, January , .\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 You perhaps know that General Hardin and\nI have a contest for the Whig nomination for Congress for\nthis district.\nHe has had a turn and my argument is \u201cturn about is fair\nplay.\u201d\nI shall be pleased if this strikes you as a su\ufb00icient\nargument.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  A\n      \nA\n.\nSPRINGFIELD, April , .\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 I thank you for the promptness with which\nyou answered my letter from Bloomington. I also thank you\nfor the frankness with which you comment upon a certain\npart of my letter; because that comment a\ufb00ords me an\nopportunity of trying to express myself better than I did\nbefore, seeing, as I do, that in that part of my letter, you\nhave not understood me as I intended to be understood.\nIn speaking of the \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d of men who yet mean\nto do no wrong, etc., I mean no special application of what I\nsaid to the Whigs of Morgan, or of Morgan \n Scott. I only\nhad in my mind the fact that previous to General Hardin\u2019s\nwithdrawal some of his friends and some of mine had\nbecome a little warm; and I felt, and meant to say, that for\nthem now to meet face to face and converse together was\nthe best way to e\ufb00ace any remnant of unpleasant feeling, if\nany such existed.\nI did not suppose that General Hardin\u2019s friends were in\nany greater need of having their feelings corrected than\nmine were. Since I saw you at Jacksonville, I have had no\nmore suspicion of the Whigs of Morgan than of those of any\nother part of the district. I write this only to try to remove\n any impression that I distrust you and the other Whigs of\nyour country.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  A\n      \nA\n.\nSPRINGFIELD, May , .\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 It is a matter of high moral obligation, if\nnot of necessity, for me to attend the Coles and Edwards\ncourts. I have some cases in both of them, in which the\nparties have my promise, and are depending upon me. The\ncourt commences in Coles on the second Monday, and in\nEdgar on the third. Your court in Morgan commences on\nthe fourth Monday; and it is my purpose to be with you\nthen, and make a speech. I mention the Coles and Edgar\ncourts in order that if I should not reach Jacksonville at the\ntime named you may understand the reason why. I do not,\nhowever, think there is much danger of my being detained;\nas I shall go with a purpose not to be, and consequently\nshall engage in no new cases that might delay me.\nYours truly, A.

He\nwrites: \u201cThat part of the country is within itself as\nunpoetical as any spot on earth; but still seeing it and its\nobjects and inhabitants aroused feelings in me which were\ncertainly poetry; though whether my expression of these\nfeelings is poetry, is quite another question.\u201d]\nNear twenty years have passed away Since here I bid\nfarewell\nTo woods and \ufb01elds, and scenes of play, And playmates\nloved so well.\nWhere many were, but few remain Of old familiar things;\nBut seeing them to mind again The lost and absent\nbrings.\nThe friends I left that parting day, How changed, as time\nhas sped!\nYoung childhood grown, strong manhood gray, And half\nof all are dead.\n I hear the loved survivors tell How naught from death\ncould save, Till every sound appears a knell, And every spot\na grave.\nI range the \ufb01elds with pensive tread, And pace the\nhollow rooms,\nAnd feel (companion of the dead) I \u2018m living in the tombs.\nVERSES WRITTEN BY LINCOLN CONCERNING A\nSCHOOL-FELLOW\nWHO BECAME INSANE \u2014 (A FRAGMENT).\nAnd when at length the drear and long Time soothed thy\n\ufb01ercer woes, How plaintively thy mournful song Upon the\nstill night rose\nI\u2019ve heard it oft as if I dreamed, Far distant, sweet and\nlone; The funeral dirge it ever seemed Of reason dead and\ngone.\nAir held her breath; trees with the spell Seemed\nsorrowing angels round, Whose swelling tears in dewdrops\nfell Upon the listening ground.\nBut this is past, and naught remains That raised thee o\u2019er\nthe brute; Thy piercing shrieks and soothing strains Are\nlike, forever mute.\n Now fare thee well!

SPEED\nSPRINGFIELD, OCTOBER , .\nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 You, no doubt, assign the suspension of\nour correspondence to the true philosophic cause; though it\nmust be confessed by both of us that this is rather a cold\nreason for allowing a friendship such as ours to die out by\ndegrees. I propose now that, upon receipt of this, you shall\nbe considered in my debt, and under obligations to pay\nsoon, and that neither shall remain long in arrears\nhereafter. Are you agreed?\nBeing elected to Congress, though I am very grateful to\nour friends for having done it, has not pleased me as much\nas I expected.\nWe have another boy, born the th of March. He is very\nmuch such a child as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer\norder. Bob is \u201cshort and low,\u201d and I expect always will be.\nHe talks very plainly, \u2014 almost as plainly as anybody. He is\nquite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he is one of the\nlittle rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about \ufb01ve than ever\nafter. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the\no\ufb00spring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a\nmessenger came to tell me Bob was lost; but by the time I\nreached the house his mother had found him and had him\n whipped, and by now, very likely, he is run away again.\nMary has read your letter, and wishes to be remembered to\nMrs. Speed and you, in which I most sincerely join her.\nAs ever yours, A.

I went at\nonce to see Logan, and found that he is not engaged\nagainst you, and that he has so sent you word by Mr.\nButter\ufb01eld, as he says. He says that some time ago, a\nyoung man (who he knows not) came to him, with a copy of\nthe a\ufb00idavit, to engage him to aid in getting the Governor\nto grant the warrant; and that he, Logan, told the man, that\nin his opinion, the a\ufb00idavit was clearly insu\ufb00icient, upon\nwhich the young man left, without making any engagement\nwith him. If the Governor shall arrive before I leave, Logan\nand I will both attend to the matter, and he will attend to it,\nif he does not come till after I leave; all upon the condition\nthat the Governor shall not have acted upon the matter,\nbefore his arrival here. I mention this condition because, I\nlearned this morning from the Secretary of State, that he is\nforwarding to the Governor, at Palestine, all papers he\nreceives in the case, as fast as he receives them. Among the\npapers forwarded will be your letter to the Governor or\nSecretary of, I believe, the same date and about the same\ncontents of your last letter to me; so that the Governor will,\n at all events have your points and authorities. The case is a\nclear one on our side; but whether the Governor will view it\nso is another thing.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \nI  IA\n H. H  \nWASHINGTON, December , .\nDEAR WILLIAM: \u2014 You may remember that about a year\nago a man by the name of Wilson (James Wilson, I think)\npaid us twenty dollars as an advance fee to attend to a case\nin the Supreme Court for him, against a Mr. Campbell, the\nrecord of which case was in the hands of Mr. Dixon of St.\nLouis, who never furnished it to us. When I was at\nBloomington last fall I met a friend of Wilson, who\nmentioned the subject to me, and induced me to write to\nWilson, telling him I would leave the ten dollars with you\nwhich had been left with me to pay for making abstracts in\nthe case, so that the case may go on this winter; but I came\naway, and forgot to do it. What I want now is to send you\nthe money, to be used accordingly, if any one comes on to\nstart the case, or to be retained by you if no one does.\nThere is nothing of consequence new here. Congress is\nto organize to-morrow. Last night we held a Whig caucus\nfor the House, and nominated Winthrop of Massachusetts\nfor speaker, Sargent of Pennsylvania for sergeant-at-arms,\nHomer of New Jersey door-keeper, and McCormick of\nDistrict of Columbia postmaster. The Whig majority in the\nHouse is so small that, together with some little\n dissatisfaction, [it] leaves it doubtful whether we will elect\nthem all.\nThis paper is too thick to fold, which is the reason I send\nonly a half-sheet.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \nI  IA\n H.

I am under no obligations to\nthe bank; and I therefore wish you to buy bank certi\ufb01cates,\nand pay my debt there, so as to pay it with the least money\npossible. I would as soon you should buy them of Mr.\nRidgely, or any other person at the bank, as of any one else,\nprovided you can get them as cheaply. I suppose, after the\nbank debt shall be paid, there will be some money left, out\nof which I would like to have you pay Lavely and Stout\ntwenty dollars, and Priest and somebody (oil-makers) ten\ndollars, for materials got for house-painting. If there shall\nstill be any left, keep it till you see or hear from me.\nI shall begin sending documents so soon as I can get\nthem.

LINCOLN.\n    \n \n I\n  I\n  H  \nI  \n   A    H\n \n         \n A I   \nDECEMBER , \nWHEREAS, THE PRESIDENT of the United States, in his\nmessage of May , , has declared that \u201cthe Mexican\nGovernment not only refused to receive him [the envoy of\nthe United States], or to listen to his propositions, but, after\na long-continued series of menaces, has at last invaded our\nterritory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our\nown soil\u201d;\nAnd again, in his message of December , , that \u201cwe\nhad ample cause of war against Mexico long before the\nbreaking out of hostilities; but even then we forbore to take\nredress into our own hands until Mexico herself became\nthe aggressor, by invading our soil in hostile array, and\nshedding the blood of our citizens\u201d;\nAnd yet again, in his message of December , , that\n\u201cthe Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms\nof adjustment which he [our minister of peace] was\nauthorized \nto \npropose, \nand \n\ufb01nally, \nunder \nwholly\nunjusti\ufb01able pretexts, involved the two countries in war, by\ninvading the territory of the State of Texas, striking the \ufb01rst\nblow, and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own\nsoil\u201d;\n And whereas, This House is desirous to obtain a full\nknowledge of all the facts which go to establish whether\nthe particular spot on which the blood of our citizens was\nso shed was or was not at that time our own soil: therefore,\nResolved, By the House of Representatives, that the\nPresident of the United States be respectfully requested to\ninform this House:\nFirst. Whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens\nwas shed, as in his message declared, was or was not\nwithin the territory of Spain, at least after the treaty of\n, until the Mexican revolution.\nSecond. Whether that spot is or is not within the territory\nwhich was wrested from Spain by the revolutionary\ngovernment of Mexico.\nThird. Whether that spot is or is not within a settlement\nof people, which settlement has existed ever since long\nbefore the Texas revolution, and until its inhabitants \ufb02ed\nbefore the approach of the United States army.\nFourth. Whether that settlement is or is not isolated from\nany and all other settlements by the Gulf and the Rio\nGrande on the south and west, and by wide uninhabited\nregions on the north and east.\nFifth. Whether the people of that settlement, or a\nmajority of them, or any of them, have ever submitted\nthemselves to the government or laws of Texas or of the\nUnited States, by consent or by compulsion, either by\naccepting o\ufb00ice, or voting at elections, or paying tax, or\nserving on juries, or having process served upon them, or\nin any other way.\n Sixth. Whether the people of that settlement did or did\nnot \ufb02ee from the approach of the United States army,\nleaving unprotected their homes and their growing crops,\nbefore the blood was shed, as in the message stated; and\nwhether the \ufb01rst blood, so shed, was or was not shed\nwithin the inclosure of one of the people who had thus \ufb02ed\nfrom it.\nSeventh. Whether our citizens, whose blood was shed, as\nin his message declared, were or were not, at that time,\narmed o\ufb00icers and soldiers, sent into that settlement by the\nmilitary order of the President, through the Secretary of\nWar.\nEighth. Whether the military force of the United States\nwas or was not so sent into that settlement after General\nTaylor had more than once intimated to the War\nDepartment that, in his opinion, no such movement was\nnecessary to the defence or protection of Texas.\n   \nA    I\n  H  \nI  \n   A    H\n   \n       \n A I   \nJANUARY , .\nMR. LINCOLN SAID he had made an e\ufb00ort, some few days\nsince, to obtain the \ufb02oor in relation to this measure\n[resolution \nto \ndirect \nPostmaster-General \nto \nmake\narrangements with railroad for carrying the mails \u2014 in\nCommittee of the Whole], but had failed. One of the objects\nhe had then had in view was now in a great measure\nsuperseded by what had fallen from the gentleman from\nVirginia who had just taken his seat. He begged to assure\nhis friends on the other side of the House that no assault\nwhatever was meant upon the Postmaster-General, and he\nwas glad that what the gentleman had now said modi\ufb01ed to\na great extent the impression which might have been\ncreated by the language he had used on a previous\noccasion. He wanted to state to gentlemen who might have\nentertained such impressions, that the Committee on the\nPost-o\ufb00ice \nwas \ncomposed \nof \n\ufb01ve \nWhigs \nand \nfour\nDemocrats, and their report was understood as sustaining,\nnot impugning, the position taken by the Postmaster-\nGeneral. That report had met with the approbation of all\nthe Whigs, and of all the Democrats also, with the\nexception of one, and he wanted to go even further than\n this. [Intimation was informally given Mr. Lincoln that it\nwas not in order to mention on the \ufb02oor what had taken\nplace in committee.] He then observed that if he had been\nout of order in what he had said he took it all back so far as\nhe could. He had no desire, he could assure gentlemen,\never to be out of order \u2014 though he never could keep long\nin order.\nMr. Lincoln went on to observe that he di\ufb00ered in\nopinion, in the present case, from his honorable friend from\nRichmond [Mr. Botts]. That gentleman, had begun his\nremarks by saying that if all prepossessions in this matter\ncould be removed out of the way, but little di\ufb00iculty would\nbe experienced in coming to an agreement. Now, he could\nassure that gentleman that he had himself begun the\nexamination of the subject with prepossessions all in his\nfavor. He had long and often heard of him, and, from what\nhe had heard, was prepossessed in his favor. Of the\nPostmaster-General he had also heard, but had no\nprepossessions in his favor, though certainly none of an\nopposite kind. He di\ufb00ered, however, with that gentleman in\npolitics, while in this respect he agreed with the gentleman\nfrom Virginia [Mr. Botts], whom he wished to oblige\nwhenever it was in his power. That gentleman had referred\nto the report made to the House by the Postmaster-General,\nand had intimated an apprehension that gentlemen would\nbe disposed to rely, on that report alone, and derive their\nviews of the case from that document alone. Now it so\nhappened that a pamphlet had been slipped into his [Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s] hand before he read the report of the\n Postmaster-General; so that, even in this, he had begun\nwith prepossessions in favor of the gentleman from\nVirginia.\nAs to the report, he had but one remark to make: he had\ncarefully examined it, and he did not understand that there\nwas any dispute as to the facts therein stated the dispute, if\nhe understood it, was con\ufb01ned altogether to the inferences\nto be drawn from those facts. It was a di\ufb00erence not about\nfacts, but about conclusions. The facts were not disputed. If\nhe was right in this, he supposed the House might assume\nthe facts to be as they were stated, and thence proceed to\ndraw their own conclusions.\nThe gentleman had said that the Postmaster-General had\ngot into a personal squabble with the railroad company. Of\nthis Mr. Lincoln knew nothing, nor did he need or desire to\nknow anything, because it had nothing whatever to do with\na just conclusion from the premises. But the gentleman had\ngone on to ask whether so great a grievance as the present\ndetention of the Southern mail ought not to be remedied.\nMr. Lincoln would assure the gentleman that if there was a\nproper way of doing it, no man was more anxious than he\nthat it should be done. The report made by the committee\nhad been intended to yield much for the sake of removing\nthat grievance. That the grievance was very great there\nwas no dispute in any quarter. He supposed that the\nstatements made by the gentleman from Virginia to show\nthis were all entirely correct in point of fact. He did\nsuppose that the interruptions of regular intercourse, and\nall the other inconveniences growing out of it, were all as\n that gentleman had stated them to be; and certainly, if\nredress could be rendered, it was proper it should be\nrendered as soon as possible. The gentleman said that in\norder to e\ufb00ect this no new legislative action was needed;\nall that was necessary was that the Postmaster-General\nshould be required to do what the law, as it stood,\nauthorized and required him to do.\nWe come then, said Mr. Lincoln, to the law. Now the\nPostmaster-General says he cannot give to this company\nmore than two hundred and thirty-seven dollars and \ufb01fty\ncents per railroad mile of transportation, and twelve and a\nhalf per cent. less for transportation by steamboats. He\nconsiders himself as restricted by law to this amount; and\nhe says, further, that he would not give more if he could,\nbecause in his apprehension it would not be fair and just.\n     \n   I    \n     \n    \n I\n  \n   \nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\nWASHINGTON, JANUARY , .\nDEAR WILLIAM: \u2014 Your letter of December  was\nreceived a day or two ago. I am much obliged to you for the\ntrouble you have taken, and promise to take in my little\nbusiness there. As to speech making, by way of getting the\nhang of the House I made a little speech two or three days\nago on a post-o\ufb00ice question of no general interest. I \ufb01nd\nspeaking here and elsewhere about the same thing. I was\nabout as badly scared, and no worse as I am when I speak\nin court. I expect to make one within a week or two, in\nwhich I hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it.\nIt is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some\nwho desire that I should be reelected. I most heartily thank\nthem for their kind partiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said\nof the annexation of Texas, that \u201cpersonally I would not\nobject\u201d to a reelection, although I thought at the time, and\nstill think, it would be quite as well for me to return to the\nlaw at the end of a single term. I made the declaration that\nI would not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal\nfairly with others, to keep peace among our friends, and to\nkeep the district from going to the enemy, than for any\ncause personal to myself; so that if it should so happen that\n nobody else wishes to be elected, I could not refuse the\npeople the right of sending me again. But to enter myself as\na competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter\nme is what my word and honor forbid.\nI got some letters intimating a probability of so much\ndi\ufb00iculty amongst our friends as to lose us the district; but\nI remember such letters were written to Baker when my\nown case was under consideration, and I trust there is no\nmore ground for such apprehension now than there was\nthen. Remember I am always glad to receive a letter from\nyou.\nMost truly your friend, A. LINCOLN.\n      H \n \n   A A I\n \n  \nA  \n \n  I \nSPEECH IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES,\nJANUARY , .\nMR CHAIRMAN: \u2014 Some if not all the gentlemen on the\nother side of the House who have addressed the committee\nwithin the last two days have spoken rather complainingly,\nif I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week\nor ten days ago declaring that the war with Mexico was\nunnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the\nPresident. I admit that such a vote should not be given in\nmere party wantonness, and that the one given is justly\ncensurable if it have no other or better foundation. I am\none of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under my\nbest impression of the truth of the case. How I got this\nimpression, and how it may possibly be remedied, I will\nnow try to show. When the war began, it was my opinion\nthat all those who because of knowing too little, or because\nof knowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the\nconduct of the President in the beginning of it should\nnevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on\nthat point, at least till the war should be ended. Some\nleading Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have\ntaken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered\n to it and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I\nthink I should still adhere to it were it not that the\nPresident and his friends will not allow it to be so. Besides\nthe continual e\ufb00ort of the President to argue every silent\nvote given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice\nand wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid\nparagraph in his late message in which he tells us that\nCongress with great unanimity had declared that \u201cby the\nact of the Republic of Mexico, a state of war exists between\nthat government and the United States,\u201d when the same\njournals that informed him of this also informed him that\nwhen that declaration stood disconnected from the\nquestion of supplies sixty-seven in the House, and not\nfourteen merely, voted against it; besides this open attempt\nto prove by telling the truth what he could not prove by\ntelling the whole truth-demanding of all who will not\nsubmit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to\nspeak out, besides all this, one of my colleagues [Mr.\nRichardson] at a very early day in the session brought in a\nset of resolutions expressly indorsing the original justice of\nthe war on the part of the President. Upon these\nresolutions when they shall be put on their passage I shall\nbe compelled to vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would.\nSeeing this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote\nunderstandingly when it should come. I carefully examined\nthe President\u2019s message, to ascertain what he himself had\nsaid and proved upon the point. The result of this\nexamination was to make the impression that, taking for\ntrue all the President states as facts, he falls far short of\n proving his justi\ufb01cation; and that the President would have\ngone further with his proof if it had not been for the small\nmatter that the truth would not permit him. Under the\nimpression thus made I gave the vote before mentioned. I\npropose now to give concisely the process of the\nexamination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I\ndid. The President, in his \ufb01rst war message of May, ,\ndeclares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were\ncommenced by Mexico, and he repeats that declaration\nalmost in the same language in each successive annual\nmessage, thus showing that he deems that point a highly\nessential one. In the importance of that point I entirely\nagree with the President. To my judgment it is the very\npoint upon which he should be justi\ufb01ed, or condemned. In\nhis message of December, , it seems to have occurred\nto him, as is certainly true, that title-ownership-to soil or\nanything else is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion\nfollowing on one or more simple facts; and that it was\nincumbent upon him to present the facts from which he\nconcluded the soil was ours on which the \ufb01rst blood of the\nwar was shed.\nAccordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve in\nthe message last referred to, he enters upon that task;\nforming an issue and introducing testimony, extending the\nwhole to a little below the middle of page fourteen. Now, I\npropose to try to show that the whole of this \u2014 issue and\nevidence \u2014 is from beginning to end the sheerest\ndeception. The issue, as he presents it, is in these words:\n\u201cBut there are those who, conceding all this to be true,\n assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas\nis the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that,\ntherefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the\nlatter river, we passed the Texas line and invaded the\nterritory of Mexico.\u201d Now this issue is made up of two\na\ufb00irmatives and no negative. The main deception of it is\nthat it assumes as true that one river or the other is\nnecessarily the boundary; and cheats the super\ufb01cial thinker\nentirely out of the idea that possibly the boundary is\nsomewhere between the two, and not actually at either. A\nfurther deception is that it will let in evidence which a true\nissue would exclude. A true issue made by the President\nwould be about as follows: \u201cI say the soil was ours, on\nwhich the \ufb01rst blood was shed; there are those who say it\nwas not.\u201d\nI now proceed to examine the President\u2019s evidence as\napplicable to such an issue. When that evidence is\nanalyzed, it is all included in the following propositions: ()\nThat the Rio Grande was the western boundary of\nLouisiana as we purchased it of France in .\n() That the Republic of Texas always claimed the Rio\nGrande as her eastern boundary.\n() That by various acts she had claimed it on paper.\n() That Santa Anna in his treaty with Texas recognized\nthe Rio Grande as her boundary.\n() That Texas before, and the United States after,\nannexation had exercised jurisdiction beyond the Nueces \u2014\nbetween the two rivers.\n () That our Congress understood the boundary of Texas\nto extend beyond the Nueces.\nNow for each of these in its turn. His \ufb01rst item is that the\nRio Grande was the western boundary of Louisiana, as we\npurchased it of France in ; and seeming to expect this\nto be disputed, he argues over the amount of nearly a page\nto prove it true, at the end of which he lets us know that by\nthe treaty of  we sold to Spain the whole country from\nthe Rio Grande eastward to the Sabine. Now, admitting for\nthe present that the Rio Grande was the boundary of\nLouisiana, what under heaven had that to do with the\npresent boundary between us and Mexico? How, Mr.\nChairman, the line that once divided your land from mine\ncan still be the boundary between us after I have sold my\nland to you is to me beyond all comprehension. And how\nany man, with an honest purpose only of proving the truth,\ncould ever have thought of introducing such a fact to prove\nsuch an issue is equally incomprehensible. His next piece of\nevidence is that \u201cthe Republic of Texas always claimed this\nriver [Rio Grande] as her western boundary.\u201d That is not\ntrue, in fact. Texas has claimed it, but she has not always\nclaimed it. There is at least one distinguished exception.\nHer State constitution the republic\u2019s most solemn and well-\nconsidered act, that which may, without impropriety, be\ncalled her last will and testament, revoking all others-\nmakes no such claim. But suppose she had always claimed\nit. Has not Mexico always claimed the contrary? So that\nthere is but claim against claim, leaving nothing proved\nuntil we get back of the claims and \ufb01nd which has the\n better foundation. Though not in the order in which the\nPresident presents his evidence, I now consider that class\nof his statements which are in substance nothing more than\nthat Texas has, by various acts of her Convention and\nCongress, claimed the Rio Grande as her boundary, on\npaper. I mean here what he says about the \ufb01xing of the Rio\nGrande as her boundary in her old constitution (not her\nState constitution), about forming Congressional districts,\ncounties, etc. Now all of this is but naked claim; and what I\nhave already said about claims is strictly applicable to this.\nIf I should claim your land by word of mouth, that certainly\nwould not make it mine; and if I were to claim it by a deed\nwhich I had made myself, and with which you had had\nnothing to do, the claim would be quite the same in\nsubstance \u2014 or rather, in utter nothingness. I next consider\nthe President\u2019s statement that Santa Anna in his treaty with\nTexas recognized the Rio Grande as the western boundary\nof Texas. Besides the position so often taken, that Santa\nAnna while a prisoner of war, a captive, could not bind\nMexico by a treaty, which I deem conclusive \u2014 besides this,\nI wish to say something in relation to this treaty, so called\nby the President, with Santa Anna. If any man would like to\nbe amused by a sight of that little thing which the President\ncalls by that big name, he can have it by turning to Niles\u2019s\nRegister, vol. , . And if any one should suppose that Niles\u2019s\nRegister is a curious repository of so mighty a document as\na solemn treaty between nations, I can only say that I\nlearned to a tolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry at the\nState Department, that the President himself never saw it\n anywhere else. By the way, I believe I should not err if I\nwere to declare that during the \ufb01rst ten years of the\nexistence of that document it was never by anybody called\na treaty \u2014 that it was never so called till the President, in\nhis extremity, attempted by so calling it to wring something\nfrom it in justi\ufb01cation of himself in connection with the\nMexican War. It has none of the distinguishing features of a\ntreaty. It does not call itself a treaty. Santa Anna does not\ntherein assume to bind Mexico; he assumes only to act as\nthe President \u2014 Commander-in-Chief of the Mexican army\nand navy; stipulates that the then present hostilities should\ncease, and that he would not himself take up arms, nor\nin\ufb02uence the Mexican people to take up arms, against\nTexas during the existence of the war of independence. He\ndid not recognize the independence of Texas; he did not\nassume to put an end to the war, but clearly indicated his\nexpectation of its continuance; he did not say one word\nabout boundary, and, most probably, never thought of it. It\nis stipulated therein that the Mexican forces should\nevacuate the territory of Texas, passing to the other side of\nthe Rio Grande; and in another article it is stipulated that,\nto prevent collisions between the armies, the Texas army\nshould not approach nearer than within \ufb01ve leagues \u2014 of\nwhat is not said, but clearly, from the object stated, it is of\nthe Rio Grande. Now, if this is a treaty recognizing the Rio\nGrande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the singular\nfeature of stipulating that Texas shall not go within \ufb01ve\nleagues of her own boundary.\n Next comes the evidence of Texas before annexation, and\nthe United States afterwards, exercising jurisdiction\nbeyond the Nueces and between the two rivers. This actual\nexercise of jurisdiction is the very class or quality of\nevidence we want. It is excellent so far as it goes; but does\nit go far enough? He tells us it went beyond the Nueces,\nbut he does not tell us it went to the Rio Grande. He tells us\njurisdiction was exercised between the two rivers, but he\ndoes not tell us it was exercised over all the territory\nbetween them. Some simple-minded people think it is\npossible to cross one river and go beyond it without going\nall the way to the next, that jurisdiction may be exercised\nbetween two rivers without covering all the country\nbetween them. I know a man, not very unlike myself, who\nexercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between the\nWabash and the Mississippi; and yet so far is this from\nbeing all there is between those rivers that it is just one\nhundred and \ufb01fty-two feet long by \ufb01fty feet wide, and no\npart of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has a\nneighbor between him and the Mississippi \u2014 that is, just\nacross the street, in that direction \u2014 whom I am sure he\ncould neither persuade nor force to give up his habitation;\nbut which nevertheless he could certainly annex, if it were\nto be done by merely standing on his own side of the street\nand claiming it, or even sitting down and writing a deed for\nit.\nBut next the President tells us the Congress of the\nUnited States understood the State of Texas they admitted\ninto the Union to extend beyond the Nueces. Well, I\n suppose they did. I certainly so understood it. But how far\nbeyond? That Congress did not understand it to extend\nclear to the Rio Grande is quite certain, by the fact of their\njoint resolutions for admission expressly leaving all\nquestions of boundary to future adjustment. And it may be\nadded that Texas herself is proven to have had the same\nunderstanding of it that our Congress had, by the fact of\nthe exact conformity of her new constitution to those\nresolutions.\nI am now through the whole of the President\u2019s evidence;\nand it is a singular fact that if any one should declare the\nPresident sent the army into the midst of a settlement of\nMexican people who had never submitted, by consent or by\nforce, to the authority of Texas or of the United States, and\nthat there and thereby the \ufb01rst blood of the war was shed,\nthere is not one word in all the which would either admit or\ndeny the declaration. This strange omission it does seem to\nme could not have occurred but by design. My way of living\nleads me to be about the courts of justice; and there I have\nsometimes seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client\u2019s\nneck in a desperate case, employing every arti\ufb01ce to work\nround, befog, and cover up with many words some point\narising in the case which he dared not admit and yet could\nnot deny. Party bias may help to make it appear so, but with\nall the allowance I can make for such bias, it still does\nappear to me that just such, and from just such necessity, is\nthe President\u2019s struggle in this case.\nSometime \nafter \nmy \ncolleague \n[Mr. \nRichardson]\nintroduced the resolutions I have mentioned, I introduced a\n preamble, resolution, and interrogations, intended to draw\nthe President out, if possible, on this hitherto untrodden\nground. To show their relevancy, I propose to state my\nunderstanding of the true rule for ascertaining the\nboundary between Texas and Mexico. It is that wherever\nTexas was exercising jurisdiction was hers; and wherever\nMexico was exercising jurisdiction was hers; and that\nwhatever separated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of\nthe one from that of the other was the true boundary\nbetween them. If, as is probably true, Texas was exercising\njurisdiction along the western bank of the Nueces, and\nMexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the Rio\nGrande, then neither river was the boundary: but the\nuninhabited country between the two was. The extent of\nour territory in that region depended not on any treaty-\n\ufb01xed boundary (for no treaty had attempted it), but on\nrevolution. Any people anywhere being inclined and having\nthe power have the right to rise up and shake o\ufb00 the\nexisting government, and form a new one that suits them\nbetter. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right \u2014 a\nright which we hope and believe is to liberate the world.\nNor is this right con\ufb01ned to cases in which the whole\npeople of an existing government may choose to exercise it.\nAny portion of such people that can may revolutionize and\nmake their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit.\nMore than this, a majority of any portion of such people\nmay revolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled\nwith or near about them, who may oppose this movement.\nSuch minority was precisely the case of the Tories of our\n own revolution. It is a quality of revolutions not to go by old\nlines or old laws, but to break up both, and make new ones.\nAs to the country now in question, we bought it of France\nin , and sold it to Spain in , according to the\nPresident\u2019s statements. After this, all Mexico, including\nTexas, revolutionized against Spain; and still later Texas\nrevolutionized against Mexico. In my view, just so far as she\ncarried her resolution by obtaining the actual, willing or\nunwilling, submission of the people, so far the country was\nhers, and no farther. Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining\nthe very best evidence as to whether Texas had actually\ncarried her revolution to the place where the hostilities of\nthe present war commenced, let the President answer the\ninterrogatories I proposed, as before mentioned, or some\nother similar ones. Let him answer fully, fairly, and\ncandidly. Let him answer with facts and not with\narguments. Let him remember he sits where Washington\nsat, and so remembering, let him answer as Washington\nwould answer. As a nation should not, and the Almighty will\nnot, be evaded, so let him attempt no evasion \u2014 no\nequivocation. And if, so answering, he can show that the\nsoil was ours where the \ufb01rst blood of the war was shed, \u2014\nthat it was not within an inhabited country, or, if within\nsuch, that the inhabitants had submitted themselves to the\ncivil authority of Texas or of the United States, and that the\nsame is true of the site of Fort Brown, then I am with him\nfor his justi\ufb01cation. In that case I shall be most happy to\nreverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a sel\ufb01sh\nmotive for desiring that the President may do this \u2014 I\n expect to gain some votes, in connection with the war,\nwhich, without his so doing, will be of doubtful propriety in\nmy own judgment, but which will be free from the doubt if\nhe does so. But if he can not or will not do this, \u2014 if on any\npretence or no pretence he shall refuse or omit it then I\nshall be fully convinced of what I more than suspect\nalready that he is deeply conscious of being in the wrong;\nthat he feels the blood of this war, like the blood of Abel, is\ncrying to heaven against him; that originally having some\nstrong motive \u2014 what, I will not stop now to give my\nopinion concerning to involve the two countries in a war,\nand trusting to escape scrutiny by \ufb01xing the public gaze\nupon the exceeding brightness of military glory, \u2014 that\nattractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood, that\nserpent\u2019s eye that charms to destroy, \u2014 he plunged into it,\nand was swept on and on till, disappointed in his\ncalculation of the ease with which Mexico might be\nsubdued, he now \ufb01nds himself he knows not where. How\nlike the half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole\nwar part of his late message! At one time telling us that\nMexico has nothing whatever that we can get \u2014 but\nterritory; at another showing us how we can support the\nwar by levying contributions on Mexico. At one time urging\nthe national honor, the security of the future, the\nprevention of foreign interference, and even the good of\nMexico herself as among the objects of the war; at another\ntelling us that \u201cto reject indemnity, by refusing to accept a\ncession of territory, would be to abandon all our just\ndemands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses,\n without a purpose or de\ufb01nite object.\u201d So then this national\nhonor, security of the future, and everything but territorial\nindemnity \nmay \nbe \nconsidered \nthe \nno-purposes \nand\ninde\ufb01nite objects of the war! But, having it now settled that\nterritorial indemnity is the only object, we are urged to\nseize, by legislation here, all that he was content to take a\nfew months ago, and the whole province of Lower\nCalifornia to boot, and to still carry on the war to take all\nwe are \ufb01ghting for, and still \ufb01ght on. Again, the President is\nresolved under all circumstances to have full territorial\nindemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell\nus how we are to get the excess after those expenses shall\nhave surpassed the value of the whole of the Mexican\nterritory. So again, he insists that the separate national\nexistence of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not\ntell us how this can be done, after we shall have taken all\nher territory. Lest the questions I have suggested be\nconsidered speculative merely, let me be indulged a\nmoment in trying to show they are not. The war has gone\non some twenty months; for the expenses of which,\ntogether with an inconsiderable old score, the President\nnow claims about one half of the Mexican territory, and that\nby far the better half, so far as concerns our ability to make\nanything out of it. It is comparatively uninhabited; so that\nwe could establish land-o\ufb00ices in it, and raise some money\nin that way. But the other half is already inhabited, as I\nunderstand it, tolerably densely for the nature of the\ncountry, and all its lands, or all that are valuable, already\nappropriated as private property. How then are we to make\n anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on\nthem? or how remove the encumbrance? I suppose no one\nwould say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or\nmake slaves of them, or con\ufb01scate their property. How,\nthen, can we make much out of this part of the territory? If\nthe prosecution of the war has in expenses already equalled\nthe better half of the country, how long its future\nprosecution will be in equalling the less valuable half is not\na speculative, but a practical, question, pressing closely\nupon us. And yet it is a question which the President seems\nnever to have thought of. As to the mode of terminating the\nwar and securing peace, the President is equally wandering\nand inde\ufb01nite. First, it is to be done by a more vigorous\nprosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy\u2019s\ncountry; and after apparently talking himself tired on this\npoint, the President drops down into a half-despairing tone,\nand tells us that \u201cwith a people distracted and divided by\ncontending factions, and a government subject to constant\nchanges by successive revolutions, the continued success of\nour arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace.\u201d Then he\nsuggests the propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to\ndesert the counsels of their own leaders, and, trusting in\nour protestations, to set up a government from which we\ncan secure a satisfactory peace; telling us that \u201cthis may\nbecome the only mode of obtaining such a peace.\u201d But soon\nhe falls into doubt of this too; and then drops back on to the\nalready \nhalf-abandoned \nground \nof \n\u201cmore \nvigorous\nprosecution.\u201d All this shows that the President is in nowise\nsatis\ufb01ed with his own positions. First he takes up one, and\n in attempting to argue us into it he argues himself out of it,\nthen seizes another and goes through the same process,\nand then, confused at being able to think of nothing new, he\nsnatches up the old one again, which he has some time\nbefore cast o\ufb00. His mind, taxed beyond its power, is\nrunning hither and thither, like some tortured creature on a\nburning surface, \ufb01nding no position on which it can settle\ndown and be at ease.\nAgain, it is a singular omission in this message that it\nnowhere intimates when the President expects the war to\nterminate. At its beginning, General Scott was by this same\nPresident driven into disfavor if not disgrace, for intimating\nthat peace could not be conquered in less than three or\nfour months. But now, at the end of about twenty months,\nduring which time our arms have given us the most\nsplendid successes, every department and every part, land\nand water, o\ufb00icers and privates, regulars and volunteers,\ndoing all that men could do, and hundreds of things which\nit had ever before been thought men could not do \u2014 after\nall this, this same President gives a long message, without\nshowing us that as to the end he himself has even an\nimaginary conception. As I have before said, he knows not\nwhere he is. He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably\nperplexed man. God grant he may be able to show there is\nnot something about his conscience more painful than his\nmental perplexity.\nThe following is a copy of the so-called \u201ctreaty\u201d referred\nto in the speech: \u201cArticles of Agreement entered into\nbetween his Excellency David G. Burnet, President of the\n Republic of Texas, of the one part, and his Excellency\nGeneral Santa Anna, President-General-in-Chief of the\nMexican army, of the other part:\n\u201cArticle I. General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna agrees\nthat he will not take up arms, nor will he exercise his\nin\ufb02uence to cause them to be taken up, against the people\nof Texas during the present war of independence.\n\u201cArticle II. All hostilities between the Mexican and Texan\ntroops will cease immediately, both by land and water.\n\u201cArticle III. The Mexican troops will evacuate the\nterritory of Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio\nGrande Del Norte.\n\u201cArticle IV. The Mexican army, in its retreat, shall not\ntake the property of any person without his consent and\njust indemni\ufb01cation, using only such articles as may be\nnecessary for its subsistence, in cases when the owner may\nnot be present, and remitting to the commander of the\narmy of Texas, or to the commissioners to be appointed for\nthe adjustment of such matters, an account of the value of\nthe property consumed, the place where taken, and the\nname of the owner, if it can be ascertained.\n\u201cArticle V. That all private property, including cattle,\nhorses, negro slaves, or indentured persons, of whatever\ndenomination, that may have been captured by any portion\n of the Mexican army, or may have taken refuge in the said\narmy, since the commencement of the late invasion, shall\nbe restored to the commander of the Texan army, or to such\nother persons as may be appointed by the Government of\nTexas to receive them.\n\u201cArticle VI. The troops of both armies will refrain from\ncoming in contact with each other; and to this end the\ncommander of the army of Texas will be careful not to\napproach within a shorter distance than \ufb01ve leagues.\n\u201cArticle VII. The Mexican army shall not make any other\ndelay on its march than that which is necessary to take up\ntheir hospitals, baggage, etc., and to cross the rivers; any\ndelay not necessary to these purposes to be considered an\ninfraction of this agreement.\n\u201cArticle \nVIII. \nBy \nan \nexpress, \nto \nbe \nimmediately\ndespatched, this agreement shall be sent to General\nVincente Filisola and to General T. J. Rusk, commander of\nthe Texan army, in order that they may be apprised of its\nstipulations; \nand \nto \nthis \nend \nthey \nwill \nexchange\nengagements to comply with the same.\n\u201cArticle I . That all Texan prisoners now in the\npossession of the Mexican army, or its authorities, be\nforthwith released, and furnished with free passports to\nreturn to their homes; in consideration of which a\ncorresponding number of Mexican prisoners, rank and \ufb01le,\n now in possession of the Government of Texas shall be\nimmediately released; the remainder of the Mexican\nprisoners \nthat \ncontinue \nin \nthe \npossession \nof \nthe\nGovernment of Texas to be treated with due humanity, \u2014\nany extraordinary comforts that may be furnished them to\nbe at the charge of the Government of Mexico.\n\u201cArticle  . General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna will be\nsent to Vera Cruz as soon as it shall be deemed proper.\n\u201cThe contracting parties sign this instrument for the\nabovementioned purposes, in duplicate, at the port of\nVelasco, this fourteenth day of May, .\n\u201cDAVID G.

LINCOLN, FROM the Committee on the Post-o\ufb00ice and\nPost Roads, made the following report:\nThe Committee on the Post-o\ufb00ice and Post Roads, to\nwhom was referred the petition of Messrs. Saltmarsh and\nFuller, report: That, as proved to their satisfaction, the mail\nroutes from Milledgeville to Athens, and from Warrenton to\nDecatur, in the State of Georgia (numbered  and\n), were let to Reeside and Avery at   per annum\nfor the former and   for the latter, for the term of four\nyears, to commence on the \ufb01rst day of January, ; that,\nprevious to the time for commencing the service, Reeside\nsold his interest therein to Avery; that on the th of May,\n, Avery sold the whole to these petitioners, Saltmarsh\nand Fuller, to take e\ufb00ect from the beginning, January a\n; that at this time, the Assistant Postmaster-General,\nbeing called on for that purpose, consented to the transfer\nof the contracts from Reeside and Avery to these\npetitioners, and promised to have proper entries of the\ntransfer made on the books of the department, which,\nhowever, was neglected to be done; that the petitioners,\nsupposing all was right, in good faith commenced the\ntransportation of the mail on these routes, and after\ndi\ufb00iculty arose, still trusting that all would be made right,\n continued the service till December a ; that they\nperformed the service to the entire satisfaction of the\ndepartment, and have never been paid anything for it\nexcept   \u2014\u2014 ; that the di\ufb00iculty occurred as follows:\nMr. Barry was Postmaster-General at the times of making\nthe contracts and the attempted transfer of them; Mr.\nKendall \nsucceeded \nMr. \nBarry, \nand \n\ufb01nding \nReeside\napparently in debt to the department, and these contracts\nstill standing in the names of Reeside and Avery, refused to\npay for the services under them, otherwise than by credits\nto \nReeside; \nafterward, \nhowever, \nhe \ndivided \nthe\ncompensation, still crediting one half to Reeside, and\ndirecting the other to be paid to the order of Avery, who\ndisclaimed all right to it. After discontinuing the service,\nthese petitioners, supposing they might have legal redress\nagainst Avery, brought suit against him in New Orleans; in\nwhich suit they failed, on the ground that Avery had\ncomplied with his contract, having done so much toward\nthe transfer as they had accepted and been satis\ufb01ed with.\nStill later the department sued Reeside on his supposed\nindebtedness, and by a verdict of the jury it was\ndetermined that the department was indebted to him in a\nsum much beyond all the credits given him on the account\nabove stated. Under these circumstances, the committee\nconsider the petitioners clearly entitled to relief, and they\nreport a bill accordingly; lest, however, there should be\nsome mistake as to the amount which they have already\nreceived, we so frame it as that, by adjustment at the\ndepartment, they may be paid so much as remains unpaid\n for services actually performed by them not charging them\nwith the credits given to Reeside. The committee think it\nnot improbable that the petitioners purchased the right of\nAvery to be paid for the service from the st of January, till\ntheir purchase on May , ; but, the evidence on this\npoint being very vague, they forbear to report in favor of\nallowing it.\n  \n \nI  IA\n H. H  \n \n   \nA  \n \nWASHINGTON, January , .\nDEAR WILLIAM: \u2014 Inclosed you \ufb01nd a letter of Louis W.\nChandler. What is wanted is that you shall ascertain\nwhether the claim upon the note described has received\nany dividend in the Probate Court of Christian County,\nwhere the estate of Mr. Overbon Williams has been\nadministered on. If nothing is paid on it, withdraw the note\nand send it to me, so that Chandler can see the indorser of\nit. At all events write me all about it, till I can somehow get\nit o\ufb00 my hands. I have already been bored more than\nenough about it; not the least of which annoyance is his\ncursed, unreadable, and ungodly handwriting.\nI have made a speech, a copy of which I will send you by\nnext mail.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n   \nA \nI\n      H \n \n  I A\n \nA\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\nWASHINGTON, FEBRUARY , .\nDEAR WILLIAM: \u2014 Your letter of the th ultimo was\nreceived last night, and for which I am much obliged. The\nonly thing in it that I wish to talk to you at once about is\nthat because of my vote for Ashmun\u2019s amendment you fear\nthat you and I disagree about the war. I regret this, not\nbecause of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you\nhave read this letter, but because if you misunderstand I\nfear other good friends may also. That vote a\ufb00irms that the\nwar was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced\nby the President; and I will stake my life that if you had\nbeen in my place you would have voted just as I did. Would\nyou have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie? I know\nyou would not. Would you have gone out of the House \u2014\nskulked the vote? I expect not. If you had skulked one vote,\nyou would have had to skulk many more before the end of\nthe session. Richardson\u2019s resolutions, introduced before I\nmade any move or gave any vote upon the subject, make\nthe direct question of the justice of the war; so that no man\ncan be silent if he would. You are compelled to speak; and\nyour only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie. I cannot\ndoubt which you would do.\n This vote has nothing to do in determining my votes on\nthe questions of supplies. I have always intended, and still\nintend, to vote supplies; perhaps not in the precise form\nrecommended by the President, but in a better form for all\npurposes, except Locofoco party purposes. It is in this\nparticular you seem mistaken. The Locos are untiring in\ntheir e\ufb00orts to make the impression that all who vote\nsupplies or take part in the war do of necessity approve the\nPresident\u2019s conduct in the beginning of it; but the Whigs\nhave from the beginning made and kept the distinction\nbetween the two. In the very \ufb01rst act nearly all the Whigs\nvoted against the preamble declaring that war existed by\nthe act of Mexico; and yet nearly all of them voted for the\nsupplies. As to the Whig men who have participated in the\nwar, so far as they have spoken in my hearing they do not\nhesitate to denounce as unjust the President\u2019s conduct in\nthe beginning of the war. They do not suppose that such\ndenunciation is directed by undying hatred to him, as The\nRegister would have it believed. There are two such Whigs\non this \ufb02oor (Colonel Haskell and Major James) The former\nfought as a colonel by the side of Colonel Baker at Cerro\nGordo, and stands side by side with me in the vote that you\nseem dissatis\ufb01ed with. The latter, the history of whose\ncapture with Cassius Clay you well know, had not arrived\nhere when that vote was given; but, as I understand, he\nstands ready to give just such a vote whenever an occasion\nshall present. Baker, too, who is now here, says the truth is\nundoubtedly that way; and whenever he shall speak out, he\nwill say so. Colonel Doniphan, too, the favorite Whig of\n Missouri, and who overran all Northern Mexico, on his\nreturn home in a public speech at St. Louis condemned the\nadministration in relation to the war. If I remember, G. T. M.\nDavis, who has been through almost the whole war,\ndeclares in favor of Mr. Clay; from which I infer that he\nadopts the sentiments of Mr. Clay, generally at least. On the\nother hand, I have heard of but one Whig who has been to\nthe war attempting to justify the President\u2019s conduct. That\none was Captain Bishop, editor of the Charleston Courier,\nand a very clever fellow. I do not mean this letter for the\npublic, but for you. Before it reaches you, you will have\nseen and read my pamphlet speech, and perhaps been\nscared anew by it. After you get over your scare, read it\nover again, sentence by sentence, and tell me honestly\nwhat you think of it. I condensed all I could for fear of\nbeing cut o\ufb00 by the hour rule, and when I got through I had\nspoken but forty-\ufb01ve minutes.\nYours forever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \nI  IA\n H. H  \n.\nWASHINGTON, February , \nDEAR WILLIAM: \u2014 I just take my pen to say that Mr.\nStephens, of Georgia, a little, slim, pale-faced, consumptive\nman, with a voice like Logan\u2019s, has just concluded the very\nbest speech of an hour\u2019s length I ever heard. My old\nwithered dry eyes are full of tears yet.\nIf he writes it out anything like he delivered it, our\npeople shall see a good many copies of it.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n   H  \n  I A\n \nA\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\nWASHINGTON, FEBRUARY , .\nDEAR WILLIAM: \u2014 Your letter of the th January was\nreceived last night. Being exclusively a constitutional\nargument, I wish to submit some re\ufb02ections upon it in the\nsame spirit of kindness that I know actuates you. Let me\n\ufb01rst state what I understand to be your position. It is that if\nit shall become necessary to repel invasion, the President\nmay, without violation of the Constitution, cross the line\nand invade the territory of another country, and that\nwhether such necessity exists in any given case the\nPresident is the sole judge.\nBefore going further consider well whether this is or is\nnot your position. If it is, it is a position that neither the\nPresident himself, nor any friend of his, so far as I know,\nhas ever taken. Their only positions are \u2014 \ufb01rst, that the soil\nwas ours when the hostilities commenced; and second, that\nwhether it was rightfully ours or not, Congress had\nannexed it, and the President for that reason was bound to\ndefend it; both of which are as clearly proved to be false in\nfact as you can prove that your house is mine. The soil was\nnot ours, and Congress did not annex or attempt to annex\nit. But to return to your position. Allow the President to\n invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it\nnecessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so\nwhenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for\nsuch purpose, and you allow him to make war at pleasure.\nStudy to see if you can \ufb01x any limit to his power in this\nrespect, after having given him so much as you propose. If\nto-day he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to\ninvade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how\ncould you stop him? You may say to him,\u2014 \u201cI see no\nprobability of the British invading us\u201d; but he will say to\nyou, \u201cBe silent: I see it, if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe provision of the Constitution giving the war making\npower to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the\nfollowing reasons: kings had always been involving and\nimpoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if\nnot always, that the good of the people was the object. This\nour convention understood to be the most oppressive of all\nkingly oppressions, and they resolved to so frame the\nConstitution that no one man should hold the power of\nbringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys\nthe whole matter, and places our President where kings\nhave always stood. Write soon again.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n    \n   I\n  H  H\n   \n         \n A I   \nMARCH , .\nMR. LINCOLN, FROM the Committee on the Posto\ufb00ice and\nPost Roads, made the following report:\nThe Committee on the Post-o\ufb00ice and Post Roads, to\nwhom was referred the resolution of the House of\nRepresentatives entitled \u201cAn Act authorizing postmasters at\ncounty seats of justice to receive subscriptions for\nnewspapers and periodicals, to be paid through the agency\nof the Post-o\ufb00ice Department, and for other purposes,\u201d beg\nleave to submit the following report:\nThe committee have reason to believe that a general\nwish pervades the community at large that some such\nfacility as the proposed measure should be granted by\nexpress law, for subscribing, through the agency of the\nPost-o\ufb00ice Department, to newspapers and periodicals\nwhich di\ufb00use daily, weekly, or monthly intelligence of\npassing events. Compliance with this general wish is\ndeemed \nto \nbe \nin \naccordance \nwith \nour \nrepublican\ninstitutions, which can be best sustained by the di\ufb00usion of\nknowledge and the due encouragement of a universal,\nnational spirit of inquiry and discussion of public events\nthrough the medium of the public press. The committee,\nhowever, has not been insensible to its duty of guarding the\n Post-o\ufb00ice Department against injurious sacri\ufb01ces for the\naccomplishment of this object, whereby its ordinary\ne\ufb00icacy might be impaired or embarrassed. It has therefore\nbeen a subject of much consideration; but it is now\ncon\ufb01dently \nhoped \nthat \nthe \nbill \nherewith \nsubmitted\ne\ufb00ectually obviates all objections which might exist with\nregard to a less matured proposition.\nThe committee learned, upon inquiry, that the Post-o\ufb00ice\nDepartment, in view of meeting the general wish on this\nsubject, made the experiment through one if its own\ninternal regulations, when the new postage system went\ninto operation on the \ufb01rst of July, , and that it was\ncontinued until the thirtieth of September, . But this\nexperiment, \nfor \nreasons \nhereafter \nstated, \nproved\nunsatisfactory, and it was discontinued by order of the\nPostmaster-General. As far as the committee can at present\nascertain, the following seem to have been the principal\ngrounds of dissatisfaction in this experiment:\n() The legal responsibility of postmasters receiving\nnewspaper subscriptions, or of their sureties, was not\nde\ufb01ned.\n() The authority was open to all postmasters instead of\nbeing limited to those of speci\ufb01c o\ufb00ices.\n() The consequence of this extension of authority was\nthat, in innumerable instances, the money, without the\nprevious knowledge or control of the o\ufb00icers of the\ndepartment who are responsible for the good management\nof its \ufb01nances, was deposited in o\ufb00ices where it was\nimproper such funds should be placed; and the repayment\n was ordered, not by the \ufb01nancial o\ufb00icers, but by the\npostmasters, at points where it was inconvenient to the\ndepartment so to disburse its funds.\n() The inconvenience of accumulating uncertain and\n\ufb02uctuating sums at small o\ufb00ices was felt seriously in\nconsequent overpayments to contractors on their quarterly\ncollecting orders; and, in case of private mail routes, in\nlitigation concerning the misapplication of such funds to\nthe special service of supplying mails.\n() The accumulation of such funds on draft o\ufb00ices could\nnot be known to the \ufb01nancial clerks of the department in\ntime to control it, and too often this rendered uncertain all\ntheir calculations of funds in hand.\n() The orders of payment were for the most part issued\nupon the principal o\ufb00ices, such as New York, Philadelphia,\nBoston, Baltimore, etc., where the large o\ufb00ices of\npublishers \nare \nlocated, \ncausing \nan \nillimitable \nand\nuncontrollable drain of the department funds from those\npoints where it was essential to husband them for its own\nregular disbursements. In Philadelphia alone this drain\naveraged   per quarter; and in other cities of the\nseaboard it was proportionate.\n() The embarrassment of the department was increased\nby \nthe \nillimitable, \nuncontrollable, \nand \nirresponsible\nscattering of its funds from concentrated points suitable for\nits distributions, to remote, unsafe, and inconvenient\no\ufb00ices, where they could not be again made available till\ncollected by special agents, or were transferred at\n considerable expense into the principal disbursing o\ufb00ices\nagain.\n() There was a vast increase of duties thrown upon the\nlimited force before necessary to conduct the business of\nthe department; and from the delay of obtaining vouchers\nimpediments arose to the speedy settlement of accounts\nwith \npresent \nor \nretired \npost-masters, \ncausing\npostponements which endangered the liability of sureties\nunder the act of limitations, and causing much danger of an\nincrease of such cases.\n() The most responsible postmasters (at the large\no\ufb00ices) were ordered by the least responsible (at small\no\ufb00ices) to make payments upon their vouchers, without\nhaving the means of ascertaining whether these vouchers\nwere genuine or forged, or if genuine, whether the signers\nwere in or out of o\ufb00ice, or solvent or defaulters.\n() The transaction of this business for subscribers and\npublishers at the public expense, an the embarrassment,\ninconvenience, and delay of the department\u2019s own business\noccasioned by it, were not justi\ufb01ed by any su\ufb00icient\nremuneration of revenue to sustain the department, as\nrequired in every other respect with regard to its agency.\nThe committee, in view of these objections, has been\nsolicitous to frame a bill which would not be obnoxious to\nthem in principle or in practical e\ufb00ect.\nIt is con\ufb01dently believed that by limiting the o\ufb00ices for\nreceiving subscriptions to less than one tenth of the\nnumber authorized by the experiment already tried, and\ndesignating the county seat in each county for the purpose,\n the control of the department will be rendered satisfactory;\nparticularly as it will be in the power of the Auditor, who is\nthe o\ufb00icer required by law to check the accounts, to\napprove or disapprove of the deposits, and to sanction not\nonly the payments, but to point out the place of payment. If\nthese payments should cause a drain on the principal\no\ufb00ices of the seaboard, it will be compensated by the\naccumulation of funds at county seats, where the\ncontractors on those routes can be paid to that extent by\nthe department\u2019s drafts, with more local convenience to\nthemselves than by drafts on the seaboard o\ufb00ices.\nThe legal responsibility for these deposits is de\ufb01ned, and\nthe accumulation of funds at the point of deposit, and the\nrepayment at points drawn upon, being known to and\ncontrolled by the Auditor, will not occasion any such\nembarrassments as were before felt; the record kept by the\nAuditor on the passing of the certi\ufb01cates through his hands\nwill enable him to settle accounts without the delay\noccasioned by vouchers being withheld; all doubt or\nuncertainty as to the genuineness of certi\ufb01cates, or the\npropriety of their issue, will be removed by the Auditor\u2019s\nexamination and approval; and there can be no risk of loss\nof funds by transmission, as the certi\ufb01cate will not be\npayable till sanctioned by the Auditor, and after his\nsanction the payor need not pay it unless it is presented by\nthe publisher or his known clerk or agent.\nThe main principle of equivalent for the agency of the\ndepartment is secured by the postage required to be paid\n upon the transmission of the certi\ufb01cates, augmenting\nadequately the post-o\ufb00ice revenue.\nThe committee, conceiving that in this report all the\ndi\ufb00iculties of the subject have been fully and fairly stated,\nand that these di\ufb00iculties have been obviated by the plan\nproposed in the accompanying bill, and believing that the\nmeasure will satisfactorily meet the wants and wishes of a\nvery large portion of the community, beg leave to\nrecommend its adoption.\n    \n   I\n  H  H\n   \n         \n A I   \nMARCH , .\nMR. LINCOLN, FROM the Committee on the Posto\ufb00ice and\nPost Roads, made the following report:\nThe Committee on the Post-o\ufb00ice and Post Roads, to\nwhom was referred the petition of H. M. Barney,\npostmaster at Brim\ufb01eld, Peoria County, Illinois, report: That\nthey have been satis\ufb01ed by evidence, that on the th of\nDecember, , said petitioner had his store, with some\n\ufb01fteen hundred dollars\u2019 worth of goods, together with all\nthe papers of the post-o\ufb00ice, entirely destroyed by \ufb01re; and\nthat the specie funds of the o\ufb00ice were melted down,\npartially lost and partially destroyed; that this large\nindividual loss entirely precludes the idea of embezzlement;\nthat the balances due the department of former quarters\nhad been only about twenty-\ufb01ve dollars; and that owing to\nthe destruction of papers, the exact amount due for the\nquarter ending December , , cannot be ascertained.\nThey therefore report a joint resolution, releasing said\npetitioner from paying anything for the quarter last\nmentioned.\n   \nA    I\n  H  \nI  \n   A    H\n   \n       \n A I     \nA  H         .\nTHE BILL FOR raising additional military force for limited\ntime, etc., was reported from Committee on judiciary;\nsimilar bills had been reported from Committee on, Public\nLands and Military Committee.\nMr. Lincoln said if there was a general desire on the part\nof the House to pass the bill now he should be glad to have\nit done \u2014 concurring, as he did generally, with the\ngentleman \nfrom \nArkansas \n[Mr. \nJohnson] \nthat \nthe\npostponement might jeopard the safety of the proposition.\nIf, however, a reference was to be made, he wished to make\na very few remarks in relation to the several subjects\ndesired by the gentlemen to be embraced in amendments\nto the ninth section of the act of the last session of\nCongress. The \ufb01rst amendment desired by members of this\nHouse had for its only object to give bounty lands to such\npersons as had served for a time as privates, but had never\nbeen discharged as such, because promoted to o\ufb00ice. That\nsubject, and no other, was embraced in this bill. There were\nsome others who desired, while they were legislating on\nthis subject, that they should also give bounty lands to the\nvolunteers of the War of . His friend from Maryland\nsaid there were no such men. He [Mr. L.] did not say there\nwere many, but he was very con\ufb01dent there were some. His\n friend from Kentucky near him, [Mr. Gaines] told him he\nhimself was one.\nThere was still another proposition touching this matter;\nthat was, that persons entitled to bounty lands should by\nlaw be entitled to locate these lands in parcels, and not be\nrequired to locate them in one body, as was provided by the\nexisting law.\nNow he had carefully drawn up a bill embracing these\nthree separate propositions, which he intended to propose\nas a substitute for all these bills in the House, or in\nCommittee of the Whole on the State of the Union, at some\nsuitable time. If there was a disposition on the part of the\nHouse to act at once on this separate proposition, he\nrepeated that, with the gentlemen from Arkansas, he\nshould prefer it lest they should lose all. But if there was to\nbe a reference, he desired to introduce his bill embracing\nthe three propositions, thus enabling the committee and\nthe House to act at the same time, whether favorably or\nunfavorably, upon all. He inquired whether an amendment\nwas now in order.\nThe Speaker replied in the negative.\n  \n A  HI A \n \nI  IA\n .\nWASHINGTON, April , .\nDEAR WILLIAMS: \u2014 I have not seen in the papers any\nevidence of a movement to send a delegate from your\ncircuit to the June convention. I wish to say that I think it\nall-important that a delegate should be sent. Mr. Clay\u2019s\nchance for an election is just no chance at all. He might get\nNew York, and that would have elected in , but it will\nnot now, because he must now, at the least, lose Tennessee,\nwhich he had then, and in addition the \ufb01fteen new votes of\nFlorida, Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin. I know our good friend\nBrowning is a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and I therefore\nfear he is favoring his nomination. If he is, ask him to\ndiscard feeling, and try if he can possibly, as a matter of\njudgment, count the votes necessary to elect him.\nIn my judgment we can elect nobody but General Taylor;\nand we cannot elect him without a nomination. Therefore\ndon\u2019t fail to send a delegate.\nYour friend as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n   \nA    I\n  H  H\n   \n         \n A I   \nMAY , .\nA BILL FOR the admission of Wisconsin into the Union had\nbeen passed.\nMr. Lincoln moved to reconsider the vote by which the\nbill was passed. He stated to the House that he had made\nthis motion for the purpose of obtaining an opportunity to\nsay a few words in relation to a point raised in the course of\nthe debate on this bill, which he would now proceed to\nmake if in order. The point in the case to which he referred\narose on the amendment that was submitted by the\ngentleman from Vermont [Mr. Collamer] in Committee of\nthe Whole on the State of the Union, and which was\nafterward renewed in the House, in relation to the question\nwhether the reserved sections, which, by some bills\nheretofore passed, by which an appropriation of land had\nbeen made to Wisconsin, had been enhanced in value,\nshould be reduced to the minimum price of the public\nlands. The question of the reduction in value of those\nsections was to him at this time a matter very nearly of\nindi\ufb00erence. He was inclined to desire that Wisconsin\nshould be obliged by having it reduced. But the gentleman\nfrom Indiana [Mr. C. B. Smith], the chairman of the\nCommittee \non \nTerritories, \nyesterday \nassociated \nthat\n question with the general question, which is now to some\nextent agitated in Congress, of making appropriations of\nalternate sections of land to aid the States in making\ninternal improvements, and enhancing the price of the\nsections reserved, and the gentleman from Indiana took\nground against that policy. He did not make any special\nargument in favor of Wisconsin, but he took ground\ngenerally against the policy of giving alternate sections of\nland, and enhancing the price of the reserved sections.\nNow he [Mr. Lincoln] did not at this time take the \ufb02oor for\nthe purpose of attempting to make an argument on the\ngeneral subject. He rose simply to protest against the\ndoctrine which the gentleman from Indiana had avowed in\nthe course of what he [Mr. Lincoln] could not but consider\nan unsound argument.\nIt might, however, be true, for anything he knew, that the\ngentleman from Indiana might convince him that his\nargument was sound; but he [Mr. Lincoln] feared that\ngentleman would not be able to convince a majority in\nCongress that it was sound. It was true the question\nappeared in a di\ufb00erent aspect to persons in consequence of\na di\ufb00erence in the point from which they looked at it. It did\nnot look to persons residing east of the mountains as it did\nto those who lived among the public lands. But, for his part,\nhe would state that if Congress would make a donation of\nalternate sections of public land for the purpose of internal\nimprovements in his State, and forbid the reserved sections\nbeing sold at  ., he should be glad to see the\nappropriation made; though he should prefer it if the\n reserved sections were not enhanced in price. He repeated,\nhe should be glad to have such appropriations made, even\nthough the reserved sections should be enhanced in price.\nHe did not wish to be understood as concurring in any\nintimation that they would refuse to receive such an\nappropriation of alternate sections of land because a\ncondition enhancing the price of the reserved sections\nshould be attached thereto. He believed his position would\nnow be understood: if not, he feared he should not be able\nto make himself understood.\nBut, before he took his seat, he would remark that the\nSenate during the present session had passed a bill making\nappropriations of land on that principle for the bene\ufb01t of\nthe State in which he resided the State of Illinois. The\nalternate sections were to be given for the purpose of\nconstructing roads, and the reserved sections were to be\nenhanced in value in consequence. When that bill came\nhere for the action of this House \u2014 it had been received,\nand was now before the Committee on Public Lands \u2014 he\ndesired much to see it passed as it was, if it could be put in\nno more favorable form for the State of Illinois. When it\nshould be before this House, if any member from a section\nof the Union in which these lands did not lie, whose interest\nmight be less than that which he felt, should propose a\nreduction of the price of the reserved sections to  ., he\nshould be much obliged; but he did not think it would be\nwell for those who came from the section of the Union in\nwhich the lands lay to do so. \u2014 He wished it, then, to be\nunderstood that he did not join in the warfare against the\n principle which had engaged the minds of some members\nof Congress who were favorable to the improvements in the\nwestern country. There was a good deal of force, he\nadmitted, in what fell from the chairman of the Committee\non Territories. It might be that there was no precise justice\nin raising the price of the reserved sections to  . per\nacre. It might be proper that the price should be enhanced\nto some extent, though not to double the usual price; but he\nshould be glad to have such an appropriation with the\nreserved sections at  .; he should be better pleased to\nhave the price of those sections at something less; and he\nshould be still better pleased to have them without any\nenhancement at all.\nThere was one portion of the argument of the gentleman\nfrom Indiana, the chairman of the Committee on Territories\n[Mr. Smith], which he wished to take occasion to say that\nhe did not view as unsound. He alluded to the statement\nthat the General Government was interested in these\ninternal improvements being made, inasmuch as they\nincreased the value of the lands that were unsold, and they\nenabled the government to sell the lands which could not\nbe sold without them. Thus, then, the government gained\nby internal improvements as well as by the general good\nwhich the people derived from them, and it might be,\ntherefore, that the lands should not be sold for more than\n . instead of the price being doubled. He, however,\nmerely mentioned this in passing, for he only rose to state,\nas the principle of giving these lands for the purposes\nwhich he had mentioned had been laid hold of and\n considered favorably, and as there were some gentlemen\nwho had constitutional scruples about giving money for\nthese purchases who would not hesitate to give land, that\nhe was not willing to have it understood that he was one of\nthose who made war against that principle. This was all he\ndesired to say, and having accomplished the object with\nwhich he rose, he withdrew his motion to reconsider.\n   A  \n    \nI\nA I\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\nWASHINGTON, APRIL ,.\nDEAR WASHBURNE: I have this moment received your\nvery short note asking me if old Taylor is to be used up, and\nwho will be the nominee. My hope of Taylor\u2019s nomination is\nas high \u2014 a little higher than it was when you left. Still, the\ncase is by no means out of doubt. Mr. Clay\u2019s letter has not\nadvanced his interests any here. Several who were against\nTaylor, but not for anybody particularly, before, are since\ntaking ground, some for Scott and some for McLean. Who\nwill be nominated neither I nor any one else can tell. Now,\nlet me pray to you in turn. My prayer is that you let nothing\ndiscourage or ba\ufb04e you, but that, in spite of every\ndi\ufb00iculty, you send us a good Taylor delegate from your\ncircuit. Make Baker, who is now with you, I suppose, help\nabout it. He is a good hand to raise a breeze.\nGeneral Ashley, in the Senate from Arkansas, died\nyesterday. Nothing else new beyond what you see in the\npapers.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN\n    \n   \n  \n  I A\n \nA   \n I I\nTO REV. J. M. PECK\nWASHINGTON, MAY , . DEAR SIR: ....Not in view\nof all the facts. There are facts which you have kept out of\nview. It is a fact that the United States army in marching to\nthe \nRio \nGrande \nmarched \ninto \na \npeaceful \nMexican\nsettlement, and frightened the inhabitants away from their\nhomes and their growing crops. It is a fact that Fort Brown,\nopposite Matamoras, was built by that army within a\nMexican cotton-\ufb01eld, on which at the time the army\nreached it a young cotton crop was growing, and which\ncrop was wholly destroyed and the \ufb01eld itself greatly and\npermanently injured by ditches, embankments, and the\nlike. It is a fact that when the Mexicans captured Captain\nThornton and his command, they found and captured them\nwithin another Mexican \ufb01eld.\nNow I wish to bring these facts to your notice, and to\nascertain what is the result of your re\ufb02ections upon them.\nIf you deny that they are facts, I think I can furnish proofs\nwhich shall convince you that you are mistaken. If you\nadmit that they are facts, then I shall be obliged for a\nreference to any law of language, law of States, law of\nnations, law of morals, law of religions, any law, human or\n divine, in which an authority can be found for saying those\nfacts constitute \u201cno aggression.\u201d\nPossibly you consider those acts too small for notice.\nWould you venture to so consider them had they been\ncommitted by any nation on earth against the humblest of\nour people? I know you would not. Then I ask, is the\nprecept \u201cWhatsoever ye would that men should do to you,\ndo ye even so to them\u201d obsolete? of no force? of no\napplication?\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n   A HA    A  \n  \nI\nA I\nTO ARCHIBALD WILLIAMS.\nWASHINGTON, JUNE , .\nDEAR WILLIAMS: \u2014 On my return from Philadelphia,\nwhere I had been attending the nomination of \u201cOld Rough,\u201d\n(Zachary Taylor) I found your letter in a mass of others\nwhich had accumulated in my absence. By many, and often,\nit had been said they would not abide the nomination of\nTaylor; but since the deed has been done, they are fast\nfalling in, and in my opinion we shall have a most\noverwhelming, glorious triumph. One unmistakable sign is\nthat all the odds and ends are with us \u2014 Barnburners,\nNative Americans, Tyler men, disappointed o\ufb00ice-seeking\nLocofocos, and the Lord knows what. This is important, if in\nnothing else, in showing which way the wind blows. Some\nof the sanguine men have set down all the States as certain\nfor Taylor but Illinois, and it as doubtful. Cannot something\nbe done even in Illinois? Taylor\u2019s nomination takes the\nLocos on the blind side. It turns the war thunder against\nthem. The war is now to them the gallows of Haman, which\nthey built for us, and on which they are doomed to be\nhanged themselves.\nExcuse this short letter. I have so many to write that I\ncannot devote much time to any one.\n Yours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n      H I\n  H  H\n   \n         \n A I   \nJUNE , .\nIN COMMITTEE OF the Whole on the State of the Union, on\nthe Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Bill:\nMr. CHAIRMAN: \u2014 I wish at all times in no way to\npractise any fraud upon the House or the committee, and I\nalso desire to do nothing which may be very disagreeable\nto any of the members. I therefore state in advance that my\nobject in taking the \ufb02oor is to make a speech on the general\nsubject of internal improvements; and if I am out of order\nin doing so, I give the chair an opportunity of so deciding,\nand I will take my seat.\nThe Chair: I will not undertake to anticipate what the\ngentleman \nmay \nsay \non \nthe \nsubject \nof \ninternal\nimprovements. He will, therefore, proceed in his remarks,\nand if any question of order shall be made, the chair will\nthen decide it.\nMr. Lincoln: At an early day of this session the President\nsent us what may properly be called an internal\nimprovement \nveto \nmessage. \nThe \nlate \nDemocratic\nconvention, which sat at Baltimore, and which nominated\nGeneral Cass for the Presidency, adopted a set of\nresolutions, now called the Democratic platform, among\nwhich is one in these words:\n \u201cThat the Constitution does not confer upon the General\nGovernment the power to commence and carry on a\ngeneral system of internal improvements.\u201d\nGeneral Cass, in his letter accepting the nomination,\nholds this language:\n\u201cI have carefully read the resolutions of the Democratic\nnational convention, laying down the platform of our\npolitical faith, and I adhere to them as \ufb01rmly as I approve\nthem cordially.\u201d\nThese things, taken together, show that the question of\ninternal improvements is now more distinctly made \u2014 has\nbecome more intense \u2014 than at any former period. The\nveto message and the Baltimore resolution I understand to\nbe, in substance, the same thing; the latter being the more\ngeneral statement, of which the former is the ampli\ufb01cation\nthe bill of particulars. While I know there are many\nDemocrats, on this \ufb02oor and elsewhere, who disapprove\nthat message, I understand that all who voted for General\nCass will thereafter be counted as having approved it, as\nhaving indorsed all its doctrines.\nI suppose all, or nearly all, the Democrats will vote for\nhim. Many of them will do so not because they like his\nposition on this question, but because they prefer him,\nbeing wrong on this, to another whom they consider farther\nwrong on other questions. In this way the internal\nimprovement Democrats are to be, by a sort of forced\nconsent, carried over and arrayed against themselves on\nthis measure of policy. General Cass, once elected, will not\ntrouble himself to make a constitutional argument, or\n perhaps any argument at all, when he shall veto a river or\nharbor bill; he will consider it a su\ufb00icient answer to all\nDemocratic murmurs to point to Mr. Polk\u2019s message, and to\nthe Democratic platform. This being the case, the question\nof improvements is verging to a \ufb01nal crisis; and the friends\nof this policy must now battle, and battle manfully, or\nsurrender all. In this view, humble as I am, I wish to review,\nand contest as well as I may, the general positions of this\nveto message. When I say general positions, I mean to\nexclude from consideration so much as relates to the\npresent embarrassed state of the treasury in consequence\nof the Mexican War.\nThose general positions are: that internal improvements\nought not to be made by the General Government \u2014 First.\nBecause they would overwhelm the treasury Second.\nBecause, while their burdens would be general, their\nbene\ufb01ts would be local and partial, involving an obnoxious\ninequality; \nand \nThird. \nBecause \nthey \nwould \nbe\nunconstitutional. Fourth. Because the States may do\nenough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties; or if\nnot \u2014 Fifth. That the Constitution may be amended. \u201cDo\nnothing at all, lest you do something wrong,\u201d is the sum of\nthese positions is the sum of this message. And this, with\nthe exception of what is said about constitutionality,\napplying as forcibly to what is said about making\nimprovements by State authority as by the national\nauthority; so that we must abandon the improvements of\nthe country altogether, by any and every authority, or we\n must resist and repudiate the doctrines of this message.\nLet us attempt the latter.\nThe \n\ufb01rst \nposition \nis, \nthat \na \nsystem \nof \ninternal\nimprovements would overwhelm the treasury. That in such\na system there is a tendency to undue expansion, is not to\nbe denied. Such tendency is founded in the nature of the\nsubject. A member of Congress will prefer voting for a bill\nwhich contains an appropriation for his district, to voting\nfor one which does not; and when a bill shall be expanded\ntill every district shall be provided for, that it will be too\ngreatly expanded is obvious. But is this any more true in\nCongress than in a State Legislature? If a member of\nCongress must have an appropriation for his district, so a\nmember of a Legislature must have one for his county. And\nif one will overwhelm the national treasury, so the other\nwill overwhelm the State treasury. Go where we will, the\ndi\ufb00iculty is the same. Allow it to drive us from the halls of\nCongress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from the State\nLegislatures. Let us, then, grapple with it, and test its\nstrength. Let us, judging of the future by the past, ascertain\nwhether there may not be, in the discretion of Congress, a\nsu\ufb00icient power to limit and restrain this expansive\ntendency within reasonable and proper bounds. The\nPresident himself values the evidence of the past. He tells\nus that at a certain point of our history more than two\nhundred millions of dollars had been applied for to make\nimprovements; and this he does to prove that the treasury\nwould be overwhelmed by such a system. Why did he not\ntell us how much was granted? Would not that have been\n better evidence? Let us turn to it, and see what it proves. In\nthe message the President tells us that \u201cduring the four\nsucceeding years embraced by the administration of\nPresident Adams, the power not only to appropriate money,\nbut to apply it, under the direction and authority of the\nGeneral Government, as well to the construction of roads\nas to the improvement of harbors and rivers, was fully\nasserted and exercised.\u201d This, then, was the period of\ngreatest enormity. These, if any, must have been the days of\nthe two hundred millions. And how much do you suppose\nwas really expended for improvements during that four\nyears? Two hundred millions? One hundred? Fifty? Ten?\nFive? No, sir; less than two millions. As shown by authentic\ndocuments, the expenditures on improvements during\n, , , and  amounted to one million eight\nhundred and seventy-nine thousand six hundred and\ntwenty-seven dollars and one cent. These four years were\nthe period of Mr. Adams\u2019s administration, nearly and\nsubstantially. This fact shows that when the power to make\nimprovements \u201cwas fully asserted and exercised,\u201d the\nCongress did keep within reasonable limits; and what has\nbeen done, it seems to me, can be done again.\nNow for the second portion of the message \u2014 namely,\nthat the burdens of improvements would be general, while\ntheir bene\ufb01ts would be local and partial, involving an\nobnoxious inequality. That there is some degree of truth in\nthis position, I shall not deny. No commercial object of\ngovernment patronage can be so exclusively general as to\nnot be of some peculiar local advantage. The navy, as I\n understand it, was established, and is maintained at a great\nannual expense, partly to be ready for war when war shall\ncome, and partly also, and perhaps chie\ufb02y, for the\nprotection of our commerce on the high seas. This latter\nobject is, for all I can see, in principle the same as internal\nimprovements. The driving a pirate from the track of\ncommerce on the broad ocean, and the removing of a snag\nfrom its more narrow path in the Mississippi River, cannot,\nI think, be distinguished in principle. Each is done to save\nlife and property, and for nothing else.\nThe navy, then, is the most general in its bene\ufb01ts of all\nthis class of objects; and yet even the navy is of some\npeculiar advantage to Charleston, Baltimore, Philadelphia,\nNew York, and Boston, beyond what it is to the interior\ntowns of Illinois. The next most general object I can think of\nwould be improvements on the Mississippi River and its\ntributaries. They touch thirteen of our States-Pennsylvania,\nVirginia, \nKentucky, \nTennessee, \nMississippi, \nLouisiana,\nArkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and\nIowa. Now I suppose it will not be denied that these\nthirteen States are a little more interested in improvements\non that great river than are the remaining seventeen. These\ninstances of the navy and the Mississippi River show clearly\nthat there is something of local advantage in the most\ngeneral objects. But the converse is also true. Nothing is so\nlocal as to not be of some general bene\ufb01t. Take, for\ninstance, the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Considered apart\nfrom its e\ufb00ects, it is perfectly local. Every inch of it is\nwithin the State of Illinois. That canal was \ufb01rst opened for\n business last April. In a very few days we were all grati\ufb01ed\nto learn, among other things, that sugar had been carried\nfrom New Orleans through this canal to Bu\ufb00alo in New\nYork. This sugar took this route, doubtless, because it was\ncheaper than the old route. Supposing bene\ufb01t of the\nreduction in the cost of carriage to be shared between\nseller and the buyer, result is that the New Orleans\nmerchant sold his sugar a little dearer, and the people of\nBu\ufb00alo sweetened their co\ufb00ee a little cheaper, than before,\n\u2014 a bene\ufb01t resulting from the canal, not to Illinois, where\nthe canal is, but to Louisiana and New York, where it is not.\nIn other transactions Illinois will, of course, have her share,\nand perhaps the larger share too, of the bene\ufb01ts of the\ncanal; but this instance of the sugar clearly shows that the\nbene\ufb01ts of an improvement are by no means con\ufb01ned to\nthe particular locality of the improvement itself. The just\nconclusion from all this is that if the nation refuse to make\nimprovements of the more general kind because their\nbene\ufb01ts may be somewhat local, a State may for the same\nreason refuse to make an improvement of a local kind\nbecause its bene\ufb01ts may be somewhat general. A State may\nwell say to the nation, \u201cIf you will do nothing for me, I will\ndo nothing for you.\u201d Thus it is seen that if this argument of\n\u201cinequality\u201d \nis \nsu\ufb00icient \nanywhere, \nit \nis \nsu\ufb00icient\neverywhere, and puts an end to improvements altogether. I\nhope and believe that if both the nation and the States\nwould, in good faith, in their respective spheres do what\nthey could in the way of improvements, what of inequality\nmight be produced in one place might be compensated in\n another, and the sum of the whole might not be very\nunequal.\nBut suppose, after all, there should be some degree of\ninequality. Inequality is certainly never to be embraced for\nits own sake; but is every good thing to be discarded which\nmay be inseparably connected with some degree of it? If so,\nwe must discard all government. This Capitol is built at the\npublic expense, for the public bene\ufb01t; but does any one\ndoubt that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the\nproperty-holders and business people of Washington? Shall\nwe remove it for this reason? And if so, where shall we set\nit down, and be free from the di\ufb00iculty? To make sure of\nour object, shall we locate it nowhere, and have Congress\nhereafter to hold its sessions, as the loafer lodged, \u201cin spots\nabout\u201d? I make no allusion to the present President when I\nsay there are few stronger cases in this world of \u201cburden to\nthe many and bene\ufb01t to the few,\u201d of \u201cinequality,\u201d than the\nPresidency itself is by some thought to be. An honest\nlaborer digs coal at about seventy cents a day, while the\nPresident digs abstractions at about seventy dollars a day.\nThe coal is clearly worth more than the abstractions, and\nyet what a monstrous inequality in the prices! Does the\nPresident, \nfor \nthis \nreason, \npropose \nto \nabolish \nthe\nPresidency? He does not, and he ought not. The true rule,\nin determining to embrace or reject anything, is not\nwhether it have any evil in it, but whether it have more of\nevil than of good. There are few things wholly evil or wholly\ngood. Almost everything, especially of government policy, is\nan inseparable compound of the two; so that our best\n judgment \nof \nthe \npreponderance \nbetween \nthem \nis\ncontinually demanded. On this principle the President, his\nfriends, and the world generally act on most subjects. Why\nnot apply it, then, upon this question? Why, as to\nimprovements, magnify the evil, and stoutly refuse to see\nany good in them?\nMr. Chairman, on the third position of the message the\nconstitutional question \u2014 I have not much to say. Being the\nman I am, and speaking, where I do, I feel that in any\nattempt at an original constitutional argument I should not\nbe and ought not to be listened to patiently. The ablest and\nthe best of men have gone over the whole ground long ago.\nI shall attempt but little more than a brief notice of what\nsome of them have said. In relation to Mr. Je\ufb00erson\u2019s views,\nI read from Mr. Polk\u2019s veto message:\n\u201cPresident Je\ufb00erson, in his message to Congress in ,\nrecommended an amendment of the Constitution, with a\nview to apply an anticipated surplus in the treasury \u2018to the\ngreat purposes of the public education, roads, rivers,\ncanals, and such other objects of public improvement as it\nmay be thought proper to add to the constitutional\nenumeration of the federal powers\u2019; and he adds: \u2018I suppose\nan amendment to the Constitution, by consent of the\nStates, necessary, because the objects now recommended\nare not among those enumerated in the Constitution, and to\nwhich it permits the public moneys to be applied.\u2019 In ,\nhe repeated in his published letters the opinion that no\nsuch power has been conferred upon Congress.\u201d\n I introduce this not to controvert just now the\nconstitutional opinion, but to show that, on the question of\nexpediency, Mr. Je\ufb00erson\u2019s opinion was against the present\nPresident; that this opinion of Mr. Je\ufb00erson, in one branch\nat least, is in the hands of Mr. Polk like McFingal\u2019s gun\u2014\n\u201cbears wide and kicks the owner over.\u201d\nBut to the constitutional question. In  Chancellor\nKent \ufb01rst published his Commentaries on American law. He\ndevoted a portion of one of the lectures to the question of\nthe authority of Congress to appropriate public moneys for\ninternal improvements. He mentions that the subject had\nnever been brought under judicial consideration, and\nproceeds to give a brief summary of the discussion it had\nundergone between the legislative and executive branches\nof the government. He shows that the legislative branch\nhad usually been for, and the executive against, the power,\ntill the period of Mr. J.Q. Adams\u2019s administration, at which\npoint he considers the executive in\ufb02uence as withdrawn\nfrom opposition, and added to the support of the power. In\n the chancellor published a new edition of his\nCommentaries, in which he adds some notes of what had\ntranspired on the question since . I have not time to\nread the original text on the notes; but the whole may be\nfound on page , and the two or three following pages, of\nthe \ufb01rst volume of the edition of . As to what\nChancellor Kent seems to consider the sum of the whole, I\nread from one of the notes:\n\u201cMr. \nJustice \nStory, \nin \nhis \nCommentaries \non \nthe\nConstitution of the United States, Vol. II., p-, and again\n p-, has stated at large the arguments for and against\nthe proposition that Congress have a constitutional\nauthority to lay taxes and to apply the power to regulate\ncommerce as a means directly to encourage and protect\ndomestic manufactures; and without giving any opinion of\nhis own on the contested doctrine, he has left the reader to\ndraw his own conclusions. I should think, however, from the\narguments as stated, that every mind which has taken no\npart in the discussion, and felt no prejudice or territorial\nbias on either side of the question, would deem the\narguments in favor of the Congressional power vastly\nsuperior.\u201d\nIt will be seen that in this extract the power to make\nimprovements is not directly mentioned; but by examining\nthe context, both of Kent and Story, it will be seen that the\npower mentioned in the extract and the power to make\nimprovements are regarded as identical. It is not to be\ndenied that many great and good men have been against\nthe power; but it is insisted that quite as many, as great and\nas good, have been for it; and it is shown that, on a full\nsurvey of the whole, Chancellor Kent was of opinion that\nthe arguments of the latter were vastly superior. This is but\nthe opinion of a man; but who was that man? He was one of\nthe ablest and most learned lawyers of his age, or of any\nage. It is no disparagement to Mr. Polk, nor indeed to any\none who devotes much time to politics, to be placed far\nbehind Chancellor Kent as a lawyer. His attitude was most\nfavorable to correct conclusions. He wrote coolly, and in\nretirement. He was struggling to rear a durable monument\n of fame; and he well knew that truth and thoroughly sound\nreasoning were the only sure foundations. Can the party\nopinion of a party President on a law question, as this\npurely is, be at all compared or set in opposition to that of\nsuch a man, in such an attitude, as Chancellor Kent? This\nconstitutional question will probably never be better settled\nthan it is, until it shall pass under judicial consideration;\nbut I do think no man who is clear on the questions of\nexpediency need feel his conscience much pricked upon\nthis.\nMr. Chairman, the President seems to think that enough\nmay be done, in the way of improvements, by means of\ntonnage duties under State authority, with the consent of\nthe General Government. Now I suppose this matter of\ntonnage duties is well enough in its own sphere. I suppose\nit may be e\ufb00icient, and perhaps su\ufb00icient, to make slight\nimprovements and repairs in harbors already in use and not\nmuch out of repair. But if I have any correct general idea of\nit, it must be wholly ine\ufb00icient for any general bene\ufb01cent\npurposes of improvement. I know very little, or rather\nnothing at all, of the practical matter of levying and\ncollecting tonnage duties; but I suppose one of its\nprinciples must be to lay a duty for the improvement of any\nparticular harbor upon the tonnage coming into that\nharbor; to do otherwise \u2014 to collect money in one harbor,\nto be expended on improvements in another \u2014 would be an\nextremely aggravated form of that inequality which the\nPresident so much deprecates. If I be right in this, how\ncould we make any entirely new improvement by means of\n tonnage duties? How make a road, a canal, or clear a\ngreatly obstructed river? The idea that we could involves\nthe same absurdity as the Irish bull about the new boots. \u201cI\nshall niver git \u2019em on,\u201d says Patrick, \u201ctill I wear \u2019em a day\nor two, and stretch \u2019em a little.\u201d We shall never make a\ncanal by tonnage duties until it shall already have been\nmade awhile, so the tonnage can get into it.\nAfter all, the President concludes that possibly there may\nbe some great objects of improvement which cannot be\ne\ufb00ected by tonnage duties, and which it therefore may be\nexpedient for the General Government to take in hand.\nAccordingly he suggests, in case any such be discovered,\nthe propriety of amending the Constitution. Amend it for\nwhat? If, like Mr. Je\ufb00erson, the President thought\nimprovements expedient, but not constitutional, it would be\nnatural enough for him to recommend such an amendment.\nBut hear what he says in this very message:\n\u201cIn view of these portentous consequences, I cannot but\nthink that this course of legislation should be arrested,\neven were there nothing to forbid it in the fundamental\nlaws of our Union.\u201d\nFor what, then, would he have the Constitution\namended? With him it is a proposition to remove one\nimpediment merely to be met by others which, in his\nopinion, cannot be removed, to enable Congress to do\nwhat, in his opinion, they ought not to do if they could.\nHere Mr. Meade of Virginia inquired if Mr. Lincoln\nunderstood the President to be opposed, on grounds of\nexpediency, to any and every improvement.\n Mr. Lincoln answered: In the very part of his message of\nwhich I am speaking, I understand him as giving some\nvague expression in favor of some possible objects of\nimprovement; but in doing so I understand him to be\ndirectly on the teeth of his own arguments in other parts of\nit. Neither the President nor any one can possibly specify\nan improvement which shall not be clearly liable to one or\nanother of the objections he has urged on the score of\nexpediency. I have shown, and might show again, that no\nwork \u2014 no object \u2014 can be so general as to dispense its\nbene\ufb01ts with precise equality; and this inequality is chief\namong the \u201cportentous consequences\u201d for which he\ndeclares that improvements should be arrested. No, sir.\nWhen the President intimates that something in the way of\nimprovements may properly be done by the General\nGovernment, he is shrinking from the conclusions to which\nhis own arguments would force him. He feels that the\nimprovements of this broad and goodly land are a mighty\ninterest; and he is unwilling to confess to the people, or\nperhaps to himself, that he has built an argument which,\nwhen pressed to its conclusions, entirely annihilates this\ninterest.\nI have already said that no one who is satis\ufb01ed of the\nexpediency of making improvements needs be much uneasy\nin his conscience about its constitutionality. I wish now to\nsubmit a few remarks on the general proposition of\namending the Constitution. As a general rule, I think we\nwould much better let it alone. No slight occasion should\ntempt us to touch it. Better not take the \ufb01rst step, which\n may lead to a habit of altering it. Better, rather, habituate\nourselves to think of it as unalterable. It can scarcely be\nmade better than it is. New provisions would introduce new\ndi\ufb00iculties, and thus create and increase appetite for\nfurther change. No, sir; let it stand as it is. New hands have\nnever touched it. The men who made it have done their\nwork, and have passed away. Who shall improve on what\nthey did?\nMr. Chairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message\nin the least possible time, as well as for the sake of\ndistinctness, I have analyzed its arguments as well as I\ncould, and reduced them to the propositions I have stated. I\nhave now examined them in detail. I wish to detain the\ncommittee only a little while longer with some general\nremarks upon the subject of improvements. That the\nsubject is a di\ufb00icult one, cannot be denied. Still it is no\nmore di\ufb00icult in Congress than in the State Legislatures, in\nthe counties, or in the smallest municipal districts which\nanywhere exist. All can recur to instances of this di\ufb00iculty\nin the case of county roads, bridges, and the like. One man\nis o\ufb00ended because a road passes over his land, and\nanother is o\ufb00ended because it does not pass over his; one is\ndissatis\ufb01ed because the bridge for which he is taxed\ncrosses the river on a di\ufb00erent road from that which leads\nfrom his house to town; another cannot bear that the\ncounty should be got in debt for these same roads and\nbridges; while not a few struggle hard to have roads\nlocated over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let them\nbe opened until they are \ufb01rst paid the damages. Even\n between the di\ufb00erent wards and streets of towns and cities\nwe \ufb01nd this same wrangling and di\ufb00iculty. Now these are\nno other than the very di\ufb00iculties against which, and out of\nwhich, \nthe \nPresident \nconstructs \nhis \nobjections \nof\n\u201cinequality,\u201d \u201cspeculation,\u201d and \u201ccrushing the treasury.\u201d\nThere is but a single alternative about them: they are\nsu\ufb00icient, or they are not. If su\ufb00icient, they are su\ufb00icient\nout of Congress as well as in it, and there is the end. We\nmust reject them as insu\ufb00icient, or lie down and do nothing\nby any authority. Then, di\ufb00iculty though there be, let us\nmeet and encounter it. \u201cAttempt the end, and never stand\nto doubt; nothing so hard, but search will \ufb01nd it out.\u201d\nDetermine that the thing can and shall be done, and then\nwe shall \ufb01nd the way. The tendency to undue expansion is\nunquestionably the chief di\ufb00iculty.\nHow to do something, and still not do too much, is the\ndesideratum. Let each contribute his mite in the way of\nsuggestion. The late Silas Wright, in a letter to the Chicago\nconvention, contributed his, which was worth something;\nand I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing. At\nall events, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no\nharm. I would not borrow money. I am against an\noverwhelming, crushing system. Suppose that, at each\nsession, Congress shall \ufb01rst determine how much money\ncan, for that year, be spared for improvements; then\napportion that sum to the most important objects. So far all\nis easy; but how shall we determine which are the most\nimportant? On this question comes the collision of\ninterests. I shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor\n or your river is more important than mine, and vice versa.\nTo clear this di\ufb00iculty, let us have that same statistical\ninformation which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Vinton]\nsuggested at the beginning of this session. In that\ninformation we shall have a stern, unbending basis of facts\n\u2014 a basis in no wise subject to whim, caprice, or local\ninterest. The prelimited amount of means will save us from\ndoing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing\nwhat we do in wrong places. Adopt and adhere to this\ncourse, and, it seems to me, the di\ufb00iculty is cleared.\nOne of the gentlemen from South Carolina [Mr. Rhett]\nvery much deprecates these statistics. He particularly\nobjects, as I understand him, to counting all the pigs and\nchickens in the land. I do not perceive much force in the\nobjection. It is true that if everything be enumerated, a\nportion of such statistics may not be very useful to this\nobject. Such products of the country as are to be consumed\nwhere they are produced need no roads or rivers, no means\nof transportation, and have no very proper connection with\nthis subject. The surplus \u2014 that which is produced in one\nplace to be consumed in another; the capacity of each\nlocality for producing a greater surplus; the natural means\nof transportation, and their susceptibility of improvement;\nthe hindrances, delays, and losses of life and property\nduring transportation, and the causes of each, would be\namong the most valuable statistics in this connection. From\nthese it would readily appear where a given amount of\nexpenditure would do the most good. These statistics might\nbe equally accessible, as they would be equally useful, to\n both the nation and the States. In this way, and by these\nmeans, let the nation take hold of the larger works, and the\nStates the smaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting\ndirection, discreetly, but steadily and \ufb01rmly, what is made\nunequal in one place may be equalized in another,\nextravagance avoided, and the whole country put on that\ncareer of prosperity which shall correspond with its extent\nof territory, its natural resources, and the intelligence and\nenterprise of its people.\n   \n  \nI I    \n   \n  \n I I IA\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\nWASHINGTON, JUNE , .\nDEAR WILLIAM: \u2014 Last night I was attending a sort of\ncaucus of the Whig members, held in relation to the coming\nPresidential election. The whole \ufb01eld of the nation was\nscanned, and all is high hope and con\ufb01dence. Illinois is\nexpected to better her condition in this race. Under these\ncircumstances, judge how heartrending it was to come to\nmy room and \ufb01nd and read your discouraging letter of the\nth. We have made no gains, but have lost \u201cH. R.\nRobinson, Turner, Campbell, and four or \ufb01ve more.\u201d Tell\nArney to reconsider, if he would be saved. Baker and I used\nto do something, but I think you attach more importance to\nour absence than is just. There is another cause. In ,\nfor instance, we had two senators and \ufb01ve representatives\nin Sangamon; now we have part of one senator and two\nrepresentatives. With quite one third more people than we\nhad then, we have only half the sort of o\ufb00ices which are\nsought by men of the speaking sort of talent. This, I think,\nis the chief cause. Now, as to the young men. You must not\nwait to be brought forward by the older men. For instance,\ndo you suppose that I should ever have got into notice if I\nhad waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older\n men? You young men get together and form a \u201cRough and\nReady Club,\u201d and have regular meetings and speeches.\nTake in everybody you can get. Harrison Grimsley, L. A.\nEnos, Lee Kimball, and C. W. Matheny will do to begin the\nthing; but as you go along gather up all the shrewd, wild\nboys about town, whether just of age, or a little under age,\nChris. Logan, Reddick Ridgely, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds\nsuch. Let every one play the part he can play best, \u2014 some\nspeak, some sing, and all \u201choller.\u201d Your meetings will be of\nevenings; the older men, and the women, will go to hear\nyou; so that it will not only contribute to the election of\n\u201cOld Zach,\u201d but will be an interesting pastime, and\nimproving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged. Don\u2019t\nfail to do this.\nYou ask me to send you all the speeches made about \u201cOld\nZach,\u201d the war, etc. Now this makes me a little impatient. I\nhave regularly sent you the Congressional Globe and\nAppendix, and you cannot have examined them, or you\nwould have discovered that they contain every speech\nmade by every man in both houses of Congress, on every\nsubject, during the session. Can I send any more? Can I\nsend speeches that nobody has made? Thinking it would be\nmost natural that the newspapers would feel interested to\ngive at least some of the speeches to their readers, I at the\nbeginning of the session made arrangements to have one\ncopy of the Globe and Appendix regularly sent to each\nWhig paper of the district. And yet, with the exception of\nmy own little speech, which was published in two only of\nthe then \ufb01ve, now four, Whig papers, I do not remember\n having seen a single speech, or even extract from one, in\nany single one of those papers. With equal and full means\non both sides, I will venture that the State Register has\nthrown before its readers more of Locofoco speeches in a\nmonth than all the Whig papers of the district have done of\nWhig speeches during the session.\nIf you wish a full understanding of the war, I repeat what\nI believe I said to you in a letter once before, that the\nwhole, or nearly so, is to be found in the speech of Dixon of\nConnecticut. This I sent you in pamphlet as well as in the\nGlobe. Examine and study every sentence of that speech\nthoroughly, and you will understand the whole subject. You\nask how Congress came to declare that war had existed by\nthe act of Mexico. Is it possible you don\u2019t understand that\nyet? You have at least twenty speeches in your possession\nthat fully explain it. I will, however, try it once more. The\nnews reached Washington of the commencement of\nhostilities on the Rio Grande, and of the great peril of\nGeneral Taylor\u2019s army. Everybody, Whigs and Democrats,\nwas for sending them aid, in men and money. It was\nnecessary to pass a bill for this. The Locos had a majority in\nboth houses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble\nsaying: Whereas, War exists by the act of Mexico, therefore\nwe send General Taylor money. The Whigs moved to strike\nout the preamble, so that they could vote to send the men\nand money, without saying anything about how the war\ncommenced; but being in the minority, they were voted\ndown, and the preamble was retained. Then, on the\npassage of the bill, the question came upon them, Shall we\n vote for preamble and bill together, or against both\ntogether? They did not want to vote against sending help to\nGeneral Taylor, and therefore they voted for both together.\nIs there any di\ufb00iculty in understanding this? Even my little\nspeech shows how this was; and if you will go to the library,\nyou may get the Journal of -, in which you will \ufb01nd\nthe whole for yourself.\nWe have nothing published yet with special reference to\nthe Taylor race; but we soon will have, and then I will send\nthem to everybody. I made an internal-improvement speech\nday before yesterday, which I shall send home as soon as I\ncan get it written out and printed, \u2014 and which I suppose\nnobody will read.\nYour friend as ever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  A A   \n   \n  I\n \n     \n  I \nI\nIA\nREMARKS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JUNE\n, .\nDISCUSSION AS TO salary of judge of western Virginia: \u2014\nWishing to increase it from   to  .\nMr. Lincoln said he felt unwilling to be either unjust or\nungenerous, and he wanted to understand the real case of\nthis judicial o\ufb00icer. The gentleman from Virginia had stated\nthat he had to hold eleven courts. Now everybody knew\nthat it was not the habit of the district judges of the United\nStates in other States to hold anything like that number of\ncourts; and he therefore took it for granted that this must\nhappen under a peculiar law which required that large\nnumber of courts to be holden every year; and these laws,\nhe further supposed, were passed at the request of the\npeople of that judicial district. It came, then, to this: that\nthe people in the western district of Virginia had got eleven\ncourts to be held among them in one year, for their own\naccommodation; and being thus better accommodated than\nneighbors elsewhere, they wanted their judge to be a little\nbetter paid. In Illinois there had been until the present\nseason but one district court held in the year. There were\nnow to be two. Could it be that the western district of\n Virginia furnished more business for a judge than the whole\nState of Illinois?\n A I\nA   A\nJULY, , \n[FRAGMENT]\nThe question of a national bank is at rest. Were I\nPresident, I should not urge its reagitation upon Congress;\nbut should Congress see \ufb01t to pass an act to establish such\nan institution, I should not arrest it by the veto, unless I\nshould consider it subject to some constitutional objection\nfrom which I believe the two former banks to have been\nfree.\n  \n  .s. \n \n \n  \n I I A    A \n \nTO W. H. HERNDON.\nWASHINGTON, JULY , .\nDEAR WILLIAM: Your letter covering the newspaper\nslips was received last night. The subject of that letter is\nexceedingly painful to me, and I cannot but think there is\nsome mistake in your impression of the motives of the old\nmen. I suppose I am now one of the old men; and I declare\non my veracity, which I think is good with you, that nothing\ncould a\ufb00ord me more satisfaction than to learn that you\nand others of my young friends at home were doing battle\nin the contest and endearing themselves to the people and\ntaking a stand far above any I have ever been able to reach\nin their admiration. I cannot conceive that other men feel\ndi\ufb00erently. Of course I cannot demonstrate what I say; but I\nwas young once, and I am sure I was never ungenerously\nthrust back. I hardly know what to say. The way for a young\nman to rise is to improve himself every way he can, never\nsuspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to\nassure you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any\nman in any situation. There may sometimes be ungenerous\nattempts to keep a young man down; and they will succeed,\ntoo, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true\nchannel to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about and\n see if this feeling has not injured every person you have\never known to fall into it.\nNow, in what I have said I am sure you will suspect\nnothing but sincere friendship. I would save you from a\nfatal error. You have been a studious young man. You are\nfar better informed on almost all subjects than I ever have\nbeen. You cannot fail in any laudable object unless you\nallow your mind to be improperly directed. I have some the\nadvantage of you in the world\u2019s experience, merely by\nbeing older; and it is this that induces me to advise. You\nstill seem to be a little mistaken about the Congressional\nGlobe and Appendix. They contain all of the speeches that\nare published in any way. My speech and Dayton\u2019s speech\nwhich you say you got in pamphlet form are both word for\nword in the Appendix. I repeat again, all are there.\nYour friend, as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  A   A  \n  A\n  H     \nSPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JULY ,\n.\nMR. SPEAKER, OUR Democratic friends seem to be in a\ngreat distress because they think our candidate for the\nPresidency don\u2019t suit us. Most of them cannot \ufb01nd out that\nGeneral Taylor has any principles at all; some, however,\nhave discovered that he has one, but that one is entirely\nwrong. This one principle is his position on the veto power.\nThe gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Stanton] who has just\ntaken his seat, indeed, has said there is very little, if any,\ndi\ufb00erence on this question between General Taylor and all\nthe Presidents; and he seems to think it su\ufb00icient\ndetraction from General Taylor\u2019s position on it that it has\nnothing new in it. But all others whom I have heard speak\nassail it furiously. A new member from Kentucky [Mr.\nClark], of very considerable ability, was in particular\nconcerned about it. He thought it altogether novel and\nunprecedented for a President or a Presidential candidate\nto think of approving bills whose constitutionality may not\nbe entirely clear to his own mind. He thinks the ark of our\nsafety is gone unless Presidents shall always veto such bills\nas in their judgment may be of doubtful constitutionality.\nHowever clear Congress may be on their authority to pass\n any particular act, the gentleman from Kentucky thinks the\nPresident must veto it if he has doubts about it. Now I have\nneither time nor inclination to argue with the gentleman on\nthe veto power as an original question; but I wish to show\nthat General Taylor, and not he, agrees with the earlier\nstatesmen on this question. When the bill chartering the\n\ufb01rst Bank of the United States passed Congress, its\nconstitutionality was questioned. Mr. Madison, then in the\nHouse of Representatives, as well as others, had opposed it\non that ground. General Washington, as President, was\ncalled on to approve or reject it. He sought and obtained on\nthe constitutionality question the separate written opinions\nof Je\ufb00erson, Hamilton, and Edmund Randolph, \u2014 they then\nbeing respectively Secretary of State, Secretary of the\nTreasury, and Attorney general. Hamilton\u2019s opinion was for\nthe power; while Randolph\u2019s and Je\ufb00erson\u2019s were both\nagainst it. Mr. Je\ufb00erson, after giving his opinion deciding\nonly against the constitutionality of the bill, closes his letter\nwith the paragraph which I now read:\n\u201cIt \nmust \nbe \nadmitted, \nhowever, \nthat \nunless \nthe\nPresident\u2019s mind, on a view of everything which is urged\nfor and against this bill, is tolerably clear that it is\nunauthorized by the Constitution, \u2014 if the pro and con\nhang so even as to balance his judgment, a just respect for\nthe wisdom of the legislature would naturally decide the\nbalance in favor of their opinion. It is chie\ufb02y for cases\nwhere they are clearly misled by error, ambition, or\ninterest, that the Constitution has placed a check in the\nnegative of the President.\n \u201cTHOMAS JEFFERSON.\n\u201cFebruary , .\u201d\nGeneral Taylor\u2019s opinion, as expressed in his Allison\nletter, is as I now read:\n\u201cThe power given by the veto is a high conservative\npower; but, in my opinion, should never be exercised\nexcept in cases of clear violation of the Constitution, or\nmanifest haste and want of consideration by Congress.\u201d\nIt is here seen that, in Mr. Je\ufb00erson\u2019s opinion, if on the\nconstitutionality of any given bill the President doubts, he\nis not to veto it, as the gentleman from Kentucky would\nhave him do, but is to defer to Congress and approve it.\nAnd if we compare the opinion of Je\ufb00erson and Taylor, as\nexpressed in these paragraphs, we shall \ufb01nd them more\nexactly alike than we can often \ufb01nd any two expressions\nhaving \nany \nliteral \ndi\ufb00erence. \nNone \nbut \ninterested\nfault\ufb01nders, I think, can discover any substantial variation.\nBut gentlemen on the other side are unanimously agreed\nthat General Taylor has no other principles. They are in\nutter darkness as to his opinions on any of the questions of\npolicy which occupy the public attention. But is there any\ndoubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if\nelected? Not the least. It is not possible to know what he\nwill or would do in every imaginable case, because many\nquestions have passed away, and others doubtless will arise\nwhich none of us have yet thought of; but on the prominent\nquestions of currency, tari\ufb00, internal improvements, and\nWilmot Proviso, General Taylor\u2019s course is at least as well\nde\ufb01ned as is General Cass\u2019s. Why, in their eagerness to get\n at General Taylor, several Democratic members here have\ndesired to know whether, in case of his election, a bankrupt\nlaw is to be established. Can they tell us General Cass\u2019s\nopinion on this question?\n[Some member answered, \u201cHe is against it.\u201d]\nAye, how do you know he is? There is nothing about it in\nthe platform, nor elsewhere, that I have seen. If the\ngentleman knows of anything which I do not know he can\nshow it. But to return. General Taylor, in his Allison letter,\nsays:\n\u201cUpon the subject of the tari\ufb00, the currency, the\nimprovement of our great highways, rivers, lakes, and\nharbors, the will of the people, as expressed through their\nrepresentatives in Congress, ought to be respected and\ncarried out by the executive.\u201d\nNow this is the whole matter. In substance, it is this: The\npeople say to General Taylor, \u201cIf you are elected, shall we\nhave a national bank?\u201d He answers, \u201cYour will, gentlemen,\nnot mine.\u201d \u201cWhat about the tari\ufb00?\u201d \u201cSay yourselves.\u201d \u201cShall\nour rivers and harbors be improved?\u201d \u201cJust as you please. If\nyou desire a bank, an alteration of the tari\ufb00, internal\nimprovements, any or all, I will not hinder you. If you do\nnot desire them, I will not attempt to force them on you.\nSend up your members of Congress from the various\ndistricts, with opinions according to your own, and if they\nare for these measures, or any of them, I shall have nothing\nto oppose; if they are not for them, I shall not, by any\nappliances whatever, attempt to dragoon them into their\nadoption.\u201d\n Now can there be any di\ufb00iculty in understanding this? To\nyou Democrats it may not seem like principle; but surely\nyou cannot fail to perceive the position plainly enough. The\ndistinction between it and the position of your candidate is\nbroad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to\nshow it is wrong if you can; but you have no right to\npretend you cannot see it at all. We see it, and to us it\nappears like principle, and the best sort of principle at that\n\u2014 the principle of allowing the people to do as they please\nwith their own business. My friend from Indiana (C. B.\nSmith) has aptly asked, \u201cAre you willing to trust the\npeople?\u201d Some of you answered substantially, \u201cWe are\nwilling to trust the people; but the President is as much the\nrepresentative of the people as Congress.\u201d In a certain\nsense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of\nthe people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is;\nbut can he, in the nature of things know the wants of the\npeople as well as three hundred other men, coming from all\nthe various localities of the nation? If so, where is the\npropriety of having a Congress? That the Constitution gives\nthe President a negative on legislation, all know; but that\nthis negative should be so combined with platforms and\nother appliances as to enable him, and in fact almost\ncompel him, to take the whole of legislation into his own\nhands, is what we object to, is what General Taylor objects\nto, and is what constitutes the broad distinction between\nyou and us. To thus transfer legislation is clearly to take it\nfrom those who understand with minuteness the interests\nof the people, and give it to one who does not and cannot so\n well understand it. I understand your idea that if a\nPresidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given\nquestion, or rather upon all questions, and the people, with\nfull knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly\napprove all those opinions. By means of it, measures are\nadopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of\none party, and often nearly half of the other. Three, four, or\nhalf a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the\nparty selects its candidate, and he takes his position on\neach of these questions. On all but one his positions have\nalready been indorsed at former elections, and his party\nfully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large\nportion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The\nwhole was strung together; and they must take all, or reject\nall. They cannot take what they like, and leave the rest.\nWhat they are already committed to being the majority,\nthey shut their eyes, and gulp the whole. Next election, still\nanother is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes\nalong the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not\nquite all the articles of the present Democratic creed have\nbeen at \ufb01rst forced upon the party in this very way. And just\nnow, and just so, opposition to internal improvements is to\nbe established if General Cass shall be elected. Almost half\nthe Democrats here are for improvements; but they will\nvote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided\nin closing the doors against improvements. Now this is a\nprocess which we think is wrong. We prefer a candidate\nwho, like General Taylor, will allow the people to have their\nown way, regardless of his private opinions; and I should\n think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought\nto prefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them\nwhich they don\u2019t want, and he would allow them to have\nimprovements which their own candidate, if elected, will\nnot.\nMr. Speaker, I have said General Taylor\u2019s position is as\nwell de\ufb01ned as is that of General Cass. In saying this, I\nadmit I do not certainly know what he would do on the\nWilmot Proviso. I am a Northern man or rather a Western\nFree-State man, with a constituency I believe to be, and\nwith personal feelings I know to be, against the extension\nof slavery. As such, and with what information I have, I\nhope and believe General Taylor, if elected, would not veto\nthe proviso. But I do not know it. Yet if I knew he would, I\nstill would vote for him. I should do so because, in my\njudgment, his election alone can defeat General Cass; and\nbecause, should slavery thereby go to the territory we now\nhave, just so much will certainly happen by the election of\nCass, and in addition a course of policy leading to new\nwars, new acquisitions of territory and still further\nextensions of slavery. One of the two is to be President.\nWhich is preferable?\nBut there is as much doubt of Cass on improvements as\nthere is of Taylor on the proviso. I have no doubt myself of\nGeneral Cass on this question; but I know the Democrats\ndi\ufb00er among themselves as to his position. My internal-\nimprovement colleague [Mr. Wentworth] stated on this \ufb02oor\nthe other day that he was satis\ufb01ed Cass was for\nimprovements, because he had voted for all the bills that he\n [Mr. Wentworth] had. So far so good. But Mr. Polk vetoed\nsome of these very bills. The Baltimore convention passed a\nset of resolutions, among other things, approving these\nvetoes, and General Cass declares, in his letter accepting\nthe \nnomination, \nthat \nhe \nhas \ncarefully \nread \nthese\nresolutions, and that he adheres to them as \ufb01rmly as he\napproves them cordially. In other words, General Cass\nvoted for the bills, and thinks the President did right to\nveto them; and his friends here are amiable enough to\nconsider him as being on one side or the other, just as one\nor the other may correspond with their own respective\ninclinations. My colleague admits that the platform\ndeclares against the constitutionality of a general system of\nimprovements, \nand \nthat \nGeneral \nCass \nindorses \nthe\nplatform; but he still thinks General Cass is in favor of some\nsort of improvements. Well, what are they? As he is against\ngeneral objects, those he is for must be particular and\nlocal. Now this is taking the subject precisely by the wrong\nend. Particularity expending the money of the whole people\nfor an object which will bene\ufb01t only a portion of them \u2014 is\nthe greatest real objection to improvements, and has been\nso held by General Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I\nbelieve, till now. But now, behold, the objects most general\n\u2014 nearest free from this objection \u2014 are to be rejected,\nwhile those most liable to it are to be embraced. To return:\nI cannot help believing that General Cass, when he wrote\nhis letter of acceptance, well understood he was to be\nclaimed by the advocates of both sides of this question, and\nthat he then closed the door against all further expressions\n of opinion purposely to retain the bene\ufb01ts of that double\nposition. His subsequent equivocation at Cleveland, to my\nmind, proves such to have been the case.\nOne word more, and I shall have done with this branch of\nthe subject. You Democrats, and your candidate, in the\nmain are in favor of laying down in advance a platform \u2014 a\nset of party positions \u2014 as a unit, and then of forcing the\npeople, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however\nunpalatable some of them may be. We and our candidate\nare in favor of making Presidential elections and the\nlegislation of the country distinct matters; so that the\npeople can elect whom they please, and afterward legislate\njust as they please, without any hindrance, save only so\nmuch as may guard against infractions of the Constitution,\nundue haste, and want of consideration. The di\ufb00erence\nbetween us is clear as noonday. That we are right we\ncannot doubt. We hold the true Republican position. In\nleaving the people\u2019s business in their hands, we cannot be\nwrong. We are willing, and even anxious, to go to the\npeople on this issue.\nBut I suppose I cannot reasonably hope to convince you\nthat we have any principles. The most I can expect is to\nassure you that we think we have and are quite contented\nwith them. The other day one of the gentlemen from\nGeorgia [Mr. Iverson], an eloquent man, and a man of\nlearning, so far as I can judge, not being learned myself,\ncame down upon us astonishingly. He spoke in what the\n\u2018Baltimore American\u2019 calls the \u201cscathing and withering\nstyle.\u201d At the end of his second severe \ufb02ash I was struck\n blind, and found myself feeling with my \ufb01ngers for an\nassurance of my continued existence. A little of the bone\nwas left, and I gradually revived. He eulogized Mr. Clay in\nhigh and beautiful terms, and then declared that we had\ndeserted all our principles, and had turned Henry Clay out,\nlike an old horse, to root. This is terribly severe. It cannot\nbe answered by argument \u2014 at least I cannot so answer it.\nI merely wish to ask the gentleman if the Whigs are the\nonly party he can think of who sometimes turn old horses\nout to root. Is not a certain Martin Van Buren an old horse\nwhich your own party have turned out to root? and is he\nnot rooting a little to your discomfort about now? But in not\nnominating Mr. Clay we deserted our principles, you say.\nAh! In what? Tell us, ye men of principle, what principle we\nviolated. We say you did violate principle in discarding Van\nBuren, and we can tell you how. You violated the primary,\nthe cardinal, the one great living principle of all democratic\nrepresentative government \u2014 the principle that the\nrepresentative is bound to carry out the known will of his\nconstituents. A large majority of the Baltimore convention\nof  were, by their constituents, instructed to procure\nVan Buren \u2018s nomination if they could. In violation \u2014 in\nutter glaring contempt of this, you rejected him; rejected\nhim, as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Birdsall] the\nother day expressly admitted, for availability \u2014 that same\n\u201cgeneral availability\u201d which you charge upon us, and daily\nchew over here, as something exceedingly odious and\nunprincipled. But the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Iverson]\ngave us a second speech yesterday, all well considered and\n put down in writing, in which Van Buren was scathed and\nwithered a \u201cfew\u201d for his present position and movements. I\ncannot remember the gentleman\u2019s precise language; but I\ndo remember he put Van Buren down, down, till he got him\nwhere he was \ufb01nally to \u201cstink\u201d and \u201crot.\u201d\nMr. Speaker, it is no business or inclination of mine to\ndefend Martin Van Buren in the war of extermination now\nwaging between him and his old admirers. I say, \u201cDevil take\nthe hindmost\u201d \u2014 and the foremost. But there is no\nmistaking the origin of the breach; and if the curse of\n\u201cstinking\u201d and \u201crotting\u201d is to fall on the \ufb01rst and greatest\nviolators of principle in the matter, I disinterestedly suggest\nthat the gentleman from Georgia and his present co-\nworkers are bound to take it upon themselves. But the\ngentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all\nour principles, and taken shelter under General Taylor\u2019s\nmilitary coat-tail, and he seems to think this is exceedingly\ndegrading. Well, as his faith is, so be it unto him. But can\nhe remember no other military coat-tail under which a\ncertain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter\nof a century? Has he no acquaintance with the ample\nmilitary coat tail of General Jackson? Does he not know that\nhis own party have run the \ufb01ve last Presidential races\nunder that coat-tail, and that they are now running the\nsixth under the same cover? Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used\nnot only for General Jackson himself, but has been clung to,\nwith the grip of death, by every Democratic candidate\nsince. You have never ventured, and dare not now venture,\nfrom under it. Your campaign papers have constantly been\n \u201cOld Hickories,\u201d with rude likenesses of the old general\nupon them; hickory poles and hickory brooms your never-\nending emblems; Mr. Polk himself was \u201cYoung Hickory,\u201d or\nsomething so; and even now your campaign paper here is\nproclaiming that Cass and Butler are of the true \u201cHickory\nstripe.\u201d Now, sir, you dare not give it up. Like a horde of\nhungry ticks you have stuck to the tail of the Hermitage\nLion to the end of his life; and you are still sticking to it,\nand drawing a loathsome sustenance from it, after he is\ndead. A fellow once advertised that he had made a\ndiscovery by which he could make a new man out of an old\none, and have enough of the stu\ufb00 left to make a little yellow\ndog. Just such a discovery has General Jackson\u2019s popularity\nbeen to you. You not only twice made President of him out\nof it, but you have had enough of the stu\ufb00 left to make\nPresidents of several comparatively small men since; and it\nis your chief reliance now to make still another.\nMr. Speaker, old horses and military coat-tails, or tails of\nany sort, are not \ufb01gures of speech such as I would be the\n\ufb01rst to introduce into discussions here; but as the\ngentleman from Georgia has thought \ufb01t to introduce them,\nhe and you are welcome to all you have made, or can make\nby them. If you have any more old horses, trot them out;\nany more tails, just cock them and come at us. I repeat, I\nwould not introduce this mode of discussion here; but I\nwish gentlemen on the other side to understand that the\nuse of degrading \ufb01gures is a game at which they may not\n\ufb01nd themselves able to take all the winnings.\n[\u201cWe give it up!\u201d]\n Aye, you give it up, and well you may; but for a very\ndi\ufb00erent reason from that which you would have us\nunderstand. The point \u2014 the power to hurt \u2014 of all \ufb01gures\nconsists in the truthfulness of their application; and,\nunderstanding this, you may well give it up. They are\nweapons which hit you, but miss us.\nBut in my hurry I was very near closing this subject of\nmilitary tails before I was done with it. There is one entire\narticle of the sort I have not discussed yet, \u2014 I mean the\nmilitary tail you Democrats are now engaged in dovetailing\ninto the great Michigander [Cass]. Yes, sir; all his\nbiographies (and they are legion) have him in hand, tying\nhim to a military tail, like so many mischievous boys tying a\ndog to a bladder of beans. True, the material they have is\nvery limited, but they drive at it might and main. He\ninvaded Canada without resistance, and he outvaded it\nwithout pursuit. As he did both under orders, I suppose\nthere was to him neither credit nor discredit in them; but\nthey constitute a large part of the tail. He was not at Hull\u2019s\nsurrender, but he was close by; he was volunteer aid to\nGeneral Harrison on the day of the battle of the Thames;\nand as you said in  Harrison was picking huckleberries\ntwo miles o\ufb00 while the battle was fought, I suppose it is a\njust conclusion with you to say Cass was aiding Harrison to\npick huckleberries. This is about all, except the mooted\nquestion of the broken sword. Some authors say he broke\nit, some say he threw it away, and some others, who ought\nto know, say nothing about it. Perhaps it would be a fair\n historical compromise to say, if he did not break it, he did\nnot do anything else with it.\nBy the way, Mr. Speaker, did you know I am a military\nhero? Yes, sir; in the days of the Black Hawk war I fought,\nbled, and came away. Speaking of General Cass\u2019s career\nreminds me of my own. I was not at Stiliman\u2019s defeat, but I\nwas about as near it as Cass was to Hull\u2019s surrender; and,\nlike him, I saw the place very soon afterward. It is quite\ncertain I did not break my sword, for I had none to break;\nbut I bent a musket pretty badly on one occasion. If Cass\nbroke his sword, the idea is he broke it in desperation; I\nbent the musket by accident. If General Cass went in\nadvance of me in picking huckleberries, I guess I surpassed\nhim in charges upon the wild onions. If he saw any live,\n\ufb01ghting Indians, it was more than I did; but I had a good\nmany bloody struggles with the mosquitoes, and although I\nnever fainted from the loss of blood, I can truly say I was\noften very hungry. Mr. Speaker, if I should ever conclude to\ndo\ufb00 whatever our Democratic friends may suppose there is\nof black-cockade federalism about me, and therefore they\nshall take me up as their candidate for the Presidency, I\nprotest they shall not make fun of me, as they have of\nGeneral Cass, by attempting to write me into a military\nhero.\nWhile I have General Cass in hand, I wish to say a word\nabout his political principles. As a specimen, I take the\nrecord of his progress in the Wilmot Proviso. In the\nWashington Union of March , , there is a report of a\nspeech of General Cass, made the day before in the Senate,\n on the Wilmot Proviso, during the delivery of which Mr.\nMiller of New Jersey is reported to have interrupted him as\nfollows, to wit:\n\u201cMr. Miller expressed his great surprise at the change in\nthe sentiments of the Senator from Michigan, who had\nbeen regarded as the great champion of freedom in the\nNorthwest, of which he was a distinguished ornament. Last\nyear the Senator from Michigan was understood to be\ndecidedly in favor of the Wilmot Proviso; and as no reason\nhad been stated for the change, he [Mr. Miller] could not\nrefrain from the expression of his extreme surprise.\u201d\nTo this General Cass is reported to have replied as\nfollows, to wit:\n\u201cMr. Cass said that the course of the Senator from New\nJersey was most extraordinary. Last year he [Mr. Cass]\nshould have voted for the proposition, had it come up. But\ncircumstances had altogether changed. The honorable\nSenator then read several passages from the remarks, as\ngiven above, which he had committed to writing, in order to\nrefute such a charge as that of the Senator from New\nJersey.\u201d\nIn the \u201cremarks above reduced to writing\u201d is one\nnumbered four, as follows, to wit:\n\u201cFourth. Legislation now would be wholly inoperative,\nbecause no territory hereafter to be acquired can be\ngoverned without an act of Congress providing for its\ngovernment; and such an act, on its passage, would open\nthe whole subject, and leave the Congress called on to pass\n it free to exercise its own discretion, entirely uncontrolled\nby any declaration found on the statute-book.\u201d\nIn Niles\u2019s Register, vol. lxxiii., , there is a letter of\nGeneral Cass to \u2014\u2014 \u2014 Nicholson, of Nashville, Tennessee,\ndated December , , from which the following are\ncorrect extracts:\n\u201cThe Wilmot Proviso has been before the country some\ntime. It has been repeatedly discussed in Congress and by\nthe public press. I am strongly impressed with the opinion\nthat a great change has been going on in the public mind\nupon this subject, \u2014 in my own as well as others\u2019, \u2014 and\nthat doubts are resolving themselves into convictions that\nthe principle it involves should be kept out of the national\nlegislature, and left to the people of the confederacy in\ntheir respective local governments.... Brie\ufb02y, then, I am\nopposed to the exercise of any jurisdiction by Congress\nover this matter; and I am in favor of leaving the people of\nany territory which may be hereafter acquired the right to\nregulate it themselves, under the general principles of the\nConstitution. Because\u2014 \u2018First. I do not see in the\nConstitution any grant of the requisite power to Congress;\nand I am not disposed to extend a doubtful precedent\nbeyond its necessity, \u2014 the establishment of territorial\ngovernments when needed, \u2014 leaving to the inhabitants all\nthe right compatible with the relations they bear to the\nconfederation.\u201d\nThese extracts show that in  General Cass was for\nthe proviso at once; that in March, , he was still for it,\nbut not just then; and that in December, , he was\n against it altogether. This is a true index to the whole man.\nWhen the question was raised in , he was in a\nblustering hurry to take ground for it. He sought to be in\nadvance, and to avoid the uninteresting position of a mere\nfollower; but soon he began to see glimpses of the great\nDemocratic ox-goad waving in his face, and to hear\nindistinctly a voice saying, \u201cBack! Back, sir! Back a little!\u201d\nHe shakes his head, and bats his eyes, and blunders back to\nhis position of March, ; but still the goad waves, and\nthe voice grows more distinct and sharper still, \u201cBack, sir!\nBack, I say! Further back!\u201d \u2014 and back he goes to the\nposition of December, , at which the goad is still, and\nthe voice soothingly says, \u201cSo! Stand at that!\u201d\nHave no fears, gentlemen, of your candidate. He exactly\nsuits you, and we congratulate you upon it. However much\nyou may be distressed about our candidate, you have all\ncause to be contented and happy with your own. If elected,\nhe may not maintain all or even any of his positions\npreviously taken; but he will be sure to do whatever the\nparty exigency for the time being may require; and that is\nprecisely what you want. He and Van Buren are the same\n\u201cmanner of men\u201d; and, like Van Buren, he will never desert\nyou till you \ufb01rst desert him.\nMr. Speaker, I adopt the suggestion of a friend, that\nGeneral Cass is a general of splendidly successful charges\n\u2014 charges, to be sure, not upon the public enemy, but upon\nthe public treasury. He was Governor of Michigan territory,\nand ex-o\ufb00icio Superintendent of Indian A\ufb00airs, from the th\nof October, , till the st of July,  \u2014 a period of\n seventeen years, nine months, and twenty-two days. During\nthis period he received from the United States treasury, for\npersonal services and personal expenses, the aggregate\nsum of ninety-six thousand and twenty eight dollars, being\nan average of fourteen dollars and seventy-nine cents per\nday for every day of the time. This large sum was reached\nby assuming that he was doing service at several di\ufb00erent\nplaces, and in several di\ufb00erent capacities in the same\nplace, all at the same time. By a correct analysis of his\naccounts during that period, the following propositions may\nbe deduced:\nFirst. He was paid in three di\ufb00erent capacities during the\nwhole of the time: that is to say \u2014 () As governor a salary\nat the rate per year of  . () As estimated for o\ufb00ice\nrent, clerk hire, fuel, etc., in superintendence of Indian\na\ufb00airs in Michigan, at the rate per year of  . () As\ncompensation and expenses for various miscellaneous\nitems of Indian service out of Michigan, an average per\nyear of  .\nSecond. During part of the time \u2014 that is, from the th of\nOctober, , to the th of May,  he was paid in four\ndi\ufb00erent capacities; that is to say, the three as above, and,\nin addition thereto, the commutation of ten rations per day,\namounting per year to  .\nThird. During another part of the time \u2014 that is, from the\nbeginning of  to the st of July, \u2018 he was also paid\nin four di\ufb00erent capacities; that is to say, the \ufb01rst three, as\nabove (the rations being dropped after the th of May,\n), and, in addition thereto, for superintending Indian\n Agencies at Piqua, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Chicago,\nIllinois, at the rate per year of  . It should be observed\nhere that the last item, commencing at the beginning of\n, and the item of rations, ending on the th of May,\n, lap on each other during so much of the time as lies\nbetween those two dates.\nFourth. Still another part of the time \u2014 that is, from the\nst of October, , to the th of May,  \u2014 he was\npaid in six di\ufb00erent capacities; that is to say, the three \ufb01rst,\nas above; the item of rations, as above; and, in addition\nthereto, another item of ten rations per day while at\nWashington settling his accounts, being at the rate per year\nof  ; and also an allowance for expenses traveling to\nand from Washington, and while there, of  , being at\nthe rate per year of  .\nFifth. And yet during the little portion of the time which\nlies between the st of January, , and the th of May,\n, he was paid in seven di\ufb00erent capacities; that is to\nsay, the six last mentioned, and also, at the rate of  \nper year, for the Piqua, Fort Wayne, and Chicago service, as\nmentioned above.\nThese accounts have already been discussed some here;\nbut when we are amongst them, as when we are in the\nPatent O\ufb00ice, we must peep about a good deal before we\ncan see all the curiosities. I shall not be tedious with them.\nAs to the large item of   per year \u2014 amounting in the\naggregate to  , for o\ufb00ice rent, clerk hire, fuel, etc., I\nbarely wish to remark that, so far as I can discover in the\npublic documents, there is no evidence, by word or\n inference, either from any disinterested witness or of\nGeneral Cass himself, that he ever rented or kept a\nseparate o\ufb00ice, ever hired or kept a clerk, or even used any\nextra amount of fuel, etc., in consequence of his Indian\nservices. Indeed, General Cass\u2019s entire silence in regard to\nthese items, in his two long letters urging his claims upon\nthe government, is, to my mind, almost conclusive that no\nsuch claims had any real existence.\nBut I have introduced General Cass\u2019s accounts here\nchie\ufb02y to show the wonderful physical capacities of the\nman. They show that he not only did the labor of several\nmen at the same time, but that he often did it at several\nplaces, many hundreds of miles apart, at the same time.\nAnd at eating, too, his capacities are shown to be quite as\nwonderful. From October, , to May, , he eat ten\nrations a day in Michigan, ten rations a day here in\nWashington, and near \ufb01ve dollars\u2019 worth a day on the road\nbetween the two places! And then there is an important\ndiscovery in his example \u2014 the art of being paid for what\none eats, instead of having to pay for it. Hereafter if any\nnice young man should owe a bill which he cannot pay in\nany other way, he can just board it out. Mr. Speaker, we\nhave all heard of the animal standing in doubt between two\nstacks of hay and starving to death. The like of that would\nnever happen to General Cass. Place the stacks a thousand\nmiles apart, he would stand stock-still midway between\nthem, and eat them both at once, and the green grass along\nthe line would be apt to su\ufb00er some, too, at the same time.\nBy all means make him President, gentlemen. He will feed\n you bounteously \u2014 if \u2014 if there is any left after he shall\nhave helped himself.\nBut, as General Taylor is, par excellence, the hero of the\nMexican War, and as you Democrats say we Whigs have\nalways opposed the war, you think it must be very awkward\nand embarrassing for us to go for General Taylor. The\ndeclaration that we have always opposed the war is true or\nfalse, according as one may understand the term \u201coppose\nthe war.\u201d If to say \u201cthe war was unnecessarily and\nunconstitutionally \ncommenced \nby \nthe \nPresident\u201d \nby\nopposing the war, then the Whigs have very generally\nopposed it. Whenever they have spoken at all, they have\nsaid this; and they have said it on what has appeared good\nreason to them. The marching an army into the midst of a\npeaceful Mexican settlement, frightening the inhabitants\naway, leaving their growing crops and other property to\ndestruction, to you may appear a perfectly amiable,\npeaceful, unprovoking procedure; but it does not appear so\nto us. So to call such an act, to us appears no other than a\nnaked, impudent absurdity, and we speak of it accordingly.\nBut if, when the war had begun, and had become the cause\nof the country, the giving of our money and our blood, in\ncommon with yours, was support of the war, then it is not\ntrue that we have always opposed the war. With few\nindividual exceptions, you have constantly had our votes\nhere for all the necessary supplies. And, more than this,\nyou have had the services, the blood, and the lives of our\npolitical brethren in every trial and on every \ufb01eld. The\nbeardless boy and the mature man, the humble and the\n distinguished \u2014 you have had them. Through su\ufb00ering and\ndeath, by disease and in battle they have endured and\nfought and fell with you. Clay and Webster each gave a son,\nnever to be returned. From the State of my own residence,\nbesides other worthy but less known Whig names, we sent\nMarshall, Morrison, Baker, and Hardin; they all fought, and\none fell, and in the fall of that one we lost our best Whig\nman. Nor were the Whigs few in number, or laggard in the\nday of danger. In that fearful, bloody, breathless struggle at\nBuena Vista, where each man\u2019s hard task was to beat back\n\ufb01ve foes or die himself, of the \ufb01ve high o\ufb00icers who\nperished, four were Whigs.\nIn speaking of this, I mean no odious comparison\nbetween the lion-hearted Whigs and the Democrats who\nfought there. On other occasions, and among the lower\no\ufb00icers and privates on that occasion, I doubt not the\nproportion was di\ufb00erent. I wish to do justice to all. I think\nof all those brave men as Americans, in whose proud fame,\nas an American, I too have a share. Many of them, Whigs\nand Democrats are my constituents and personal friends;\nand I thank them, \u2014 more than thank them, \u2014 one and all,\nfor the high imperishable honor they have conferred on our\ncommon State.\nBut the distinction between the cause of the President in\nbeginning the war, and the cause of the country after it was\nbegun, is a distinction which you cannot perceive. To you\nthe President and the country seem to be all one. You are\ninterested to see no distinction between them; and I\nventure to suggest that probably your interest blinds you a\n little. We see the distinction, as we think, clearly enough;\nand our friends who have fought in the war have no\ndi\ufb00iculty in seeing it also. What those who have fallen\nwould say, were they alive and here, of course we can never\nknow; but with those who have returned there is no\ndi\ufb00iculty. Colonel Haskell and Major Gaines, members\nhere, both fought in the war, and both of them underwent\nextraordinary perils and hardships; still they, like all other\nWhigs here, vote, on the record, that the war was\nunnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the\nPresident. And even General Taylor himself, the noblest\nRoman of them all, has declared that as a citizen, and\nparticularly as a soldier, it is su\ufb00icient for him to know that\nhis country is at war with a foreign nation, to do all in his\npower to bring it to a speedy and honorable termination by\nthe most vigorous and energetic operations, without\ninquiry about its justice, or anything else connected with it.\nMr. Speaker, let our Democratic friends be comforted\nwith the assurance that we are content with our position,\ncontent with our company, and content with our candidate;\nand that although they, in their generous sympathy, think\nwe ought to be miserable, we really are not, and that they\nmay dismiss the great anxiety they have on our account.\nMr. Speaker, I see I have but three minutes left, and this\nforces me to throw out one whole branch of my subject. A\nsingle word on still another. The Democrats are keen\nenough to frequently remind us that we have some\ndissensions in our ranks. Our good friend from Baltimore\nimmediately before me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt\n the other day as to which branch of our party General\nTaylor would ultimately fall into the hands of. That was a\nnew idea to me. I knew we had dissenters, but I did not\nknow they were trying to get our candidate away from us. I\nwould like to say a word to our dissenters, but I have not\nthe time. Some such we certainly have; have you none,\ngentlemen Democrats? Is it all union and harmony in your\nranks? no bickerings? no divisions? If there be doubt as to\nwhich of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no\ndoubt as to which of your candidates will get your party? I\nhave heard some things from New York; and if they are\ntrue, one might well say of your party there, as a drunken\nfellow once said when he heard the reading of an\nindictment for hog-stealing. The clerk read on till he got to\nand through the words, \u201cdid steal, take, and carry away ten\nboars, ten sows, ten shoats, and ten pigs,\u201d at which he\nexclaimed, \u201cWell, by golly, that is the most equally divided\ngang of hogs I ever did hear of!\u201d If there is any other gang\nof hogs more equally divided than the Democrats of New\nYork are about this time, I have not heard of it.\n      H \n  I    \n A  \n         \nA  .  \n    .         .\n(From the Boston Advertiser.)\nMR. KELLOGG THEN introduced to the meeting the Hon.\nAbram Lincoln, Whig member of Congress from Illinois, a\nrepresentative of free soil.\nMr. Lincoln has a very tall and thin \ufb01gure, with an\nintellectual face, showing a searching mind, and a cool\njudgment. He spoke in a clear and cool and very eloquent\nmanner, for an hour and a half, carrying the audience with\nhim in his able arguments and brilliant illustrations \u2014 only\ninterrupted by warm and frequent applause. He began by\nexpressing a real feeling of modesty in addressing an\naudience \u201cthis side of the mountains,\u201d a part of the country\nwhere, in the opinion of the people of his section,\neverybody was supposed to be instructed and wise. But he\nhad devoted his attention to the question of the coming\nPresidential election, and was not unwilling to exchange\nwith all whom he might the ideas to which he had arrived.\nHe then began to show the fallacy of some of the\narguments against Gen. Taylor, making his chief theme the\nfashionable statement of all those who oppose him (\u201cthe old\nLocofocos as well as the new\u201d) that he has no principles,\nand that the Whig party have abandoned their principles by\n adopting him as their candidate. He maintained that Gen.\nTaylor occupied a high and unexceptionable Whig ground,\nand took for his \ufb01rst instance and proof of this the\nstatement in the Allison letter \u2014 with regard to the bank,\ntari\ufb00, rivers and harbors, etc. \u2014 that the will of the people\nshould produce its own results, without executive in\ufb02uence.\nThe principle that the people should do what \u2014 under the\nConstitution \u2014 as they please, is a Whig principle. All that\nGen. Taylor is not only to consent to, but appeal to the\npeople to judge and act for themselves. And this was no\nnew doctrine for Whigs. It was the \u201cplatform\u201d on which\nthey had fought all their battles, the resistance of executive\nin\ufb02uence, and the principle of enabling the people to frame\nthe government according to their will. Gen. Taylor\nconsents to be the candidate, and to assist the people to do\nwhat they think to be their duty, and think to be best in\ntheir national a\ufb00airs, but because he don\u2019t want to tell\nwhat we ought to do, he is accused of having no principles.\nThe Whigs here maintained for years that neither the\nin\ufb02uence, the duress, or the prohibition of the executive\nshould control the legitimately expressed will of the people;\nand now that, on that very ground, Gen. Taylor says that he\nshould use the power given him by the people to do, to the\nbest of his judgment, the will of the people, he is accused of\nwant of principle, and of inconsistency in position.\nMr. Lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an\nattempt to make a platform or creed for a national party, to\nall parts of which all must consent and agree, when it was\nclearly the intention and the true philosophy of our\n government, that in Congress all opinions and principles\nshould be represented, and that when the wisdom of all had\nbeen compared and united, the will of the majority should\nbe carried out. On this ground he conceived (and the\naudience seemed to go with him) that Gen. Taylor held\ncorrect, sound republican principles.\nMr. Lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the\nStates, saying that the people of Illinois agreed entirely\nwith the people of Massachusetts on this subject, except\nperhaps that they did not keep so constantly thinking about\nit. All agreed that slavery was an evil, but that we were not\nresponsible for it and cannot a\ufb00ect it in States of this Union\nwhere we do not live. But the question of the extension of\nslavery to new territories of this country is a part of our\nresponsibility and care, and is under our control. In\nopposition to this Mr. L. believed that the self-named \u201cFree\nSoil\u201d party was far behind the Whigs. Both parties opposed\nthe extension. As he understood it the new party had no\nprinciple except this opposition. If their platform held any\nother, it was in such a general way that it was like the pair\nof pantaloons the Yankee pedlar o\ufb00ered for sale, \u201clarge\nenough for any man, small enough for any boy.\u201d They\ntherefore had taken a position calculated to break down\ntheir single important declared object. They were working\nfor the election of either Gen. Cass or Gen. Taylor. The\nspeaker then went on to show, clearly and eloquently, the\ndanger of extension of slavery, likely to result from the\nelection of Gen. Cass. To unite with those who annexed the\nnew territory to prevent the extension of slavery in that\n territory seemed to him to be in the highest degree absurd\nand ridiculous. Suppose these gentlemen succeed in\nelecting Mr. Van Buren, they had no speci\ufb01c means to\nprevent the extension of slavery to New Mexico and\nCalifornia, and Gen. Taylor, he con\ufb01dently believed, would\nnot encourage it, and would not prohibit its restriction. But\nif Gen. Cass was elected, he felt certain that the plans of\nfarther extension of territory would be encouraged, and\nthose of the extension of slavery would meet no check. The\n\u201cFree Soil\u201d mart in claiming that name indirectly attempts\na deception, by implying that Whigs were not Free Soil\nmen. Declaring that they would \u201cdo their duty and leave\nthe consequences to God\u201d merely gave an excuse for taking\na course they were not able to maintain by a fair and full\nargument. To make this declaration did not show what their\nduty was. If it did we should have no use for judgment, we\nmight as well be made without intellect; and when divine or\nhuman law does not clearly point out what is our duty, we\nhave no means of \ufb01nding out what it is but by using our\nmost intelligent judgment of the consequences. If there\nwere divine law or human law for voting for Martin Van\nBuren, or if a fair examination of the consequences and just\nreasoning would show that voting for him would bring\nabout the ends they pretended to wish \u2014 then he would\ngive up the argument. But since there was no \ufb01xed law on\nthe subject, and since the whole probable result of their\naction would be an assistance in electing Gen. Cass, he\nmust say that they were behind the Whigs in their advocacy\nof the freedom of the soil.\n Mr. Lincoln proceeded to rally the Bu\ufb00alo convention for\nforbearing to say anything \u2014 after all the previous\ndeclarations of those members who were formerly Whigs \u2014\non the subject of the Mexican War, because the Van Burens\nhad been known to have supported it. He declared that of\nall the parties asking the con\ufb01dence of the country, this\nnew one had less of principle than any other.\nHe wondered whether it was still the opinion of these\nFree Soil gentlemen, as declared in the \u201cwhereas\u201d at\nBu\ufb00alo, that the Whig and Democratic parties were both\nentirely dissolved and absorbed into their own body. Had\nthe Vermont election given them any light? They had\ncalculated on making as great an impression in that State\nas in any part of the Union, and there their attempts had\nbeen wholly ine\ufb00ectual. Their failure was a greater success\nthan they would \ufb01nd in any other part of the Union.\nMr. Lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that\nall those who wished to keep up the character of the Union;\nwho did not believe in enlarging our \ufb01eld, but in keeping\nour fences where they are and cultivating our present\npossessions, making it a garden, improving the morals and\neducation of the people, devoting the administrations to\nthis purpose; all real Whigs, friends of good honest\ngovernment \u2014 the race was ours. He had opportunities of\nhearing from almost every part of the Union from reliable\nsources and had not heard of a county in which we had not\nreceived accessions from other parties. If the true Whigs\ncome forward and join these new friends, they need not\nhave a doubt. We had a candidate whose personal\n character and principles he had already described, whom\nhe could not eulogize if he would. Gen. Taylor had been\nconstantly, perseveringly, quietly standing up, doing his\nduty and asking no praise or reward for it. He was and\nmust be just the man to whom the interests, principles, and\nprosperity of the country might be safely intrusted. He had\nnever failed in anything he had undertaken, although many\nof his duties had been considered almost impossible.\nMr. Lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of\nthe origin of the Mexican War and the connection of the\nadministration and General Taylor with it, from which he\ndeduced a strong appeal to the Whigs present to do their\nduty in the support of General Taylor, and closed with the\nwarmest aspirations for and con\ufb01dence in a deserved\nsuccess.\nAt the close of his truly masterly and convincing speech,\nthe audience gave three enthusiastic cheers for Illinois, and\nthree more for the eloquent Whig member from the State.\n HI   A H       \n     \n  \n \nTO THOMAS LINCOLN\nWASHINGTON, DEC. , .\nMY DEAR FATHER: \u2014 Your letter of the th was received\nnight before last. I very cheerfully send you the twenty\ndollars, which sum you say is necessary to save your land\nfrom sale. It is singular that you should have forgotten a\njudgment against you; and it is more singular that the\nplainti\ufb00 should have let you forget it so long; particularly as\nI suppose you always had property enough to satisfy a\njudgment of that amount. Before you pay it, it would be\nwell to be sure you have not paid, or at least, that you\ncannot prove you have paid it.\nGive my love to mother and all the connections.\nA\ufb00ectionately your son, A. LINCOLN.\n",
    "1854-1861": "     \n  \n \n.  . \nA I .\nSPRINGFIELD, JUNE , .\nO. L. DAVIS, ESQ.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 You, no doubt, remember the enclosed\nmemorandum being handed me in your o\ufb00ice. I have just\nmade the desired search, and \ufb01nd that no such deed has\never been here. Campbell, the auditor, says that if it were\nhere, it would be in his o\ufb00ice, and that he has hunted for it\na dozen times, and could never \ufb01nd it. He says that one\ntime and another, he has heard much about the matter, that\nit was not a deed for Right of Way, but a deed, outright, for\nDepot-ground \u2014 at least, a sale for Depot-ground, and\nthere may never have been a deed. He says, if there is a\ndeed, it is most probable General Alexander, of Paris, has it.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n    A  A \n A \n \nTO J. M. PALMER\n[Con\ufb01dential]\nSPRINGFIELD, Sept. , .\nHON. J. M. PALMER.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 You know how anxious I am that this\nNebraska measure shall be rebuked and condemned\neverywhere. Of course I hope something from your\nposition; yet I do not expect you to do anything which may\nbe wrong in your own judgment; nor would I have you do\nanything personally injurious to yourself. You are, and\nalways have been, honestly and sincerely a Democrat; and I\nknow how painful it must be to an honest, sincere man to\nbe urged by his party to the support of a measure which in\nhis conscience he believes to be wrong. You have had a\nsevere struggle with yourself, and you have determined not\nto swallow the wrong. Is it not just to yourself that you\nshould, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and\nthus justify yourself? I wish you would; and yet I say, don\u2019t\ndo it, if you think it will injure you. You may have given\nyour word to vote for Major Harris; and if so, of course you\nwill stick to it. But allow me to suggest that you should\navoid speaking of this; for it probably would induce some of\nyour friends in like manner to cast their votes. You\n understand. And now let me beg your pardon for obtruding\nthis letter upon you, to whom I have ever been opposed in\npolitics. Had your party omitted to make Nebraska a test of\nparty \n\ufb01delity, \nyou \nprobably \nwould \nhave \nbeen \nthe\nDemocratic candidate for Congress in the district. You\ndeserved it, and I believe it would have been given you. In\nthat case I should have been quite happy that Nebraska\nwas to be rebuked at all events. I still should have voted for\nthe Whig candidate; but I should have made no speeches,\nwritten no letters; and you would have been elected by at\nleast a thousand majority.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n A.  . \n  A\n.\nSPRINGFIELD, September , \nA. B. MOREAU, ESQ.\nSIR: \u2014 Stranger though I am, personally, being a brother\nin the faith, I venture to write you. Yates can not come to\nyour court next week. He is obliged to be at Pike court\nwhere he has a case, with a fee of \ufb01ve hundred dollars, two\nhundred dollars already paid. To neglect it would be unjust\nto himself, and dishonest to his client. Harris will be with\nyou, head up and tail up, for Nebraska. You must have some\none to make an anti-Nebraska speech. Palmer is the best, if\nyou can get him, I think. Jo. Gillespie, if you can not get\nPalmer, and somebody anyhow, if you can get neither. But\npress Palmer hard. It is in his Senatorial district, I believe.\nYours etc., A. LINCOLN.\n        \n   \nA \n  \n A  \n   \n IA\n     H\nSPEECH AT PEORIA, ILLINOIS, IN REPLY TO SENATOR\nDOUGLAS,\nOCTOBER , .\nI do not rise to speak now, if I can stipulate with the\naudience to meet me here at half-past six or at seven\no\u2019clock. It is now several minutes past \ufb01ve, and Judge\nDouglas has spoken over three hours. If you hear me at all,\nI wish you to hear me through. It will take me as long as it\nhas taken him. That will carry us beyond eight o\u2019clock at\nnight. Now, every one of you who can remain that long can\njust as well get his supper, meet me at seven, and remain\nan hour or two later. The Judge has already informed you\nthat he is to have an hour to reply to me. I doubt not but\nyou have been a little surprised to learn that I have\nconsented to give one of his high reputation and known\nability this advantage of me. Indeed, my consenting to it,\nthough reluctant, was not wholly unsel\ufb01sh, for I suspected,\nif it were understood that the Judge was entirely done, you\nDemocrats would leave and not hear me; but by giving him\nthe close, I felt con\ufb01dent you would stay for the fun of\nhearing him skin me.\n The audience signi\ufb01ed their assent to the arrangement,\nand adjourned to seven o\u2019clock P.M., at which time they\nreassembled, and Mr. Lincoln spoke substantially as\nfollows:\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and the\npropriety of its restoration, constitute the subject of what I\nam about to say. As I desire to present my own connected\nview of this subject, my remarks will not be speci\ufb01cally an\nanswer to Judge Douglas; yet, as I proceed, the main points\nhe has presented will arise, and will receive such respectful\nattention as I may be able to give them. I wish further to\nsay that I do not propose to question the patriotism or to\nassail the motives of any man or class of men, but rather to\ncon\ufb01ne myself strictly to the naked merits of the question. I\nalso wish to be no less than national in all the positions I\nmay take, and whenever I take ground which others have\nthought, or may think, narrow, sectional, and dangerous to\nthe Union, I hope to give a reason which will appear\nsu\ufb00icient, at least to some, why I think di\ufb00erently.\nAnd as this subject is no other than part and parcel of the\nlarger general question of domestic slavery, I wish to make\nand to keep the distinction between the existing institution\nand the extension of it so broad and so clear that no honest\nman can misunderstand me, and no dishonest one\nsuccessfully misrepresent me.\nIn order to a clear understanding of what the Missouri\nCompromise is, a short history of the preceding kindred\nsubjects will perhaps be proper.\n When we established our independence, we did not own\nor claim the country to which this compromise applies.\nIndeed, strictly speaking, the Confederacy then owned no\ncountry at all; the States respectively owned the country\nwithin their limits, and some of them owned territory\nbeyond their strict State limits. Virginia thus owned the\nNorthwestern Territory \u2014 the country out of which the\nprincipal part of Ohio, all Indiana, all Illinois, all Michigan,\nand all Wisconsin have since been formed. She also owned\n(perhaps within her then limits) what has since been\nformed into the State of Kentucky. North Carolina thus\nowned what is now the State of Tennessee; and South\nCarolina and Georgia owned, in separate parts, what are\nnow Mississippi and Alabama. Connecticut, I think, owned\nthe little remaining part of Ohio, being the same where\nthey now send Giddings to Congress and beat all creation\nin making cheese.\nThese territories, together with the States themselves,\nconstitute all the country over which the Confederacy then\nclaimed any sort of jurisdiction. We were then living under\nthe Articles of Confederation, which were superseded by\nthe Constitution several years afterward. The question of\nceding the territories to the General Government was set\non foot. Mr. Je\ufb00erson, \u2014 the author of the Declaration of\nIndependence, \nand \notherwise \na \nchief \nactor \nin \nthe\nRevolution; then a delegate in Congress; afterward, twice\nPresident; who was, is, and perhaps will continue to be, the\nmost distinguished politician of our history; a Virginian by\nbirth and continued residence, and withal a slaveholder, \u2014\n conceived the idea of taking that occasion to prevent\nslavery ever going into the Northwestern Territory. He\nprevailed on the Virginia Legislature to adopt his views,\nand to cede the Territory, making the prohibition of slavery\ntherein a condition of the deed. (Je\ufb00erson got only an\nunderstanding, not a condition of the deed to this wish.)\nCongress accepted the cession with the condition; and the\n\ufb01rst ordinance (which the acts of Congress were then\ncalled) for the government of the Territory provided that\nslavery should never be permitted therein. This is the\nfamed \u201cOrdinance of \u2018,\u201d so often spoken of.\nThenceforward for sixty-one years, and until, in , the\nlast scrap of this Territory came into the Union as the State\nof Wisconsin, all parties acted in quiet obedience to this\nordinance. It is now what Je\ufb00erson foresaw and intended \u2014\nthe happy home of teeming millions of free, white,\nprosperous people, and no slave among them.\nThus, \nwith \nthe \nauthor \nof \nthe \nDeclaration \nof\nIndependence, the policy of prohibiting slavery in new\nterritory originated. Thus, away back to the Constitution, in\nthe pure, fresh, free breath of the Revolution, the State of\nVirginia and the national Congress put that policy into\npractice. Thus, through more than sixty of the best years of\nthe republic, did that policy steadily work to its great and\nbene\ufb01cent end. And thus, in those \ufb01ve States, and in \ufb01ve\nmillions of free, enterprising people, we have before us the\nrich fruits of this policy.\nBut now new light breaks upon us. Now Congress\ndeclares this ought never to have been, and the like of it\n must never be again. The sacred right of self-government is\ngrossly violated by it. We even \ufb01nd some men who drew\ntheir \ufb01rst breath \u2014 and every other breath of their lives \u2014\nunder this very restriction, now live in dread of absolute\nsu\ufb00ocation if they should be restricted in the \u201csacred right\u201d\nof taking slaves to Nebraska. That perfect liberty they sigh\nfor \u2014 the liberty of making slaves of other people, Je\ufb00erson\nnever thought of, their own fathers never thought of, they\nnever thought of themselves, a year ago. How fortunate for\nthem they did not sooner become sensible of their great\nmisery! Oh, how di\ufb00icult it is to treat with respect such\nassaults upon all we have ever really held sacred!\nBut to return to history. In  we purchased what was\nthen called Louisiana, of France. It included the present\nStates of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa; also the\nTerritory of Minnesota, and the present bone of contention,\nKansas and Nebraska. Slavery already existed among the\nFrench at New Orleans, and to some extent at St. Louis. In\n Louisiana came into the Union as a slave State,\nwithout controversy. In  or \u2018, Missouri showed signs\nof a wish to come in with slavery. This was resisted by\nNorthern members of Congress; and thus began the \ufb01rst\ngreat slavery agitation in the nation. This controversy\nlasted several months, and became very angry and exciting\n\u2014 the House of Representatives voting steadily for the\nprohibition of slavery in Missouri, and the Senate voting as\nsteadily against it. Threats of the breaking up of the Union\nwere freely made, and the ablest public men of the day\nbecame seriously alarmed. At length a compromise was\n made, in which, as in all compromises, both sides yielded\nsomething. It was a law, passed on the th of March, ,\nproviding that Missouri might come into the Union with\nslavery, but that in all the remaining part of the territory\npurchased of France which lies north of thirty-six degrees\nand thirty minutes north latitude, slavery should never be\npermitted. \nThis \nprovision \nof \nlaw \nis \nthe \n\u201cMissouri\nCompromise.\u201d In excluding slavery north of the line, the\nsame language is employed as in the Ordinance of . It\ndirectly applied to Iowa, Minnesota, and to the present\nbone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska. Whether there\nshould or should not be slavery south of that line, nothing\nwas said in the law. But Arkansas constituted the principal\nremaining part south of the line; and it has since been\nadmitted as a slave State, without serious controversy.\nMore recently, Iowa, north of the line, came in as a free\nState without controversy. Still later, Minnesota, north of\nthe line, had a territorial organization without controversy.\nTexas, principally south of the line, and west of Arkansas,\nthough originally within the purchase from France, had, in\n, been traded o\ufb00 to Spain in our treaty for the\nacquisition of Florida. It had thus become a part of Mexico.\nMexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain.\nAmerican citizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in\nthe southern part of Texas. Soon they revolutionized\nagainst \nMexico, \nand \nestablished \nan \nindependent\ngovernment of their own, adopting a constitution with\nslavery, strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave\nStates. By still another rapid move, Texas, claiming a\n boundary much farther west than when we parted with her\nin , was brought back to the United States, and\nadmitted into the Union as a slave State. Then there was\nlittle or no settlement in the northern part of Texas, a\nconsiderable portion of which lay north of the Missouri line;\nand in the resolutions admitting her into the Union, the\nMissouri restriction was expressly extended westward\nacross her territory. This was in , only nine years ago.\nThus originated the Missouri Compromise; and thus has\nit been respected down to . And even four years later,\nin , our distinguished Senator, in a public address,\nheld the following language in relation to it:\n\u201cThe Missouri Compromise has been in practical\noperation for about a quarter of a century, and has received\nthe sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every\nsection of the Union. It has allayed all sectional jealousies\nand irritations growing out of this vexed question, and\nharmonized and tranquillized the whole country. It has\ngiven to Henry Clay, as its prominent champion, the proud\nsobriquet of the \u2018Great Paci\ufb01cator,\u2019 and by that title, and for\nthat service, his political friends had repeatedly appealed to\nthe people to rally under his standard as a Presidential\ncandidate, as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and\npower to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation, and\npreserve the Union. He was not aware that any man or any\nparty, from any section of the Union, had ever urged as an\nobjection to Mr. Clay that he was the great champion of the\nMissouri Compromise. On the contrary, the e\ufb00ort was made\nby the opponents of Mr. Clay to prove that he was not\n entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic\nmeasure, and that the honor was equally due to others, as\nwell as to him, for securing its adoption; that it had its\norigin in the hearts of all patriotic men, who desired to\npreserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious\nUnion \u2014 an origin akin to that of the Constitution of the\nUnited States, conceived in the same spirit of fraternal\na\ufb00ection, and calculated to remove forever the only danger\nwhich seemed to threaten, at some distant day, to sever the\nsocial bond of union. All the evidences of public opinion at\nthat day seemed to indicate that this compromise had been\ncanonized in the hearts of the American people, as a sacred\nthing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless\nenough to disturb.\u201d\nI do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an\ninconsistency. If he afterward thought he had been wrong,\nit was right for him to change. I bring this forward merely\nto show the high estimate placed on the Missouri\nCompromise by all parties up to so late as the year .\nBut going back a little in point of time. Our war with\nMexico broke out in . When Congress was about\nadjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place\ntwo millions of dollars under his control, to be used by him\nin the recess, if found practicable and expedient, in\nnegotiating a treaty of peace with Mexico, and acquiring\nsome part of her territory. A bill was duly gotten up for the\npurpose, and was progressing swimmingly in the House of\nRepresentatives, when a member by the name of David\nWilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, moved as an\n amendment, \u201cProvided, that in any territory thus acquired\nthere never shall be slavery.\u201d\nThis is the origin of the far-famed Wilmot Proviso. It\ncreated a great \ufb02utter; but it stuck like wax, was voted into\nthe bill, and the bill passed with it through the House. The\nSenate, however, adjourned without \ufb01nal action on it, and\nso both appropriation and proviso were lost for the time.\nThe war continued, and at the next session the President\nrenewed his request for the appropriation, enlarging the\namount, I think, to three millions. Again came the proviso,\nand defeated the measure. Congress adjourned again, and\nthe war went on. In December, , the new Congress\nassembled. I was in the lower House that term. The Wilmot\nProviso, or the principle of it, was constantly coming up in\nsome shape or other, and I think I may venture to say I\nvoted for it at least forty times during the short time I was\nthere. The Senate, however, held it in check, and it never\nbecame a law. In the spring of  a treaty of peace was\nmade with Mexico, by which we obtained that portion of\nher country which now constitutes the Territories of New\nMexico and Utah and the present State of California. By\nthis treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated, in so far as it\nwas intended to be a condition of the acquisition of\nterritory. Its friends, however, were still determined to \ufb01nd\nsome way to restrain slavery from getting into the new\ncountry. This new acquisition lay directly west of our old\npurchase from France, and extended west to the Paci\ufb01c\nOcean, and was so situated that if the Missouri line should\nbe extended straight west, the new country would be\n divided by such extended line, leaving some north and\nsome south of it. On Judge Douglas\u2019s motion, a bill, or\nprovision of a bill, passed the Senate to so extend the\nMissouri line. The proviso men in the House, including\nmyself, voted it down, because, by implication, it gave up\nthe southern part to slavery, while we were bent on having\nit all free.\nIn the fall of  the gold-mines were discovered in\nCalifornia. This attracted people to it with unprecedented\nrapidity, so that on, or soon after, the meeting of the new\nCongress in December, , she already had a population\nof nearly a hundred thousand, had called a convention,\nformed a State constitution excluding slavery, and was\nknocking for admission into the Union. The proviso men, of\ncourse, were for letting her in, but the Senate, always true\nto the other side, would not consent to her admission, and\nthere California stood, kept out of the Union because she\nwould not let slavery into her borders. Under all the\ncircumstances, perhaps, this was not wrong. There were\nother points of dispute connected with the general question\nof Slavery, which equally needed adjustment. The South\nclamored for a more e\ufb00icient fugitive slave law. The North\nclamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave\ntrade in the District of Columbia, in connection with which,\nin view from the windows of the Capitol, a sort of negro\nlivery-stable, where droves of negroes were collected,\ntemporarily kept, and \ufb01nally taken to Southern markets,\nprecisely like droves of horses, had been openly maintained\nfor \ufb01fty years. Utah and New Mexico needed territorial\n governments; and whether slavery should or should not be\nprohibited \nwithin \nthem \nwas \nanother \nquestion. \nThe\ninde\ufb01nite western boundary of Texas was to be settled. She\nwas a slave State, and consequently the farther west the\nslavery men could push her boundary, the more slave\ncountry they secured; and the farther east the slavery\nopponents could thrust the boundary back, the less slave\nground was secured. Thus this was just as clearly a slavery\nquestion as any of the others.\nThese points all needed adjustment, and they were held\nup, perhaps wisely, to make them help adjust one another.\nThe Union now, as in , was thought to be in danger,\nand devotion to the Union rightfully inclined men to yield\nsomewhat in points where nothing else could have so\ninclined them. A compromise was \ufb01nally e\ufb00ected. The\nSouth got their new fugitive slave law, and the North got\nCalifornia, (by far the best part of our acquisition from\nMexico) as a free State. The South got a provision that New\nMexico and Utah, when admitted as States, may come in\nwith or without slavery as they may then choose; and the\nNorth got the slave trade abolished in the District of\nColumbia.. The North got the western boundary of Texas\nthrown farther back eastward than the South desired; but,\nin turn, they gave Texas ten millions of dollars with which\nto pay her old debts. This is the Compromise of .\nPreceding the Presidential election of , each of the\ngreat political parties, Democrats and Whigs, met in\nconvention \nand \nadopted \nresolutions \nindorsing \nthe\nCompromise of \u2018, as a \u201c\ufb01nality,\u201d a \ufb01nal settlement, so far\n as these parties could make it so, of all slavery agitation.\nPrevious to this, in , the Illinois Legislature had\nindorsed it.\nDuring this long period of time, Nebraska (the Nebraska\nTerritory, not the State of as we know it now) had remained\nsubstantially an uninhabited country, but now emigration to\nand settlement within it began to take place. It is about one\nthird as large as the present United States, and its\nimportance, so long overlooked, begins to come into view.\nThe restriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise\ndirectly applies to it \u2014 in fact was \ufb01rst made, and has since\nbeen maintained expressly for it. In , a bill to give it a\nterritorial \ngovernment \npassed \nthe \nHouse \nof\nRepresentatives, and, in the hands of Judge Douglas, failed\nof passing only for want of time. This bill contained no\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise. Indeed, when it was\nassailed because it did not contain such repeal, Judge\nDouglas defended it in its existing form. On January ,\n, Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska\nterritorial government. He accompanies this bill with a\nreport, in which last he expressly recommends that the\nMissouri Compromise shall neither be a\ufb00irmed nor\nrepealed. Before long the bill is so modi\ufb01ed as to make two\nterritories instead of one, calling the southern one Kansas.\nAlso, about a month after the introduction of the bill, on\nthe Judge\u2019s own motion it is so amended as to declare the\nMissouri \nCompromise \ninoperative \nand \nvoid; \nand,\nsubstantially, that the people who go and settle there may\nestablish slavery, or exclude it, as they may see \ufb01t. In this\n shape the bill passed both branches of Congress and\nbecame a law.\nThis is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The\nforegoing history may not be precisely accurate in every\nparticular, but I am sure it is su\ufb00iciently so for all the use I\nshall attempt to make of it, and in it we have before us the\nchief material enabling us to judge correctly whether the\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong. I\nthink, and shall try to show, that it is wrong \u2014 wrong in its\ndirect e\ufb00ect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska, and\nwrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to\nevery other part of the wide world where men can be found\ninclined to take it.\nThis declared indi\ufb00erence, but, as I must think, covert\nreal zeal, for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate\nit because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate\nit because it deprives our republican example of its just\nin\ufb02uence in the world; enables the enemies of free\ninstitutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites;\ncauses the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity;\nand especially because it forces so many good men among\nourselves into an open war with the very fundamental\nprinciples of civil liberty, criticizing the Declaration of\nIndependence, and insisting that there is no right principle\nof action but self-interest.\nBefore proceeding let me say that I think I have no\nprejudice against the Southern people. They are just what\nwe would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist\namong them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist\n among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe\nof the masses North and South. Doubtless there are\nindividuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under\nany circumstances, and others who would gladly introduce\nslavery anew if it were out of existence. We know that some\nSouthern men do free their slaves, go North and become\ntip-top abolitionists, while some Northern ones go South\nand become most cruel slave masters.\nWhen Southern people tell us that they are no more\nresponsible for the origin of slavery than we are, I\nacknowledge the fact. When it is said that the institution\nexists, and that it is very di\ufb00icult to get rid of it in any\nsatisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the\nsaying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I\nshould not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were\ngiven me, I should not know what to do as to the existing\ninstitution. My \ufb01rst impulse would be to free all the slaves,\nand send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a\nmoment\u2019s re\ufb02ection would convince me that whatever of\nhigh hope (as I think there is) there may be in this in the\nlong run, its sudden execution is impossible. If they were\nall landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next\nten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus\nmoney enough to carry them there in many times ten days.\nWhat then? Free them all, and keep them among us as\nunderlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their\ncondition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at any\nrate, yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce\npeople upon. What next? Free them, and make them\n politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not\nadmit of this, and if mine would, we well know that those of\nthe great mass of whites will not. Whether this feeling\naccords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole\nquestion, if indeed it is any part of it. A universal feeling,\nwhether well or ill founded, cannot be safely disregarded.\nWe cannot then make them equals. It does seem to me that\nsystems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for\ntheir tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our\nbrethren of the South.\nWhen they remind us of their constitutional rights, I\nacknowledge them \u2014 not grudgingly, but fully and fairly;\nand I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of\ntheir fugitives which should not in its stringency be more\nlikely to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary\ncriminal laws are to hang an innocent one.\nBut all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse\nfor permitting slavery to go into our own free territory than\nit would for reviving the African slave trade by law. The law\nwhich forbids the bringing of slaves from Africa, and that\nwhich has so long forbidden the taking of them into\nNebraska, can hardy be distinguished on any moral\nprinciple, and the repeal of the former could \ufb01nd quite as\nplausible excuses as that of the latter.\nThe arguments by which the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise is sought to be justi\ufb01ed are these:\nFirst. That the Nebraska country needed a territorial\ngovernment.\n Second. That in various ways the public had repudiated\nthat compromise and\ndemanded the repeal, and therefore should not now\ncomplain of it.\nAnd, lastly, That the repeal establishes a principle which\nis\nintrinsically right.\nI will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn.\nFirst, then: If that country was in need of a territorial\norganization, could it not have had it as well without as\nwith a repeal? Iowa and Minnesota, to both of which the\nMissouri restriction applied, had, without its repeal, each in\nsuccession, territorial organizations. And even the year\nbefore, a bill for Nebraska itself was within an ace of\npassing without the repealing clause, and this in the hands\nof the same men who are now the champions of repeal.\nWhy no necessity then for repeal? But still later, when this\nvery bill was \ufb01rst brought in, it contained no repeal. But,\nsay they, because the people had demanded, or rather\ncommanded, the repeal, the repeal was to accompany the\norganization whenever that should occur.\nNow, I deny that the public ever demanded any such\nthing \u2014 ever repudiated the Missouri Compromise, ever\ncommanded its repeal. I deny it, and call for the proof. It is\nnot contended, I believe, that any such command has ever\nbeen given in express terms. It is only said that it was done\nin principle. The support of the Wilmot Proviso is the \ufb01rst\nfact mentioned to prove that the Missouri restriction was\n repudiated in principle, and the second is the refusal to\nextend the Missouri line over the country acquired from\nMexico. These are near enough alike to be treated together.\nThe one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the\nwhole new acquisition by the lump, and the other was to\nreject a division of it, by which one half was to be given up\nto those chances. Now, whether this was a repudiation of\nthe Missouri line in principle depends upon whether the\nMissouri law contained any principle requiring the line to\nbe extended over the country acquired from Mexico. I\ncontend it did not. I insist that it contained no general\nprinciple, but that it was, in every sense, speci\ufb01c. That its\nterms limit it to the country purchased from France is\nundenied and undeniable. It could have no principle beyond\nthe intention of those who made it. They did not intend to\nextend the line to country which they did not own. If they\nintended to extend it in the event of acquiring additional\nterritory, why did they not say so? It was just as easy to say\nthat \u201cin all the country west of the Mississippi which we\nnow own, or may hereafter acquire, there shall never be\nslavery,\u201d as to say what they did say; and they would have\nsaid it if they had meant it. An intention to extend the law is\nnot only not mentioned in the law, but is not mentioned in\nany contemporaneous history. Both the law itself, and the\nhistory of the times, are a blank as to any principle of\nextension; and by neither the known rules of construing\nstatutes and contracts, nor by common sense, can any such\nprinciple be inferred.\n Another fact showing the speci\ufb01c character of the\nMissouri law \u2014 showing that it intended no more than it\nexpressed, showing that the line was not intended as a\nuniversal dividing line between Free and Slave territory,\npresent and prospective, north of which slavery could never\ngo \u2014 is the fact that by that very law Missouri came in as a\nslave State, north of the line. If that law contained any\nprospective principle, the whole law must be looked to in\norder to ascertain what the principle was. And by this rule\nthe South could fairly contend that, inasmuch as they got\none slave State north of the line at the inception of the law,\nthey have the right to have another given them north of it\noccasionally, now and then, in the inde\ufb01nite westward\nextension of the line. This demonstrates the absurdity of\nattempting to deduce a prospective principle from the\nMissouri Compromise line.\nWhen we voted for the Wilmot Proviso we were voting to\nkeep slavery out of the whole Mexican acquisition, and\nlittle did we think we were thereby voting to let it into\nNebraska lying several hundred miles distant. When we\nvoted against extending the Missouri line, little did we\nthink we were voting to destroy the old line, then of near\nthirty years\u2019 standing.\nTo \nargue \nthat \nwe \nthus \nrepudiated \nthe \nMissouri\nCompromise is no less absurd than it would be to argue\nthat because we have so far forborne to acquire Cuba, we\nhave \nthereby, \nin \nprinciple, \nrepudiated \nour \nformer\nacquisitions and determined to throw them out of the\nUnion. No less absurd than it would be to say that because\n I may have refused to build an addition to my house, I\nthereby have decided to destroy the existing house! And if I\ncatch you setting \ufb01re to my house, you will turn upon me\nand say I instructed you to do it!\nThe most conclusive argument, however, that while for\nthe Wilmot Proviso, and while voting against the extension\nof the Missouri line, we never thought of disturbing the\noriginal Missouri Compromise, is found in the fact that\nthere was then, and still is, an unorganized tract of \ufb01ne\ncountry, nearly as large as the State of Missouri, lying\nimmediately west of Arkansas and south of the Missouri\nCompromise line, and that we never attempted to prohibit\nslavery as to it. I wish particular attention to this. It adjoins\nthe original Missouri Compromise line by its northern\nboundary, and consequently is part of the country into\nwhich by implication slavery was permitted to go by that\ncompromise. There it has lain open ever s, and there it still\nlies, and yet no e\ufb00ort has been made at any time to wrest it\nfrom the South. In all our struggles to prohibit slavery\nwithin our Mexican acquisitions, we never so much as lifted\na \ufb01nger to prohibit it as to this tract. Is not this entirely\nconclusive that at all times we have held the Missouri\nCompromise as a sacred thing, even when against\nourselves as well as when for us?\nSenator Douglas sometimes says the Missouri line itself\nwas in principle only an extension of the line of the\nOrdinance of \u2018 \u2014 that is to say, an extension of the Ohio\nRiver. I think this is weak enough on its face. I will remark,\nhowever, that, as a glance at the map will show, the\n Missouri line is a long way farther south than the Ohio, and\nthat if our Senator in proposing his extension had stuck to\nthe principle of jogging southward, perhaps it might not\nhave been voted down so readily.\nBut next it is said that the compromises of \u2018, and the\nrati\ufb01cation of them by both political parties in \u2018,\nestablished a new principle which required the repeal of\nthe Missouri Compromise. This again I deny. I deny it, and\ndemand the proof. I have already stated fully what the\ncompromises of \u2018 are. That particular part of those\nmeasures from which the virtual repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise is sought to be inferred (for it is admitted they\ncontain nothing about it in express terms) is the provision\nin the Utah and New Mexico laws which permits them\nwhen they seek admission into the Union as States to come\nin with or without slavery, as they shall then see \ufb01t. Now I\ninsist this provision was made for Utah and New Mexico,\nand for no other place whatever. It had no more direct\nreference to Nebraska than it had to the territories of the\nmoon. But, say they, it had reference to Nebraska in\nprinciple. Let us see. The North consented to this provision,\nnot because they considered it right in itself, but because\nthey were compensated \u2014 paid for it.\nThey at the same time got California into the Union as a\nfree State. This was far the best part of all they had\nstruggled for by the Wilmot Proviso. They also got the area\nof slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement of the\nboundary of Texas. Also they got the slave trade abolished\nin the District of Columbia.\n For all these desirable objects the North could a\ufb00ord to\nyield something; and they did yield to the South the Utah\nand New Mexico provision. I do not mean that the whole\nNorth, or even a majority, yielded, when the law passed;\nbut enough yielded \u2014 when added to the vote of the South,\nto carry the measure. Nor can it be pretended that the\nprinciple of this arrangement requires us to permit the\nsame provision to be applied to Nebraska, without any\nequivalent at all. Give us another free State; press the\nboundary of Texas still farther back; give us another step\ntoward the destruction of slavery in the District, and you\npresent us a similar case. But ask us not to repeat, for\nnothing, what you paid for in the \ufb01rst instance. If you wish\nthe thing again, pay again. That is the principle of the\ncompromises of \u2018, if, indeed, they had any principles\nbeyond their speci\ufb01c terms \u2014 it was the system of\nequivalents.\nAgain, if Congress, at that time, intended that all future\nTerritories should, when admitted as States, come in with\nor without slavery at their own option, why did it not say\nso? With such a universal provision, all know the bills could\nnot have passed. Did they, then \u2014 could they-establish a\nprinciple contrary to their own intention? Still further, if\nthey intended to establish the principle that, whenever\nCongress had control, it should be left to the people to do\nas they thought \ufb01t with slavery, why did they not authorize\nthe people of the District of Columbia, at their option, to\nabolish slavery within their limits?\n I personally know that this has not been left undone\nbecause it was unthought of. It was frequently spoken of by\nmembers of Congress, and by citizens of Washington, six\nyears ago; and I heard no one express a doubt that a\nsystem of gradual emancipation, with compensation to\nowners, would meet the approbation of a large majority of\nthe white people of the District. But without the action of\nCongress they could say nothing; and Congress said \u201cNo.\u201d\nIn the measures of , Congress had the subject of\nslavery in the District expressly on hand. If they were then\nestablishing the principle of allowing the people to do as\nthey please with slavery, why did they not apply the\nprinciple to that people?\nAgain it is claimed that by the resolutions of the Illinois\nLegislature, passed in , the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise was demanded. This I deny also. Whatever\nmay be worked out by a criticism of the language of those\nresolutions, the people have never understood them as\nbeing any more than an indorsement of the compromises of\n, and a release of our senators from voting for the\nWilmot Proviso. The whole people are living witnesses that\nthis only was their view. Finally, it is asked, \u201cIf we did not\nmean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision to all\nfuture territories, what did we mean when we, in ,\nindorsed the compromises of ?\u201d\nFor myself I can answer this question most easily. I\nmeant not to ask a repeal or modi\ufb01cation of the Fugitive\nSlave law. I meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in\nthe District of Columbia. I meant not to resist the admission\n of Utah and New Mexico, even should they ask to come in\nas \nslave \nStates. \nI \nmeant \nnothing \nabout \nadditional\nTerritories, because, as I understood, we then had no\nTerritory whose character as to slavery was not already\nsettled. As to Nebraska, I regarded its character as being\n\ufb01xed by the Missouri Compromise for thirty years \u2014 as\nunalterably \ufb01xed as that of my own home in Illinois. As to\nnew acquisitions, I said, \u201cSu\ufb00icient unto the day is the evil\nthereof.\u201d When we make new acquisitions, we will, as\nheretofore, try to manage them somehow. That is my\nanswer; that is what I meant and said; and I appeal to the\npeople to say each for himself whether that is not also the\nuniversal meaning of the free States.\nAnd now, in turn, let me ask a few questions. If, by any or\nall these matters, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\nwas commanded, why was not the command sooner\nobeyed? Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska Bill of\n? Why was it omitted in the original bill of ? Why\nin \nthe \naccompanying \nreport \nwas \nsuch \na \nrepeal\ncharacterized as a departure from the course pursued in\n and its continued omission recommended?\nI am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the\nsubsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of\nthe bill. This argument seems wonderful to me. It is as if\none should argue that white and black are not di\ufb00erent. He\nadmits, however, that there is a literal change in the bill,\nand that he made the change in deference to other senators\nwho would not support the bill without. This proves that\nthose other senators thought the change a substantial one,\n and that the Judge thought their opinions worth deferring\nto. His own opinions, therefore, seem not to rest on a very\n\ufb01rm basis, even in his own mind; and I suppose the world\nbelieves, and will continue to believe, that precisely on the\nsubstance of that change this whole agitation has arisen.\nI conclude, then, that the public never demanded the\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise.\nI now come to consider whether the appeal with its\navowed principles, is intrinsically right. I insist that it is\nnot. Take the particular case. A controversy had arisen\nbetween the advocates and opponents of slavery, in relation\nto its establishment within the country we had purchased of\nFrance. The southern, and then best, part of the purchase\nwas already in as a slave State. The controversy was settled\nby also letting Missouri in as a slave State; but with the\nagreement that within all the remaining part of the\npurchase, north of a certain line, there should never be\nslavery. As to what was to be done with the remaining part,\nsouth of the line, nothing was said; but perhaps the fair\nimplication was, it should come in with slavery if it should\nso choose. The southern part, except a portion heretofore\nmentioned, afterward did come in with slavery, as the State\nof Arkansas. All these many years, since , the northern\npart had remained a wilderness. At length settlements\nbegan in it also. In due course Iowa came in as a free State,\nand Minnesota was given a territorial government, without\nremoving the slavery restriction. Finally, the sole remaining\npart north of the line \u2014 Kansas and Nebraska \u2014 was to be\norganized; and it is proposed, and carried, to blot out the\n old dividing line of thirty-four years\u2019 standing, and to open\nthe whole of that country to the introduction of slavery.\nNow this, to my mind, is manifestly unjust. After an angry\nand dangerous controversy, the parties made friends by\ndividing the bone of contention. The one party \ufb01rst\nappropriates her own share, beyond all power to be\ndisturbed in the possession of it, and then seizes the share\nof the other party. It is as if two starving men had divided\ntheir only loaf, the one had hastily swallowed his half, and\nthen grabbed the other\u2019s half just as he was putting it to his\nmouth.\nLet me here drop the main argument, to notice what I\nconsider rather an inferior matter. It is argued that slavery\nwill not go to Kansas and Nebraska, in any event. This is a\npalliation, a lullaby. I have some hope that it will not; but\nlet us not be too con\ufb01dent. As to climate, a glance at the\nmap shows that there are \ufb01ve slave States \u2014 Delaware,\nMaryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and also the\nDistrict of Columbia, all north of the Missouri Compromise\nline. The census returns of  show that within these\nthere are eight hundred and sixty-seven thousand two\nhundred and seventy-six slaves, being more than one fourth\nof all the slaves in the nation.\nIt is not climate, then, that will keep slavery out of these\nTerritories. Is there anything in the peculiar nature of the\ncountry? Missouri adjoins these Territories by her entire\nwestern boundary, and slavery is already within every one\nof her western counties. I have even heard it said that there\nare more slaves in proportion to whites in the northwestern\n county of Missouri than within any other county in the\nState. Slavery pressed entirely up to the old western\nboundary of the State, and when rather recently a part of\nthat boundary at the northwest was moved out a little\nfarther west, slavery followed on quite up to the new line.\nNow, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it\nfrom going still farther? Climate will not, no peculiarity of\nthe country will, nothing in nature will. Will the disposition\nof the people prevent it? Those nearest the scene are all in\nfavor of the extension. The Yankees who are opposed to it\nmay be most \ufb02umerous; but, in military phrase, the\nbattle\ufb01eld is too far from their base of operations.\nBut it is said there now is no law in Nebraska on the\nsubject of slavery, and that, in such case, taking a slave\nthere operates his freedom. That is good book-law, but it is\nnot the rule of actual practice. Wherever slavery is it has\nbeen \ufb01rst introduced without law. The oldest laws we \ufb01nd\nconcerning it are not laws introducing it, but regulating it\nas an already existing thing. A white man takes his slave to\nNebraska now. Who will inform the negro that he is free?\nWho will take him before court to test the question of his\nfreedom? In ignorance of his legal emancipation he is kept\nchopping, splitting, and plowing. Others are brought, and\nmove on in the same track. At last, if ever the time for\nvoting comes on the question of slavery the institution\nalready, in fact, exists in the country, and cannot well be\nremoved. The fact of its presence, and the di\ufb00iculty of its\nremoval, will carry the vote in its favor. Keep it out until a\nvote is taken, and a vote in favor of it cannot be got in any\n population of forty thousand on earth, who have been\ndrawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and\nsettlement. To get slaves into the Territory simultaneously\nwith the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the\nprecise stake played for and won in this Nebraska measure.\nThe question is asked us: \u201cIf slaves will go in\nnotwithstanding the general principle of law liberates\nthem, why would they not equally go in against positive\nstatute law \u2014 go in, even if the Missouri restriction were\nmaintained!\u201d I answer, because it takes a much bolder man\nto venture in with his property in the latter case than in the\nformer; because the positive Congressional enactment is\nknown to and respected by all, or nearly all, whereas the\nnegative principle that no law is free law is not much\nknown except among lawyers. We have some experience of\nthis practical di\ufb00erence. In spite of the Ordinance of \u2018, a\nfew negroes were brought into Illinois, and held in a state\nof quasi-slavery, not enough, however, to carry a vote of the\npeople in favor of the institution when they came to form a\nconstitution. But into the adjoining Missouri country, where\nthere was no Ordinance of \u2018, \u2014 was no restriction, \u2014\nthey were carried ten times, nay, a hundred times, as fast,\nand actually made a slave State. This is fact-naked fact.\nAnother lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new\ncountries does not increase their number, does not make\nany one slave who would otherwise be free. There is some\ntruth in this, and I am glad of it; but it is not wholly true.\nThe African slave trade is not yet e\ufb00ectually suppressed;\nand, if we make a reasonable deduction for the white\n people among us who are foreigners and the descendants\nof foreigners arriving here since , we shall \ufb01nd the\nincrease of the black population outrunning that of the\nwhite to an extent unaccountable, except by supposing that\nsome of them, too, have been coming from Africa. If this be\nso, the opening of new countries to the institution increases\nthe demand for and augments the price of slaves, and so\ndoes, in fact, make slaves of freemen, by causing them to\nbe brought from Africa and sold into bondage.\nBut however this may be, we know the opening of new\ncountries to slavery tends to the perpetuation of the\ninstitution, and so does keep men in slavery who would\notherwise be free. This result we do not feel like favoring,\nand we are under no legal obligation to suppress our\nfeelings in this respect.\nEqual justice to the South, it is said, requires us to\nconsent to the extension of slavery to new countries. That\nis to say, inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my\nhog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object to your taking\nyour slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly logical if there\nis no di\ufb00erence between hogs and negroes. But while you\nthus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish\nto ask whether you of the South, yourselves, have ever\nbeen willing to do as much? It is kindly provided that of all\nthose who come into the world only a small percentage are\nnatural tyrants. That percentage is no larger in the slave\nStates than in the free. The great majority South, as well as\nNorth, have human sympathies, of which they can no more\ndivest themselves than they can of their sensibility to\n physical pain. These sympathies in the bosoms of the\nSouthern people manifest, in many ways, their sense of the\nwrong of slavery, and their consciousness that, after all,\nthere is humanity in the negro. If they deny this, let me\naddress them a few plain questions. In  you (the\nSouth) joined the North, almost unanimously, in declaring\nthe African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the\npunishment of death. Why did you do this? If you did not\nfeel that it was wrong, why did you join in providing that\nmen should be hung for it? The practice was no more than\nbringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy\nthem. But you never thought of hanging men for catching\nand selling wild horses, wild bu\ufb00aloes, or wild bears.\nAgain, you have among you a sneaking individual of the\nclass of native tyrants known as the \u201cslavedealer.\u201d He\nwatches your necessities, and crawls up to buy your slave,\nat a speculating price. If you cannot help it, you sell to him;\nbut if you can help it, you drive him from your door. You\ndespise him utterly. You do not recognize him as a friend, or\neven as an honest man. Your children must not play with\nhis; they may rollick freely with the little negroes, but not\nwith the slave-dealer\u2019s children. If you are obliged to deal\nwith him, you try to get through the job without so much as\ntouching him. It is common with you to join hands with the\nmen you meet, but with the slave-dealer you avoid the\nceremony \u2014 instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact.\nIf he grows rich and retires from business, you still\nremember him, and still keep up the ban of non-intercourse\n upon him and his family. Now, why is this? You do not so\ntreat the man who deals in corn, cotton, or tobacco.\nAnd yet again: There are in the United States and\nTerritories, including the District of Columbia, , free\nblacks. At \ufb01ve hundred dollars per head they are worth\nover two hundred millions of dollars. How comes this vast\namount of property to be running about without owners?\nWe do not see free horses or free cattle running at large.\nHow is this? All these free blacks are the descendants of\nslaves, or have been slaves themselves; and they would be\nslaves now but for something which has operated on their\nwhite owners, inducing them at vast pecuniary sacri\ufb01ce to\nliberate them. What is that something? Is there any\nmistaking it? In all these cases it is your sense of justice\nand human sympathy continually telling you that the poor\nnegro has some natural right to himself \u2014 that those who\ndeny it and make mere merchandise of him deserve\nkickings, contempt, and death.\nAnd now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the\nslave, and estimate him as only the equal of the hog? Why\nask us to do what you will not do yourselves? Why ask us to\ndo for nothing what two hundred millions of dollars could\nnot induce you to do?\nBut one great argument in support of the repeal of the\nMissouri Compromise is still to come. That argument is\n\u201cthe sacred right of self-government.\u201d It seems our\ndistinguished Senator has found great di\ufb00iculty in getting\nhis antagonists, even in the Senate, to meet him fairly on\nthis argument. Some poet has said:\n \u201cFools rush in where angels fear to tread.\u201d\nAt the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this\nquotation, I meet that argument \u2014 I rush in \u2014 I take that\nbull by the horns. I trust I understand and truly estimate\nthe right of self-government. My faith in the proposition\nthat each man should do precisely as he pleases with all\nwhich is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the\nsense of justice there is in me. I extend the principle to\ncommunities of men as well as to individuals. I so extend it\nbecause it is politically wise, as well as naturally just;\npolitically wise in saving us from broils about matters\nwhich do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would\nnot trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the\ncranberry laws of Indiana. The doctrine of self-government\nis right, \u2014 absolutely and eternally right, \u2014 but it has no\njust application as here attempted. Or perhaps I should\nrather say that whether it has such application depends\nupon whether a negro is or is not a man. If he is not a man,\nin that case he who is a man may as a matter of self-\ngovernment do just what he pleases with him. But if the\nnegro is a man, is it not to that extent a total destruction of\nself-government to say that he too shall not govern himself?\nWhen the white man governs himself, that is self-\ngovernment; but when he governs himself and also governs\nanother man, that is more than self-government \u2014 that is\ndespotism. If the negro is a man, why, then, my ancient\nfaith teaches me that \u201call men are created equal,\u201d and that\nthere can be no moral right in connection with one man\u2019s\nmaking a slave of another.\n Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm,\nparaphrases our argument by saying: \u201cThe white people of\nNebraska are good enough to govern themselves, but they\nare not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes!\u201d\nWell, I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will\ncontinue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere.\nI do not say the contrary. What I do say is that no man is\ngood enough to govern another man without that other\u2019s\nconsent. I say this is the leading principle, the sheet-anchor\nof \nAmerican \nrepublicanism. \nOur \nDeclaration \nof\nIndependence says:\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are\ncreated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\ncertain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,\nand the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,\ngovernments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR\nJUST \nPOWERS \nPROM \nTHE \nCONSENT \nOF \nTHE\nGOVERNED.\u201d\nI have quoted so much at this time merely to show that,\naccording to our ancient faith, the just powers of\ngovernment are derived from the consent of the governed.\nNow the relation of master and slave is pro tanto a total\nviolation of this principle. The master not only governs the\nslave without his consent, but he governs him by a set of\nrules altogether di\ufb00erent from those which he prescribes\nfor himself. Allow all the governed an equal voice in the\ngovernment, and that, and that only, is self-government.\nLet it not be said that I am contending for the\nestablishment of political and social equality between the\n whites and blacks. I have already said the contrary. I am\nnot combating the argument of necessity, arising from the\nfact that the blacks are already among us; but I am\ncombating what is set up as moral argument for allowing\nthem to be taken where they have never yet been \u2014\narguing against the extension of a bad thing, which, where\nit already exists, we must of necessity manage as we best\ncan.\nIn support of his application of the doctrine of self-\ngovernment, Senator Douglas has sought to bring to his aid\nthe opinions and examples of our Revolutionary fathers. I\nam glad he has done this. I love the sentiments of those old-\ntime men, and shall be most happy to abide by their\nopinions. He shows us that when it was in contemplation\nfor the colonies to break o\ufb00 from Great Britain, and set up\na new government for themselves, several of the States\ninstructed their delegates to go for the measure, provided\neach State should be allowed to regulate its domestic\nconcerns in its own way. I do not quote; but this in\nsubstance. This was right; I see nothing objectionable in it.\nI also think it probable that it had some reference to the\nexistence of slavery among them. I will not deny that it had.\nBut had it any reference to the carrying of slavery into new\ncountries? That is the question, and we will let the fathers\nthemselves answer it.\nThis same generation of men, and mostly the same\nindividuals of the generation who declared this principle,\nwho declared independence, who fought the war of the\nRevolution through, who afterward made the Constitution\n under which we still live \u2014 these same men passed the\nOrdinance of \u2018, declaring that slavery should never go to\nthe Northwest Territory.\nI have no doubt Judge Douglas thinks they were very\ninconsistent in this. It is a question of discrimination\nbetween them and him. But there is not an inch of ground\nleft for his claiming that their opinions, their example, their\nauthority, are on his side in the controversy.\nAgain, is not Nebraska, while a Territory, a part of us? Do\nwe not own the country? And if we surrender the control of\nit, do we not surrender the right of self-government? It is\npart of ourselves. If you say we shall not control it, because\nit is only part, the same is true of every other part; and\nwhen all the parts are gone, what has become of the whole?\nWhat is then left of us? What use for the General\nGovernment, when there is nothing left for it to govern?\nBut you say this question should be left to the people of\nNebraska, because they are more particularly interested. If\nthis be the rule, you must leave it to each individual to say\nfor himself whether he will have slaves. What better moral\nright have thirty-one citizens of Nebraska to say that the\nthirty-second shall not hold slaves than the people of the\nthirty-one States have to say that slavery shall not go into\nthe thirty-second State at all?\nBut if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to\ntake and hold slaves there, it is equally their sacred right to\nbuy them where they can buy them cheapest; and that,\nundoubtedly, will be on the coast of Africa, provided you\nwill consent not to hang them for going there to buy them.\n You must remove this restriction, too, from the sacred right\nof self-government. I am aware you say that taking slaves\nfrom the States to Nebraska does not make slaves of\nfreemen; but the African slave-trader can say just as much.\nHe does not catch free negroes and bring them here. He\n\ufb01nds them already slaves in the hands of their black\ncaptors, and he honestly buys them at the rate of a red\ncotton handkerchief a head. This is very cheap, and it is a\ngreat abridgment of the sacred right of self-government to\nhang men for engaging in this pro\ufb01table trade.\nAnother important objection to this application of the\nright of self-government is that it enables the \ufb01rst few to\ndeprive the succeeding many of a free exercise of the right\nof self-government. The \ufb01rst few may get slavery in, and\nthe subsequent many cannot easily get it out. How common\nis the remark now in the slave States, \u201cIf we were only\nclear of our slaves, how much better it would be for us.\u201d\nThey are actually deprived of the privilege of governing\nthemselves as they would, by the action of a very few in the\nbeginning. The same thing was true of the whole nation at\nthe time our Constitution was formed.\nWhether slavery shall go into Nebraska, or other new\nTerritories, is not a matter of exclusive concern to the\npeople who may go there. The whole nation is interested\nthat the best use shall be made of these Territories. We\nwant them for homes of free white people. This they cannot\nbe, to any considerable extent, if slavery shall be planted\nwithin them. Slave States are places for poor white people\nto remove from, not to remove to. New free States are the\n places for poor people to go to, and better their condition.\nFor this use the nation needs these Territories.\nStill further: there are constitutional relations between\nthe slave and free States which are degrading to the latter.\nWe are under legal obligations to catch and return their\nrunaway slaves to them: a sort of dirty, disagreeable job,\nwhich, I believe, as a general rule, the slaveholders will not\nperform for one another. Then again, in the control of the\ngovernment \u2014 the management of the partnership a\ufb00airs\n\u2014 they have greatly the advantage of us. By the\nConstitution each State has two senators, each has a\nnumber of representatives in proportion to the number of\nits people, and each has a number of Presidential electors\nequal \nto \nthe \nwhole \nnumber \nof \nits \nsenators \nand\nrepresentatives together. But in ascertaining the number of\nthe people for this purpose, \ufb01ve slaves are counted as\nbeing equal to three whites. The slaves do not vote; they\nare only counted and so used as to swell the in\ufb02uence of\nthe white people\u2019s votes. The practical e\ufb00ect of this is more\naptly shown by a comparison of the States of South\nCarolina \nand \nMaine. \nSouth \nCarolina \nhas \nsix\nrepresentatives, and so has Maine; South Carolina has\neight Presidential electors, and so has Maine. This is\nprecise equality so far; and of course they are equal in\nsenators, each having two. Thus in the control of the\ngovernment the two States are equals precisely. But how\nare they in the number of their white people? Maine has\n,, while South Carolina has ,; Maine has\ntwice as many as South Carolina, and , over. Thus,\n each white man in South Carolina is more than the double\nof any man in Maine. This is all because South Carolina,\nbesides her free people, has , slaves. The South\nCarolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white\nman in every other free State as well as in Maine. He is\nmore than the double of any one of us in this crowd. The\nsame advantage, but not to the same extent, is held by all\nthe citizens of the slave States over those of the free; and it\nis an absolute truth, without an exception, that there is no\nvoter in any slave State but who has more legal power in\nthe government than any voter in any free State. There is\nno instance of exact equality; and the disadvantage is\nagainst us the whole chapter through. This principle, in the\naggregate, gives the slave States in the present Congress\ntwenty additional representatives, being seven more than\nthe whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska Bill.\nNow all this is manifestly unfair; yet I do not mention it\nto complain of it, in so far as it is already settled. It is in the\nConstitution, and I do not for that cause, or any other\ncause, propose to destroy, or alter, or disregard the\nConstitution. I stand to it, fairly, fully, and \ufb01rmly.\nBut when I am told I must leave it altogether to other\npeople to say whether new partners are to be bred up and\nbrought into the \ufb01rm, on the same degrading terms against\nme, I respectfully demur. I insist that whether I shall be a\nwhole man or only the half of one, in comparison with\nothers is a question in which I am somewhat concerned,\nand one which no other man can have a sacred right of\ndeciding for me. If I am wrong in this, if it really be a\n sacred right of self-government in the man who shall go to\nNebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or\nthe double of me, then, after he shall have exercised that\nright, and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller\nfraction of a man than I already am, I should like for some\ngentleman, deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights,\nto provide himself with a microscope, and peep about, and\n\ufb01nd out, if he can, what has become of my sacred rights.\nThey will surely be too small for detection with the naked\neye.\nFinally, I insist that if there is anything which it is the\nduty of the whole people to never intrust to any hands but\ntheir own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of\ntheir own liberties and institutions. And if they shall think\nas I do, that the extension of slavery endangers them more\nthan any or all other causes, how recreant to themselves if\nthey submit The question, and with it the fate of their\ncountry, to a mere handful of men bent only on seif-interest.\nIf this question of slavery extension were an insigni\ufb01cant\none, one having no power to do harm \u2014 it might be shu\ufb04ed\naside in this way; and being, as it is, the great Behemoth of\ndanger, shall the strong grip of the nation be loosened upon\nhim, to intrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers?\nI have done with this mighty argument of self-\ngovernment. Go, sacred thing! Go in peace.\nBut Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure.\nWell, I too go for saving the Union. Much as I hate slavery, I\nwould consent to the extension of it rather than see the\nUnion dissolved, just as I would consent to any great evil to\n avoid a greater one. But when I go to Union-saving, I must\nbelieve, at least, that the means I employ have some\nadaptation to the end. To my mind, Nebraska has no such\nadaptation.\n\u201cIt hath no relish of salvation in it.\u201d\nIt is an aggravation, rather, of the only one thing which\never endangers the Union. When it came upon us, all was\npeace and quiet. The nation was looking to the forming of\nnew bends of union, and a long course of peace and\nprosperity seemed to lie before us. In the whole range of\npossibility, there scarcely appears to me to have been\nanything out of which the slavery agitation could have been\nrevived, except the very project of repealing the Missouri\nCompromise. Every inch of territory we owned already had\na de\ufb01nite settlement of the slavery question, by which all\nparties were pledged to abide. Indeed, there was no\nuninhabited country on the continent which we could\nacquire, if we except some extreme northern regions which\nare wholly out of the question.\nIn this state of a\ufb00airs the Genius of Discord himself could\nscarcely have invented a way of again setting us by the ears\nbut by turning back and destroying the peace measures of\nthe past. The counsels of that Genius seem to have\nprevailed. The Missouri Compromise was repealed; and\nhere we are in the midst of a new slavery agitation, such, I\nthink, as we have never seen before. Who is responsible for\nthis? Is it those who resist the measure, or those who\ncauselessly brought it forward, and pressed it through,\nhaving reason to know, and in fact knowing, it must and\n would be so resisted? It could not but be expected by its\nauthor that it would be looked upon as a measure for the\nextension of slavery, aggravated by a gross breach of faith.\nArgue as you will and long as you will, this is the naked\nfront and aspect of the measure. And in this aspect it could\nnot but produce agitation. Slavery is founded in the\nsel\ufb01shness of man\u2019s nature \u2014 opposition to it in his love of\njustice. These principles are at eternal antagonism, and\nwhen brought into collision so \ufb01ercely as slavery extension\nbrings them, shocks and throes and convulsions must\nceaselessly follow. Repeal the Missouri Compromise, repeal\nall compromises, repeal the Declaration of Independence,\nrepeal all past history, you still cannot repeal human\nnature. It still will be the abundance of man\u2019s heart that\nslavery extension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his\nheart his mouth will continue to speak.\nThe structure, too, of the Nebraska Bill is very peculiar.\nThe people are to decide the question of slavery for\nthemselves; but when they are to decide, or how they are to\ndecide, or whether, when the question is once decided, it is\nto remain so or is to be subject to an inde\ufb01nite succession\nof new trials, the law does not say. Is it to be decided by the\n\ufb01rst dozen settlers who arrive there, or is it to await the\narrival of a hundred? Is it to be decided by a vote of the\npeople or a vote of the Legislature, or, indeed, by a vote of\nany sort? To these questions the law gives no answer. There\nis a mystery about this; for when a member proposed to\ngive the Legislature express authority to exclude slavery, it\nwas hooted down by the friends of the bill. This fact is\n worth remembering. Some Yankees in the East are sending\nemigrants to Nebraska to exclude slavery from it; and, so\nfar as I can judge, they expect the question to be decided\nby voting in some way or other. But the Missourians are\nawake, too. They are within a stone\u2019s-throw of the\ncontested ground. They hold meetings and pass resolutions,\nin which not the slightest allusion to voting is made. They\nresolve that slavery already exists in the Territory; that\nmore shall go there; that they, remaining in Missouri, will\nprotect it, and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven\naway. Through all this bowie knives and six-shooters are\nseen plainly enough, but never a glimpse of the ballot-box.\nAnd, really, what is the result of all this? Each party\nwithin having numerous and determined backers without,\nis it not probable that the contest will come to blows and\nbloodshed? Could there be a more apt invention to bring\nabout collision and violence on the slavery question than\nthis Nebraska project is? I do not charge or believe that\nsuch was intended by Congress; but if they had literally\nformed a ring and placed champions within it to \ufb01ght out\nthe controversy, the \ufb01ght could be no more likely to come\no\ufb00 than it is. And if this \ufb01ght should begin, is it likely to\ntake a very peaceful, Union-saving turn? Will not the \ufb01rst\ndrop of blood so shed be the real knell of the Union?\nThe Missouri Compromise ought to be restored. For the\nsake of the Union, it ought to be restored. We ought to elect\na House of Representatives which will vote its restoration.\nIf by any means we omit to do this, what follows? Slavery\nmay or may not be established in Nebraska. But whether it\n be or not, we shall have repudiated \u2014 discarded from the\ncouncils of the nation \u2014 the spirit of compromise; for who,\nafter this, will ever trust in a national compromise? The\nspirit of mutual concession \u2014 that spirit which \ufb01rst gave us\nthe Constitution, and which has thrice saved the Union \u2014\nwe shall have strangled and cast from us forever. And what\nshall we have in lieu of it? The South \ufb02ushed with triumph\nand tempted to excess; the North, betrayed as they believe,\nbrooding on wrong and burning for revenge. One side will\nprovoke, the other resent. The one will taunt, the other\ndefy; one aggresses, the other retaliates. Already a few in\nthe North defy all constitutional restraints, resist the\nexecution of the Fugitive Slave law, and even menace the\ninstitution of slavery in the States where it exists. Already a\nfew in the South claim the constitutional right to take and\nto hold slaves in the free States, demand the revival of the\nslave trade, and demand a treaty with Great Britain by\nwhich fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada. As\nyet they are but few on either side. It is a grave question\nfor lovers of the union whether the \ufb01nal destruction of the\nMissouri Compromise, and with it the spirit of all\ncompromise, will or will not embolden and embitter each of\nthese, and fatally increase the number of both.\nBut restore the compromise, and what then? We thereby\nrestore the national faith, the national con\ufb01dence, the\nnational feeling of brotherhood. We thereby reinstate the\nspirit of concession and compromise, that spirit which has\nnever failed us in past perils, and which may be safely\ntrusted for all the future. The South ought to join in doing\n this. The peace of the nation is as dear to them as to us. In\nmemories of the past and hopes of the future, they share as\nlargely as we. It would be on their part a great act \u2014 great\nin its spirit, and great in its e\ufb00ect. It would be worth to the\nnation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity.\nAnd what of sacri\ufb01ce would they make? They only\nsurrender to us what they gave us for a consideration long,\nlong ago; what they have not now asked for, struggled or\ncared for; what has been thrust upon them, not less to their\nastonishment than to ours.\nBut it is said we cannot restore it; that though we elect\nevery member of the lower House, the Senate is still\nagainst us. It is quite true that of the senators who passed\nthe Nebraska Bill a majority of the whole Senate will retain\ntheir seats in spite of the elections of this and the next year.\nBut if at these elections their several constituencies shall\nclearly express their will against Nebraska, will these\nsenators disregard their will? Will they neither obey nor\nmake room for those who will?\nBut even if we fail to technically restore the compromise,\nit is still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the\nrestoration. The moral weight of such a vote cannot be\nestimated too highly. The authors of Nebraska are not at all\nsatis\ufb01ed with the destruction of the compromise \u2014 an\nindorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the great\nobject. With them, Nebraska alone is a small matter \u2014 to\nestablish a principle for future use is what they particularly\ndesire.\n The future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever\nin the wide world local and unorganized opposition cannot\nprevent it. Now, if you wish to give them this indorsement,\nif you wish to establish this principle, do so. I shall regret\nit, but it is your right. On the contrary, if you are opposed to\nthe principle, \u2014 intend to give it no such indorsement, let\nno wheedling, no sophistry, divert you from throwing a\ndirect vote against it.\nSome men, mostly Whigs, who condemn the repeal of the\nMissouri Compromise, nevertheless hesitate to go for its\nrestoration, lest they be thrown in company with the\nabolitionists. Will they allow me, as an old Whig, to tell\nthem, good-humoredly, that I think this is very silly? Stand\nwith anybody that stands right. Stand with him while he is\nright, and part with him when he goes wrong. Stand with\nthe abolitionist in restoring the Missouri Compromise, and\nstand against him when he attempts to repeal the Fugitive\nSlave law. In the latter case you stand with the Southern\ndisunionist. What of that? You are still right. In both cases\nyou are right. In both cases you oppose the dangerous\nextremes. In both you stand on middle ground, and hold the\nship level and steady. In both you are national, and nothing\nless than national. This is the good old Whig ground. To\ndesert such ground because of any company is to be less\nthan a Whig \u2014 less than a man \u2014 less than an American.\nI particularly object to the new position which the\navowed principle of this Nebraska law gives to slavery in\nthe body politic. I object to it because it assumes that there\ncan be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another. I\n object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a free people \u2014 a\nsad evidence that, feeling prosperity, we forget right; that\nliberty, as a principle, we have ceased to revere. I object to\nit because the fathers of the republic eschewed and\nrejected it. The argument of \u201cnecessity\u201d was the only\nargument they ever admitted in favor of slavery; and so far,\nand so far only, as it carried them did they ever go. They\nfound the institution existing among us, which they could\nnot help, and they cast blame upon the British king for\nhaving permitted its introduction.\nThe royally appointed Governor of Georgia in the early\n\u2019s was threatened by the King with removal if he\ncontinued to oppose slavery in his colony \u2014 at that time the\nKing of England made a small pro\ufb01t on every slave\nimported to the colonies. The later British criticism of the\nUnited States for not eradicating slavery in the early\n\u2019s, \ncombined \nwith \ntheir \ntacit \nsupport \nof \nthe\n\u2018Confederacy\u2019 during the Civil War is a prime example of\nthe irony and hypocrisy of politics: that self-interest will\never overpower right.\nBefore the Constitution they prohibited its introduction\ninto the Northwestern Territory, the only country we owned\nthen free from it. At the framing and adoption of the\nConstitution, they forbore to so much as mention the word\n\u201cslave\u201d or \u201cslavery\u201d in the whole instrument. In the\nprovision for the recovery of fugitives, the slave is spoken\nof as a \u201cperson held to service or labor.\u201d In that prohibiting\nthe abolition of the African slave trade for twenty years,\nthat trade is spoken of as \u201cthe migration or importation of\n such persons as any of the States now existing shall think\nproper to admit,\u201d etc. These are the only provisions\nalluding to slavery. Thus the thing is hid away in the\nConstitution, just as an a\ufb04icted man hides away a wen or\ncancer which he dares not cut out at once, lest he bleed to\ndeath, \u2014 with the promise, nevertheless, that the cutting\nmay begin at a certain time. Less than this our fathers\ncould not do, and more they would not do. Necessity drove\nthem so far, and farther they would not go. But this is not\nall. The earliest Congress under the Constitution took the\nsame view of slavery. They hedged and hemmed it in to the\nnarrowest limits of necessity.\nIn  they prohibited an outgoing slave trade \u2014 that\nis, the taking of slaves from the United States to sell. In\n they prohibited the bringing of slaves from Africa into\nthe Mississippi Territory, this Territory then comprising\nwhat are now the States of Mississippi and Alabama. This\nwas ten years before they had the authority to do the same\nthing as to the States existing at the adoption of the\nConstitution. In  they prohibited American citizens\nfrom trading in slaves between foreign countries, as, for\ninstance, from Africa to Brazil. In  they passed a law in\naid of one or two slave-State laws in restraint of the\ninternal slave trade. In , in apparent hot haste, they\npassed the law, nearly a year in advance, \u2014 to take e\ufb00ect\nthe \ufb01rst day of , the very \ufb01rst day the Constitution\nwould permit, prohibiting the African slave trade by heavy\npecuniary and corporal penalties. In , \ufb01nding these\nprovisions ine\ufb00ectual, they declared the slave trade piracy,\n and annexed to it the extreme penalty of death. While all\nthis was passing in the General Government, \ufb01ve or six of\nthe original slave States had adopted systems of gradual\nemancipation, \nby \nwhich \nthe \ninstitution \nwas \nrapidly\nbecoming extinct within their limits. Thus we see that the\nplain, unmistakable spirit of that age toward slavery was\nhostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity.\nBut now it is to be transformed into a \u201csacred right.\u201d\nNebraska brings it forth, places it on the highroad to\nextension and perpetuity, and with a pat on its back says to\nit, \u201cGo, and God speed you.\u201d Henceforth it is to be the chief\njewel of the nation the very \ufb01gure-head of the ship of state.\nLittle by little, but steadily as man\u2019s march to the grave, we\nhave been giving up the old for the new faith. Near eighty\nyears ago we began by declaring that all men are created\nequal; but now from that beginning we have run down to\nthe other declaration, that for some men to enslave others\nis a \u201csacred right of self-government.\u201d These principles\ncannot stand together. They are as opposite as God and\nMammon; and who ever holds to the one must despise the\nother. When Pettit, in connection with his support of the\nNebraska Bill, called the Declaration of Independence \u201ca\nself-evident lie,\u201d he only did what consistency and candor\nrequire all other Nebraska men to do. Of the forty-odd\nNebraska senators who sat present and heard him, no one\nrebuked him. Nor am I apprised that any Nebraska\nnewspaper, or any Nebraska orator, in the whole nation has\never yet rebuked him. If this had been said among Marion\u2019s\nmen, Southerners though they were, what would have\n become of the man who said it? If this had been said to the\nmen who captured Andre, the man who said it would\nprobably have been hung sooner than Andre was. If it had\nbeen said in old Independence Hall seventy-eight years\nago, the very doorkeeper would have throttled the man and\nthrust him into the street. Let no one be deceived. The\nspirit of seventy-six and the spirit of Nebraska are utter\nantagonisms; and the former is being rapidly displaced by\nthe latter.\nFellow-countrymen, Americans, South as well as North,\nshall we make no e\ufb00ort to arrest this? Already the liberal\nparty throughout the world express the apprehension that\n\u201cthe one retrograde institution in America is undermining\nthe principles of progress, and fatally violating the noblest\npolitical system the world ever saw.\u201d This is not the taunt of\nenemies, but the warning of friends. Is it quite safe to\ndisregard it \u2014 to despise it? Is there no danger to liberty\nitself in discarding the earliest practice and \ufb01rst precept of\nour ancient faith? In our greedy chase to make pro\ufb01t of the\nnegro, let us beware lest we \u201ccancel and tear in pieces\u201d\neven the white man\u2019s charter of freedom.\nOur republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust. Let\nus repurify it. Let us turn and wash it white in the spirit, if\nnot the blood, of the Revolution. Let us turn slavery from its\nclaims of \u201cmoral right,\u201d back upon its existing legal rights\nand its arguments of \u201cnecessity.\u201d Let us return it to the\nposition our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in peace.\nLet us readopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it\nthe practices and policy which harmonize with it. Let North\n and South, let all Americans \u2014 let all lovers of liberty\neverywhere join in the great and good work. If we do this,\nwe shall not only have saved the Union, but we shall have\nso saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the\nsaving. We shall have so saved it that the succeeding\nmillions of free happy people the world over shall rise up\nand call us blessed to the latest generations.\nAt Spring\ufb01eld, twelve days ago, where I had spoken\nsubstantially as I have here, Judge Douglas replied to me;\nand as he is to reply to me here, I shall attempt to\nanticipate him by noticing some of the points he made\nthere. He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way\nthrough that the principle of the Nebraska Bill would have\nthe e\ufb00ect of extending slavery. He denied that this was\nintended or that this e\ufb00ect would follow.\nI will not reopen the argument upon this point. That such\nwas the intention the world believed at the start, and will\ncontinue to believe. This was the countenance of the thing,\nand both friends and enemies instantly recognized it as\nsuch. That countenance cannot now be changed by\nargument. You can as easily argue the color out of the\nnegro\u2019s skin. Like the \u201cbloody hand,\u201d you may wash it and\nwash it, the red witness of guilt still sticks and stares\nhorribly at you.\nNext he says that Congressional intervention never\nprevented slavery anywhere; that it did not prevent it in the\nNorthwestern Territory, nor in Illinois; that, in fact, Illinois\ncame into the Union as a slave State; that the principle of\n the Nebraska Bill expelled it from Illinois, from several old\nStates, from everywhere.\nNow this is mere quibbling all the way through. If the\nOrdinance of \u2018 did not keep slavery out of the Northwest\nTerritory, how happens it that the northwest shore of the\nOhio River is entirely free from it, while the southeast\nshore, less than a mile distant, along nearly the whole\nlength of the river, is entirely covered with it?\nIf that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois, what was\nit that made the di\ufb00erence between Illinois and Missouri?\nThey lie side by side, the Mississippi River only dividing\nthem, while their early settlements were within the same\nlatitude. Between  and  the number of slaves in\nMissouri increased , while in Illinois in the same ten\nyears they decreased . This appears by the census\nreturns. During nearly all of that ten years both were\nTerritories, not States. During this time the ordinance\nforbade slavery to go into Illinois, and nothing forbade it to\ngo into Missouri. It did go into Missouri, and did not go into\nIllinois. That is the fact. Can any one doubt as to the reason\nof it? But he says Illinois came into the Union as a slave\nState. Silence, perhaps, would be the best answer to this\n\ufb02at contradiction of the known history of the country. What\nare the facts upon which this bold assertion is based? When\nwe \ufb01rst acquired the country, as far back as , there\nwere some slaves within it held by the French inhabitants\nof Kaskaskia. The territorial legislation admitted a few\nnegroes from the slave States as indentured servants. One\nyear after the adoption of the \ufb01rst State constitution, the\n whole number of them was \u2014 what do you think? Just one\nhundred \nand \nseventeen, \nwhile \nthe \naggregate \nfree\npopulation was ,, \u2014 about four hundred and seventy\nto one. Upon this state of facts the people framed their\nconstitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery,\nwith a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured\nservants, giving freedom to their children to be born\nthereafter, and making no mention whatever of any\nsupposed slave for life. Out of this small matter the Judge\nmanufactures his argument that Illinois came into the\nUnion as a slave State. Let the facts be the answer to the\nargument.\nThe principles of the Nebraska Bill, he says, expelled\nslavery from Illinois. The principle of that bill \ufb01rst planted\nit here \u2014 that is, it \ufb01rst came because there was no law to\nprevent it, \ufb01rst came before we owned the country; and\n\ufb01nding it here, and having the Ordinance of \u2018 to prevent\nits increasing, our people struggled along, and \ufb01nally got\nrid of it as best they could.\nBut the principle of the Nebraska Bill abolished slavery\nin several of the old States. Well, it is true that several of\nthe old States, in the last quarter of the last century, did\nadopt systems of gradual emancipation by which the\ninstitution has \ufb01nally become extinct within their limits; but\nit may or may not be true that the principle of the Nebraska\nBill was the cause that led to the adoption of these\nmeasures. It is now more than \ufb01fty years since the last of\nthese States adopted its system of emancipation.\n If the Nebraska Bill is the real author of the benevolent\nworks, it is rather deplorable that it has for so long a time\nceased working altogether. Is there not some reason to\nsuspect that it was the principle of the Revolution, and not\nthe principle of the Nebraska Bill, that led to emancipation\nin these old States? Leave it to the people of these old\nemancipating States, and I am quite certain they will\ndecide that neither that nor any other good thing ever did\nor ever will come of the Nebraska Bill.\nIn the course of my main argument, Judge Douglas\ninterrupted me to say that the principle of the Nebraska\nBill was very old; that it originated when God made man,\nand placed good and evil before him, allowing him to\nchoose for himself, being responsible for the choice he\nshould make. At the time I thought this was merely playful,\nand I answered it accordingly. But in his reply to me he\nrenewed it as a serious argument. In seriousness, then, the\nfacts of this proposition are not true as stated. God did not\nplace good and evil before man, telling him to make his\nchoice. On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree\nof the fruit of which he should not eat, upon pain of certain\ndeath. I should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition\nagainst slavery in Nebraska.\nBut this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in\nanother particular \u2014 in its strong resemblance to the old\nargument for the \u201cdivine right of kings.\u201d By the latter, the\nking is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects,\nbeing responsible to God alone. By the former, the white\nman is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves, being\n responsible to God alone. The two things are precisely\nalike, and it is but natural that they should \ufb01nd similar\narguments to sustain them.\nI had argued that the application of the principle of self-\ngovernment, as contended for, would require the revival of\nthe African slave trade; that no argument could be made in\nfavor of a man\u2019s right to take slaves to Nebraska which\ncould not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring\nthem from the coast of Africa. The Judge replied that the\nConstitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave\ntrade, but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the\nTerritories. That is a mistake in point of fact. The\nConstitution does not require the action of Congress in\neither case, and it does authorize it in both. And so there is\nstill no di\ufb00erence between the cases.\nIn regard to what I have said of the advantage the slave\nStates have over the free in the matter of representation,\nthe Judge replied that we in the free States count \ufb01ve free\nnegroes as \ufb01ve white people, while in the slave States they\ncount \ufb01ve slaves as three whites only; and that the\nadvantage, at last, was on the side of the free States.\nNow, in the slave States they count free negroes just as\nwe do; and it so happens that, besides their slaves, they\nhave as many free negroes as we have, and thirty thousand\nover. Thus, their free negroes more than balance ours; and\ntheir advantage over us, in consequence of their slaves, still\nremains as I stated it.\nIn reply to my argument that the compromise measures\nof  were a system of equivalents, and that the\n provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other\nsubjects without its corresponding equivalent being carried\nwith it, the Judge denied outright that these measures had\nany connection with or dependence upon each other. This is\nmere desperation. If they had no connection, why are they\nalways spoken of in connection? Why has he so spoken of\nthem a thousand times? Why has he constantly called them\na series of measures? Why does everybody call them a\ncompromise? Why was California kept out of the Union six\nor seven months, if it was not because of its connection\nwith the other measures? Webster\u2019s leading de\ufb01nition of\nthe verb \u201cto compromise\u201d is \u201cto adjust and settle a\ndi\ufb00erence, by mutual agreement, with concessions of\nclaims by the parties.\u201d This conveys precisely the popular\nunderstanding of the word \u201ccompromise.\u201d\nWe knew, before the Judge told us, that these measures\npassed separately, and in distinct bills, and that no two of\nthem were passed by the votes of precisely the same\nmembers. But we also know, and so does he know, that no\none of them could have passed both branches of Congress\nbut for the understanding that the others were to pass also.\nUpon this understanding, each got votes which it could\nhave got in no other way. It is this fact which gives to the\nmeasures their true character; and it is the universal\nknowledge of this fact that has given them the name of\n\u201ccompromises,\u201d so expressive of that true character.\nI had asked: \u201cIf, in carrying the Utah and New Mexico\nlaws to Nebraska, you could clear away other objection,\nhow could you leave Nebraska \u2018perfectly free\u2019 to introduce\n slavery before she forms a constitution, during her\nterritorial government, while the Utah and New Mexico\nlaws only authorize it when they form constitutions and are\nadmitted into the Union?\u201d To this Judge Douglas answered\nthat the Utah and New Mexico laws also authorized it\nbefore; and to prove this he read from one of their laws, as\nfollows: \u201cThat the legislative power of said Territory shall\nextend to all rightful subjects of legislation, consistent with\nthe Constitution of the United States and the provisions of\nthis act.\u201d\nNow it is perceived from the reading of this that there is\nnothing express upon the subject, but that the authority is\nsought to be implied merely for the general provision of \u201call\nrightful subjects of legislation.\u201d In reply to this I insist, as a\nlegal rule of construction, as well as the plain, popular view\nof the matter, that the express provision for Utah and New\nMexico coming in with slavery, if they choose, when they\nshall form constitutions, is an exclusion of all implied\nauthority on the same subject; that Congress having the\nsubject distinctly in their minds when they made the\nexpress provision, they therein expressed their whole\nmeaning on that subject.\nThe Judge rather insinuated that I had found it\nconvenient to forget the Washington territorial law passed\nin . This was a division of Oregon, organizing the\nnorthern part as the Territory of Washington. He asserted\nthat by this act the Ordinance of \u2018, theretofore existing in\nOregon, was repealed; that nearly all the members of\nCongress voted for it, beginning in the House of\n Representatives with Charles Allen of Massachusetts, and\nending with Richard Yates of Illinois; and that he could not\nunderstand how those who now opposed the Nebraska Bill\nso voted there, unless it was because it was then too soon\nafter both the great political parties had rati\ufb01ed the\ncompromises of , and the rati\ufb01cation therefore was too\nfresh to be then repudiated.\nNow I had seen the Washington act before, and I have\ncarefully examined it since; and I aver that there is no\nrepeal of the Ordinance of \u2018, or of any prohibition of\nslavery, in it. In express terms, there is absolutely nothing\nin the whole law upon the subject \u2014 in fact, nothing to lead\na reader to think of the subject. To my judgment it is\nequally free from everything from which repeal can be\nlegally implied; but, however this may be, are men now to\nbe entrapped by a legal implication, extracted from covert\nlanguage, introduced perhaps for the very purpose of\nentrapping them? I sincerely wish every man could read\nthis law quite through, carefully watching every sentence\nand every line for a repeal of the Ordinance of \u2018, or\nanything equivalent to it.\nAnother point on the Washington act: If it was intended\nto be modeled after the Utah and New Mexico acts, as\nJudge Douglas insists, why was it not inserted in it, as in\nthem, that Washington was to come in with or without\nslavery as she may choose at the adoption of her\nconstitution? It has no such provision in it; and I defy the\ningenuity of man to give a reason for the omission, other\n than that it was not intended to follow the Utah and New\nMexico laws in regard to the question of slavery.\nThe Washington act not only di\ufb00ers vitally from the Utah\nand New Mexico acts, but the Nebraska act di\ufb00ers vitally\nfrom both. By the latter act the people are left \u201cperfectly\nfree\u201d to regulate their own domestic concerns, etc.; but in\nall the former, all their laws are to be submitted to\nCongress, and if disapproved are to be null. The\nWashington act goes even further; it absolutely prohibits\nthe territorial Legislature, by very strong and guarded\nlanguage, from establishing banks or borrowing money on\nthe faith of the Territory. Is this the sacred right of self-\ngovernment we hear vaunted so much? No, sir; the\nNebraska Bill \ufb01nds no model in the acts of \u2018 or the\nWashington act. It \ufb01nds no model in any law from Adam till\nto-day. As Phillips says of Napoleon, the Nebraska act is\ngrand, gloomy and peculiar, wrapped in the solitude of its\nown originality, without a model and without a shadow\nupon the earth.\nIn the course of his reply Senator Douglas remarked in\nsubstance that he had always considered this government\nwas made for the white people and not for the negroes.\nWhy, in point of mere fact, I think so too. But in this remark\nof the Judge there is a signi\ufb01cance which I think is the key\nto the great mistake (if there is any such mistake) which he\nhas made in this Nebraska measure. It shows that the\nJudge has no very vivid impression that the negro is human,\nand consequently has no idea that there can be any moral\nquestion in legislating about him. In his view the question\n of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter\nof as utter indi\ufb00erence as it is whether his neighbor shall\nplant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horned cattle.\nNow, whether this view is right or wrong, it is very certain\nthat the great mass of mankind take a totally di\ufb00erent view.\nThey consider slavery a great moral wrong, and their\nfeeling against it is not evanescent, but eternal. It lies at\nthe very foundation of their sense of justice, and it cannot\nbe tri\ufb02ed with. It is a great and durable element of popular\naction, and I think no statesman can safely disregard it.\nOur Senator also objects that those who oppose him in\nthis matter do not entirely agree with one another. He\nreminds me that in my \ufb01rm adherence to the constitutional\nrights of the slave States I di\ufb00er widely from others who\nare cooperating with me in opposing the Nebraska Bill, and\nhe says it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of\nways. He should remember that he took us by surprise \u2014\nastounded us by this measure. We were thunderstruck and\nstunned, and we reeled and fell in utter confusion. But we\nrose, each \ufb01ghting, grasping whatever he could \ufb01rst reach\n\u2014 a scythe, a pitchfork, a chopping-ax, or a butcher\u2019s\ncleaver. We struck in the direction of the sound, and we\nwere rapidly closing in upon him. He must not think to\ndivert us from our purpose by showing us that our drill, our\ndress, and our weapons are not entirely perfect and\nuniform. When the storm shall be past he shall \ufb01nd us still\nAmericans, no less devoted to the continued union and\nprosperity of the country than heretofore.\n Finally, the Judge invokes against me the memory of Clay\nand Webster, They were great men, and men of great\ndeeds. But where have I assailed them? For what is it that\ntheir lifelong enemy shall now make pro\ufb01t by assuming to\ndefend them against me, their lifelong friend? I go against\nthe repeal of the Missouri Compromise; did they ever go for\nit? They went for the Compromise of ; did I ever go\nagainst them? They were greatly devoted to the Union; to\nthe small measure of my ability was I ever less so? Clay and\nWebster were dead before this question arose; by what\nauthority shall our Senator say they would espouse his side\nof it if alive? Mr. Clay was the leading spirit in making the\nMissouri Compromise; is it very credible that if now alive\nhe would take the lead in the breaking of it? The truth is\nthat some support from Whigs is now a necessity with the\nJudge, and for this it is that the names of Clay and Webster\nare invoked. His old friends have deserted him in such\nnumbers as to leave too few to live by. He came to his own,\nand his own received him not; and lo! he turns unto the\nGentiles.\nA word now as to the Judge\u2019s desperate assumption that\nthe compromises of  had no connection with one\nanother; that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State,\nand some other similar ones. This is no other than a bold\ndenial of the history of the country. If we do not know that\nthe compromises of  were dependent on each other; if\nwe do not know that Illinois came into the Union as a free\nState, \u2014 we do not know anything. If we do not know these\nthings, we do not know that we ever had a Revolutionary\n War or such a chief as Washington. To deny these things is\nto deny our national axioms, \u2014 or dogmas, at least, \u2014 and\nit puts an end to all argument. If a man will stand up and\nassert, and repeat and reassert, that two and two do not\nmake four, I know nothing in the power of argument that\ncan stop him. I think I can answer the Judge so long as he\nsticks to the premises; but when he \ufb02ies from them, I\ncannot work any argument into the consistency of a mental\ngag and actually close his mouth with it. In such a case I\ncan only commend him to the seventy thousand answers\njust in from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana.\n   \n     \n    \nA    \n  \n \nTO CHARLES HOYT\nCLINTON, DE WITT Co., Nov. , \nDEAR SIR: \u2014 You used to express a good deal of\npartiality for me, and if you are still so, now is the time.\nSome friends here are really for me for the U.S. Senate, and\nI should be very grateful if you could make a mark for me\namong your members.

Of course I prefer myself to all\nothers; yet it is neither in my heart nor my conscience to\nsay I am any better man than Mr. Williams. We shall have a\nterrible struggle with our adversaries. They are desperate\nand bent on desperate deeds. I accidentally learned of one\nof the leaders here writing to a member south of here, in\nabout the following language: We are beaten. They have a\nclean majority of at least nine, on joint ballot. They\noutnumber us, but we must outmanage them. Douglas must\nbe sustained. We must elect the Speaker; and we must\nelect a Nebraska United States Senator, or \u201celect none at\nall.\u201d Similar letters, no doubt, are written to every\nNebraska member. Be considering how we can best meet,\nand foil, and beat them. I send you, by mail, a copy of my\nPeoria speech. You may have seen it before, or you may not\nthink it worth seeing now.\nDo not speak of the Nebraska letter mentioned above; I\ndo not wish it to become public, that I received such\ninformation.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n  \nI\n  \n  A    A       \n  \nAUGUST , \nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 On Saturday last, Judge\nDouglas and myself \ufb01rst met in public discussion. He spoke\none hour, I an hour and a half, and he replied for half an\nhour. The order is now reversed. I am to speak an hour, he\nan hour and a half, and then I am to reply for half an hour. I\npropose to devote myself during the \ufb01rst hour to the scope\nof what was brought within the range of his half-hour\nspeech at Ottawa. Of course there was brought within the\nscope in that half-hour\u2019s speech something of his own\nopening speech. In the course of that opening argument\nJudge \nDouglas \nproposed \nto \nme \nseven \ndistinct\ninterrogatories. In my speech of an hour and a half, I\nattended to some other parts of his speech, and\nincidentally, as I thought, intimated to him that I would\nanswer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that\nhe should agree to answer as many for me. He made no\nintimation at the time of the proposition, nor did he in his\nreply allude at all to that suggestion of mine. I do him no\ninjustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply\nin dealing with me as though I had refused to answer his\ninterrogatories. I now propose that I will answer any of the\ninterrogatories, upon condition that he will answer\n questions from me not exceeding the same number. I give\nhim an opportunity to respond.\nThe Judge remains silent. I now say that I will answer his\ninterrogatories, whether he answers mine or not; and that\nafter I have done so, I shall propound mine to him.\nI have supposed myself, since the organization of the\nRepublican party at Bloomington, in May, , bound as a\nparty man by the platforms of the party, then and since. If\nin any interrogatories which I shall answer I go beyond the\nscope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived\nthat no one is responsible but myself.\nHaving said thus much, I will take up the Judge\u2019s\ninterrogatories as I \ufb01nd them printed in the Chicago Times,\nand answer them seriatim. In order that there may be no\nmistake about it, I have copied the interrogatories in\nwriting, and also my answers to them. The \ufb01rst one of these\ninterrogatories is in these words:\nQuestion .\u2014 \u201cI desire to know whether Lincoln to-day\nstands, as he did in , in favor of the unconditional\nrepeal of the Fugitive Slave law?\u201d Answer: \u2014 I do not now,\nnor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of\nthe Fugitive Slave law.\nQ. .\u2014 \u201cI desire him to answer whether he stands\npledged to-day, as he did in , against the admission of\nany more slave States into the Union, even if the people\nwant them?\u201d Answer: \u2014 I do not now, nor ever did, stand\npledged against the admission of any more slave States into\nthe Union.\n Q. .\u2014 \u201cI want to know whether he stands pledged\nagainst the admission of a new State into the Union with\nsuch a constitution as the people of that State may see \ufb01t to\nmake?\u201d Answer: \u2014 I do not stand pledged against the\nadmission of a new State into the Union, with such a\nconstitution as the people of that State may see \ufb01t to make.\nQ. .\u2014 \u201cI want to know whether he stands to-day pledged\nto the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?\u201d\nAnswer: \u2014 I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of\nslavery in the District of Columbia.\nQ. .\u2014 \u201cI desire him to answer whether he stands\npledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the\ndi\ufb00erent States?\u201d Answer: \u2014 I do not stand pledged to the\nprohibition of the slave-trade between the di\ufb00erent States.\nQ. .\u2014 \u201cI desire to know whether he stands pledged to\nprohibit slavery in all the Territories of the United States,\nnorth as well as south of the Missouri Compromise line?\u201d\nAnswer: \u2014 I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a\nbelief in the right and duty of Congress to prohibit slavery\nin all the United States \u2018Territories.\nQ. .\u2014 \u201cI desire him to answer whether he is opposed to\nthe acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is \ufb01rst\nprohibited therein?\u201d Answer: \u2014 I am not generally opposed\nto honest acquisition of territory; and, in any given case, I\nwould or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as\nI might think such acquisition would or would not\naggravate the slavery question among ourselves.\nNow, my friends, it will be perceived, upon an\nexamination of these questions and answers, that so far I\n have only answered that I was not pledged to this, that, or\nthe other. The Judge has not framed his interrogatories to\nask me anything more than this, and I have answered in\nstrict accordance with the interrogatories, and have\nanswered truly, that I am not pledged at all upon any of the\npoints to which I have answered. But I am not disposed to\nhang upon the exact form of his interrogatory. I am rather\ndisposed to take up at least some of these questions, and\nstate what I really think upon them.\nAs to the \ufb01rst one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I\nhave never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to\nsay, that I think, under the Constitution of the United\nStates, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a\nCongressional Fugitive Slave law. Having said that, I have\nhad nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave\nlaw, further than that I think it should have been framed so\nas to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it,\nwithout lessening its e\ufb00iciency. And inasmuch as we are not\nnow in an agitation in regard to an alteration or\nmodi\ufb01cation of that law, I would not be the man to\nintroduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general\nquestion of slavery.\nIn regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged\nto the admission of any more slave States into the Union, I\nstate to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry\never to be put in a position of having to pass upon that\nquestion. I should be exceedingly glad to know that there\nwould never be another slave State admitted into the\nUnion; but I must add that if slavery shall be kept out of the\n Territories during the territorial existence of any one given\nTerritory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance\nand a clear \ufb01eld, when they come to adopt the constitution,\ndo such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave\nconstitution, unin\ufb02uenced by the actual presence of the\ninstitution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the\ncountry, but to admit them into the Union.\nThe third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the\nsecond, it being, as I conceive, the same as the second.\nThe fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in\nthe District of Columbia. In relation to that, I have my mind\nvery distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see\nslavery abolished in the District of Columbia. I believe that\nCongress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it.\nYet as a member of Congress, I should not, with my present\nviews, be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the\nDistrict of Columbia, unless it would be upon these\nconditions: First, that the abolition should be gradual;\nsecond, that it should be on a vote of the majority of\nquali\ufb01ed \nvoters \nin \nthe \nDistrict; \nand \nthird, \nthat\ncompensation should be made to unwilling owners. With\nthese three conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly\nglad to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of\nColumbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, \u201csweep from\nour capital that foul blot upon our nation.\u201d\nIn regard to the \ufb01fth interrogatory, I must say here that,\nas to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade\nbetween the di\ufb00erent States, I can truly answer, as I have,\nthat I am pledged to nothing about it. It is a subject to\n which I have not given that mature consideration that\nwould make me feel authorized to state a position so as to\nhold myself entirely bound by it. In other words, that\nquestion has never been prominently enough before me to\ninduce me to investigate whether we really have the\nconstitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had\nsu\ufb00icient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that\nsubject; but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you\nhere, and to Judge Douglas. I must say, however, that if I\nshould be of opinion that Congress does possess the\nconstitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the\ndi\ufb00erent States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise\nof that power, unless upon some conservative principle as I\nconceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\nMy answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be\nprohibited in all the Territories of the United States is full\nand explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by\nany comments of mine. So I suppose in regard to the\nquestion whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any\nmore territory unless slavery is \ufb01rst prohibited therein, my\nanswer is such that I could add nothing by way of\nillustration, or making myself better understood, than the\nanswer which I have placed in writing.\nNow in all this the Judge has me, and he has me on the\nrecord. I suppose he had \ufb02attered himself that I was really\nentertaining one set of opinions for one place, and another\nset for another place; that I was afraid to say at one place\nwhat I uttered at another. What I am saying here I suppose\n I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism\nas any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am\nsaying that which, if it would be o\ufb00ensive to any persons\nand render them enemies to myself, would be o\ufb00ensive to\npersons in this audience.\nI \nnow \nproceed \nto \npropound \nto \nthe \nJudge \nthe\ninterrogatories, so far as I have framed them. I will bring\nforward a new installment when I get them ready. I will\nbring them forward now only reaching to number four. The\n\ufb01rst one is:\nQuestion . \u2014 If the people of Kansas shall, by means\nentirely unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State\nconstitution, and ask admission into the Union under it,\nbefore they have the requisite number of inhabitants\naccording to the English bill, \u2014 some ninety-three\nthousand, \u2014 will you vote to admit them?\nQ. . \u2014 Can the people of a United States Territory, in\nany lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United\nStates, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation\nof a State constitution?\nQ. . If the Supreme Court of the United States shall\ndecide that States cannot exclude slavery from their limits,\nare you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting, and following\nsuch decision as a rule of political action?\nQ. . Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in\ndisregard of how such acquisition may a\ufb00ect the nation on\nthe slavery question?\nAs introductory to these interrogatories which Judge\nDouglas propounded to me at Ottawa, he read a set of\n resolutions which he said Judge Trumbull and myself had\nparticipated in adopting, in the \ufb01rst Republican State\nConvention, held at Spring\ufb01eld in October, . He\ninsisted that I and Judge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire\nRepublican party, were responsible for the doctrines\ncontained in the set of resolutions which he read, and I\nunderstand that it was from that set of resolutions that he\ndeduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me,\nusing these resolutions as a sort of authority for\npropounding those questions to me. Now, I say here to-day\nthat I do not answer his interrogatories because of their\nspringing at all from that set of resolutions which he read. I\nanswered them because Judge Douglas thought \ufb01t to ask\nthem. I do not now, nor ever did, recognize any\nresponsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions. When I\nreplied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never\nhad anything to do with them. I repeat here to today that I\nnever in any possible form had anything to do with that set\nof resolutions It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions\nwere never passed in any convention held in Spring\ufb01eld.\nIt turns out that they were never passed at any\nconvention or any public meeting that I had any part in. I\nbelieve it turns out, in addition to all this, that there was\nnot, in the fall of , any convention holding a session in\nSpring\ufb01eld, calling itself a Republican State Convention;\nyet it is true there was a convention, or assemblage of men\ncalling themselves a convention, at Spring\ufb01eld, that did\npass some resolutions. But so little did I really know of the\nproceedings of that convention, or what set of resolutions\n they had passed, though having a general knowledge that\nthere had been such an assemblage of men there, that\nwhen Judge Douglas read the resolutions, I really did not\nknow but they had been the resolutions passed then and\nthere. I did not question that they were the resolutions\nadopted. For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge\nDouglas could say what he did upon this subject without\nknowing that it was true. I contented myself, on that\noccasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with\nthem, not denying or a\ufb00irming whether they were passed\nat Spring\ufb01eld. Now, it turns out that he had got hold of\nsome resolutions passed at some convention or public\nmeeting in Kane County. I wish to say here, that I don\u2019t\nconceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery\nrelieves me at all. I had just as much to do with the\nconvention in Kane County as that at Spring\ufb01eld. I am as\nmuch responsible for the resolutions at Kane County as\nthose at Spring\ufb01eld, \u2014 the amount of the responsibility\nbeing exactly nothing in either case; no more than there\nwould be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the\nmoon.\nI allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for\nsome further purpose than anything yet advanced. Judge\nDouglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as\nmatters that he believed to be true, but he stated them\nroundly as being true, in such form as to pledge his\nveracity for their truth. When the whole matter turns out as\nit does, and when we consider who Judge Douglas is, that\nhe is a distinguished Senator of the United States; that he\n has served nearly twelve years as such; that his character\nis not at all limited as an ordinary Senator of the United\nStates, but that his name has become of world-wide\nrenown, \u2014 it is most extraordinary that he should so far\nforget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary, or of\nprudence to himself, as to venture upon the assertion of\nthat which the slightest investigation would have shown\nhim to be wholly false. I can only account for his having\ndone so upon the supposition that that evil genius which\nhas attended him through his life, giving to him an\napparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very many\ngood men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue\nover vice, \u2014 I say I can only account for it on the\nsupposition that that evil genius has as last made up its\nmind to forsake him.\nAnd I may add that another extraordinary feature of the\nJudge\u2019s conduct in this canvass \u2014 made more extraordinary\nby this incident \u2014 is, that he is in the habit, in almost all\nthe speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his\nadversaries, myself and others. I now ask whether he is\nable to \ufb01nd in anything that Judge Trumbull, for instance,\nhas said, or in anything that I have said, a justi\ufb01cation at all\ncompared with what we have, in this instance, for that sort\nof vulgarity.\nI have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief\non my part that, in the introduction of the Nebraska Bill\ninto Congress, there was a conspiracy to make slavery\nperpetual and national. I have arranged from time to time\nthe evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this\n charge. I recurred to this charge at Ottawa. I shall not now\nhave time to dwell upon it at very great length; but\ninasmuch as Judge Douglas, in his reply of half an hour,\nmade some points upon me in relation to it, I propose\nnoticing a few of them.\nThe Judge insists that, in the \ufb01rst speech I made, in\nwhich I very distinctly made that charge, he thought for a\ngood while I was in fun! that I was playful; that I was not\nsincere about it; and that he only grew angry and\nsomewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as a\nmatter of earnestness. He says he characterized it as a\nfalsehood so far as I implicated his moral character in that\ntransaction. Well, I did not know, till he presented that\nview, that I had implicated his moral character. He is very\nmuch in the habit, when he argues me up into a position I\nnever thought of occupying, of very cosily saying he has no\ndoubt Lincoln is \u201cconscientious\u201d in saying so. He should\nremember that I did not know but what he was\nALTOGETHER \u201cCONSCIENTIOUS\u201d in that matter. I can\nconceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing,\nand I really \ufb01nd nothing in Judge Douglas\u2019s course of\narguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief\nof a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a\ngood and blessed thing; and so I hope he will understand\nthat I do not at all question but that in all this matter he is\nentirely \u201cconscientious.\u201d\nBut to draw your attention to one of the points I made in\nthis case, beginning at the beginning: When the Nebraska\nBill was introduced, or a short time afterward, by an\n amendment, I believe, it was provided that it must be\nconsidered \u201cthe true intent and meaning of this Act not to\nlegislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to\nform and regulate their own domestic institutions in their\nown way, subject only to the Constitution of the United\nStates.\u201d I have called his attention to the fact that when he\nand some others began arguing that they were giving an\nincreased degree of liberty to the people in the Territories\nover and above what they formerly had on the question of\nslavery, a question was raised whether the law was enacted\nto give such unconditional liberty to the people; and to test\nthe sincerity of this mode of argument, Mr. Chase, of Ohio,\nintroduced an amendment, in which he made the law \u2014 if\nthe amendment were adopted \u2014 expressly declare that the\npeople of the Territory should have the power to exclude\nslavery if they saw \ufb01t. I have asked attention also to the\nfact that Judge Douglas and those who acted with him\nvoted that amendment down, notwithstanding it expressed\nexactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning\nof the law. I have called attention to the fact that in\nsubsequent times a decision of the Supreme Court has been\nmade, in which it has been declared that a Territorial\nLegislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery.\nAnd I have argued and said that for men who did, intend\nthat the people of the Territory should have the right to\nexclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally, the voting\ndown of Chase\u2019s amendment is wholly inexplicable. It is a\npuzzle, a riddle. But I have said, that with men who did look\n forward to such a decision, or who had it in contemplation\nthat such a decision of the Supreme Court would or might\nbe made, the voting down of that amendment would be\nperfectly rational and intelligible. It would keep Congress\nfrom coming in collision with the decision when it was\nmade. Anybody can conceive that if there was an intention\nor expectation that such a decision was to follow, it would\nnot be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the\nSupreme Court \u2014 all or nearly all its members belonging to\nthe same party \u2014 to decide one way, when the party in\nCongress had decided the other way. Hence it would be\nvery rational for men expecting such a decision to keep the\nniche in that law clear for it. After pointing this out, I tell\nJudge Douglas that it looks to me as though here was the\nreason why Chase\u2019s amendment was voted down. I tell him\nthat, as he did it, and knows why he did it, if it was done for\na reason di\ufb00erent from this, he knows what that reason\nwas and can tell us what it was. I tell him, also, it will be\nvastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some\nother plausible, intelligible reason why it was voted down\nthan to stand upon his dignity and call people liars. Well, on\nSaturday he did make his answer; and what do you think it\nwas? He says if I had only taken upon myself to tell the\nwhole truth about that amendment of Chase\u2019s, no\nexplanation would have been necessary on his part or\nwords to that e\ufb00ect. Now, I say here that I am quite\nunconscious of having suppressed anything material to the\ncase, and I am very frank to admit if there is any sound\nreason other than that which appeared to me material, it is\n quite fair for him to present it. What reason does he\npropose? That when Chase came forward with his\namendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude\nslavery from the limits of every Territory, General Cass\nproposed to Chase, if he (Chase) would add to his\namendment that the people should have the power to\nintroduce or exclude, they would let it go. This is\nsubstantially all of his reply. And because Chase would not\ndo that, they voted his amendment down. Well, it turns out,\nI believe, upon examination, that General Cass took some\npart in the little running debate upon that amendment, and\nthen ran away and did not vote on it at all. Is not that the\nfact? So con\ufb01dent, as I think, was General Cass that there\nwas a snake somewhere about, he chose to run away from\nthe whole thing. This is an inference I draw from the fact\nthat, though he took part in the debate, his name does not\nappear in the ayes and noes. But does Judge Douglas\u2019s\nreply amount to a satisfactory answer?\n[Cries of \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d and \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d]\nThere is some little di\ufb00erence of opinion here. But I ask\nattention to a few more views bearing on the question of\nwhether it amounts to a satisfactory answer. The men who\nwere determined that that amendment should not get into\nthe bill, and spoil the place where the Dred Scott decision\nwas to come in, sought an excuse to get rid of it\nsomewhere. One of these ways \u2014 one of these excuses \u2014\nwas to ask Chase to add to his proposed amendment a\nprovision that the people might introduce slavery if they\nwanted to. They very well knew Chase would do no such\n thing, that Mr. Chase was one of the men di\ufb00ering from\nthem on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom\nwas better than slavery, \u2014 a man who would not consent to\nenact a law, penned with his own hand, by which he was\nmade to recognize slavery on the one hand, and liberty on\nthe other, as precisely equal; and when they insisted on his\ndoing this, they very well knew they insisted on that which\nhe would not for a moment think of doing, and that they\nwere only blu\ufb00ing him. I believe (I have not, since he made\nhis answer, had a chance to examine the journals or\nCongressional Globe and therefore speak from memory) \u2014\nI believe the state of the bill at that time, according to\nparliamentary rules, was such that no member could\npropose an additional amendment to Chase\u2019s amendment. I\nrather think this is the truth, \u2014 the Judge shakes his head.\nVery well. I would like to know, then, if they wanted Chase\u2019s\namendment \ufb01xed over, why somebody else could not have\no\ufb00ered to do it? If they wanted it amended, why did they\nnot o\ufb00er the amendment? Why did they not put it in\nthemselves? But to put it on the other ground: suppose that\nthere was such an amendment o\ufb00ered, and Chase\u2019s was an\namendment to an amendment; until one is disposed of by\nparliamentary law, you cannot pile another on. Then all\nthese gentlemen had to do was to vote Chase\u2019s on, and\nthen, in the amended form in which the whole stood, add\ntheir own amendment to it, if they wanted to put it in that\nshape. This was all they were obliged to do, and the ayes\nand noes show that there were thirty-six who voted it down,\nagainst ten who voted in favor of it. The thirty-six held\n entire sway and control. They could in some form or other\nhave put that bill in the exact shape they wanted. If there\nwas a rule preventing their amending it at the time, they\ncould pass that, and then, Chase\u2019s amendment being\nmerged, put it in the shape they wanted. They did not\nchoose to do so, but they went into a quibble with Chase to\nget him to add what they knew he would not add, and\nbecause he would not, they stand upon the \ufb02imsy pretext\nfor voting down what they argued was the meaning and\nintent of their own bill. They left room thereby for this Dred\nScott decision, which goes very far to make slavery national\nthroughout the United States.\nI pass one or two points I have, because my time will\nvery soon expire; but I must be allowed to say that Judge\nDouglas recurs again, as he did upon one or two other\noccasions, to the enormity of Lincoln, an insigni\ufb01cant\nindividual like Lincoln, \u2014 upon his ipse dixit charging a\nconspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress,\nthe Supreme Court, and two Presidents, to nationalize\nslavery. I want to say that, in the \ufb01rst place, I have made no\ncharge of this sort upon my ipse dixit. I have only arrayed\nthe evidence tending to prove it, and presented it to the\nunderstanding of others, saying what I think it proves, but\ngiving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not.\nThis is precisely what I have done. I have not placed it upon\nmy ipse dixit at all. On this occasion, I wish to recall his\nattention to a piece of evidence which I brought forward at\nOttawa \non \nSaturday, \nshowing \nthat \nhe \nhad \nmade\nsubstantially the same charge against substantially the\n same persons, excluding his dear self from the category. I\nask him to give some attention to the evidence which I\nbrought forward that he himself had discovered a \u201cfatal\nblow being struck\u201d against the right of the people to\nexclude slavery from their limits, which fatal blow he\nassumed as in evidence in an article in the Washington\nUnion, published \u201cby authority.\u201d I ask by whose authority?\nHe discovers a similar or identical provision in the\nLecompton Constitution. Made by whom? The framers of\nthat Constitution. Advocated by whom? By all the members\nof the party in the nation, who advocated the introduction\nof \nKansas \ninto \nthe \nUnion \nunder \nthe \nLecompton\nConstitution. I have asked his attention to the evidence that\nhe arrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being\nstruck, and to the facts which he brought forward in\nsupport of that charge, \u2014 being identical with the one\nwhich he thinks so villainous in me. He pointed it, not at a\nnewspaper editor merely, but at the President and his\nCabinet and the members of Congress advocating the\nLecompton Constitution and those framing that instrument.\nI must again be permitted to remind him that although my\nipse dixit may not be as great as his, yet it somewhat\nreduces the force of his calling my attention to the\nenormity of my making a like charge against him.\nGo on, Judge Douglas.\n   I     \nI\n  \n  A    A  \n  A\nA\nAUGUST , \nMR. LINCOLN\u2019S REPLY\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 When a man hears himself\nsomewhat misrepresented, it provokes him, at least, I \ufb01nd\nit so with myself; but when misrepresentation becomes\nvery gross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse him. The\n\ufb01rst thing I see \ufb01t to notice is the fact that Judge Douglas\nalleges, after running through the history of the old\nDemocratic and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull\nand myself made an arrangement in , by which I was\nto have the place of General Shields in the United States\nSenate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge\nDouglas. Now, all I have to say upon that subject is that I\nthink no man not even Judge Douglas can prove it, because\nit is not true. I have no doubt he is \u201cconscientious\u201d in\nsaying it. As to those resolutions that he took such a length\nof time to read, as being the platform of the Republican\nparty in , I say I never had anything to do with them,\nand I think Trumbull never had. Judge Douglas cannot\nshow that either of us ever did have anything to do with\nthem.\nI believe this is true about those resolutions: There was a\ncall for a convention to form a Republican party at\n Spring\ufb01eld, and I think that my friend Mr. Lovejoy, who is\nhere upon this stand, had a hand in it. I think this is true,\nand I think if he will remember accurately he will be able to\nrecollect that he tried to get me into it, and I would not go\nin. I believe it is also true that I went away from Spring\ufb01eld\nwhen the convention was in session, to attend court in\nTazewell county. It is true they did place my name, though\nwithout authority, upon the committee, and afterward\nwrote me to attend the meeting of the committee; but I\nrefused to do so, and I never had anything to do with that\norganization. This is the plain truth about all that matter of\nthe resolutions.\nNow, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of\nTrumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic party,\nand Lincoln agreeing to sell out the old Whig party, I have\nthe means of knowing about that: Judge Douglas cannot\nhave; and I know there is no substance to it whatever. Yet I\nhave no doubt he is \u201cconscientious\u201d about it. I know that\nafter Mr. Lovejoy got into the Legislature that winter, he\ncomplained of me that I had told all the old Whigs of his\ndistrict that the old Whig party was good enough for them,\nand some of them voted against him because I told them so.\nNow, I have no means of totally disproving such charges as\nthis which the Judge makes. A man cannot prove a\nnegative; but he has a right to claim that when a man\nmakes an a\ufb00irmative charge, he must o\ufb00er some proof to\nshow the truth of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce\ntestimony to show the negative about things, but I have a\nright to claim that if a man says he knows a thing, then he\n must show how he knows it. I always have a right to claim\nthis, and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be\n\u201cconscientious\u201d on the subject.\nNow, gentlemen, I hate to waste my time on such things;\nbut in regard to that general Abolition tilt that Judge\nDouglas makes, when he says that I was engaged at that\ntime in selling out and Abolitionizing the old Whig party, I\nhope you will permit me to read a part of a printed speech\nthat I made then at Peoria, which will show altogether a\ndi\ufb00erent view of the position I took in that contest of .\n[Voice: \u201cPut on your specs.\u201d]\nMr. LINCOLN: Yes, sir, I am obliged to do so; I am no\nlonger a young man.\n\u201cThis is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The\nforegoing history may not be precisely accurate in every\nparticular, but I am sure it is su\ufb00iciently so for all the uses I\nshall attempt to make of it, and in it we have before us the\nchief materials enabling us to correctly judge whether the\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong.\n\u201cI think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong \u2014 wrong\nin its direct e\ufb00ect, letting slavery into Kansas and\nNebraska, and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing\nit to spread to every other part of the wide world where\nmen can be found inclined to take it.\n\u201cThis declared indi\ufb00erence, but, as I must think, covert\nreal zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate\nit because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate\nit because it deprives our republican example of its just\nin\ufb02uence in the world, \u2014 enables the enemies of free\n institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites;\ncauses the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity,\nand especially because it forces so many really good men\namongst ourselves into an open war with the very\nfundamental principles of civil liberty, criticizing the\nDeclaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no\nright principle of action but self-interest.\n\u201cBefore proceeding, let me say I think I have no\nprejudice against the Southern people. They are just what\nwe would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist\namong them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist\namong us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe\nof the masses north and south. Doubtless there are\nindividuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under\nany circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce\nslavery anew, if it were out of existence. We know that\nsome Southern men do free their slaves, go north, and\nbecome tip-top Abolitionists; while some Northern ones go\nsouth and become most cruel slave-masters.\n\u201cWhen Southern people tell us they are no more\nresponsible for the origin of slavery than we, I acknowledge\nthe fact. When it is said that the institution exists, and that\nit is very di\ufb00icult to get rid of it, in any satisfactory way, I\ncan understand and appreciate the saying. I will not blame\nthem for not doing what I should not know how to do\nmyself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not\nknow what to do, as to the existing institution. My \ufb01rst\nimpulse would be to free all the slaves and send them to\nLiberia, \u2014 to their own native land. But a moment\u2019s\n re\ufb02ection would convince me that whatever of high hope\n(as I think there is) there may be in this in the long term,\nits sudden execution is impossible. If they were all landed\nthere in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days;\nand there are not surplus shipping and surplus money\nenough in the world to carry them there in many times ten\ndays. What then? Free them all and keep them among us as\nunderlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their\ncondition? I think I would not hold one in slavery, at any\nrate; yet the point is not clear enough to me to denounce\npeople upon. What next? Free them, and make them\npolitically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not\nadmit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of\nthe great mass of white people will not. Whether this\nfeeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the\nsole question, if, indeed, it is any part of it. A universal\nfeeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely\ndisregarded. We cannot, then, make them equals. It does\nseem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be\nadopted; but for their tardiness in this I will not undertake\nto judge our brethren of the South.\n\u201cWhen they remind us of their constitutional rights, I\nacknowledge them, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and\nI would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their\nfugitives, which should not, in its stringency, be more likely\nto carry a free man into slavery than Our ordinary criminal\nlaws are to hang an innocent one.\n\u201cBut all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse\nfor permitting slavery to go into our own free territory than\n it would for reviving the African slave-trade by law. The law\nwhich forbids the bringing of slaves from Africa, and that\nwhich has so long forbid the taking of them to Nebraska,\ncan hardly be distinguished on any moral principle; and the\nrepeal of the former could \ufb01nd quite as plausible excuses\nas that of the latter.\u201d\nI have reason to know that Judge Douglas knows that I\nsaid this. I think he has the answer here to one of the\nquestions he put to me. I do not mean to allow him to\ncatechize me unless he pays back for it in kind. I will not\nanswer questions one after another, unless he reciprocates;\nbut as he has made this inquiry, and I have answered it\nbefore, he has got it without my getting anything in return.\nHe has got my answer on the Fugitive Slave law.\nNow, gentlemen, I don\u2019t want to read at any greater\nlength; but this is the true complexion of all I have ever\nsaid in regard to the institution of slavery and the black\nrace. This is the whole of it; and anything that argues me\ninto his idea of perfect social and political equality with the\nnegro is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of\nwords, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a\nchestnut horse. I will say here, while upon this subject, that\nI have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\nthe institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I\nbelieve I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no\ninclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political\nand social equality between the white and the black races.\nThere is a physical di\ufb00erence between the two which, in my\njudgment, will probably forever forbid their living together\n upon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it\nbecomes a necessity that there must be a di\ufb00erence, I, as\nwell as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I\nbelong having the superior position. I have never said\nanything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding\nall this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not\nentitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the\nDeclaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and\nthe pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled\nto these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is\nnot my equal in many respects, certainly not in color,\nperhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the\nright to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else,\nwhich his own hand earns, he is my equal, and the equal of\nJudge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.\nNow I pass on to consider one or two more of these little\nfollies. The Judge is woefully at fault about his early friend\nLincoln being a \u201cgrocery-keeper.\u201d I don\u2019t know as it would\nbe a great sin, if I had been; but he is mistaken. Lincoln\nnever kept a grocery anywhere in the world. It is true that\nLincoln did work the latter part of one winter in a little\nstillhouse, up at the head of a hollow. And so I think my\nfriend the Judge is equally at fault when he charges me at\nthe time when I was in Congress of having opposed our\nsoldiers who were \ufb01ghting in the Mexican war. The Judge\ndid not make his charge very distinctly, but I can tell you\nwhat he can prove, by referring to the record. You\nremember I was an old Whig, and whenever the\nDemocratic party tried to get me to vote that the war had\n been righteously begun by the President, I would not do it.\nBut whenever they asked for any money, or landwarrants,\nor anything to pay the soldiers there, during all that time, I\ngave the same vote that Judge Douglas did. You can think\nas you please as to whether that was consistent. Such is the\ntruth, and the Judge has the right to make all he can out of\nit. But when he, by a general charge, conveys the idea that\nI withheld supplies from the soldiers who were \ufb01ghting in\nthe Mexican war, or did anything else to hinder the\nsoldiers, he is, to say the least, grossly and altogether\nmistaken, as a consultation of the records will prove to him.\nAs I have not used up so much of my time as I had\nsupposed, I will dwell a little longer upon one or two of\nthese minor topics upon which the Judge has spoken. He\nhas read from my speech in Spring\ufb01eld, in which I say that\n\u201ca house divided against itself cannot stand\u201d Does the\nJudge say it can stand? I don\u2019t know whether he does or\nnot. The Judge does not seem to be attending to me just\nnow, but I would like to know if it is his opinion that a\nhouse divided against itself can stand. If he does, then\nthere is a question of veracity, not between him and me, but\nbetween the Judge and an Authority of a somewhat higher\ncharacter.\nNow, my friends, I ask your attention to this matter for\nthe purpose of saying something seriously. I know that the\nJudge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim\nwhich was put forth by the Savior is true, but he may allege\nthat I misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge that, in\nmy application, I do misapply it, and then I have a right to\n show that I do not misapply it, When he undertakes to say\nthat because I think this nation, so far as the question of\nslavery is concerned, will all become one thing or all the\nother, I am in favor of bringing about a dead uniformity in\nthe various States, in all their institutions, he argues\nerroneously. The great variety of the local institutions in the\nStates, springing from di\ufb00erences in the soil, di\ufb00erences in\nthe face of the country, and in the climate, are bonds of\nUnion. They do not make \u201ca house divided against itself,\u201d\nbut they make a house united. If they produce in one\nsection of the country what is called for, by the wants of\nanother section, and this other section can supply the\nwants of the \ufb01rst, they are not matters of discord, but\nbonds of union, true bonds of union. But can this question\nof slavery be considered as among these varieties in the\ninstitutions of the country? I leave it to you to say whether,\nin the history of our government, this institution of slavery\nhas not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the\ncontrary, been an apple of discord and an element of\ndivision in the house. I ask you to consider whether, so long\nas the moral constitution of men\u2019s minds shall continue to\nbe the same, after this generation and assemblage shall\nsink into the grave, and another race shall arise, with the\nsame moral and intellectual development we have, whether,\nif that institution is standing in the same irritating position\nin which it now is, it will not continue an element of\ndivision? If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to\nthis question, the Union is a house divided against itself;\nand when the Judge reminds me that I have often said to\n him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty\nyears in some States, and yet it does not exist in some\nothers, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at\nthe position in which our fathers originally placed it \u2014\nrestricting it from the new Territories where it had not\ngone, and legislating to cut o\ufb00 its source by the abrogation\nof the slave trade, thus putting the seal of legislation\nagainst its spread. The public mind did rest in the belief\nthat it was in the course of ultimate extinction. But lately, I\nthink \u2014 and in this I charge nothing on the Judge\u2019s motives\n\u2014 lately, I think that he, and those acting with him, have\nplaced that institution on a new basis, which looks to the\nperpetuity and nationalization of slavery. And while it is\nplaced upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I\nbelieve we shall not have peace upon the question until the\nopponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and\nplace it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\nis in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other\nhand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall\nbecome alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new,\nNorth as well as South. Now, I believe if we could arrest\nthe spread, and place it where Washington and Je\ufb00erson\nand Madison placed it, it would be in the course of ultimate\nextinction, and the public mind would, as for eighty years\npast, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.\nThe crisis would be past, and the institution might be let\nalone for a hundred years, if it should live so long, in the\nStates where it exists; yet it would be going out of\n existence in the way best for both the black and the white\nraces.\n[A voice: \u201cThen do you repudiate popular sovereignty?\u201d]\nWell, then, let us talk about popular sovereignty! what is\npopular sovereignty? Is it the right of the people to have\nslavery or not have it, as they see \ufb01t, in the Territories? I\nwill state \u2014 and I have an able man to watch me \u2014 my\nunderstanding is that popular sovereignty, as now applied\nto the question of slavery, does allow the people of a\nTerritory to have slavery if they want to, but does not allow\nthem not to have it if they do not want it. I do not mean that\nif this vast concourse of people were in a Territory of the\nUnited States, any one of them would be obliged to have a\nslave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I\nunderstand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants\nslaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that one man\nfrom holding them.\nWhen I made my speech at Spring\ufb01eld, of which the\nJudge complains, and from which he quotes, I really was\nnot thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all. I\nhad no thought in the world that I was doing anything to\nbring about a war between the free and slave states. I had\nno thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring\nabout a political and social equality of the black and white\nraces. It never occurred to me that I was doing anything or\nfavoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the\nlocal institutions of the various States. But I must say, in all\nfairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which\nleads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did\n not mean it. It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any\nin\ufb02uence in producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can\nit be true that placing this institution upon the original\nbasis \u2014 the basis upon which our fathers placed it \u2014 can\nhave any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern\nStates at war with one another, or that it can have any\ntendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugar-cane,\nbecause they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the\npeople of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie,\nwhere they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in\nMaine, where they do grow? The Judge says this is a new\nprinciple started in regard to this question. Does the Judge\nclaim that he is working on the plan of the founders of\ngovernment? I think he says in some of his speeches\nindeed, I have one here now \u2014 that he saw evidence of a\npolicy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while\nnorth of it it should be excluded, and he saw an\nindisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that\npolicy, and therefore he set about studying the subject upon\noriginal principles, and upon original principles he got up\nthe Nebraska Bill! I am \ufb01ghting it upon these \u201coriginal\nprinciples,\u201d \ufb01ghting it in the Je\ufb00ersonian, Washingtonian,\nand Madisonian fashion.\nNow, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to\none or two other things in that Spring\ufb01eld speech. My main\nobject was to show, so far as my humble ability was capable\nof showing, to the people of this country what I believed\nwas the truth, \u2014 that there was a tendency, if not a\nconspiracy, among those who have engineered this slavery\n question for the last four or \ufb01ve years, to make slavery\nperpetual and universal in this nation. Having made that\nspeech principally for that object, after arranging the\nevidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I\nconcluded with this bit of comment:\n\u201cWe cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations\nare the result of preconcert; but when we see a lot of\nframed timbers, di\ufb00erent portions of which we know have\nbeen gotten out at di\ufb00erent times and places, and by\ndi\ufb00erent workmen \u2014 Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James,\nfor instance, \u2014 and when we see these timbers joined\ntogether, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or\na mill, all the tenons and mortises exactly \ufb01tting, and all\nthe lengths and proportions of the di\ufb00erent pieces exactly\nadapted to their respective places, and not a piece too\nmany or too few, \u2014 not omitting even the sca\ufb00olding, \u2014 or\nif a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame\nexactly \ufb01tted and prepared yet to bring such piece in, \u2014 in\nsuch a case we feel it impossible not to believe that\nStephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood\none another from the beginning, and all worked upon a\ncommon plan or draft drawn before the \ufb01rst blow was\nstruck.\u201d\nWhen my friend Judge Douglas came to Chicago on the\nth of July, this speech having been delivered on the th of\nJune, he made an harangue there, in which he took hold of\nthis speech of mine, showing that he had carefully read it;\nand while he paid no attention to this matter at all, but\ncomplimented me as being a \u201ckind, amiable, and intelligent\n gentleman,\u201d notwithstanding I had said this, he goes on\nand eliminates, or draws out, from my speech this tendency\nof mine to set the States at war with one another, to make\nall the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white\npeople to marrying together. Then, as the Judge had\ncomplimented me with these pleasant titles (I must confess\nto my weakness), I was a little \u201ctaken,\u201d for it came from a\ngreat man. I was not very much accustomed to \ufb02attery, and\nit came the sweeter to me. I was rather like the Hoosier,\nwith the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it\nbetter than any other man, and got less of it. As the Judge\nhad so \ufb02attered me, I could not make up my mind that he\nmeant to deal unfairly with me; so I went to work to show\nhim that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech,\nand that I really never intended to set the people at war\nwith one another. As an illustration, the next time I met\nhim, which was at Spring\ufb01eld, I used this expression, that I\nclaimed no right under the Constitution, nor had I any\ninclination, to enter into the slave States and interfere with\nthe institutions of slavery. He says upon that: Lincoln will\nnot enter into the slave States, but will go to the banks of\nthe Ohio, on this side, and shoot over! He runs on, step by\nstep, in the horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the\nSpring\ufb01eld speech he says: \u201cUnless he shall be successful\nin \ufb01ring his batteries until he shall have extinguished\nslavery in all the States the Union shall be dissolved.\u201d Now,\nI don\u2019t think that was exactly the way to treat \u201ca kind,\namiable, intelligent gentleman.\u201d I know if I had asked the\nJudge to show when or where it was I had said that, if I\n didn\u2019t succeed in \ufb01ring into the slave States until slavery\nshould be extinguished, the Union should be dissolved, he\ncould not have shown it. I understand what he would do.\nHe would say: I don\u2019t mean to quote from you, but this was\nthe result of what you say. But I have the right to ask, and I\ndo ask now, Did you not put it in such a form that an\nordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression\nfrom me?\nIn a speech at Spring\ufb01eld, on the night of the th, I\nthought I might as well attend to my own business a little,\nand I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge\nof conspiracy to nationalize slavery. I called his attention to\nthe fact that he had acknowledged in my hearing twice that\nhe had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of\nthe lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had\nput in no plea or answer, I took a default on him. I insisted\nthat I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy.\nTen days afterward I met the Judge at Clinton, \u2014 that is to\nsay, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion, \u2014 and\nheard him make a speech. Then he comes in with his plea\nto this charge, for the \ufb01rst time; and his plea when put in,\nas well as I can recollect it, amounted to this: that he never\nhad any talk with Judge Taney or the President of the\nUnited States with regard to the Dred Scott decision before\nit was made. I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who\nmakes a charge without knowing it to be true falsi\ufb01es as\nmuch as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and, lastly,\nthat he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but,\nhe would make no personal application of the charge of\n falsehood, not because of any regard for the \u201ckind, amiable,\nintelligent gentleman,\u201d but because of his own personal\nself-respect! I have understood since then (but [turning to\nJudge Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not\nwilling) that he has broken through the \u201cself-respect,\u201d and\nhas got to saying the thing out. The Judge nods to me that\nit is so. It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-\nhumored as I do, when the Judge acknowledges that he has\nbeen trying to make a question of veracity with me. I know\nthe Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but I\nfeel that I have got him. I demur to that plea. I waive all\nobjections that it was not \ufb01led till after default was taken,\nand demur to it upon the merits. What if Judge Douglas\nnever did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President\nbefore the Dred Scott decision was made, does it follow\nthat he could not have had as perfect an understanding\nwithout talking as with it? I am not disposed to stand upon\nmy legal advantage. I am disposed to take his denial as\nbeing like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any\nknowledge, information, or belief in the existence of such a\nconspiracy. I am disposed to take his answer as being as\nbroad as though he had put it in these words. And now, I\nask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to prove it on\nhim, and to o\ufb00er the evidence of more than two witnesses,\nby whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves the\nexistence of the conspiracy, does his broader answer\ndenying all knowledge, information, or belief, disturb the\nfact? It can only show that he was used by conspirators,\nand was not a leader of them.\n Now, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that\npersons who tell\nwhat they do not know to be true falsify as much as those\nwho knowingly\ntell falsehoods. I remember the rule, and it must be\nborne in mind that\nin what I have read to you, I do not say that I know such\na conspiracy\nto exist. To that I reply, I believe it. If the Judge says that\nI do not\nbelieve it, then he says what he does not know, and falls\nwithin his\nown rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not\nknow to be true,\nfalsi\ufb01es as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood. I\nwant to call\nyour attention to a little discussion on that branch of the\ncase, and the\nevidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which\nI expressed as\nmy belief. If, in arraying that evidence I had stated\nanything which was\nfalse or erroneous, it needed but that Judge Douglas\nshould point it out,\nand I would have taken it back, with all the kindness in\nthe world. I do\nnot deal in that way. If I have brought forward anything\nnot a fact, if he\n will point it out, it will not even ru\ufb04e me to take it back.\nBut if he\nwill not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is\nit not rather\nfor him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I\nhave reasoned\nfalsely, than to call the \u201ckind, amiable, intelligent\ngentleman\u201d a liar?\nIf I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation\nof an\nable debater to show by argument that I have wandered\nto an erroneous\nconclusion. I want to ask your attention to a portion of\nthe Nebraska\nBill, which Judge Douglas has quoted:\n\u201cIt being the true intent and meaning of this Act, not to\nlegislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to\nexclude it\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free\nto form and\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way,\nsubject only to the\nConstitution of the United States.\u201d\nThereupon Judge Douglas and others began to argue in\nfavor of \u201cpopular sovereignty,\u201d the right of the people to\nhave slaves if they wanted them, and to exclude slavery if\nthey did not want them. \u201cBut,\u201d said, in substance, a Senator\nfrom Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), \u201cwe more than suspect\n that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery\nif they wish to; and if you do mean it, accept an amendment\nwhich I propose, expressly authorizing the people to\nexclude slavery.\u201d\nI believe I have the amendment here before me, which\nwas o\ufb00ered, and under which the people of the Territory,\nthrough their representatives, might, if they saw \ufb01t,\nprohibit the existence of slavery therein. And now I state it\nas a fact, to be taken back if there is any mistake about it,\nthat Judge Douglas and those acting with him voted that\namendment down. I now think that those men who voted it\ndown had a real reason for doing so. They know what that\nreason was. It looks to us, since we have seen the Dred\nScott decision pronounced, holding that \u201cunder the\nConstitution\u201d the people cannot exclude slavery, I say it\nlooks to outsiders, poor, simple, \u201camiable, intelligent\ngentlemen,\u201d as though the niche was left as a place to put\nthat Dred Scott decision in, \u2014 a niche which would have\nbeen spoiled by adopting the amendment. And now, I say\nagain, if this was not the reason, it will avail the Judge\nmuch more to calmly and good-humoredly point out to\nthese people what that other reason was for voting the\namendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate\nthat he may be provoked to call somebody a liar.\nAgain: There is in that same quotation from the Nebraska\nBill this clause: \u201cIt being the true intent and meaning of\nthis bill not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State.\u201d\nI have always been puzzled to know what business the\nword \u201cState\u201d had in that connection. Judge Douglas knows.\n He put it there. He knows what he put it there for. We\noutsiders cannot say what he put it there for. The law they\nwere passing was not about States, and was not making\nprovisions for States. What was it placed there for? After\nseeing the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people\ncannot exclude slavery from a Territory, if another Dred\nScott decision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude\nit from a State, we shall discover that when the word was\noriginally put there, it was in view of something which was\nto come in due time, we shall see that it was the other half\nof something. I now say again, if there is any di\ufb00erent\nreason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a good-\nhumored way, without calling anybody a liar, can tell what\nthe reason was.\nWhen the Judge spoke at Clinton, he came very near\nmaking a charge of falsehood against me. He used, as I\nfound it printed in a newspaper, which, I remember, was\nvery nearly like the real speech, the following language:\n\u201cI did not answer the charge [of conspiracy] before, for\nthe reason that I did not suppose there was a man in\nAmerica with a heart so corrupt as to believe such a charge\ncould be true. I have too much respect for Mr. Lincoln to\nsuppose he is serious in making the charge.\u201d\nI confess this is rather a curious view, that out of respect\nfor me he should consider I was making what I deemed\nrather a grave charge in fun. I confess it strikes me rather\nstrangely. But I let it pass. As the Judge did not for a\nmoment believe that there was a man in America whose\nheart was so \u201ccorrupt\u201d as to make such a charge, and as he\n places me among the \u201cmen in America\u201d who have hearts\nbase enough to make such a charge, I hope he will excuse\nme if I hunt out another charge very like this; and if it\nshould turn out that in hunting I should \ufb01nd that other, and\nit should turn out to be Judge Douglas himself who made it,\nI hope he will reconsider this question of the deep\ncorruption of heart he has thought \ufb01t to ascribe to me. In\nJudge Douglas\u2019s speech of March , , which I hold in\nmy hand, he says:\n\u201cIn this connection there is another topic to which I\ndesire to allude. I seldom refer to the course of\nnewspapers, or notice the articles which they publish in\nregard to myself; but the course of the Washington Union\nhas been so extraordinary for the last two or three months,\nthat I think it well enough to make some allusion to it. It\nhas read me out of the Democratic party every other day, at\nleast for two or three months, and keeps reading me out,\nand, as if it had not succeeded, still continues to read me\nout, using such terms as \u2018traitor,\u2019 \u2018renegade,\u2019 \u2018deserter,\u2019 and\nother kind and polite epithets of that nature. Sir, I have no\nvindication to make of my Democracy against the\nWashington Union, or any other newspapers. I am willing to\nallow my history and action for the last twenty years to\nspeak for themselves as to my political principles and my\n\ufb01delity to political obligations. The Washington Union has a\npersonal grievance. When its editor was nominated for\npublic printer, I declined to vote for him, and stated that at\nsome time I might give my reasons for doing so. Since I\ndeclined to give that vote, this scurrilous abuse, these\n vindictive and constant attacks have been repeated almost\ndaily on me. Will any friend from Michigan read the article\nto which I allude?\u201d\nThis is a part of the speech. You must excuse me from\nreading the entire article of the Washington Union, as Mr.\nStuart read it for Mr. Douglas. The Judge goes on and sums\nup, as I think, correctly:\n\u201cMr. \nPresident, \nyou \nhere \n\ufb01nd \nseveral \ndistinct\npropositions advanced boldly by the Washington Union\neditorially, and apparently authoritatively; and any man\nwho questions any of them is denounced as an Abolitionist,\na Free-soiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, \ufb01rst, that the\nprimary object of all government at its original institution is\nthe protection of person and property; second, that the\nConstitution of the United States declares that the citizens\nof each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and\nimmunities of citizens in the several States; and that,\ntherefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or\notherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from\nsettling in another with their slave property, and especially\ndeclaring it forfeited, are direct violations of the original\nintention of the government and Constitution of the United\nStates; and, fourth, that the emancipation of the slaves of\nthe Northern States was a gross outrage of the rights of\nproperty, inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part\nof the owner.\n\u201cRemember that this article was published in the Union\non the th of November, and on the th appeared the\n \ufb01rst article giving the adhesion of the Union, to the\nLecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\n\u201cKANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION. \u2014 The vexed\nquestion is settled. The problem is saved. The dead point of\ndanger is passed. All serious trouble to Kansas a\ufb00airs is\nover and gone...\u201d\nAnd a column nearly of the same sort. Then, when you\ncome to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you \ufb01nd the\nsame doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth\neditorially in the Union. What is it?\n\u201cARTICLE , Section I. The right of property is before\nand higher than any constitutional sanction; and the right\nof the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the\nsame and as inviolable as the right of the owner of any\nproperty whatever.\u201d\nThen in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution\nmay be amended after  by a two-thirds vote:\n\u201cBut no alteration shall be made to a\ufb00ect the right of\nproperty in the ownership of slaves.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton\nConstitution that they are identical in spirit with the\nauthoritative article in the Washington Union of the day\nprevious to its indorsement of this Constitution.\u201d\nI pass over some portions of the speech, and I hope that\nany one who feels interested in this matter will read the\nentire section of the speech, and see whether I do the\nJudge injustice. He proceeds:\n\u201cWhen I saw that article in the Union of the th of\nNovember, followed by the glori\ufb01cation of the Lecompton\n Constitution on the th of November, and this clause in\nthe Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no\nright to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there\nwas a fatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the\nStates of this Union.\u201d\nI stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may\nall be read. I have read all of the portion I desire to\ncomment upon. What is this charge that the Judge thinks I\nmust have a very corrupt heart to make? It was a purpose\non the part of certain high functionaries to make it\nimpossible for the people of one State to prohibit the\npeople of any other State from entering it with their\n\u201cproperty,\u201d so called, and making it a slave State. In other\nwords, it was a charge implying a design to make the\ninstitution of slavery national. And now I ask your attention\nto what Judge Douglas has himself done here. I know he\nmade that part of the speech as a reason why he had\nrefused to vote for a certain man for public printer; but\nwhen we get at it, the charge itself is the very one I made\nagainst him, that he thinks I am so corrupt for uttering.\nNow, whom does he make that charge against? Does he\nmake it against that newspaper editor merely? No; he says\nit is identical in spirit with the Lecompton Constitution, and\nso the framers of that Constitution are brought in with the\neditor of the newspaper in that \u201cfatal blow being struck.\u201d\nHe did not call it a \u201cconspiracy.\u201d In his language, it is a\n\u201cfatal blow being struck.\u201d And if the words carry the\nmeaning better when changed from a \u201cconspiracy\u201d into a\n\u201cfatal blow being struck,\u201d I will change my expression, and\n call it \u201cfatal blow being struck.\u201d We see the charge made\nnot merely against the editor of the Union, but all the\nframers of the Lecompton Constitution; and not only so, but\nthe article was an authoritative article. By whose authority?\nIs there any question but he means it was by the authority\nof the President and his Cabinet, \u2014 the Administration?\nIs there any sort of question but he means to make that\ncharge? Then there are the editors of the Union, the\nframers of the Lecompton Constitution, the President of the\nUnited States and his Cabinet, and all the supporters of the\nLecompton Constitution, in Congress and out of Congress,\nwho are all involved in this \u201cfatal blow being struck.\u201d I\ncommend to Judge Douglas\u2019s consideration the question of\nhow corrupt a man\u2019s heart must be to make such a charge!\nNow, my friends, I have but one branch of the subject, in\nthe little time I have left, to which to call your attention;\nand as I shall come to a close at the end of that branch, it is\nprobable that I shall not occupy quite all the time allotted\nto me. Although on these questions I would like to talk\ntwice as long as I have, I could not enter upon another head\nand discuss it properly without running over my time. I ask\nthe attention of the people here assembled and elsewhere\nto the course that Judge Douglas is pursuing every day as\nbearing upon this question of making slavery national. Not\ngoing back to the records, but taking the speeches he\nmakes, the speeches he made yesterday and day before,\nand makes constantly all over the country, I ask your\nattention to them. In the \ufb01rst place, what is necessary to\nmake the institution national? Not war. There is no danger\n that the people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets,\nand, with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet, march\ninto Illinois and force them upon us. There is no danger of\nour going over there and making war upon them. Then\nwhat is necessary for the nationalization of slavery? It is\nsimply the next Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the\nSupreme Court to decide that no State under the\nConstitution can exclude it, just as they have already\ndecided that under the Constitution neither Congress nor\nthe Territorial Legislature can do it. When that is decided\nand acquiesced in, the whole thing is done. This being true,\nand this being the way, as I think, that slavery is to be made\nnational, let us consider what Judge Douglas is doing every\nday to that end. In the \ufb01rst place, let us see what in\ufb02uence\nhe is exerting on public sentiment. In this and like\ncommunities, public sentiment is everything. With public\nsentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can\nsucceed. Consequently, he who moulds public sentiment\ngoes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces\ndecisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or\nimpossible to be executed. This must be borne in mind, as\nalso the additional fact that Judge Douglas is a man of vast\nin\ufb02uence, so great that it is enough for many men to\nprofess to believe anything when they once \ufb01nd out Judge\nDouglas professes to believe it. Consider also the attitude\nhe occupies at the head of a large party, \u2014 a party which he\nclaims has a majority of all the voters in the country. This\nman sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a\nTerritory from excluding slavery, and he does so, not\n because he says it is right in itself, \u2014 he does not give any\nopinion on that, \u2014 but because it has been decided by the\ncourt; and being decided by the court, he is, and you are,\nbound to take it in your political action as law, not that he\njudges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the\ncourt is to him a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d He places it on that\nground alone; and you will bear in mind that thus\ncommitting himself unreservedly to this decision commits\nhim to the next one just as \ufb01rmly as to this. He did not\ncommit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the\ndecision, but it is a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d The next\ndecision, as much as this, will be a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nThere is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this\ndecision. It is nothing that I point out to him that his great\nprototype, General Jackson, did not believe in the binding\nforce of decisions. It is nothing to him that Je\ufb00erson did not\nso believe. I have said that I have often heard him approve\nof Jackson\u2019s course in disregarding the decision of the\nSupreme \nCourt \npronouncing \na \nNational \nBank\nconstitutional. He says I did not hear him say so. He denies\nthe accuracy of my recollection. I say he ought to know\nbetter than I, but I will make no question about this thing,\nthough it still seems to me that I heard him say it twenty\ntimes. I will tell him, though, that he now claims to stand on\nthe Cincinnati platform, which a\ufb00irms that Congress\ncannot charter a National Bank, in the teeth of that old\nstanding decision that Congress can charter a bank. And I\nremind him of another piece of history on the question of\nrespect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois\n history belonging to a time when the large party to which\nJudge Douglas belonged were displeased with a decision of\nthe Supreme Court of Illinois, because they had decided\nthat a Governor could not remove a Secretary of State. You\nwill \ufb01nd the whole story in Ford\u2019s History of Illinois, and I\nknow that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in\nfavor of over-slaughing that decision by the mode of adding\n\ufb01ve new judges, so as to vote down the four old ones. Not\nonly so, but it ended in the Judge\u2019s sitting down on that\nvery bench as one of the \ufb01ve new judges to break down the\nfour old ones It was in this way precisely that he got his\ntitle of judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men\nappointed conditionally to sit as members of a court will\nhave to be catechized beforehand upon some subject, I say,\n\u201cYou know, Judge; you have tried it.\u201d When he says a court\nof this kind will lose the con\ufb01dence of all men, will be\nprostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, \u201cYou\nknow best, Judge; you have been through the mill.\u201d But I\ncannot shake Judge Douglas\u2019s teeth loose from the Dred\nScott decision. Like some obstinate animal (I mean no\ndisrespect) that will hang on when he has once got his\nteeth \ufb01xed, you may cut o\ufb00 a leg, or you may tear away an\narm, still he will not relax his hold. And so I may point out\nto the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all over, from\nthe beginning of his political life to the present time, with\nattacks upon judicial decisions; I may cut o\ufb00 limb after limb\nof his public record, and strive to wrench him from a single\ndictum of the court, \u2014 yet I cannot divert him from it. He\nhangs, to the last, to the Dred Scott decision. These things\n show there is a purpose strong as death and eternity for\nwhich he adheres to this decision, and for which he will\nadhere to all other decisions of the same court.\n[A HIBERNIAN: \u201cGive us something besides Dred\nScott.\u201d]\nYes; no doubt you want to hear something that don\u2019t\nhurt. Now, having spoken of the Dred Scott decision, one\nmore word, and I am done. Henry Clay, my beau-ideal of a\nstatesman, the man for whom I fought all my humble life,\nHenry Clay once said of a class of men who would repress\nall tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation that\nthey must, if they would do this, go back to the era of our\nIndependence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its\nannual joyous return; they must blow out the moral lights\naround us; they must penetrate the human soul, and\neradicate there the love of liberty; and then, and not till\nthen, could they perpetuate slavery in this country! To my\nthinking, Judge Douglas is, by his example and vast\nin\ufb02uence, doing that very thing in this community, when he\nsays that the negro has nothing in the Declaration of\nIndependence. Henry Clay plainly understood the contrary.\nJudge Douglas is going back to the era of our Revolution,\nand, to the extent of his ability, muzzling the cannon which\nthunders its annual joyous return. When he invites any\npeople, willing to have slavery, to establish it, he is blowing\nout the moral lights around us. When he says he \u201ccares not\nwhether slavery is voted down or up,\u201d \u2014 that it is a sacred\nright of self-government, \u2014 he is, in my judgment,\npenetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of\n reason and the love of liberty in this American people. And\nnow I will only say that when, by all these means and\nappliances, Judge Douglas shall succeed in bringing public\nsentiment to an exact accordance with his own views; when\nthese \nvast \nassemblages \nshall \necho \nback \nall \nthese\nsentiments; when they shall come to repeat his views and\nto avow his principles, and to say all that he says on these\nmighty questions, \u2014 then it needs only the formality of the\nsecond Dred Scott decision, which he indorses in advance,\nto make slavery alike lawful in all the States, old as well as\nnew, North as well as South.\nMy friends, that ends the chapter. The Judge can take his\nhalf-hour.\n   .  I\n \n \n      \nI\n  .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: IT FOLLOWS as a matter of course\nthat a half-hour answer to a speech of an hour and a half\ncan be but a very hurried one. I shall only be able to touch\nupon a few of the points suggested by Judge Douglas, and\ngive them a brief attention, while I shall have to totally omit\nothers for the want of time.\nJudge Douglas has said to you that he has not been able\nto get from me an answer to the question whether I am in\nfavor of negro citizenship. So far as I know the Judge never\nasked me the question before. He shall have no occasion to\never ask it again, for I tell him very frankly that I am not in\nfavor of negro citizenship. This furnishes me an occasion\nfor saying a few words upon the subject. I mentioned in a\ncertain speech of mine, which has been printed, that the\nSupreme Court had decided that a negro could not possibly\nbe made a citizen; and without saying what was my ground\nof complaint in regard to that, or whether I had any ground\nof \ncomplaint, \nJudge \nDouglas \nhas \nfrom \nthat \nthing\nmanufactured nearly everything that he ever says about my\ndisposition to produce an equality between the negroes and\nthe white people. If any one will read my speech, he will\n\ufb01nd I mentioned that as one of the points decided in the\ncourse of the Supreme Court opinions, but I did not state\n what objection I had to it. But Judge Douglas tells the\npeople what my objection was when I did not tell them\nmyself. Now, my opinion is that the di\ufb00erent States have\nthe power to make a negro a citizen under the Constitution\nof the United States if they choose. The Dred Scott decision\ndecides that they have not that power. If the State of Illinois\nhad that power, I should be opposed to the exercise of it.\nThat is all I have to say about it.\nJudge Douglas has told me that he heard my speeches\nnorth and my speeches south; that he had heard me at\nOttawa and at Freeport in the north and recently at\nJonesboro in the south, and there was a very di\ufb00erent cast\nof sentiment in the speeches made at the di\ufb00erent points. I\nwill not charge upon Judge Douglas that he wilfully\nmisrepresents me, but I call upon every fair-minded man to\ntake these speeches and read them, and I dare him to point\nout any di\ufb00erence between my speeches north and south.\nWhile I am here perhaps I ought to say a word, if I have the\ntime, in regard to the latter portion of the Judge\u2019s speech,\nwhich was a sort of declamation in reference to my having\nsaid I entertained the belief that this government would not\nendure half slave and half free. I have said so, and I did not\nsay it without what seemed to me to be good reasons. It\nperhaps would require more time than I have now to set\nforth these reasons in detail; but let me ask you a few\nquestions. Have we ever had any peace on this slavery\nquestion? When are we to have peace upon it, if it is kept in\nthe position it now occupies? How are we ever to have\npeace upon it? That is an important question. To be sure, if\n we will all stop, and allow Judge Douglas and his friends to\nmarch on in their present career until they plant the\ninstitution all over the nation, here and wherever else our\n\ufb02ag waves, and we acquiesce in it, there will be peace. But\nlet me ask Judge Douglas how he is going to get the people\nto do that? They have been wrangling over this question for\nat least forty years. This was the cause of the agitation\nresulting in the Missouri Compromise; this produced the\ntroubles at the annexation of Texas, in the acquisition of the\nterritory acquired in the Mexican War. Again, this was the\ntrouble which was quieted by the Compromise of ,\nwhen it was settled \u201cforever\u201d as both the great political\nparties declared in their National Conventions. That\n\u201cforever\u201d turned out to be just four years, when Judge\nDouglas himself reopened it. When is it likely to come to an\nend? He introduced the Nebraska Bill in  to put\nanother end to the slavery agitation. He promised that it\nwould \ufb01nish it all up immediately, and he has never made a\nspeech since, until he got into a quarrel with the President\nabout the Lecompton Constitution, in which he has not\ndeclared that we are just at the end of the slavery agitation.\nBut in one speech, I think last winter, he did say that he did\nn\u2019t quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would\ncome. Now he tells us again that it is all over and the\npeople of Kansas have voted down the Lecompton\nConstitution. How is it over? That was only one of the\nattempts at putting an end to the slavery agitation \u2014 one of\nthese \u201c\ufb01nal settlements.\u201d Is Kansas in the Union? Has she\nformed a constitution that she is likely to come in under? Is\n not the slavery agitation still an open question in that\nTerritory? Has the voting down of that constitution put an\nend to all the trouble? Is that more likely to settle it than\nevery one of these previous attempts to settle the slavery\nagitation? Now, at this day in the history of the world we\ncan no more foretell where the end of this slavery agitation\nwill be than we can see the end of the world itself. The\nNebraska-Kansas Bill was introduced four years and a half\nago, and if the agitation is ever to come to an end we may\nsay we are four years and a half nearer the end. So, too, we\ncan say we are four years and a half nearer the end of the\nworld, and we can just as clearly see the end of the world\nas we can see the end of this agitation. The Kansas\nsettlement did not conclude it. If Kansas should sink to-day,\nand leave a great vacant space in the earth\u2019s surface, this\nvexed question would still be among us. I say, then, there is\nno way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst\nus but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers\nplaced it; no way but to keep it out of our new Territories,\n\u2014 to restrict it forever to the old States where it now\nexists. Then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is\nin the course of ultimate extinction. That is one way of\nputting an end to the slavery agitation.\nThe other way is for us to surrender and let Judge\nDouglas and his friends have their way and plant slavery\nover all the States; cease speaking of it as in any way a\nwrong; regard slavery as one of the common matters of\nproperty, and speak of negroes as we do of our horses and\ncattle. But while it drives on in its state of progress as it is\n now driving, and as it has driven for the last \ufb01ve years, I\nhave ventured the opinion, and I say to-day, that we will\nhave no end to the slavery agitation until it takes one turn\nor the other. I do not mean that when it takes a turn toward\nultimate extinction it will be in a day, nor in a year, nor in\ntwo years. I do not suppose that in the most peaceful way\nultimate extinction would occur in less than a hundred\nyears at least; but that it will occur in the best way for both\nraces, in God\u2019s own good time, I have no doubt. But, my\nfriends, I have used up more of my time than I intended on\nthis point.\nNow, in regard to this matter about Trumbull and myself\nhaving made a bargain to sell out the entire Whig and\nDemocratic parties in : Judge Douglas brings forward\nno evidence to sustain his charge, except the speech\nMatheny is said to have made in , in which he told a\ncock-and-bull story of that sort, upon the same moral\nprinciples that Judge Douglas tells it here to-day. This is the\nsimple truth. I do not care greatly for the story, but this is\nthe truth of it: and I have twice told Judge Douglas to his\nface that from beginning to end there is not one word of\ntruth in it. I have called upon him for the proof, and he does\nnot at all meet me as Trumbull met him upon that of which\nwe were just talking, by producing the record. He did n\u2019t\nbring the record because there was no record for him to\nbring. When he asks if I am ready to indorse Trumbull\u2019s\nveracity after he has broken a bargain with me, I reply that\nif Trumbull had broken a bargain with me I would not be\nlikely to indorse his veracity; but I am ready to indorse his\n veracity because neither in that thing, nor in any other, in\nall the years that I have known Lyman Trumbull, have I\nknown him to fail of his word or tell a falsehood large or\nsmall. It is for that reason that I indorse Lyman Trumbull.\n[Mr. JAMES BROWN (Douglas postmaster): \u201cWhat does\nFord\u2019s History say about him?\u201d]\nSome gentleman asks me what Ford\u2019s History says about\nhim. My own recollection is that Ford speaks of Trumbull in\nvery disrespectful terms in several portions of his book, and\nthat he talks a great deal worse of Judge Douglas. I refer\nyou, sir, to the History for examination.\nJudge Douglas complains at considerable length about a\ndisposition on the part of Trumbull and myself to attack\nhim personally. I want to attend to that suggestion a\nmoment. I don\u2019t want to be unjustly accused of dealing\nilliberally or unfairly with an adversary, either in court or in\na political canvass or anywhere else. I would despise myself\nif I supposed myself ready to deal less liberally with an\nadversary than I was willing to be treated myself. Judge\nDouglas in a general way, without putting it in a direct\nshape, revives the old charge against me in reference to\nthe Mexican War. He does not take the responsibility of\nputting it in a very de\ufb01nite form, but makes a general\nreference to it. That charge is more than ten years old. He\ncomplains of Trumbull and myself because he says we bring\ncharges against him one or two years old. He knows, too,\nthat in regard to the Mexican War story the more\nrespectable papers of his own party throughout the State\n have been compelled to take it back and acknowledge that\nit was a lie.\n[Here Mr. LINCOLN turned to the crowd on the platform,\nand, selecting HON. ORLANDO B. FICKLIN, led him\nforward and said:]\nI do not mean to do anything with Mr. FICKLIN except to\npresent his face and tell you that he personally knows it to\nbe a lie! He was a member of Congress at the only time I\nwas in Congress, and [FICKLIN] knows that whenever\nthere was an attempt to procure a vote of mine which\nwould indorse the origin and justice of the war, I refused to\ngive such indorsement and voted against it; but I never\nvoted against the supplies for the army, and he knows, as\nwell as Judge Douglas, that whenever a dollar was asked by\nway of compensation or otherwise for the bene\ufb01t of the\nsoldiers I gave all the votes that FICKLIN or Douglas did,\nand perhaps more.\n[Mr. FICKLIN: My friends, I wish to say this in reference\nto the matter: Mr. Lincoln and myself are just as good\npersonal friends as Judge Douglas and myself. In reference\nto this Mexican War, my recollection is that when Ashmun\u2019s\nresolution [amendment] was o\ufb00ered by Mr. Ashmun of\nMassachusetts, in which he declared that the Mexican War\nwas unnecessary and unconstitutionally commenced by the\nPresident-my recollection is that Mr. Lincoln voted for that\nresolution.]\nThat is the truth. Now, you all remember that was a\nresolution censuring the President for the manner in which\nthe war was begun. You know they have charged that I\n voted against the supplies, by which I starved the soldiers\nwho were out \ufb01ghting the battles of their country. I say that\nFICKLIN knows it is false. When that charge was brought\nforward by the Chicago Times, the Spring\ufb01eld Register\n[Douglas\u2019s organ] reminded the Times that the charge\nreally applied to John Henry; and I do know that John\nHenry is now making speeches and \ufb01ercely battling for\nJudge Douglas. If the Judge now says that he o\ufb00ers this as a\nsort of seto\ufb00 to what I said to-day in reference to\nTrumbull\u2019s charge, then I remind him that he made this\ncharge before I said a word about Trumbull\u2019s. He brought\nthis forward at Ottawa, the \ufb01rst time we met face to face;\nand in the opening speech that Judge Douglas made he\nattacked me in regard to a matter ten years old. Is n\u2019t he a\npretty man to be whining about people making charges\nagainst him only two years old!\nThe Judge thinks it is altogether wrong that I should have\ndwelt upon this charge of Trumbull\u2019s at all. I gave the\napology for doing so in my opening speech. Perhaps it did\nn\u2019t \ufb01x your attention. I said that when Judge Douglas was\nspeaking at place \u2014 where I spoke on the succeeding day\nhe used very harsh language about this charge. Two or\nthree times afterward I said I had con\ufb01dence in Judge\nTrumbull\u2019s veracity and intelligence; and my own opinion\nwas, from what I knew of the character of Judge Trumbull,\nthat he would vindicate his position and prove whatever he\nhad stated to be true. This I repeated two or three times;\nand then I dropped it, without saying anything more on the\nsubject for weeks \u2014 perhaps a month. I passed it by\n without noticing it at all till I found, at Jacksonville, Judge\nDouglas in the plenitude of his power is not willing to\nanswer Trumbull and let me alone, but he comes out there\nand uses this language: \u201cHe should not hereafter occupy\nhis time in refuting such charges made by Trumbull but\nthat, Lincoln having indorsed the character of Trumbull for\nveracity, he should hold him [Lincoln] responsible for the\nslanders.\u201d What was Lincoln to do? Did he not do right,\nwhen he had the \ufb01t opportunity of meeting Judge Douglas\nhere, to tell him he was ready for the responsibility? I ask a\ncandid audience whether in doing thus Judge Douglas was\nnot the assailant rather than I? Here I meet him face to\nface, and say I am ready to take the responsibility, so far as\nit rests on me.\nHaving done so I ask the attention of this audience to the\nquestion whether I have succeeded in sustaining the\ncharge, and whether Judge Douglas has at all succeeded in\nrebutting it? You all heard me call upon him to say which of\nthese pieces of evidence was a forgery. Does he say that\nwhat I present here as a copy of the original Toombs bill is\na forgery? Does he say that what I present as a copy of the\nbill reported by himself is a forgery, or what is presented as\na transcript from the Globe of the quotations from Bigler\u2019s\nspeech is a forgery? Does he say the quotations from his\nown speech are forgeries? Does he say this transcript from\nTrumbull\u2019s speech is a forgery?\n[\u201cHe didn\u2019t deny one of them.\u201d]\nI would then like to know how it comes about that when\neach piece of a story is true the whole story turns out false.\n I take it these people have some sense; they see plainly that\nJudge Douglas is playing cuttle-\ufb01sh, a small species of \ufb01sh\nthat has no mode of defending itself when pursued except\nby throwing out a black \ufb02uid, which makes the water so\ndark the enemy cannot see it, and thus it escapes. Ain\u2019t the\nJudge playing the cuttle-\ufb01sh?\nNow, I would ask very special attention to the\nconsideration of Judge Douglas\u2019s speech at Jacksonville;\nand when you shall read his speech of to-day, I ask you to\nwatch closely and see which of these pieces of testimony,\nevery one of which he says is a forgery, he has shown to be\nsuch. Not one of them has he shown to be a forgery. Then I\nask the original question, if each of the pieces of testimony\nis true, how is it possible that the whole is a falsehood?\nIn regard to Trumbull\u2019s charge that he [Douglas] inserted\na provision into the bill to prevent the constitution being\nsubmitted to the people, what was his answer? He comes\nhere and reads from the Congressional Globe to show that\non his motion that provision was struck out of the bill. Why,\nTrumbull has not said it was not stricken out, but Trumbull\nsays he [Douglas] put it in; and it is no answer to the\ncharge to say he afterwards took it out. Both are perhaps\ntrue. It was in regard to that thing precisely that I told him\nhe had dropped the cub. Trumbull shows you that by his\nintroducing the bill it was his cub. It is no answer to that\nassertion to call Trumbull a liar merely because he did not\nspecially say that Douglas struck it out. Suppose that were\nthe case, does it answer Trumbull? I assert that you\n[pointing to an individual] are here to-day, and you\n undertake to prove me a liar by showing that you were in\nMattoon yesterday. I say that you took your hat o\ufb00 your\nhead, and you prove me a liar by putting it on your head.\nThat is the whole force of Douglas\u2019s argument.\nNow, I want to come back to my original question.\nTrumbull says that Judge Douglas had a bill with a\nprovision in it for submitting a constitution to be made to a\nvote of the people of Kansas. Does Judge Douglas deny that\nfact? Does he deny that the provision which Trumbull reads\nwas put in that bill? Then Trumbull says he struck it out.\nDoes he dare to deny that? He does not, and I have the\nright to repeat the question, \u2014 Why Judge Douglas took it\nout? Bigler has said there was a combination of certain\nsenators, among whom he did not include Judge Douglas,\nby which it was agreed that the Kansas Bill should have a\nclause in it not to have the constitution formed under it\nsubmitted to a vote of the people. He did not say that\nDouglas was among them, but we prove by another source\nthat about the same time Douglas comes into the Senate\nwith that provision stricken out of the bill. Although Bigler\ncannot say they were all working in concert, yet it looks\nvery much as if the thing was agreed upon and done with a\nmutual understanding after the conference; and while we\ndo not know that it was absolutely so, yet it looks so\nprobable that we have a right to call upon the man who\nknows the true reason why it was done to tell what the true\nreason was. When he will not tell what the true reason was,\nhe stands in the attitude of an accused thief who has stolen\ngoods in his possession, and when called to account refuses\n to tell where he got them. Not only is this the evidence, but\nwhen he comes in with the bill having the provision\nstricken out, he tells us in a speech, not then but since, that\nthese alterations and modi\ufb01cations in the bill had been\nmade by HIM, in consultation with Toombs, the originator\nof the bill. He tells us the same to-day. He says there were\ncertain modi\ufb01cations made in the bill in committee that he\ndid not vote for. I ask you to remember, while certain\namendments were made which he disapproved of, but\nwhich a majority of the committee voted in, he has himself\ntold us that in this particular the alterations and\nmodi\ufb01cations were made by him, upon consultation with\nToombs. We have his own word that these alterations were\nmade by him, and not by the committee. Now, I ask, what is\nthe reason Judge Douglas is so chary about coming to the\nexact question? What is the reason he will not tell you\nanything about How it was made, BY WHOM it was made,\nor that he remembers it being made at all? Why does he\nstand playing upon the meaning of words and quibbling\naround the edges of the evidence? If he can explain all this,\nbut leaves it unexplained, I have the right to infer that\nJudge Douglas understood it was the purpose of his party,\nin engineering that bill through, to make a constitution, and\nhave Kansas come into the Union with that constitution,\nwithout its being submitted to a vote of the people. If he\nwill explain his action on this question, by giving a better\nreason for the facts that happened than he has done, it will\nbe satisfactory. But until he does that \u2014 until he gives a\nbetter or more plausible reason than he has o\ufb00ered against\n the evidence in the case \u2014 I suggest to him it will not avail\nhim at all that he swells himself up, takes on dignity, and\ncalls people liars. Why, sir, there is not a word in Trumbull\u2019s\nspeech that depends on Trumbull\u2019s veracity at all. He has\nonly arrayed the evidence and told you what follows as a\nmatter of reasoning. There is not a statement in the whole\nspeech that depends on Trumbull\u2019s word. If you have ever\nstudied geometry, you remember that by a course of\nreasoning Euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are\nequal to two right angles. Euclid has shown you how to\nwork it out. Now, if you undertake to disprove that\nproposition, and to show that it is erroneous, would you\nprove it to be false by calling Euclid a liar? They tell me\nthat my time is out, and therefore I close.\n     \n  \n   \n    I\nA    \n    \nA \nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\nSPRINGFIELD, FEBRUARY ,  MY DEAR SIR:\nI began with  votes, Shields , and Trumbull , \u2014 yet\nTrumbull was elected. In fact  di\ufb00erent members voted\nfor me, \u2014 getting three new ones on the second ballot, and\nlosing four old ones. How came my  to yield to\nTrumbull\u2019s ? It was Governor Matteson\u2019s work. He has\nbeen secretly a candidate ever since (before, even) the fall\nelection.\nAll the members round about the canal were Anti-\nNebraska, but were nevertheless nearly all Democrats and\nold personal friends of his. His plan was to privately\nimpress them with the belief that he was as good Anti-\nNebraska as any one else \u2014 at least could be secured to be\nso by instructions, which could be easily passed.\nThe Nebraska men, of course, were not for Matteson; but\nwhen they found they could elect no avowed Nebraska\nman, they tardily determined to let him get whomever of\nour men he could, by whatever means he could, and ask\nhim no questions.\nThe Nebraska men were very con\ufb01dent of the election of\nMatteson, though denying that he was a candidate, and we\nvery much believing also that they would elect him. But\n they wanted \ufb01rst to make a show of good faith to Shields by\nvoting for him a few times, and our secret Matteson men\nalso wanted to make a show of good faith by voting with us\na few times. So we led o\ufb00. On the seventh ballot, I think,\nthe signal was given to the Nebraska men to turn to\nMatteson, which they acted on to a man, with one\nexception. . . Next ballot the remaining Nebraska man and\none pretended Anti went over to him, giving him . The\nnext still another, giving him , wanting only three of an\nelection. In the meantime our friends, with a view of\ndetaining our expected bolters, had been turning from me\nto Trumbull till he had risen to  and I had been reduced\nto . These would never desert me except by my direction;\nbut I became satis\ufb01ed that if we could prevent Matteson\u2019s\nelection one or two ballots more, we could not possibly do\nso a single ballot after my friends should begin to return to\nme from Trumbull. So I determined to strike at once, and\naccordingly advised my remaining friends to go for him,\nwhich they did and elected him on the tenth ballot.\nSuch is the way the thing was done. I think you would\nhave done the same under the circumstances.\nI could have headed o\ufb00 every combination and been\nelected, had it not been for Matteson\u2019s double game \u2014 and\nhis defeat now gives me more pleasure than my own gives\nme pain. On the whole, it is perhaps as well for our general\ncause that Trumbull is elected. The Nebraska men confess\nthat they hate it worse than anything that could have\nhappened. It is a great consolation to see them worse\nwhipped than I am.\n Yours forever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n    \n \n  \n  A\n   \n    I\nTO SANFORD, PORTER, AND STRIKER, NEW YORK.\nSPRINGFIELD, MARCH , \nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 Yours of the th is received, as also was\nthat of th Dec, last, inclosing bond of Clift to Pray.

BROWNING.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your letter to Judge Logan has been\nshown to us by him; and, with his consent, we answer it.\nWhen it became probable that there would be a vacancy on\nthe Supreme Bench, public opinion, on this side of the river,\nseemed to be universally directed to Logan as the proper\nman to \ufb01ll it. I mean public opinion on our side in politics,\nwith very small manifestation in any di\ufb00erent direction by\nthe other side. The result is, that he has been a good deal\npressed to allow his name to be used, and he has consented\nto it, provided it can be done with perfect cordiality and\ngood feeling on the part of all our own friends. We, the\nundersigned, are very anxious for it; and the more so now\nthat he has been urged, until his mind is turned upon the\nmatter. We, therefore are very glad of your letter, with the\ninformation it brings us, mixed only with a regret that we\ncan not elect Logan and Walker both. We shall be glad, if\nyou will hoist Logan\u2019s name, in your Quincy papers.\nVery truly your friends,\nA. LINCOLN, B. S. EWARDS, JOHN T. STUART.\n  \n H.  . \nHI \n  .\nSPRINGFIELD, June , .\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your note containing election news is\nreceived; and for which I thank you. It is all of no use,\nhowever. Logan is worse beaten than any other man ever\nwas since elections were invented \u2014 beaten more than\ntwelve hundred in this county. It is conceded on all hands\nthat the Prohibitory law is also beaten.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n    \n A   \n   A       I \nTO JOSHUA. F. SPEED.\nSPRINGFIELD, AUGUST , \nDEAR SPEED: \u2014 You know what a poor correspondent I\nam. Ever since I received your very agreeable letter of the\nd of May, I have been intending to write you an answer\nto it. You suggest that in political action, now, you and I\nwould di\ufb00er. I suppose we would; not quite as much,\nhowever, as you may think. You know I dislike slavery, and\nyou fully admit the abstract wrong of it. So far there is no\ncause of di\ufb00erence. But you say that sooner than yield your\nlegal right to the slave, especially at the bidding of those\nwho are not themselves interested, you would see the\nUnion dissolved. I am not aware that any one is bidding you\nyield that right; very certainly I am not. I leave that matter\nentirely to yourself. I also acknowledge your rights and my\nobligations under the Constitution in regard to your slaves.\nI confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and\ncaught and carried back to their stripes and unrequited\ntoil; but I bite my lips and keep quiet. In  you and I had\ntogether a tedious low-water trip on a steamboat from\nLouisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that\nfrom Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio there were on\nboard ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons.\n That sight was a continued torment to me, and I see\nsomething like it every time I touch the Ohio or any other\nslave border. It is not fair for you to assume that I have no\ninterest in a thing which has, and continually exercises, the\npower of making me miserable. You ought rather to\nappreciate how much the great body of the Northern\npeople do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their\nloyalty to the Constitution and the Union. I do oppose the\nextension of slavery because my judgment and feeling so\nprompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary.\nIf for this you and I must di\ufb00er, di\ufb00er we must. You say, if\nyou were President, you would send an army and hang the\nleaders of the Missouri outrages upon the Kansas elections;\nstill, if Kansas fairly votes herself a slave State she must be\nadmitted or the Union must be dissolved. But how if she\nvotes herself a slave State unfairly, that is, by the very\nmeans for which you say you would hang men? Must she\nstill be admitted, or the Union dissolved? That will be the\nphase of the question when it \ufb01rst becomes a practical one.\nIn your assumption that there may be a fair decision of the\nslavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would\ndi\ufb00er about the Nebraska law. I look upon that enactment\nnot as a law, but as a violence from the beginning. It was\nconceived in violence, is maintained in violence, and is\nbeing executed in violence. I say it was conceived in\nviolence, \nbecause \nthe \ndestruction \nof \nthe \nMissouri\nCompromise, under the circumstances, was nothing less\nthan violence. It was passed in violence because it could\nnot have passed at all but for the votes of many members in\n violence of the known will of their constituents. It is\nmaintained in violence, because the elections since clearly\ndemand its repeal; and the demand is openly disregarded.\nYou say men ought to be hung for the way they are\nexecuting the law; I say the way it is being executed is\nquite as good as any of its antecedents. It is being executed\nin the precise way which was intended from the \ufb01rst, else\nwhy does no Nebraska man express astonishment or\ncondemnation? Poor Reeder is the only public man who has\nbeen silly enough to believe that anything like fairness was\never intended, and he has been bravely undeceived.\nThat Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it\nwill ask to be admitted into the Union, I take to be already\na settled question, and so settled by the very means you so\npointedly condemn. By every principle of law ever held by\nany court North or South, every negro taken to Kansas is\nfree; yet, in utter disregard of this, \u2014 in the spirit of\nviolence merely, \u2014 that beautiful Legislature gravely passes\na law to hang any man who shall venture to inform a negro\nof his legal rights. This is the subject and real object of the\nlaw. If, like Haman, they should hang upon the gallows of\ntheir own building, I shall not be among the mourners for\ntheir fate. In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the\nrestoration of the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas\nremains a Territory, and when, by all these foul means, it\nseeks to come into the Union as a slave State, I shall\noppose it. I am very loath in any case to withhold my assent\nto the enjoyment of property acquired or located in good\nfaith; but I do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to\n Kansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man.\nAny man who has sense enough to be the controller of his\nown property has too much sense to misunderstand the\noutrageous character of the whole Nebraska business. But I\ndigress. In my opposition to the admission of Kansas I shall\nhave some company, but we may be beaten. If we are, I\nshall not on that account attempt to dissolve the Union. I\nthink it probable, however, we shall be beaten. Standing as\na unit among yourselves, You can, directly and indirectly,\nbribe enough of our men to carry the day, as you could on\nthe open proposition to establish a monarchy. Get hold of\nsome man in the North whose position and ability is such\nthat he can make the support of your measure, whatever it\nmay be, a Democratic party necessity, and the thing is\ndone. Apropos of this, let me tell you an anecdote. Douglas\nintroduced the Nebraska Bill in January. In February\nafterward there was a called session of the Illinois\nLegislature. Of the one hundred members composing the\ntwo branches of that body, about seventy were Democrats.\nThese latter held a caucus in which the Nebraska Bill was\ntalked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby\ndiscovered that just three, and no more, were in favor of\nthe measure. In a day or two Douglas\u2019s orders came on to\nhave resolutions passed approving the bill; and they were\npassed by large majorities!!!! The truth of this is vouched\nfor by a bolting Democratic member. The masses, too,\nDemocratic as well as Whig, were even nearer unanimous\nagainst it; but, as soon as the party necessity of supporting\n it became apparent, the way the Democrats began to see\nthe wisdom and justice of it was perfectly astonishing.\nYou say that if Kansas fairly votes herself a free State, as\na Christian you will rejoice at it. All decent slaveholders\ntalk that way, and I do not doubt their candor. But they\nnever vote that way. Although in a private letter or\nconversation you will express your preference that Kansas\nshall be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who\nwould say the same thing publicly. No such man could be\nelected from any district in a slave State. You think\nStringfellow and company ought to be hung; and yet at the\nnext Presidential election you will vote for the exact type\nand representative of Stringfellow. The slave-breeders and\nslave-traders are a small, odious, and detested class among\nyou; and yet in politics they dictate the course of all of you,\nand are as completely your masters as you are the master\nof your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand. That\nis a disputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say\nthere are no Whigs, and that I am an Abolitionist. When I\nwas at Washington, I voted for the Wilmot Proviso as good\nas forty times; and I never heard of any one attempting to\nun-Whig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the\nextension of slavery. I am not a Know-Nothing; that is\ncertain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the\noppression of negroes be in favor of degrading classes of\nwhite people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to\nbe pretty rapid. As a nation we began by declaring that \u201call\nmen are created equal.\u201d We now practically read it \u201call men\nare created equal, except negroes.\u201d When the Know-\n Nothings get control, it will read \u201call men are created\nequal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\u201d When\nit comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country\nwhere they make no pretense of loving liberty, \u2014 to Russia,\nfor instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and\nwithout the base alloy of hypocrisy.\nMary will probably pass a day or two in Louisville in\nOctober. My kindest regards to Mrs. Speed. On the leading\nsubject of this letter I have more of her sympathy than I\nhave of yours; and yet let me say I am,\nYour friend forever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n       H A     I\n I  \n   \n           .\n  I    \n  A \n \nA     \nI\n(MR. DOUGLAS WAS not present.)\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \n\u2014 \nAnother \nelection, \nwhich \nis\ndeemed an important one, is approaching, and, as I\nsuppose, the Republican party will, without much di\ufb00iculty,\nelect their State ticket. But in regard to the Legislature,\nwe, the Republicans, labor under some disadvantages. In\nthe \ufb01rst place, we have a Legislature to elect upon an\napportionment of the representation made several years\nago, when the proportion of the population was far greater\nin the South (as compared with the North) than it now is;\nand inasmuch as our opponents hold almost entire sway in\nthe South, and we a correspondingly large majority in the\nNorth, the fact that we are now to be represented as we\nwere years ago, when the population was di\ufb00erent, is to us\na very great disadvantage. We had in the year ,\naccording to law, a census, or enumeration of the\ninhabitants, taken for the purpose of a new apportionment\nof representation. We know what a fair apportionment of\nrepresentation upon that census would give us. We know\nthat it could not, if fairly made, fail to give the Republican\nparty from six to ten more members of the Legislature than\nthey can probably get as the law now stands. It so\n happened at the last session of the Legislature that our\nopponents, holding the control of both branches of the\nLegislature, \nsteadily \nrefused \nto \ngive \nus \nsuch \nan\napportionment as we were rightly entitled to have upon the\ncensus already taken. The Legislature steadily refused to\ngive us such an apportionment as we were rightfully\nentitled to have upon the census taken of the population of\nthe State. The Legislature would pass no bill upon that\nsubject, except such as was at least as unfair to us as the\nold one, and in which, in some instances, two men in the\nDemocratic regions were allowed to go as far toward\nsending a member to the Legislature as three were in the\nRepublican regions. Comparison was made at the time as to\nrepresentative and senatorial districts, which completely\ndemonstrated that such was the fact. Such a bill was\npassed and tendered to the Republican Governor for his\nsignature; but, principally for the reasons I have stated, he\nwithheld his approval, and the bill fell without becoming a\nlaw.\nAnother disadvantage under which we labor is that there\nare one or two Democratic Senators who will be members\nof the next Legislature, and will vote for the election of\nSenator, who are holding over in districts in which we\ncould, on all reasonable calculation, elect men of our own,\nif we only had the chance of an election. When we consider\nthat there are but twenty-\ufb01ve Senators in the Senate,\ntaking two from the side where they rightfully belong, and\nadding them to the other, is to us a disadvantage not to be\nlightly regarded. Still, so it is; we have this to contend with.\n Perhaps there is no ground of complaint on our part. In\nattending to the many things involved in the last general\nelection \nfor \nPresident, \nGovernor, \nAuditor, \nTreasurer,\nSuperintendent \nof \nPublic \nInstruction, \nMembers \nof\nCongress, of the Legislature, County O\ufb00icers, and so on, we\nallowed these things to happen by want of su\ufb00icient\nattention, and we have no cause to complain of our\nadversaries, so far as this matter is concerned. But we have\nsome cause to complain of the refusal to give us a fair\napportionment.\nThere is still another disadvantage under which we labor,\nand to which I will ask your attention. It arises out of the\nrelative positions of the two persons who stand before the\nState as candidates for the Senate. Senator Douglas is of\nworld-wide renown. All the anxious politicians of his party,\nor who have been of his party for years past, have been\nlooking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the\nPresident of the United States. They have seen in his\nround, \njolly, \nfruitful \nface \npost-o\ufb00ices, \nland-o\ufb00ices,\nmarshalships, and cabinet appointments, charge-ships and\nforeign missions bursting and sprouting out in wonderful\nexuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands.\nAnd as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture\nso long, they cannot, in the little distraction that has taken\nplace in the party, bring themselves to give up the\ncharming hope; but with greedier anxiety they rush about\nhim, sustain him, and give him marches, triumphal entries,\nand receptions beyond what even in the days of his highest\nprosperity they could have brought about in his favor. On\n the contrary, nobody has ever expected me to be President.\nIn my poor, lean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that any\ncabbages were sprouting out. These are disadvantages all,\ntaken together, that the Republicans labor under. We have\nto \ufb01ght this battle upon principle, and upon principle alone.\nI am, in a certain sense, made the standard-bearer in behalf\nof the Republicans. I was made so merely because there\nhad to be some one so placed, \u2014 I being in nowise\npreferable to any other one of twenty-\ufb01ve, perhaps a\nhundred, we have in the Republican ranks. Then I say I\nwish it to be distinctly understood and borne in mind that\nwe have to \ufb01ght this battle without many \u2014 perhaps\nwithout any of the external aids which are brought to bear\nagainst us. So I hope those with whom I am surrounded\nhave principle enough to nerve themselves for the task, and\nleave nothing undone that can be fairly done to bring about\nthe right result.\nAfter Senator Douglas left Washington, as his movements\nwere made known by the public prints, he tarried a\nconsiderable time in the city of New York; and it was\nheralded that, like another Napoleon, he was lying by and\nframing the plan of his campaign. It was telegraphed to\nWashington City, and published in the Union, that he was\nframing his plan for the purpose of going to Illinois to\npounce upon and annihilate the treasonable and disunion\nspeech which Lincoln had made here on the th of June.\nNow, I do suppose that the Judge really spent some time in\nNew York maturing the plan of the campaign, as his friends\nheralded for him. I have been able, by noting his\n movements since his arrival in Illinois, to discover\nevidences con\ufb01rmatory of that allegation. I think I have\nbeen able to see what are the material points of that plan. I\nwill, for a little while, ask your attention to some of them.\nWhat I shall point out, though not showing the whole plan,\nare, nevertheless, the main points, as I suppose.\nThey are not very numerous. The \ufb01rst is popular\nsovereignty. The second and third are attacks upon my\nspeech made on the th of June. Out of these three points\n\u2014 drawing within the range of popular sovereignty the\nquestion of the Lecompton Constitution \u2014 he makes his\nprincipal assault. Upon these his successive speeches are\nsubstantially one and the same. On this matter of popular\nsovereignty I wish to be a little careful. Auxiliary to these\nmain points, to be sure, are their thunderings of cannon,\ntheir marching and music, their \ufb01zzlegigs and \ufb01reworks;\nbut I will not waste time with them. They are but the little\ntrappings of the campaign.\nComing to the substance, \u2014 the \ufb01rst point, \u201cpopular\nsovereignty.\u201d It is to be labeled upon the cars in which he\ntravels; put upon the hacks he rides in; to be \ufb02aunted upon\nthe arches he passes under, and the banners which wave\nover him. It is to be dished up in as many varieties as a\nFrench cook can produce soups from potatoes. Now, as this\nis so great a staple of the plan of the campaign, it is worth\nwhile to examine it carefully; and if we examine only a very\nlittle, and do not allow ourselves to be misled, we shall be\nable to see that the whole thing is the most arrant\nQuixotism that was ever enacted before a community. What\n is the matter of popular sovereignty? The \ufb01rst thing, in\norder to understand it, is to get a good de\ufb01nition of what it\nis, and after that to see how it is applied.\nI suppose almost every one knows that, in this\ncontroversy, whatever has been said has had reference to\nthe question of negro slavery. We have not been in a\ncontroversy about the right of the people to govern\nthemselves in the ordinary matters of domestic concern in\nthe States and Territories. Mr. Buchanan, in one of his late\nmessages (I think when he sent up the Lecompton\nConstitution) urged that the main point to which the public\nattention had been directed was not in regard to the great\nvariety of small domestic matters, but was directed to the\nquestion of negro slavery; and he asserts that if the people\nhad had a fair chance to vote on that question there was no\nreasonable ground of objection in regard to minor\nquestions. Now, while I think that the people had not had\ngiven, or o\ufb00ered, them a fair chance upon that slavery\nquestion, still, if there had been a fair submission to a vote\nupon that main question, the President\u2019s proposition would\nhave been true to the utmost. Hence, when hereafter I\nspeak of popular sovereignty, I wish to be understood as\napplying what I say to the question of slavery only, not to\nother minor domestic matters of a Territory or a State.\nDoes Judge Douglas, when he says that several of the\npast years of his life have been devoted to the question of\n\u201cpopular sovereignty,\u201d and that all the remainder of his life\nshall be devoted to it, does he mean to say that he has been\ndevoting his life to securing to the people of the Territories\n the right to exclude slavery from the Territories? If he\nmeans so to say he means to deceive; because he and every\none knows that the decision of the Supreme Court, which\nhe approves and makes especial ground of attack upon me\nfor disapproving, forbids the people of a Territory to\nexclude slavery. This covers the whole ground, from the\nsettlement of a Territory till it reaches the degree of\nmaturity entitling it to form a State Constitution. So far as\nall that ground is concerned, the Judge is not sustaining\npopular sovereignty, but absolutely opposing it. He sustains\nthe decision which declares that the popular will of the\nTerritory has no constitutional power to exclude slavery\nduring their territorial existence. This being so, the period\nof time from the \ufb01rst settlement of a Territory till it reaches\nthe point of forming a State Constitution is not the thing\nthat the Judge has fought for or is \ufb01ghting for, but, on the\ncontrary, he has fought for, and is \ufb01ghting for, the thing\nthat annihilates and crushes out that same popular\nsovereignty.\nWell, so much being disposed of, what is left? Why, he is\ncontending for the right of the people, when they come to\nmake a State Constitution, to make it for themselves, and\nprecisely as best suits themselves. I say again, that is\nquixotic. I defy contradiction when I declare that the Judge\ncan \ufb01nd no one to oppose him on that proposition. I repeat,\nthere is nobody opposing that proposition on principle. Let\nme not be misunderstood. I know that, with reference to\nthe Lecompton Constitution, I may be misunderstood; but\nwhen you understand me correctly, my proposition will be\n true and accurate. Nobody is opposing, or has opposed, the\nright of the people, when they form a constitution, to form\nit for themselves. Mr. Buchanan and his friends have not\ndone it; they, too, as well as the Republicans and the Anti-\nLecompton Democrats, have not done it; but on the\ncontrary, they together have insisted on the right of the\npeople to form a constitution for themselves. The di\ufb00erence\nbetween the Buchanan men on the one hand, and the\nDouglas men and the Republicans on the other, has not\nbeen on a question of principle, but on a question of fact.\nThe dispute was upon the question of fact, whether the\nLecompton Constitution had been fairly formed by the\npeople or not. Mr. Buchanan and his friends have not\ncontended for the contrary principle any more than the\nDouglas men or the Republicans. They have insisted that\nwhatever of small irregularities existed in getting up the\nLecompton Constitution were such as happen in the\nsettlement of all new Territories. The question was, Was it a\nfair emanation of the people? It was a question of fact, and\nnot of principle. As to the principle, all were agreed. Judge\nDouglas voted with the Republicans upon that matter of\nfact.\nHe and they, by their voices and votes, denied that it was\na fair emanation of the people. The Administration a\ufb00irmed\nthat it was. With respect to the evidence bearing upon that\nquestion of fact, I readily agree that Judge Douglas and the\nRepublicans had the right on their side, and that the\nAdministration was wrong. But I state again that, as a\nmatter of principle, there is no dispute upon the right of a\n people in a Territory, merging into a State, to form a\nconstitution for themselves without outside interference\nfrom any quarter. This being so, what is Judge Douglas\ngoing to spend his life for? Is he going to spend his life in\nmaintaining a principle that nobody on earth opposes?\nDoes he expect to stand up in majestic dignity, and go\nthrough his apotheosis and become a god in the\nmaintaining of a principle which neither man nor mouse in\nall God\u2019s creation is opposing? Now something in regard to\nthe Lecompton Constitution more specially; for I pass from\nthis other question of popular sovereignty as the most\narrant humbug that has ever been attempted on an\nintelligent community.\nAs to the Lecompton Constitution, I have already said\nthat on the question of fact, as to whether it was a fair\nemanation of the people or not, Judge Douglas, with the\nRepublicans \nand \nsome \nAmericans, \nhad \ngreatly \nthe\nargument against the Administration; and while I repeat\nthis, I wish to know what there is in the opposition of Judge\nDouglas to the Lecompton Constitution that entitles him to\nbe considered the only opponent to it, \u2014 as being par\nexcellence the very quintessence of that opposition. I agree\nto the rightfulness of his opposition. He in the Senate and\nhis class of men there formed the number three and no\nmore. In the House of Representatives his class of men \u2014\nthe Anti-Lecompton Democrats \u2014 formed a number of\nabout twenty. It took one hundred and twenty to defeat the\nmeasure, against one hundred and twelve. Of the votes of\nthat one hundred and twenty, Judge Douglas\u2019s friends\n furnished twenty, to add to which there were six Americans\nand ninety-four Republicans. I do not say that I am\nprecisely accurate in their numbers, but I am su\ufb00iciently so\nfor any use I am making of it.\nWhy is it that twenty shall be entitled to all the credit of\ndoing that work, and the hundred none of it? Why, if, as\nJudge Douglas says, the honor is to be divided and due\ncredit is to be given to other parties, why is just so much\ngiven as is consonant with the wishes, the interests, and\nadvancement of the twenty? My understanding is, when a\ncommon job is done, or a common enterprise prosecuted, if\nI put in \ufb01ve dollars to your one, I have a right to take out\n\ufb01ve dollars to your one. But he does not so understand it.\nHe declares the dividend of credit for defeating Lecompton\nupon \na \nbasis \nwhich \nseems \nunprecedented \nand\nincomprehensible.\nLet us see. Lecompton in the raw was defeated. It\nafterward took a sort of cooked-up shape, and was passed\nin the English bill. It is said by the Judge that the defeat\nwas a good and proper thing. If it was a good thing, why is\nhe entitled to more credit than others for the performance\nof that good act, unless there was something in the\nantecedents of the Republicans that might induce every\none to expect them to join in that good work, and at the\nsame time something leading them to doubt that he would?\nDoes he place his superior claim to credit on the ground\nthat he performed a good act which was never expected of\nhim? He says I have a proneness for quoting Scripture. If I\nshould do so now, it occurs that perhaps he places himself\n somewhat upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep\nwhich went astray upon the mountains, and when the\nowner of the hundred sheep found the one that was lost,\nand threw it upon his shoulders and came home rejoicing,\nit was said that there was more rejoicing over the one\nsheep that was lost and had been found than over the\nninety and nine in the fold. The application is made by the\nSaviour in this parable, thus: \u201cVerily, I say unto you, there\nis more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,\nthan over ninety and nine just persons that need no\nrepentance.\u201d\nAnd now, if the Judge claims the bene\ufb01t of this parable,\nlet him repent. Let him not come up here and say: \u201cI am the\nonly just person; and you are the ninety-nine sinners!\u201d\nRepentance before forgiveness is a provision of the\nChristian system, and on that condition alone will the\nRepublicans grant his forgiveness.\nHow will he prove that we have ever occupied a di\ufb00erent\nposition in regard to the Lecompton Constitution or any\nprinciple in it? He says he did not make his opposition on\nthe ground as to whether it was a free or slave constitution,\nand he would have you understand that the Republicans\nmade their opposition because it ultimately became a slave\nconstitution. To make proof in favor of himself on this point,\nhe reminds us that he opposed Lecompton before the vote\nwas taken declaring whether the State was to be free or\nslave. But he forgets to say that our Republican Senator,\nTrumbull, made a speech against Lecompton even before\nhe did.\n Why did he oppose it? Partly, as he declares, because the\nmembers of the convention who framed it were not fairly\nelected by the people; that the people were not allowed to\nvote unless they had been registered; and that the people\nof whole counties, some instances, were not registered. For\nthese reasons he declares the Constitution was not an\nemanation, in any true sense, from the people. He also has\nan additional objection as to the mode of submitting the\nConstitution back to the people. But bearing on the\nquestion of whether the delegates were fairly elected, a\nspeech of his, made something more than twelve months\nago, from this stand, becomes important. It was made a\nlittle while before the election of the delegates who made\nLecompton. In that speech he declared there was every\nreason to hope and believe the election would be fair; and if\nany one failed to vote, it would be his own culpable fault.\nI, a few days after, made a sort of answer to that speech.\nIn that answer I made, substantially, the very argument\nwith which he combated his Lecompton adversaries in the\nSenate last winter. I pointed to the facts that the people\ncould not vote without being registered, and that the time\nfor registering had gone by. I commented on it as wonderful\nthat Judge Douglas could be ignorant of these facts which\nevery one else in the nation so well knew.\nI now pass from popular sovereignty and Lecompton. I\nmay have occasion to refer to one or both.\nWhen he was preparing his plan of campaign, Napoleon-\nlike, in New York, as appears by two speeches I have heard\nhim deliver since his arrival in Illinois, he gave special\n attention to a speech of mine, delivered here on the th of\nJune last. He says that he carefully read that speech. He\ntold us that at Chicago a week ago last night and he\nrepeated it at Bloomington last night. Doubtless, he\nrepeated it again to-day, though I did not hear him. In the\n\ufb01rst two places \u2014 Chicago and Bloomington I heard him;\nto-day I did not. He said he had carefully examined that\nspeech, \u2014 when, he did not say; but there is no reasonable\ndoubt it was when he was in New York preparing his plan\nof campaign. I am glad he did read it carefully. He says it\nwas evidently prepared with great care. I freely admit it\nwas prepared with care. I claim not to be more free from\nerrors than others, \u2014 perhaps scarcely so much; but I was\nvery careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter\nof fact, or make any inferences, which did not appear to me\nto be true and fully warrantable. If I had made any mistake,\nI was willing to be corrected; if I had drawn any inference\nin regard to Judge Douglas or any one else which was not\nwarranted, I was fully prepared to modify it as soon as\ndiscovered. I planted myself upon the truth and the truth\nonly, so far as I knew it, or could be brought to know it.\nHaving made that speech with the most kindly feelings\ntoward Judge Douglas, as manifested therein, I was\ngrati\ufb01ed when I found that he had carefully examined it,\nand had detected no error of fact, nor any inference against\nhim, nor any misrepresentations of which he thought \ufb01t to\ncomplain. In neither of the two speeches I have mentioned\ndid he make any such complaint. I will thank any one who\nwill inform me that he, in his speech to-day, pointed out\n anything I had stated respecting him as being erroneous. I\npresume there is no such thing. I have reason to be\ngrati\ufb01ed that the care and caution used in that speech left\nit so that he, most of all others interested in discovering\nerror, has not been able to point out one thing against him\nwhich he could say was wrong. He seizes upon the\ndoctrines he supposes to be included in that speech, and\ndeclares that upon them will turn the issues of this\ncampaign. He then quotes, or attempts to quote, from my\nspeech. I will not say that he wilfully misquotes, but he\ndoes fail to quote accurately. His attempt at quoting is from\na passage which I believe I can quote accurately from\nmemory. I shall make the quotation now, with some\ncomments upon it, as I have already said, in order that the\nJudge \nshall \nbe \nleft \nentirely \nwithout \nexcuse \nfor\nmisrepresenting me. I do so now, as I hope, for the last\ntime. I do this in great caution, in order that if he repeats\nhis misrepresentation it shall be plain to all that he does so\nwilfully. If, after all, he still persists, I shall be compelled to\nreconstruct the course I have marked out for myself, and\ndraw upon such humble resources, as I have, for a new\ncourse, better suited to the real exigencies of the case. I set\nout in this campaign with the intention of conducting it\nstrictly as a gentleman, in substance at least, if not in the\noutside polish. The latter I shall never be; but that which\nconstitutes the inside of a gentleman I hope I understand,\nand am not less inclined to practice than others. It was my\npurpose and expectation that this canvass would be\nconducted upon principle, and with fairness on both sides,\n and it shall not be my fault if this purpose and expectation\nshall be given up.\nHe charges, in substance, that I invite a war of sections;\nthat I propose all the local institutions of the di\ufb00erent\nStates shall become consolidated and uniform. What is\nthere in the language of that speech which expresses such\npurpose or bears such construction? I have again and again\nsaid that I would not enter into any of the States to disturb\nthe \ninstitution \nof \nslavery. \nJudge \nDouglas \nsaid, \nat\nBloomington, that I used language most able and ingenious\nfor concealing what I really meant; and that while I had\nprotested against entering into the slave States, I\nnevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the Ohio and\nthrow missiles into Kentucky, to disturb them in their\ndomestic institutions.\nI said in that speech, and I meant no more, that the\ninstitution of slavery ought to be placed in the very attitude\nwhere the framers of this government placed it and left it. I\ndo not understand that the framers of our Constitution left\nthe people of the free States in the attitude of \ufb01ring bombs\nor shells into the slave States. I was not using that passage\nfor the purpose for which he infers I did use it. I said:\n\u201cWe are now far advanced into the \ufb01fth year since a\npolicy was created for the avowed object and with the\ncon\ufb01dent promise of putting an end to slavery agitation.\nUnder the operation of that policy that agitation has not\nonly not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my\nopinion it will not cease till a crisis shall have been reached\nand passed. \u2018A house divided against itself cannot stand.\u2019 I\n believe that this government cannot endure permanently\nhalf slave and half free; it will become all one thing or all\nthe other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the\nfurther spread of it, and place it where the public mind\nshall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate\nextinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall\nbecome alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new,\nNorth as well as South.\u201d\nNow, you all see, from that quotation, I did not express\nmy wish on anything. In that passage I indicated no wish or\npurpose of my own; I simply expressed my expectation.\nCannot the Judge perceive a distinction between a purpose\nand an expectation? I have often expressed an expectation\nto die, but I have never expressed a wish to die. I said at\nChicago, and now repeat, that I am quite aware this\ngovernment has endured, half slave and half free, for\neighty-two years. I understand that little bit of history. I\nexpressed the opinion I did because I perceived \u2014 or\nthought I perceived \u2014 a new set of causes introduced. I did\nsay at Chicago, in my speech there, that I do wish to see\nthe spread of slavery arrested, and to see it placed where\nthe public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the\ncourse of ultimate extinction. I said that because I\nsupposed, when the public mind shall rest in that belief, we\nshall have peace on the slavery question. I have believed \u2014\nand now believe \u2014 the public mind did rest on that belief\nup to the introduction of the Nebraska Bill.\nAlthough I have ever been opposed to slavery, so far I\nrested in the hope and belief that it was in the course of\n ultimate extinction. For that reason it had been a minor\nquestion with me. I might have been mistaken; but I had\nbelieved, and now believe, that the whole public mind, that\nis, the mind of the great majority, had rested in that belief\nup to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. But upon that\nevent I became convinced that either I had been resting in\na delusion, or the institution was being placed on a new\nbasis, a basis for making it perpetual, national, and\nuniversal. Subsequent events have greatly con\ufb01rmed me in\nthat belief. I believe that bill to be the beginning of a\nconspiracy for that purpose. So believing, I have since then\nconsidered that question a paramount one. So believing, I\nthought the public mind will never rest till the power of\nCongress to restrict the spread of it shall again be\nacknowledged and exercised on the one hand or, on the\nother, all resistance be entirely crushed out. I have\nexpressed that opinion, and I entertain it to-night. It is\ndenied that there is any tendency to the nationalization of\nslavery in these States.\nMr. Brooks, of South Carolina, in one of his speeches,\nwhen they were presenting him canes, silver plate, gold\npitchers, and the like, for assaulting Senator Sumner,\ndistinctly a\ufb00irmed his opinion that when this Constitution\nwas formed it was the belief of no man that slavery would\nlast to the present day. He said, what I think, that the\nframers of our Constitution placed the institution of slavery\nwhere the public mind rested in the hope that it was in the\ncourse of ultimate extinction. But he went on to say that\nthe men of the present age, by their experience, have\n become wiser than the framers of the Constitution, and the\ninvention of the cotton gin had made the perpetuity of\nslavery a necessity in this country.\nAs another piece of evidence tending to this same point:\nQuite recently in Virginia, a man \u2014 the owner of slaves \u2014\nmade a will providing that after his death certain of his\nslaves should have their freedom if they should so choose,\nand go to Liberia, rather than remain in slavery. They chose\nto be liberated. But the persons to whom they would\ndescend as property claimed them as slaves. A suit was\ninstituted, which \ufb01nally came to the Supreme Court of\nVirginia, and was therein decided against the slaves upon\nthe ground that a negro cannot make a choice; that they\nhad no legal power to choose, could not perform the\ncondition upon which their freedom depended.\nI do not mention this with any purpose of criticizing it,\nbut to connect it with the arguments as a\ufb00ording additional\nevidence of the change of sentiment upon this question of\nslavery in the direction of making it perpetual and national.\nI argue now as I did before, that there is such a tendency;\nand I am backed, not merely by the facts, but by the open\nconfession in the slave States.\nAnd now as to the Judge\u2019s inference that because I wish\nto see slavery placed in the course of ultimate extinction, \u2014\nplaced where our fathers originally placed it, \u2014 I wish to\nannihilate the State Legislatures, to force cotton to grow\nupon the tops of the Green Mountains, to freeze ice in\nFlorida, to cut lumber on the broad Illinois prairie, \u2014 that I\nam in favor of all these ridiculous and impossible things.\n It seems to me it is a complete answer to all this to ask if,\nwhen Congress did have the fashion of restricting slavery\nfrom free territory; when courts did have the fashion of\ndeciding that taking a slave into a free country made him\nfree, \u2014 I say it is a su\ufb00icient answer to ask if any of this\nridiculous nonsense about consolidation and uniformity did\nactually follow. Who heard of any such thing because of the\nOrdinance of \u2018? because of the Missouri restriction?\nbecause of the numerous court decisions of that character?\nNow, as to the Dred Scott decision; for upon that he\nmakes his last point at me. He boldly takes ground in favor\nof that decision.\nThis is one half the onslaught, and one third of the entire\nplan of the campaign. I am opposed to that decision in a\ncertain sense, but not in the sense which he puts it. I say\nthat in so far as it decided in favor of Dred Scott\u2019s master,\nand against Dred Scott and his family, I do not propose to\ndisturb or resist the decision.\nI never have proposed to do any such thing. I think that\nin respect for judicial authority my humble history would\nnot su\ufb00er in comparison with that of Judge Douglas. He\nwould have the citizen conform his vote to that decision;\nthe member of Congress, his; the President, his use of the\nveto power. He would make it a rule of political action for\nthe people and all the departments of the government. I\nwould not. By resisting it as a political rule, I disturb no\nright of property, create no disorder, excite no mobs.\nWhen he spoke at Chicago, on Friday evening of last\nweek, he made this same point upon me. On Saturday\n evening I replied, and reminded him of a Supreme Court\ndecision which he opposed for at least several years. Last\nnight, at Bloomington, he took some notice of that reply,\nbut entirely forgot to remember that part of it.\nHe renews his onslaught upon me, forgetting to\nremember that I have turned the tables against himself on\nthat very point. I renew the e\ufb00ort to draw his attention to\nit. I wish to stand erect before the country, as well as Judge\nDouglas, on this question of judicial authority; and\ntherefore I add something to the authority in favor of my\nown position. I wish to show that I am sustained by\nauthority, in addition to that heretofore presented. I do not\nexpect to convince the Judge. It is part of the plan of his\ncampaign, and he will cling to it with a desperate grip.\nEven turn it upon him, \u2014 the sharp point against him, and\nga\ufb00 him through, \u2014 he will still cling to it till he can invent\nsome new dodge to take the place of it.\nIn public speaking it is tedious reading from documents;\nbut I must beg to indulge the practice to a limited extent. I\nshall read from a letter written by Mr. Je\ufb00erson in ,\nand now to be found in the seventh volume of his\ncorrespondence, at page . It seems he had been\npresented by a gentleman of the name of Jarvis with a\nbook, or essay, or periodical, called the Republican, and he\nwas writing in acknowledgment of the present, and noting\nsome of its contents. After expressing the hope that the\nwork will produce a favorable e\ufb00ect upon the minds of the\nyoung, he proceeds to say:\n \u201cThat it will have this tendency may be expected, and for\nthat reason I feel an urgency to note what I deem an error\nin it, the more requiring notice as your opinion is\nstrengthened by that of many others. You seem, in pages \nand , to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of\nall constitutional questions, \u2014 a very dangerous doctrine\nindeed, and one which would place us under the despotism\nof an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men, and\nnot more so. They have, with others, the same passions for\nparty, for power, and the privilege of their corps. Their\nmaxim is, \u2018Boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem\u2019; and\ntheir power is the more dangerous as they are in o\ufb00ice for\nlife, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to\nthe elective control. The Constitution has erected no such\nsingle tribunal, knowing that, to whatever hands con\ufb01ded,\nwith the corruptions of time and party, its members would\nbecome despots. It has more wisely made all the\ndepartments co-equal and co-sovereign with themselves.\u201d\nThus we see the power claimed for the Supreme Court by\nJudge Douglas, Mr. Je\ufb00erson holds, would reduce us to the\ndespotism of an oligarchy.\nNow, I have said no more than this, \u2014 in fact, never quite\nso much as this; at least I am sustained by Mr. Je\ufb00erson.\nLet us go a little further. You remember we once had a\nNational Bank. Some one owed the bank a debt; he was\nsued, and sought to avoid payment on the ground that the\nbank was unconstitutional. The case went to the Supreme\nCourt, and therein it was decided that the bank was\nconstitutional. The whole Democratic party revolted against\n that decision. General Jackson himself asserted that he, as\nPresident, would not be bound to hold a National Bank to\nbe constitutional, even though the court had decided it to\nbe so. He fell in precisely with the view of Mr. Je\ufb00erson,\nand acted upon it under his o\ufb00icial oath, in vetoing a\ncharter for a National Bank. The declaration that Congress\ndoes not possess this constitutional power to charter a\nbank has gone into the Democratic platform, at their\nNational Conventions, and was brought forward and\nrea\ufb00irmed in their last Convention at Cincinnati. They have\ncontended for that declaration, in the very teeth of the\nSupreme Court, for more than a quarter of a century. In\nfact, they have reduced the decision to an absolute nullity.\nThat decision, I repeat, is repudiated in the Cincinnati\nplatform; and still, as if to show that e\ufb00rontery can go no\nfurther, Judge Douglas vaunts in the very speeches in which\nhe denounces me for opposing the Dred Scott decision that\nhe stands on the Cincinnati platform.\nNow, I wish to know what the Judge can charge upon me,\nwith respect to decisions of the Supreme Court, which does\nnot lie in all its length, breadth, and proportions at his own\ndoor. The plain truth is simply this: Judge Douglas is for\nSupreme Court decisions when he likes and against them\nwhen he does not like them. He is for the Dred Scott\ndecision because it tends to nationalize slavery; because it\nis part of the original combination for that object. It so\nhappens, singularly enough, that I never stood opposed to a\ndecision of the Supreme Court till this, on the contrary, I\nhave no recollection that he was ever particularly in favor\n of one till this. He never was in favor of any nor opposed to\nany, till the present one, which helps to nationalize slavery.\nFree men of Sangamon, free men of Illinois, free men\neverywhere, judge ye between him and me upon this issue.\nHe says this Dred Scott case is a very small matter at\nmost, \u2014 that it has no practical e\ufb00ect; that at best, or\nrather, I suppose, at worst, it is but an abstraction. I submit\nthat the proposition that the thing which determines\nwhether a man is free or a slave is rather concrete than\nabstract. I think you would conclude that it was, if your\nliberty depended upon it, and so would Judge Douglas, if\nhis liberty depended upon it. But suppose it was on the\nquestion of spreading slavery over the new Territories that\nhe considers it as being merely an abstract matter, and one\nof no practical importance. How has the planting of slavery\nin new countries always been e\ufb00ected? It has now been\ndecided that slavery cannot be kept out of our new\nTerritories by any legal means. In what do our new\nTerritories now di\ufb00er in this respect from the old Colonies\nwhen slavery was \ufb01rst planted within them? It was planted,\nas Mr. Clay once declared, and as history proves true, by\nindividual men, in spite of the wishes of the people; the\nMother Government refusing to prohibit it, and withholding\nfrom the people of the Colonies the authority to prohibit it\nfor themselves. Mr. Clay says this was one of the great and\njust causes of complaint against Great Britain by the\nColonies, and the best apology we can now make for having\nthe institution amongst us. In that precise condition our\nNebraska politicians have at last succeeded in placing our\n own new Territories; the government will not prohibit\nslavery within them, nor allow the people to prohibit it.\nI defy any man to \ufb01nd any di\ufb00erence between the policy\nwhich originally planted slavery in these Colonies and that\npolicy which now prevails in our new Territories. If it does\nnot go into them, it is only because no individual wishes it\nto go. The Judge indulged himself doubtless to-day with the\nquestion as to what I am going to do with or about the Dred\nScott decision. Well, Judge, will you please tell me what you\ndid about the bank decision? Will you not graciously allow\nus to do with the Dred Scott decision precisely as you did\nwith the bank decision? You succeeded in breaking down\nthe moral e\ufb00ect of that decision: did you \ufb01nd it necessary\nto amend the Constitution, or to set up a court of negroes\nin order to do it?\nThere is one other point. Judge Douglas has a very\na\ufb00ectionate leaning toward the Americans and Old Whigs.\nLast evening, in a sort of weeping tone, he described to us\na death-bed scene. He had been called to the side of Mr.\nClay, in his last moments, in order that the genius of\n\u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d might duly descend from the dying\nman and settle upon him, the living and most worthy\nsuccessor. He could do no less than promise that he would\ndevote the remainder of his life to \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d;\nand then the great statesman departs in peace. By this part\nof the \u201cplan of the campaign\u201d the Judge has evidently\npromised himself that tears shall be drawn down the\ncheeks of all Old Whigs, as large as half-grown apples.\n Mr. Webster, too, was mentioned; but it did not quite\ncome to a death-bed scene as to him. It would be amusing,\nif it were not disgusting, to see how quick these\ncompromise-breakers administer on the political e\ufb00ects of\ntheir dead adversaries, trumping up claims never before\nheard of, and dividing the assets among themselves. If I\nshould be found dead to-morrow morning, nothing but my\ninsigni\ufb01cance could prevent a speech being made on my\nauthority, before the end of next week. It so happens that in\nthat \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d with which Mr. Clay was\nidenti\ufb01ed, \nthe \nMissouri \nCompromise \nwas \nexpressly\nreversed; and it was a little singular if Mr. Clay cast his\nmantle upon Judge Douglas on purpose to have that\ncompromise repealed.\nAgain, the Judge did not keep faith with Mr. Clay when\nhe \ufb01rst brought in his Nebraska Bill. He left the Missouri\nCompromise unrepealed, and in his report accompanying\nthe bill he told the world he did it on purpose. The manes of\nMr. Clay must have been in great agony till thirty days\nlater, when \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d stood forth in all its glory.\nOne more thing. Last night Judge Douglas tormented\nhimself with horrors about my disposition to make negroes\nperfectly equal with white men in social and political\nrelations. He did not stop to show that I have said any such\nthing, or that it legitimately follows from anything I have\nsaid, but he rushes on with his assertions. I adhere to the\nDeclaration of Independence. If Judge Douglas and his\nfriends are not willing to stand by it, let them come up and\namend it. Let them make it read that all men are created\n equal except negroes. Let us have it decided whether the\nDeclaration of Independence, in this blessed year of ,\nshall be thus amended. In his construction of the\nDeclaration last year, he said it only meant that Americans\nin America were equal to Englishmen in England. Then,\nwhen I pointed out to him that by that rule he excludes the\nGermans, the Irish, the Portuguese, and all the other\npeople who have come among us since the revolution, he\nreconstructs his construction. In his last speech he tells us\nit meant Europeans.\nI press him a little further, and ask if it meant to include\nthe Russians in Asia; or does he mean to exclude that vast\npopulation from the principles of our Declaration of\nIndependence? I expect ere long he will introduce another\namendment to his de\ufb01nition. He is not at all particular. He\nis satis\ufb01ed with anything which does not endanger the\nnationalizing of negro slavery. It may draw white men\ndown, but it must not lift negroes up.\nWho shall say, \u201cI am the superior, and you are the\ninferior\u201d?\nMy declarations upon this subject of negro slavery may\nbe misrepresented, but cannot be misunderstood. I have\nsaid that I do not understand the Declaration to mean that\nall men were created equal in all respects. They are not our\nequal in color; but I suppose that it does mean to declare\nthat all men are equal in some respects; they are equal in\ntheir right to \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\nCertainly the negro is not our equal in color, perhaps not in\nmany other respects; still, in the right to put into his mouth\n the bread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal\nof every other man, white or black. In pointing out that\nmore has been given you, you cannot be justi\ufb01ed in taking\naway the little which has been given him. All I ask for the\nnegro is that if you do not like him, let him alone. If God\ngave him but little, that little let him enjoy.\nWhen our government was established we had the\ninstitution of slavery among us. We were in a certain sense\ncompelled to tolerate its existence. It was a sort of\nnecessity. We had gone through our struggle and secured\nour own independence. The framers of the Constitution\nfound the institution of slavery amongst their own\ninstitutions at the time. They found that by an e\ufb00ort to\neradicate it they might lose much of what they had already\ngained. They were obliged to bow to the necessity. They\ngave power to Congress to abolish the slave trade at the\nend of twenty years. They also prohibited it in the\nTerritories where it did not exist. They did what they could,\nand yielded to the necessity for the rest. I also yield to all\nwhich follows from that necessity. What I would most desire\nwould be the separation of the white and black races.\nOne more point on this Spring\ufb01eld speech which Judge\nDouglas says he has read so carefully. I expressed my belief\nin the existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and\nnationalize slavery. I did not profess to know it, nor do I\nnow. I showed the part Judge Douglas had played in the\nstring of facts constituting to my mind the proof of that\nconspiracy. I showed the parts played by others.\n I charged that the people had been deceived into\ncarrying the last Presidential election, by the impression\nthat the people of the Territories might exclude slavery if\nthey chose, when it was known in advance by the\nconspirators that the court was to decide that neither\nCongress nor the people could so exclude slavery. These\ncharges are more distinctly made than anything else in the\nspeech.\nJudge Douglas has carefully read and reread that speech.\nHe has not, so far as I know, contradicted those charges. In\nthe two speeches which I heard he certainly did not. On\nthis own tacit admission, I renew that charge. I charge him\nwith having been a party to that conspiracy and to that\ndeception for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery.\n   \n     \n \n      \n  \n  I\n \n \n A\n A\n[THE FOLLOWING IS the correspondence between the two\nrival candidates for the United States Senate]\n     \n   \n     \n  A  AI \nA   A \nTO R. P. MORGAN\nSPRINGFIELD, FEBRUARY , .\nR. P. MORGAN, ESQ.: Says Tom to John, \u201cHere\u2019s your old\nrotten wheelbarrow. I\u2019ve broke it usin\u2019 on it.

LINCOLN.\n(A \u2018chalked hat\u2019 was the common term, at that time, for a\nrailroad pass.)\n      H \n  I    \n    \n    H   I  \n   \n  I A\n   A    \n  \n I\nOF ILLINOIS, HELD AT BLOOMINGTON, ON MAY ,\n.\n[FROM THE REPORT by William C. Whitney.]\n(Mr. Whitney\u2019s notes were made at the time, but not\nwritten out until . He does not claim that the speech,\nas here reported, is literally correct only that he has\nfollowed the argument, and that in many cases the\nsentences are as Mr. Lincoln spoke them.)\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN: I was over at [Cries\nof \u201cPlatform!\u201d \u201cTake the platform!\u201d] \u2014 I say, that while I\nwas at Danville Court, some of our friends of Anti-Nebraska\ngot together in Spring\ufb01eld and elected me as one delegate\nto represent old Sangamon with them in this convention,\nand I am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement\nand by virtue of that meeting and selection. But we can\nhardly be called delegates strictly, inasmuch as, properly\nspeaking, we represent nobody but ourselves. I think it\naltogether fair to say that we have no Anti-Nebraska party\nin Sangamon, although there is a good deal of Anti-\nNebraska feeling there; but I say for myself, and I think I\nmay speak also for my colleagues, that we who are here\nfully approve of the platform and of all that has been done\n [A voice, \u201cYes!\u201d], and even if we are not regularly\ndelegates, it will be right for me to answer your call to\nspeak. I suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of\nSangamon on the great question of the repeal, although we\ndo not yet represent many numbers who have taken a\ndistinct position on the question.\nWe are in a trying time \u2014 it ranges above mere party \u2014\nand this movement to call a halt and turn our steps\nbackward needs all the help and good counsels it can get;\nfor unless popular opinion makes itself very strongly felt,\nand a change is made in our present course, blood will \ufb02ow\non account of Nebraska, and brother\u2019s hands will be raised\nagainst brother!\n[The last sentence was uttered in such an earnest,\nimpressive, if not, indeed, tragic, manner, as to make a cold\nchill creep over me. Others gave a similar experience.]\nI have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal\nmade to Illinois men by the gentleman from Lawrence\n[James S. Emery] who has just addressed us so eloquently\nand forcibly. I was deeply moved by his statement of the\nwrongs done to free-State men out there. I think it just to\nsay that all true men North should sympathize with them,\nand ought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing\nto right their wrongs. But we must not promise what we\nought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot;\nwe must be calm and moderate, and consider the whole\ndi\ufb00iculty, and determine what is possible and just. We must\nnot be led by excitement and passion to do that which our\nsober judgments would not approve in our cooler moments.\n We have higher aims; we will have more serious business\nthan to dally with temporary measures.\nWe are here to stand \ufb01rmly for a principle \u2014 to stand\n\ufb01rmly for a right. We know that great political and moral\nwrongs are done, and outrages committed, and we\ndenounce those wrongs and outrages, although we cannot,\nat present, do much more. But we desire to reach out\nbeyond those personal outrages and establish a rule that\nwill apply to all, and so prevent any future outrages.\nWe have seen to-day that every shade of popular opinion\nis represented here, with Freedom, or rather Free Soil, as\nthe basis. We have come together as in some sort\nrepresentatives of popular opinion against the extension of\nslavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law, and\nthe pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are\nnow no more. We come \u2014 we are here assembled together\n\u2014 to protest as well as we can against a great wrong, and\nto take measures, as well as we now can, to make that\nwrong right; to place the nation, as far as it may be\npossible now, as it was before the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise; and the plain way to do this is to restore the\nCompromise, and to demand and determine that Kansas\nshall be free! [Immense applause.] While we a\ufb00irm, and\nrea\ufb00irm, if necessary, our devotion to the principles of the\nDeclaration of Independence, let our practical work here be\nlimited to the above. We know that there is not a perfect\nagreement of sentiment here on the public questions which\nmight be rightfully considered in this convention, and that\nthe indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped;\n but all of us must give up something for the good of the\ncause. There is one desire which is uppermost in the mind,\none wish common to us all, to which no dissent will be\nmade; and I counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment,\nto sink all personal feeling, make all things work to a\ncommon purpose in which we are united and agreed about,\nand which all present will agree is absolutely necessary \u2014\nwhich must be done by any rightful mode if there be such:\nSlavery must be kept out of Kansas! [Applause.] The test \u2014\nthe pinch \u2014 is right there. If we lose Kansas to freedom, an\nexample will be set which will prove fatal to freedom in the\nend. We, therefore, in the language of the Bible, must \u201clay\nthe axe to the root of the tree.\u201d Temporizing will not do\nlonger; now is the time for decision \u2014 for \ufb01rm, persistent,\nresolute action. [Applause.]\nThe Nebraska Bill, or rather Nebraska law, is not one of\nwholesome legislation, but was and is an act of legislative\nusurpation, whose result, if not indeed intention, is to make\nslavery national; and unless headed o\ufb00 in some e\ufb00ective\nway, we are in a fair way to see this land of boasted\nfreedom converted into a land of slavery in fact.\n[Sensation.] Just open your two eyes, and see if this be not\nso. I need do no more than state, to command universal\napproval, that almost the entire North, as well as a large\nfollowing in the border States, is radically opposed to the\nplanting of slavery in free territory. Probably in a popular\nvote throughout the nation nine tenths of the voters in the\nfree States, and at least one-half in the border States, if\nthey could express their sentiments freely, would vote NO\n on such an issue; and it is safe to say that two thirds of the\nvotes of the entire nation would be opposed to it. And yet,\nin spite of this overbalancing of sentiment in this free\ncountry, we are in a fair way to see Kansas present itself for\nadmission as a slave State. Indeed, it is a felony, by the\nlocal law of Kansas, to deny that slavery exists there even\nnow. By every principle of law, a negro in Kansas is free; yet\nthe bogus Legislature makes it an infamous crime to tell\nhim that he is free!\nStatutes of Kansas, , chapter , Sec. : If any\nfree person, by speaking or by writing, assert or maintain\nthat persons have not the right to hold slaves in this\nTerritory, or shall introduce into this Territory, print,\npublish, write, circulate . . . any book, paper, magazine,\npamphlet, or circular containing any denial of the right of\npersons to hold slaves in this Territory such person shall be\ndeemed guilty of felony, and punished by imprisonment at\nhard labor for a term of not less than two years. Sec. .\nNo person who is conscientiously opposed to holding\nslaves, or who does not admit the right to hold slaves in\nthis Territory, shall sit as a juror on the trial of any\nprosecution for any violation of any Sections of this Act.\nThe party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe\njustice and liberty; for it is a singular fact, but none the less\na fact, and well known by the most common experience,\nthat men will do things under the terror of the party lash\nthat they would not on any account or for any consideration\ndo otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of\na loaded cannon without shrinking will run from the\n terrible name of \u201cAbolitionist,\u201d even when pronounced by a\nworthless creature whom they, with good reason, despise.\nFor instance \u2014 to press this point a little \u2014 Judge Douglas\nintroduced his Nebraska Bill in January; and we had an\nextra session of our Legislature in the succeeding February,\nin which were seventy-\ufb01ve Democrats; and at a party\ncaucus, fully attended, there were just three votes, out of\nthe whole seventy-\ufb01ve, for the measure. But in a few days\norders came on from Washington, commanding them to\napprove the measure; the party lash was applied, and it\nwas brought up again in caucus, and passed by a large\nmajority. The masses were against it, but party necessity\ncarried it; and it was passed through the lower house of\nCongress against the will of the people, for the same\nreason. Here is where the greatest danger lies that, while\nwe profess to be a government of law and reason, law will\ngive way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing\npower. Like the great Juggernaut \u2014 I think that is the name\n\u2014 the great idol, it crushes everything that comes in its\nway, and makes a [?] \u2014 or, as I read once, in a blackletter\nlaw book, \u201ca slave is a human being who is legally not a\nperson but a thing.\u201d And if the safeguards to liberty are\nbroken down, as is now attempted, when they have made\nthings of all the free negroes, how long, think you, before\nthey will begin to make things of poor white men?\n[Applause.] Be not deceived. Revolutions do not go\nbackward. The founder of the Democratic party declared\nthat all men were created equal. His successor in the\nleadership has written the word \u201cwhite\u201d before men,\n making it read \u201call white men are created equal.\u201d Pray, will\nor may not the Know-Nothings, if they should get in power,\nadd the word \u201cProtestant,\u201d making it read \u201call Protestant\nwhite men...?\u201d\nMeanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of\nreprisals in other quarters. John Pettit, whom Tom Benton\npaid his respects to, you will recollect, calls the immortal\nDeclaration \u201ca self-evident lie\u201d; while at the birthplace of\nfreedom \u2014 in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of the \u201ccradle\nof liberty,\u201d at the home of the Adamses and Warren and\nOtis \u2014 Choate, from our side of the house, dares to fritter\naway the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the\nDeclaration to be \u201ca string of glittering generalities\u201d; and\nthe Southern Whigs, working hand in hand with proslavery\nDemocrats, are making Choate\u2019s theories practical. Thomas\nJe\ufb00erson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element in\nslavery, solemnly declared that he trembled for his country\nwhen he remembered that God is just; while Judge Douglas,\nwith an insigni\ufb01cant wave of the hand, \u201cdon\u2019t care whether\nslavery is voted up or voted down.\u201d Now, if slavery is right,\nor even negative, he has a right to treat it in this tri\ufb02ing\nmanner. But if it is a moral and political wrong, as all\nChristendom considers it to be, how can he answer to God\nfor this attempt to spread and fortify it? [Applause.]\nBut no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other,\ncan maintain a negative, or merely neutral, position on this\nquestion; and, accordingly, he avows that the Union was\nmade by white men and for white men and their\ndescendants. As matter of fact, the \ufb01rst branch of the\n proposition is historically true; the government was made\nby white men, and they were and are the superior race.\nThis I admit. But the corner-stone of the government, so to\nspeak, was the declaration that \u201call men are created\nequal,\u201d and all entitled to \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness.\u201d [Applause.]\nAnd not only so, but the framers of the Constitution were\nparticular to keep out of that instrument the word \u201cslave,\u201d\nthe reason being that slavery would ultimately come to an\nend, and they did not wish to have any reminder that in this\nfree country human beings were ever prostituted to slavery.\n[Applause.] Nor is it any argument that we are superior and\nthe negro inferior \u2014 that he has but one talent while we\nhave ten. Let the negro possess the little he has in\nindependence; if he has but one talent, he should be\npermitted to keep the little he has. [Applause:] But slavery\nwill endure no test of reason or logic; and yet its advocates,\nlike Douglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy\nassumption it might better be termed, like the above, in\norder to prepare the mind for the gradual, but none the\nless certain, encroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon\nthe fair domain of freedom. But however much you may\nargue upon it, or smother it in soft phrase, slavery can only\nbe maintained by force \u2014 by violence. The repeal of the\nMissouri Compromise was by violence. It was a violation of\nboth law and the sacred obligations of honor, to overthrow\nand trample under foot a solemn compromise, obtained by\nthe fearful loss to freedom of one of the fairest of our\nWestern \ndomains. \nCongress \nviolated \nthe \nwill \nand\n con\ufb01dence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and\nwhile public sentiment, as shown by the elections of ,\ndemanded the restoration of this compromise, Congress\nviolated its trust by refusing simply because it had the\nforce of numbers to hold on to it. And murderous violence\nis being used now, in order to force slavery on to Kansas;\nfor it cannot be done in any other way. [Sensation.]\nThe necessary result was to establish the rule of violence\n\u2014 force, instead of the rule of law and reason; to\nperpetuate and spread slavery, and in time to make it\ngeneral. We see it at both ends of the line. In Washington,\non the very spot where the outrage was started, the\nfearless Sumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly\ndying; while senators who claim to be gentlemen and\nChristians stood by, countenancing the act, and even\napplauding it afterward in their places in the Senate. Even\nDouglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping\ndistance, yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed. Then,\nat the other end of the line, at the very time Sumner was\nbeing murdered, Lawrence was being destroyed for the\ncrime of freedom. It was the most prominent stronghold of\nliberty in Kansas, and must give way to the all-dominating\npower of slavery. Only two days ago, Judge Trumbull found\nit necessary to propose a bill in the Senate to prevent a\ngeneral civil war and to restore peace in Kansas.\nWe live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the\nfuture; we expect some new disaster with each newspaper\nwe read. Are we in a healthful political state? Are not the\n tendencies plain? Do not the signs of the times point plainly\nthe way in which we are going? [Sensation.]\nIn the early days of the Constitution slavery was\nrecognized, by South and North alike, as an evil, and the\ndivision of sentiment about it was not controlled by\ngeographical lines or considerations of climate, but by\nmoral and philanthropic views. Petitions for the abolition of\nslavery were presented to the very \ufb01rst Congress by\nVirginia and Massachusetts alike. To show the harmony\nwhich prevailed, I will state that a fugitive slave law was\npassed in , with no dissenting voice in the Senate, and\nbut seven dissenting votes in the House. It was, however, a\nwise law, moderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one.\nTwenty-\ufb01ve years later, a more stringent law was proposed\nand defeated; and thirty-\ufb01ve years after that, the present\nlaw, drafted by Mason of Virginia, was passed by Northern\nvotes. I am not, just now, complaining of this law, but I am\ntrying to show how the current sets; for the proposed law\nof  was far less o\ufb00ensive than the present one. In \nthe \nContinental \nCongress \npledged \nitself, \nwithout \na\ndissenting vote, to wholly discontinue the slave trade, and\nto neither purchase nor import any slave; and less than\nthree months before the passage of the Declaration of\nIndependence, the same Congress which adopted that\ndeclaration unanimously resolved \u201cthat no slave be\nimported into any of the thirteen United Colonies.\u201d [Great\napplause.]\nOn the second day of July, , the draft of a\nDeclaration of Independence was reported to Congress by\n the committee, and in it the slave trade was characterized\nas \u201can execrable commerce,\u201d as \u201ca piratical warfare,\u201d as\nthe \u201copprobrium of in\ufb01del powers,\u201d and as \u201ca cruel war\nagainst human nature.\u201d [Applause.] All agreed on this\nexcept South Carolina and Georgia, and in order to\npreserve harmony, and from the necessity of the case, these\nexpressions were omitted. Indeed, abolition societies\nexisted as far south as Virginia; and it is a well-known fact\nthat Washington, Je\ufb00erson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason,\nand Pendleton were quali\ufb01ed abolitionists, and much more\nradical on that subject than we of the Whig and Democratic\nparties claim to be to-day. On March , , Virginia\nceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of\nthe Ohio River. Je\ufb00erson, Chase of Maryland, and Howell of\nRhode Island, as a committee on that and territory\nthereafter to be ceded, reported that no slavery should\nexist after the year . Had this report been adopted, not\nonly the Northwest, but Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and\nMississippi also would have been free; but it required the\nassent of nine States to ratify it. North Carolina was\ndivided, and thus its vote was lost; and Delaware, Georgia,\nand New Jersey refused to vote. In point of fact, as it was, it\nwas assented to by six States. Three years later on a square\nvote to exclude slavery from the Northwest, only one vote,\nand that from New York, was against it. And yet, thirty-\nseven years later, \ufb01ve thousand citizens of Illinois, out of a\nvoting mass of less than twelve thousand, deliberately, after\na long and heated contest, voted to introduce slavery in\nIllinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of Illinois\n are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the\nfair domain of Kansas, notwithstanding it received the\ndowry of freedom long before its birth as a political\ncommunity. I repeat, therefore, the question: Is it not plain\nin what direction we are tending? [Sensation.] In the\ncolonial time, Mason, Pendleton, and Je\ufb00erson were as\nhostile to slavery in Virginia as Otis, Ames, and the\nAdamses were in Massachusetts; and Virginia made as\nearnest an e\ufb00ort to get rid of it as old Massachusetts did.\nBut circumstances were against them and they failed; but\nnot that the good will of its leading men was lacking. Yet\nwithin less than \ufb01fty years Virginia changed its tune, and\nmade negro-breeding for the cotton and sugar States one of\nits leading industries. [Laughter and applause.]\nIn the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of\nVirginia made a more violent abolition speech than my\nfriends Lovejoy or Codding would desire to make here to-\nday \u2014 a speech which could not be safely repeated\nanywhere on Southern soil in this enlightened year. But,\nwhile there were some di\ufb00erences of opinion on this\nsubject even then, discussion was allowed; but as you see\nby the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is the\nMissouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a\nfelony to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in\nthe \nland \nof \nWashington \nand \nthe \nDeclaration \nof\nIndependence. [Sensation.]\nIn Kentucky \u2014 my State \u2014 in , on a test vote, the\nmighty in\ufb02uence of Henry Clay and many other good then\nthere could not get a symptom of expression in favor of\n gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching toward\nthe light of civilization with Ohio and Illinois; but the State\nof Boone and Hardin and Henry Clay, with a nigger under\neach arm, took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of\nbarbarism. Is there \u2014 can there be \u2014 any doubt about this\nthing? And is there any doubt that we must all lay aside our\nprejudices and march, shoulder to shoulder, in the great\narmy of Freedom? [Applause.]\nEvery Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this\nto be \u201cthe land of the free and the home of the brave!\u201d Well,\nnow, when you orators get that o\ufb00 next year, and, may be,\nthis very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer\nto get up in the grove and deny it? [Laughter.] How would\nyou like that? But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave\nState, and all the \u201cborder ru\ufb00ians\u201d have barbecues about it,\nand free-State men come trailing back to the dishonored\nNorth, like whipped dogs with their tails between their\nlegs, it is \u2014 ain\u2019t it? \u2014 evident that this is no more the\n\u201cland of the free\u201d; and if we let it go so, we won\u2019t dare to\nsay \u201chome of the brave\u201d out loud. [Sensation and\nconfusion.]\nCan any man doubt that, even in spite of the people\u2019s\nwill, slavery will triumph through violence, unless that will\nbe made manifest and enforced? Even Governor Reeder\nclaimed at the outset that the contest in Kansas was to be\nfair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe that, as a\nresult of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon\napply for admission as a slave State. And yet we can\u2019t\nmistake that the people don\u2019t want it so, and that it is a\n land which is free both by natural and political law. No law,\nis free law! Such is the understanding of all Christendom.\nIn the Somerset case, decided nearly a century ago, the\ngreat Lord Mans\ufb01eld held that slavery was of such a nature\nthat it must take its rise in positive (as distinguished from\nnatural) law; and that in no country or age could it be\ntraced back to any other source. Will some one please tell\nme where is the positive law that establishes slavery in\nKansas? [A voice: \u201cThe bogus laws.\u201d] Aye, the bogus laws!\nAnd, on the same principle, a gang of Missouri horse-\nthieves could come into Illinois and declare horse-stealing\nto be legal [Laughter], and it would be just as legal as\nslavery is in Kansas. But by express statute, in the land of\nWashington and Je\ufb00erson, we may soon be brought face to\nface with the discreditable fact of showing to the world by\nour acts that we prefer slavery to freedom \u2014 darkness to\nlight! [Sensation.]\nIt is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a\ncontract violates it so grossly as to chie\ufb02y destroy the\nobject for which it is made, the other party may rescind it. I\nwill ask Browning if that ain\u2019t good law. [Voices: \u201cYes!\u201d]\nWell, now if that be right, I go for rescinding the whole,\nentire Missouri Compromise and thus turning Missouri into\na free State; and I should like to know the di\ufb00erence \u2014\nshould like for any one to point out the di\ufb00erence \u2014\nbetween our making a free State of Missouri and their\nmaking a slave State of Kansas. [Great applause.] There\nain\u2019t one bit of di\ufb00erence, except that our way would be a\ngreat mercy to humanity. But I have never said, and the\n Whig party has never said, and those who oppose the\nNebraska Bill do not as a body say, that they have any\nintention of interfering with slavery in the slave States. Our\nplatform says just the contrary. We allow slavery to exist in\nthe slave States, not because slavery is right or good, but\nfrom the necessities of our Union. We grant a fugitive slave\nlaw because it is so \u201cnominated in the bond\u201d; because our\nfathers so stipulated \u2014 had to \u2014 and we are bound to carry\nout this agreement. But they did not agree to introduce\nslavery in regions where it did not previously exist. On the\ncontrary, they said by their example and teachings that\nthey did not deem it expedient \u2014 did n\u2019t consider it right \u2014\nto do so; and it is wise and right to do just as they did about\nit. [Voices: \u201cGood!\u201d] And that it what we propose \u2014 not to\ninterfere with slavery where it exists (we have never tried\nto do it), and to give them a reasonable and e\ufb00icient\nfugitive slave law. [A voice: \u201cNo!\u201d] I say YES! [Applause.] It\nwas part of the bargain, and I \u2018m for living up to it; but I go\nno further; I\u2019m not bound to do more, and I won\u2019t agree any\nfurther. [Great applause.]\nWe, here in Illinois, should feel especially proud of the\nprovision of the Missouri Compromise excluding slavery\nfrom what is now Kansas; for an Illinois man, Jesse B.\nThomas, was its father. Henry Clay, who is credited with the\nauthorship of the Compromise in general terms, did not\neven vote for that provision, but only advocated the\nultimate admission by a second compromise; and Thomas\nwas, beyond all controversy, the real author of the \u201cslavery\nrestriction\u201d branch of the Compromise. To show the\n generosity of the Northern members toward the Southern\nside: on a test vote to exclude slavery from Missouri, ninety\nvoted not to exclude, and eighty-seven to exclude, every\nvote from the slave States being ranged with the former\nand fourteen votes from the free States, of whom seven\nwere from New England alone; while on a vote to exclude\nslavery from what is now Kansas, the vote was one hundred\nand thirty-four for, to forty-two against. The scheme, as a\nwhole, was, of course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to\ncontend \notherwise, \nas \nis \nnow \nbeing \ndone \nby \nthe\nNebraskites; it was so shown by the votes and quite as\nemphatically by the expressions of representative men. Mr.\nLowndes of South Carolina was never known to commit a\npolitical mistake; his was the great judgment of that\nsection; and he declared that this measure \u201cwould restore\ntranquillity to the country \u2014 a result demanded by every\nconsideration of discretion, of moderation, of wisdom, and\nof virtue.\u201d When the measure came before President\nMonroe for his approval, he put to each member of his\ncabinet this question: \u201cHas Congress the constitutional\npower to prohibit slavery in a Territory?\u201d And John C.\nCalhoun and William H. Crawford from the South, equally\nwith John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Rush, and Smith\nThompson from the North, alike answered, \u201cYes!\u201d without\nquali\ufb01cation or equivocation; and this measure, of so great\nconsequence to the South, was passed; and Missouri was,\nby means of it, \ufb01nally enabled to knock at the door of the\nRepublic for an open passage to its brood of slaves. And, in\nspite of this, Freedom\u2019s share is about to be taken by\n violence \u2014 by the force of misrepresentative votes, not\ncalled for by the popular will. What name can I, in common\ndecency, give to this wicked transaction? [Sensation.]\nBut even then the contest was not over; for when the\nMissouri constitution came before Congress for its\napproval, it forbade any free negro or mulatto from\nentering the State. In short, our Illinois \u201cblack laws\u201d were\nhidden away in their constitution [Laughter], and the\ncontroversy was thus revived. Then it was that Mr. Clay\u2019s\ntalents shone out conspicuously, and the controversy that\nshook the union to its foundation was \ufb01nally settled to the\nsatisfaction of the conservative parties on both sides of the\nline, though not to the extremists on either, and Missouri\nwas admitted by the small majority of six in the lower\nHouse. How great a majority, do you think, would have\nbeen given had Kansas also been secured for slavery? [A\nvoice: \u201cA majority the other way.\u201d] \u201cA majority the other\nway,\u201d is answered. Do you think it would have been safe for\na Northern man to have confronted his constituents after\nhaving voted to consign both Missouri and Kansas to\nhopeless slavery? And yet this man Douglas, who\nmisrepresents his constituents and who has exerted his\nhighest talents in that direction, will be carried in triumph\nthrough the State and hailed with honor while applauding\nthat act. [Three groans for \u201cDug!\u201d] And this shows whither\nwe are tending. This thing of slavery is more powerful than\nits supporters \u2014 even than the high priests that minister at\nits altar. It debauches even our greatest men. It gathers\nstrength, like a rolling snowball, by its own infamy.\n Monstrous crimes are committed in its name by persons\ncollectively which they would not dare to commit as\nindividuals. Its aggressions and encroachments almost\nsurpass belief. In a despotism, one might not wonder to see\nslavery advance steadily and remorselessly into new\ndominions; but is it not wonderful, is it not even alarming,\nto see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the\nproposition that \u201call men are created equal\u201d? [Sensation.]\nIt yields nothing itself; it keeps all it has, and gets all it\ncan besides. It really came dangerously near securing\nIllinois in ; it did get Missouri in . The \ufb01rst\nproposition was to admit what is now Arkansas and\nMissouri as one slave State. But the territory was divided\nand Arkansas came in, without serious question, as a slave\nState; and afterwards Missouri, not, as a sort of equality,\nfree, but also as a slave State. Then we had Florida and\nTexas; and now Kansas is about to be forced into the dismal\nprocession. [Sensation.] And so it is wherever you look. We\nhave not forgotten \u2014 it is but six years since \u2014 how\ndangerously near California came to being a slave State.\nTexas is a slave State, and four other slave States may be\ncarved from its vast domain. And yet, in the year ,\nslavery was abolished throughout that vast region by a\nroyal decree of the then sovereign of Mexico. Will you\nplease tell me by what right slavery exists in Texas to-day?\nBy the same right as, and no higher or greater than, slavery\nis seeking dominion in Kansas: by political force \u2014\npeaceful, if that will su\ufb00ice; by the torch (as in Kansas) and\nthe bludgeon (as in the Senate chamber), if required. And\n so history repeats itself; and even as slavery has kept its\ncourse by craft, intimidation, and violence in the past, so it\nwill persist, in my judgment, until met and dominated by\nthe will of a people bent on its restriction.\nWe have, this very afternoon, heard bitter denunciations\nof Brooks in Washington, and Titus, Stringfellow, Atchison,\nJones, and Shannon in Kansas \u2014 the battle-ground of\nslavery. I certainly am not going to advocate or shield them;\nbut they and their acts are but the necessary outcome of\nthe Nebraska law. We should reserve our highest censure\nfor the authors of the mischief, and not for the catspaws\nwhich they use. I believe it was Shakespeare who said,\n\u201cWhere the o\ufb00ence lies, there let the axe fall\u201d; and, in my\nopinion, this man Douglas and the Northern men in\nCongress who advocate \u201cNebraska\u201d are more guilty than a\nthousand \nJoneses \nand \nStringfellows, \nwith \nall \ntheir\nmurderous practices, can be. [Applause.]\nWe have made a good beginning here to-day. As our\nMethodist friends would say, \u201cI feel it is good to be here.\u201d\nWhile extremists may \ufb01nd some fault with the moderation\nof our platform, they should recollect that \u201cthe battle is not\nalways to the strong, nor the race to the swift.\u201d In grave\nemergencies, \nmoderation \nis \ngenerally \nsafer \nthan\nradicalism; and as this struggle is likely to be long and\nearnest, we must not, by our action, repel any who are in\nsympathy with us in the main, but rather win all that we\ncan to our standard. We must not belittle nor overlook the\nfacts of our condition \u2014 that we are new and comparatively\nweak, while our enemies are entrenched and relatively\n strong. They have the administration and the political\npower; and, right or wrong, at present they have the\nnumbers. Our friends who urge an appeal to arms with so\nmuch force and eloquence should recollect that the\ngovernment is arrayed against us, and that the numbers\nare now arrayed against us as well; or, to state it nearer to\nthe truth, they are not yet expressly and a\ufb00irmatively for\nus; and we should repel friends rather than gain them by\nanything savoring of revolutionary methods. As it now\nstands, we must appeal to the sober sense and patriotism of\nthe people. We will make converts day by day; we will grow\nstrong by calmness and moderation; we will grow strong by\nthe violence and injustice of our adversaries. And, unless\ntruth be a mockery and justice a hollow lie, we will be in\nthe majority after a while, and then the revolution which\nwe will accomplish will be none the less radical from being\nthe result of paci\ufb01c measures. The battle of freedom is to\nbe fought out on principle. Slavery is a violation of the\neternal right. We have temporized with it from the\nnecessities of our condition; but as sure as God reigns and\nschool children read, THAT BLACK FOUL LIE CAN NEVER\nBE CONSECRATED INTO GOD\u2019S HALLOWED TRUTH!\n[Immense applause lasting some time.]\nOne of our greatest di\ufb00iculties is, that men who know\nthat slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation\nare compelled, by our peculiar condition and other\ncircumstances, to advocate it concretely, though damning it\nin the raw. Henry Clay was a brilliant example of this\ntendency; others of our purest statesmen are compelled to\n do so; and thus slavery secures actual support from those\nwho detest it at heart. Yet Henry Clay perfected and forced\nthrough the compromise which secured to slavery a great\nState as well as a political advantage. Not that he hated\nslavery less, but that he loved the whole Union more. As\nlong as slavery pro\ufb01ted by his great compromise, the hosts\nof proslavery could not su\ufb00iciently cover him with praise;\nbut now that this compromise stands in their way \u2014\n\u201c....they never mention him,\nHis name is never heard:\nTheir lips are now forbid to speak\nThat once familiar word.\u201d\nThey have slaughtered one of his most cherished\nmeasures, and his ghost would arise to rebuke them. [Great\napplause.]\nNow, let us harmonize, my friends, and appeal to the\nmoderation and patriotism of the people: to the sober\nsecond thought; to the awakened public conscience. The\nrepeal of the sacred Missouri Compromise has installed the\nweapons of violence: the bludgeon, the incendiary torch,\nthe death-dealing ri\ufb02e, the bristling cannon \u2014 the weapons\nof kingcraft, of the inquisition, of ignorance, of barbarism,\nof oppression. We see its fruits in the dying bed of the\nheroic Sumner; in the ruins of the \u201cFree State\u201d hotel; in the\nsmoking embers of the Herald of Freedom; in the free-State\nGovernor of Kansas chained to a stake on freedom\u2019s soil\nlike a horse-thief, for the crime of freedom. [Applause.] We\nsee it in Christian statesmen, and Christian newspapers,\nand Christian pulpits applauding the cowardly act of a low\n bully, WHO CRAWLED UPON HIS VICTIM BEHIND HIS\nBACK AND DEALT THE DEADLY BLOW. [Sensation and\napplause.] We note our political demoralization in the\ncatch-words that are coming into such common use; on the\none hand, \u201cfreedom-shriekers,\u201d and sometimes \u201cfreedom-\nscreechers\u201d [Laughter], and, on the other hand, \u201cborder-\nru\ufb00ians,\u201d and that fully deserved. And the signi\ufb01cance of\ncatch-words cannot pass unheeded, for they constitute a\nsign of the times. Everything in this world \u201cjibes\u201d in with\neverything else, and all the fruits of this Nebraska Bill are\nlike the poisoned source from which they come. I will not\nsay that we may not sooner or later be compelled to meet\nforce by force; but the time has not yet come, and, if we are\ntrue to ourselves, may never come. Do not mistake that the\nballot is stronger than the bullet. Therefore let the legions\nof slavery use bullets; but let us wait patiently till\nNovember and \ufb01re ballots at them in return; and by that\npeaceful \npolicy \nI \nbelieve \nwe \nshall \nultimately \nwin.\n[Applause.]\nIt was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers\nfought the good \ufb01ght and gained the victory. In  the\nfree men of our State, led by Governor Coles (who was a\nnative of Maryland and President Madison\u2019s private\nsecretary), determined that those beautiful groves should\nnever re-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself.\nBy their resolute determination, the winds that sweep\nacross our broad prairies shall never cool the parched\nbrow, nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and\ngladness to our free soil water the tired feet, of a slave; but\n so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling streams\nbless the land, or the groves and their fragrance or memory\nremain, the humanity to which they minister SHALL BE\nFOREVER FREE! [Great applause] Palmer, Yates, Williams,\nBrowning, and some more in this convention came from\nKentucky to Illinois (instead of going to Missouri), not only\nto better their conditions, but also to get away from slavery.\nThey have said so to me, and it is understood among us\nKentuckians that we don\u2019t like it one bit. Now, can we,\nmindful of the blessings of liberty which the early men of\nIllinois left to us, refuse a like privilege to the free men who\nseek to plant Freedom\u2019s banner on our Western outposts?\n[\u201cNo!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d] Should we not stand by our neighbors who\nseek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska?\n[\u201cYes!\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d] Can we as Christian men, and strong and\nfree ourselves, wield the sledge or hold the iron which is to\nmanacle anew an already oppressed race? [\u201cNo!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d]\n\u201cWoe unto them,\u201d it is written, \u201cthat decree unrighteous\ndecrees and that write grievousness which they have\nprescribed.\u201d Can we a\ufb00ord to sin any more deeply against\nhuman liberty? [\u201cNo!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d]\nOne great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an\ninsidious and crafty power, and gains equally by open\nviolence of the brutal as well as by sly management of the\npeaceful. Even after the Ordinance of , the settlers in\nIndiana and Illinois (it was all one government then) tried\nto get Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions\nto that end were sent from Kaskaskia, and General\nHarrison, the Governor, urged it from Vincennes, the\n capital. If that had succeeded, good-bye to liberty here. But\nJohn Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report against\nit; and although they persevered so well as to get three\nfavorable reports for it, yet the United States Senate, with\nthe aid of some slave States, \ufb01nally squelched if for good.\n[Applause.] And that is why this hall is to-day a temple for\nfree men instead of a negro livery-stable. [Great applause\nand laughter.] Once let slavery get planted in a locality, by\never so weak or doubtful a title, and in ever so small\nnumbers, and it is like the Canada thistle or Bermuda grass\n\u2014 you can\u2019t root it out. You yourself may detest slavery; but\nyour neighbor has \ufb01ve or six slaves, and he is an excellent\nneighbor, or your son has married his daughter, and they\nbeg you to help save their property, and you vote against\nyour interests and principle to accommodate a neighbor,\nhoping that your vote will be on the losing side. And others\ndo the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure\nfoothold. And when that is done the whole mighty Union \u2014\nthe force of the nation \u2014 is committed to its support. And\nthat very process is working in Kansas to-day. And you must\nrecollect that the slave property is worth a billion of\ndollars; while free-State men must work for sentiment\nalone. Then there are \u201cblue lodges\u201d \u2014 as they call them \u2014\neverywhere doing their secret and deadly work.\nIt is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral\nlaw that I know of, that if a man loses his horse, the whole\ncountry will turn out to help hang the thief; but if a man but\na shade or two darker than I am is himself stolen, the same\ncrowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to liberty.\n Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse is\nmore sacred than a man; and the essence of squatter or\npopular sovereignty \u2014 I don\u2019t care how you call it \u2014 is that\nif one man chooses to make a slave of another, no third man\nshall be allowed to object. And if you can do this in free\nKansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next thing you will\nsee is shiploads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at\nCharleston, for one thing is as truly lawful as the other; and\nthese are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out,\nelse they will stamp us out. [Sensation and applause.]\nTwo years ago, at Spring\ufb01eld, Judge Douglas avowed\nthat Illinois came into the Union as a slave State, and that\nslavery was weeded out by the operation of his great,\npatent, everlasting principle of \u201cpopular sovereignty.\u201d\n[Laughter.] Well, now, that argument must be answered, for\nit has a little grain of truth at the bottom. I do not mean\nthat it is true in essence, as he would have us believe. It\ncould not be essentially true if the Ordinance of \u2018 was\nvalid. But, in point of fact, there were some degraded\nbeings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the other French\nsettlements when our \ufb01rst State constitution was adopted;\nthat is a fact, and I don\u2019t deny it. Slaves were brought here\nas early as , and were kept here in spite of the\nOrdinance of  against it. But slavery did not thrive\nhere. On the contrary, under the in\ufb02uence of the ordinance\nthe number decreased \ufb01fty-one from  to ; while\nunder the in\ufb02uence of squatter sovereignty, right across\nthe river in Missouri, they increased seven thousand two\nhundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery \ufb01nally\n faded out in Illinois, under the in\ufb02uence of the law of\nfreedom, while it grew stronger and stronger in Missouri,\nunder the law or practice of \u201cpopular sovereignty.\u201d In point\nof fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in\nIllinois one year after its admission, or one to every four\nhundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in\nanother way, if Illinois was a slave State in , so were\nNew York and New Jersey much greater slave States from\nhaving \nhad \ngreater \nnumbers, \nslavery \nhaving \nbeen\nestablished there in very early times. But there is this vital\ndi\ufb00erence between all these States and the Judge\u2019s Kansas\nexperiment: that they sought to disestablish slavery which\nhad been already established, while the Judge seeks, so far\nas he can, to disestablish freedom, which had been\nestablished there by the Missouri Compromise. [Voices:\n\u201cGood!\u201d]\nThe Union is under-going a fearful strain; but it is a stout\nold ship, and has weathered many a hard blow, and \u201cthe\nstars in their courses,\u201d aye, an invisible Power, greater than\nthe puny e\ufb00orts of men, will \ufb01ght for us. But we ourselves\nmust not decline the burden of responsibility, nor take\ncounsel of unworthy passions. Whatever duty urges us to\ndo or to omit must be done or omitted; and the\nrecklessness with which our adversaries break the laws, or\ncounsel their violation, should a\ufb00ord no example for us.\nTherefore, let us revere the Declaration of Independence;\nlet us continue to obey the Constitution and the laws; let us\nkeep step to the music of the Union. Let us draw a cordon,\nso to speak, around the slave States, and the hateful\n institution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by its\nown infamy. [Applause.]\nBut we cannot be free men if this is, by our national\nchoice, to be a land of slavery. Those who deny freedom to\nothers deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of\na just God, cannot long retain it.[Loud applause.]\nDid you ever, my friends, seriously re\ufb02ect upon the speed\nwith which we are tending downwards? Within the memory\nof men now present the leading statesman of Virginia could\nmake genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches in old Virginia!\nand, as I have said, now even in \u201cfree Kansas\u201d it is a crime\nto declare that it is \u201cfree Kansas.\u201d The very sentiments that\nI and others have just uttered would entitle us, and each of\nus, to the ignominy and seclusion of a dungeon; and yet I\nsuppose that, like Paul, we were \u201cfree born.\u201d But if this\nthing is allowed to continue, it will be but one step further\nto impress the same rule in Illinois. [Sensation.]\nThe conclusion of all is, that we must restore the\nMissouri Compromise. We must highly resolve that Kansas\nmust be free! [Great applause.] We must reinstate the\nbirthday promise of the Republic; we must rea\ufb00irm the\nDeclaration of Independence; we must make good in\nessence as well as in form Madison\u2019s avowal that \u201cthe word\nslave ought not to appear in the Constitution\u201d; and we must\neven go further, and decree that only local law, and not that\ntime-honored instrument, shall shelter a slaveholder. We\nmust make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in name. But\nin seeking to attain these results \u2014 so indispensable if the\nliberty which is our pride and boast shall endure \u2014 we will\n be loyal to the Constitution and to the \u201c\ufb02ag of our Union,\u201d\nand no matter what our grievance \u2014 even though Kansas\nshall come in as a slave State; and no matter what theirs \u2014\neven if we shall restore the compromise \u2014 WE WILL SAY\nTO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS, WE WON\u2019T GO OUT\nOF THE UNION, AND YOU SHAN\u2019T!\n[This was the climax; the audience rose to its feet en\nmasse, applauded, stamped, waved handkerchiefs, threw\nhats in the air, and ran riot for several minutes. The arch-\nenchanter \nwho \nwrought \nthis \ntransformation \nlooked,\nmeanwhile, like the personi\ufb01cation of political justice.]\nBut let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism\nof the people, and not to their prejudices; let us spread the\n\ufb02oods of enthusiasm here aroused all over these vast\nprairies, so suggestive of freedom. Let us commence by\nelecting the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell who\nstood for the honor of our State alike on the plains and\namidst the chaparral of Mexico and on the \ufb02oor of\nCongress, while he de\ufb01ed the Southern Hotspur; and that\nwill have a greater moral e\ufb00ect than all the border ru\ufb00ians\ncan accomplish in all their raids on Kansas. There is both a\npower and a magic in popular opinion. To that let us now\nappeal; and while, in all probability, no resort to force will\nbe needed, our moderation and forbearance will stand US\nin good stead when, if ever, WE MUST MAKE AN APPEAL\nTO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS! [Immense\napplause and a rush for the orator.]\nOne can realize with this ability to move people\u2019s minds\nthat the Southern Conspiracy were right to hate this man.\n He, better than any at the time was able to uncover their\nstratagems \nand \ntear \ndown \ntheir \nsophisms \nand\ncontradictions.\n  \n I I A   \n     \n \n \nTO W.

This, of course, I wish to be\ncon\ufb01dential.\nLamon did get your deeds. I went with him to the o\ufb00ice,\ngot them, and put them in his hands myself.\nYours very truly, A.

This morning I received\nanother from Judd and Peck, written by consultation with\nyou. Now let me tell you why I am plagued: . I can hardly\nspare the time.\n. I am superstitious. I have scarcely known a party\npreceding an election to call in help from the neighboring\nStates but they lost the State. Last fall, our friends had\nWade, of Ohio, and others, in Maine; and they lost the\nState. Last spring our adversaries had New Hampshire full\nof South Carolinians, and they lost the State. And so,\ngenerally, it seems to stir up more enemies than friends.\nHave the enemy called in any foreign help? If they have a\nforeign champion there I should have no objection to drive\na nail in his track. I shall reach Chicago on the night of the\nth, to attend to a little business in court. Consider the\nthings I have suggested, and write me at Chicago.\nEspecially write me whether Browning consents to visit\nyou.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n    \n  I A\n  A\n AI\n      H\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT GALENA, ILLINOIS, IN THE\nFREMONT CAMPAIGN,\nAUGUST , .\nYou further charge us with being disunionists. If you\nmean that it is our aim to dissolve the Union, I for myself\nanswer that it is untrue; for those who act with me I answer\nthat it is untrue. Have you heard us assert that as our aim?\nDo you really believe that such is our aim? Do you \ufb01nd it in\nour platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere?\nIf not, withdraw the charge.\nBut you may say that, though it is not our aim, it will be\nthe result if we succeed, and that we are therefore\ndisunionists in fact. This is a grave charge you make\nagainst us, and we certainly have a right to demand that\nyou specify in what way we are to dissolve the Union. How\nare we to e\ufb00ect this?\nThe only speci\ufb01cation o\ufb00ered is volunteered by Mr.\nFillmore in his Albany speech. His charge is that if we elect\na President and Vice-President both from the free States, it\nwill dissolve the Union. This is open folly. The Constitution\nprovides that the President and Vice-President of the\nUnited States shall be of di\ufb00erent States, but says nothing\nas to the latitude and longitude of those States. In \n Andrew Jackson, of Tennessee, and John C. Calhoun, of\nSouth Carolina, were elected President and Vice-President,\nboth from slave States; but no one thought of dissolving the\nUnion then on that account. In  Harrison, of Ohio, and\nTyler, of Virginia, were elected. In  Harrison died and\nJohn Tyler succeeded to the Presidency, and William R.\nKing, of Alabama, was elected acting Vice-President by the\nSenate; but no one supposed that the Union was in danger.\nIn fact, at the very time Mr. Fillmore uttered this idle\ncharge, the state of things in the United States disproved it.\nMr. Pierce, of New Hampshire, and Mr. Bright, of Indiana,\nboth from free States, are President and Vice-President,\nand the Union stands and will stand. You do not pretend\nthat it ought to dissolve the Union, and the facts show that\nit won\u2019t; therefore the charge may be dismissed without\nfurther consideration.\nNo other speci\ufb01cation is made, and the only one that\ncould be made is that the restoration of the restriction of\n, making the United States territory free territory,\nwould dissolve the Union. Gentlemen, it will require a\ndecided majority to pass such an act. We, the majority,\nbeing able constitutionally to do all that we purpose, would\nhave no desire to dissolve the Union. Do you say that such\nrestriction of slavery would be unconstitutional, and that\nsome of the States would not submit to its enforcement? I\ngrant you that an unconstitutional act is not a law; but I do\nnot ask and will not take your construction of the\nConstitution. The Supreme Court of the United States is the\ntribunal to decide such a question, and we will submit to its\n decisions; and if you do also, there will be an end of the\nmatter. Will you? If not, who are the disunionists \u2014 you or\nwe? We, the majority, would not strive to dissolve the\nUnion; and if any attempt is made, it must be by you, who\nso loudly stigmatize us as disunionists. But the Union, in\nany event, will not be dissolved. We don\u2019t want to dissolve\nit, and if you attempt it we won\u2019t let you. With the purse\nand sword, the army and navy and treasury, in our hands\nand at our command, you could not do it. This government\nwould be very weak indeed if a majority with a disciplined\narmy and navy and a well-\ufb01lled treasury could not preserve\nitself when attacked by an unarmed, undisciplined,\nunorganized minority. All this talk about the dissolution of\nthe Union is humbug, nothing but folly. We do not want to\ndissolve the Union; you shall not.\n   H  \nA\n   \n   HI \n  A  I \nTO JOHN BENNETT.\nSPRINGFIELD, AUG. , \nDEAR SIR: \u2014 I understand you are a Fillmore man. If, as\nbetween Fremont and Buchanan, you really prefer the\nelection of Buchanan, then burn this without reading a line\nfurther. But if you would like to defeat Buchanan and his\ngang, allow me a word with you: Does any one pretend that\nFillmore can carry the vote of this State? I have not heard a\nsingle man pretend so. Every vote taken from Fremont and\ngiven to Fillmore is just so much in favor of Buchanan. The\nBuchanan men see this; and hence their great anxiety in\nfavor of the Fillmore movement. They know where the shoe\npinches. They now greatly prefer having a man of your\ncharacter go for Fillmore than for Buchanan because they\nexpect several to go with you, who would go for Fremont if\nyou were to go directly for Buchanan.\nI think I now understand the relative strength of the\nthree parties in this State as well as any one man does, and\nmy opinion is that to-day Buchanan has alone ,,\nFremont ,, and Fillmore ,.\nThis gives B. the State by  and leaves him in the\nminority of the whole ,.\n Fremont and Fillmore men being united on Bissell, as\nthey already are, he cannot be beaten. This is not a long\nletter, but it contains the whole story.\nYours as ever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n        . \n \nI .\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. , .\nDEAR DUBOIS: YOUR letter on the same sheet with Mr.\nMiller\u2019s is just received. I have been absent four days. I do\nnot know when your court sits.\nTrumbull has written the committee here to have a set of\nappointments \nmade \nfor \nhim \ncommencing \nhere \nin\nSpring\ufb01eld, on the th of Sept., and to extend throughout\nthe south half of the State. When he goes to Lawrenceville,\nas he will, I will strain every nerve to be with you and him.\nMore than that I cannot promise now.\nYours as truly as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n HA  I \n \nA    .\n[Con\ufb01dential]\nSPRINGFIELD, SEPTEMBER , .\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 I understand you are a Fillmore man. Let\nme prove to you that every vote withheld from Fremont and\ngiven to Fillmore in this State actually lessens Fillmore\u2019s\nchance of being President. Suppose Buchanan gets all the\nslave States and Pennsylvania, and any other one State\nbesides; then he is elected, no matter who gets all the rest.\nBut suppose Fillmore gets the two slave States of Maryland\nand Kentucky; then Buchanan is not elected; Fillmore goes\ninto the House of Representatives, and may be made\nPresident by a compromise. But suppose, again, Fillmore\u2019s\nfriends throw away a few thousand votes on him in Indiana\nand Illinois; it will inevitably give these States to Buchanan,\nwhich will more than compensate him for the loss of\nMaryland and Kentucky, will elect him, and leave Fillmore\nno chance in the House of Representatives or out of it.\nThis is as plain as adding up the weight of three small\nhogs. As Mr. Fillmore has no possible chance to carry\nIllinois for himself, it is plainly to his interest to let Fremont\ntake it, and thus keep it out of the hands of Buchanan. Be\nnot deceived. Buchanan is the hard horse to beat in this\nrace. Let him have Illinois, and nothing can beat him; and\n he will get Illinois if men persist in throwing away votes\nupon Mr. Fillmore. Does some one persuade you that Mr.\nFillmore can carry Illinois? Nonsense! There are over\nseventy newspapers in Illinois opposing Buchanan, only\nthree or four of which support Mr. Fillmore, all the rest\ngoing for Fremont. Are not these newspapers a fair index of\nthe proportion of the votes? If not, tell me why.\nAgain, of these three or four Fillmore newspapers, two,\nat least, are supported in part by the Buchanan men, as I\nunderstand. Do not they know where the shoe pinches?\nThey know the Fillmore movement helps them, and\ntherefore they help it. Do think these things over, and then\nact according to your judgment.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n .  .  \nA .\nSept. , .\nDR. R.

LINCOLN.\n A      H  \n \n  A I   I  \n   \n \n HA\nA\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT A REPUBLICAN BANQUET IN\nCHICAGO, DECEMBER , .\nWE HAVE ANOTHER annual Presidential message. Like a\nrejected lover making merry at the wedding of his rival, the\nPresident \nfelicitates \nhimself \nhugely \nover \nthe \nlate\nPresidential election. He considers the result a signal\ntriumph of good principles and good men, and a very\npointed rebuke of bad ones. He says the people did it. He\nforgets that the \u201cpeople,\u201d as he complacently calls only\nthose who voted for Buchanan, are in a minority of the\nwhole people by about four hundred thousand votes \u2014 one\nfull tenth of all the votes. Remembering this, he might\nperceive that the \u201crebuke\u201d may not be quite as durable as\nhe seems to think \u2014 that the majority may not choose to\nremain permanently rebuked by that minority.\nThe President thinks the great body of us Fremonters,\nbeing ardently attached to liberty, in the abstract, were\nduped by a few wicked and designing men. There is a slight\ndi\ufb00erence of opinion on this. We think he, being ardently\nattached to the hope of a second term, in the concrete, was\nduped by men who had liberty every way. He is the cat\u2019s-\npaw. By much dragging of chestnuts from the \ufb01re for others\n to eat, his claws are burnt o\ufb00 to the gristle, and he is\nthrown aside as un\ufb01t for further use. As the fool said of\nKing Lear, when his daughters had turned him out of doors,\n\u201cHe \u2018s a shelled peascod\u201d (\u201cThat \u2018s a sheal\u2019d peascod\u201d).\nSo far as the President charges us \u201cwith a desire to\nchange the domestic institutions of existing States,\u201d and of\n\u201cdoing everything in our power to deprive the Constitution\nand the laws of moral authority,\u201d for the whole party on\nbelief, and for myself on knowledge, I pronounce the\ncharge an unmixed and unmitigated falsehood.\nOur government rests in public opinion. Whoever can\nchange \npublic \nopinion \ncan \nchange \nthe \ngovernment\npractically just so much. Public opinion, on any subject,\nalways has a \u201ccentral idea,\u201d from which all its minor\nthoughts radiate. That \u201ccentral idea\u201d in our political public\nopinion at the beginning was, and until recently has\ncontinued to be, \u201cthe equality of men.\u201d And although it has\nalways submitted patiently to whatever of inequality there\nseemed to be as matter of actual necessity, its constant\nworking has been a steady progress toward the practical\nequality of all men. The late Presidential election was a\nstruggle by one party to discard that central idea and to\nsubstitute for it the opposite idea that slavery is right in the\nabstract, the workings of which as a central idea may be\nthe perpetuity of human slavery and its extension to all\ncountries and colors. Less than a year ago the Richmond\nEnquirer, an avowed advocate of slavery, regardless of\ncolor, in order to favor his views, invented the phrase\n\u201cState equality,\u201d and now the President, in his message,\n adopts the Enquirer\u2019s catch-phrase, telling us the people\n\u201chave asserted the constitutional equality of each and all of\nthe States of the Union as States.\u201d The President \ufb02atters\nhimself \nthat \nthe \nnew \ncentral \nidea \nis \ncompletely\ninaugurated; and so indeed it is, so far as the mere fact of a\nPresidential election can inaugurate it. To us it is left to\nknow that the majority of the people have not yet declared\nfor it, and to hope that they never will.\nAll of us who did not vote for Mr. Buchanan, taken\ntogether, are a majority of four hundred thousand. But in\nthe late contest we were divided between Fremont and\nFillmore. Can we not come together for the future? Let\nevery one who really believes and is resolved that free\nsociety is not and shall not be a failure, and who can\nconscientiously declare that in the last contest he has done\nonly what he thought best \u2014 let every such one have\ncharity to believe that every other one can say as much.\nThus let bygones be bygones; let past di\ufb00erences as\nnothing be; and with steady eye on the real issue let us\nreinaugurate the good old \u201ccentral idea\u201d of the republic.\nWe can do it. The human heart is with us; God is with us.\nWe shall again be able, not to declare that \u201call States as\nStates are equal,\u201d nor yet that \u201call citizens as citizens are\nequal,\u201d but to renew the broader, better declaration,\nincluding both these and much more, that \u201call men are\ncreated equal.\u201d\n  \n \n .  .  \nA .\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. , .\nDEAR SIR:-W HEN I was at Chicago two weeks ago I saw\nMr. Arnold, and from a remark of his I inferred he was\nthinking of the speakership, though I think he was not\nanxious about it. He seemed most anxious for harmony\ngenerally, and particularly that the contested seats from\nPeoria and McDonough might be rightly determined. Since\nI came home I had a talk with Cullom, one of our American\nrepresentatives here, and he says he is for you for Speaker\nand also that he thinks all the Americans will be for you,\nunless it be Gorin, of Macon, of whom he cannot speak. If\nyou would like to be Speaker go right up and see Arnold.\nHe is talented, a practised debater, and, I think, would do\nhimself more credit on the \ufb02oor than in the Speaker\u2019s seat.\nGo and see him; and if you think \ufb01t, show him this letter.\nYour friend as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n   I  H  \nI\n  \n  A    A  \nI\n    \n  \n      \n    .\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I have had no immediate\nconference with Judge Douglas, but I will venture to say\nthat he and I will perfectly agree that your entire silence,\nboth when I speak and when he speaks, will be most\nagreeable to us.\nIn the month of May, , the elements in the State of\nIllinois which have since been consolidated into the\nRepublican party assembled together in a State Convention\nat Bloomington. They adopted at that time what, in political\nlanguage, is called a platform. In June of the same year the\nelements of the Republican party in the nation assembled\ntogether in a National Convention at Philadelphia. They\nadopted what is called the National Platform. In June, ,\n\u2014 the present year, \u2014 the Republicans of Illinois\nreassembled at Spring\ufb01eld, in State Convention, and\nadopted again their platform, as I suppose not di\ufb00ering in\nany essential particular from either of the former ones, but\nperhaps \nadding \nsomething \nin \nrelation \nto \nthe \nnew\ndevelopments of political progress in the country.\nThe Convention that assembled in June last did me the\nhonor, if it be one, and I esteem it such, to nominate me as\ntheir candidate for the United States Senate. I have\nsupposed that, in entering upon this canvass, I stood\n generally upon these platforms. We are now met together\non the th of October of the same year, only four months\nfrom the adoption of the last platform, and I am unaware\nthat in this canvass, from the beginning until to-day, any\none of our adversaries has taken hold of our platforms, or\nlaid his \ufb01nger upon anything that he calls wrong in them.\nIn the very \ufb01rst one of these joint discussions between\nSenator Douglas and myself, Senator Douglas, without\nalluding at all to these platforms, or any one of them, of\nwhich I have spoken, attempted to hold me responsible for\na set of resolutions passed long before the meeting of\neither one of these conventions of which I have spoken. And\nas a ground for holding me responsible for these\nresolutions, he assumed that they had been passed at a\nState Convention of the Republican party, and that I took\npart in that Convention. It was discovered afterward that\nthis was erroneous, that the resolutions which he\nendeavored to hold me responsible for had not been passed\nby any State Convention anywhere, had not been passed at\nSpring\ufb01eld, where he supposed they had, or assumed that\nthey had, and that they had been passed in no convention\nin which I had taken part. The Judge, nevertheless, was not\nwilling to give up the point that he was endeavoring to\nmake upon me, and he therefore thought to still hold me to\nthe point that he was endeavoring to make, by showing that\nthe resolutions that he read had been passed at a local\nconvention in the northern part of the State, although it\nwas not a local convention that embraced my residence at\nall, nor one that reached, as I suppose, nearer than one\n hundred and \ufb01fty or two hundred miles of where I was\nwhen it met, nor one in which I took any part at all. He also\nintroduced other resolutions, passed at other meetings, and\nby combining the whole, although they were all antecedent\nto the two State Conventions and the one National\nConvention I have mentioned, still he insisted, and now\ninsists, as I understand, that I am in some way responsible\nfor them.\nAt Jonesboro, on our third meeting, I insisted to the\nJudge that I was in no way rightfully held responsible for\nthe proceedings of this local meeting or convention, in\nwhich I had taken no part, and in which I was in no way\nembraced; but I insisted to him that if he thought I was\nresponsible for every man or every set of men everywhere,\nwho happen to be my friends, the rule ought to work both\nways, and he ought to be responsible for the acts and\nresolutions of all men or sets of men who were or are now\nhis supporters and friends, and gave him a pretty long\nstring of resolutions, passed by men who are now his\nfriends, and announcing doctrines for which he does not\ndesire to be held responsible.\nThis still does not satisfy Judge Douglas. He still adheres\nto his proposition, that I am responsible for what some of\nmy friends in di\ufb00erent parts of the State have done, but\nthat he is not responsible for what his have done. At least,\nso I understand him. But in addition to that, the Judge, at\nour meeting in Galesburgh, last week, undertakes to\nestablish that I am guilty of a species of double dealing\nwith the public; that I make speeches of a certain sort in\n the north, among the Abolitionists, which I would not make\nin the south, and that I make speeches of a certain sort in\nthe south which I would not make in the north. I\napprehend, in the course I have marked out for myself, that\nI shall not have to dwell at very great length upon this\nsubject.\nAs this was done in the Judge\u2019s opening speech at\nGalesburgh, I had an opportunity, as I had the middle\nspeech then, of saying something in answer to it. He\nbrought forward a quotation or two from a speech of mine\ndelivered at Chicago, and then, to contrast with it, he\nbrought forward an extract from a speech of mine at\nCharleston, in which he insisted that I was greatly\ninconsistent, and insisted that his conclusion followed, that\nI was playing a double part, and speaking in one region one\nway, and in another region another way. I have not time\nnow to dwell on this as long as I would like, and wish only\nnow to requote that portion of my speech at Charleston\nwhich the Judge quoted, and then make some comments\nupon it. This he quotes from me as being delivered at\nCharleston, and I believe correctly:\n\u201cI will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in\nfavor of bringing about in any way the social and political\nequality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor\never have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of\nnegroes, nor of qualifying them to hold o\ufb00ice, nor to\nintermarry with white people; and I will say, in addition to\nthis, that there is a physical di\ufb00erence between the white\nand black races which will forever forbid the two races\n living together on terms of social and political equality. And\ninasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain\ntogether, there must be the position of superior and\ninferior. I am as much as any other man in favor of having\nthe superior position assigned to the white race.\u201d\nThis, I believe, is the entire quotation from Charleston\nspeech, as Judge Douglas made it his comments are as\nfollows:\n\u201cYes, here you \ufb01nd men who hurrah for Lincoln, and say\nhe is right when he discards all distinction between races,\nor when he declares that he discards the doctrine that\nthere is such a thing as a superior and inferior race; and\nAbolitionists are required and expected to vote for Mr.\nLincoln because he goes for the equality of races, holding\nthat in the Declaration of Independence the white man and\nnegro were declared equal, and endowed by divine law\nwith equality. And down South, with the old-line Whigs,\nwith the Kentuckians, the Virginians and the Tennesseeans,\nhe tells you that there is a physical di\ufb00erence between the\nraces, making the one superior, the other inferior, and he is\nin favor of maintaining the superiority of the white race\nover the negro.\u201d\nThose are the Judges comments. Now, I wish to show you\nthat a month, or only lacking three days of a month, before\nI made the speech at Charleston, which the Judge quotes\nfrom, he had himself heard me say substantially the same\nthing It was in our \ufb01rst meeting, at Ottawa \u2014 and I will say\na word about where it was, and the atmosphere it was in,\nafter a while \u2014 but at our \ufb01rst meeting, at Ottawa, I read\n an extract from an old speech of mine, made nearly four\nyears ago, not merely to show my sentiments, but to show\nthat my sentiments were long entertained and openly\nexpressed; in which extract I expressly declared that my\nown feelings would not admit a social and political equality\nbetween the white and black races, and that even if my own\nfeelings would admit of it, I still knew that the public\nsentiment of the country would not, and that such a thing\nwas an utter impossibility, or substantially that. That\nextract from my old speech the reporters by some sort of\naccident passed over, and it was not reported. I lay no\nblame upon anybody. I suppose they thought that I would\nhand it over to them, and dropped reporting while I was\ngiving it, but afterward went away without getting it from\nme. At the end of that quotation from my old speech, which\nI read at Ottawa, I made the comments which were\nreported at that time, and which I will now read, and ask\nyou to notice how very nearly they are the same as Judge\nDouglas says were delivered by me down in Egypt. After\nreading, I added these words:\n\u201cNow, gentlemen, I don\u2019t want to read at any great\nlength; but this is the true complexion of all I have ever\nsaid in regard to the institution of slavery or the black race,\nand this is the whole of it: anything that argues me into his\nidea of perfect social and political equality with the negro,\nis but a specious and fantastical arrangement of words by\nwhich a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut\nhorse. I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have\nno purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the\n institution in the States where it exists. I believe I have no\nright to do so. I have no inclination to do so. I have no\npurpose to introduce political and social equality between\nthe white and black races. There is a physical di\ufb00erence\nbetween the two which, in my judgment, will probably\nforever forbid their living together on the footing of perfect\nequality; and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there\nmust be a di\ufb00erence, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in\nfavor of the race to which I belong having the superior\nposition. I have never said anything to the contrary, but I\nhold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the\nworld why the negro is not entitled to all the rights\nenumerated in the Declaration of Independence, \u2014 the\nright of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold\nthat he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I\nagree with Judge Douglas that he is not my equal in many\nrespects, certainly not in color, perhaps not in intellectual\nand moral endowments; but in the right to eat the bread,\nwithout the leave of anybody else, which his own hand\nearns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and\nthe equal of every other man.\u201d\nI have chie\ufb02y introduced this for the purpose of meeting\nthe Judge\u2019s charge that the quotation he took from my\nCharleston speech was what I would say down South\namong the Kentuckians, the Virginians, etc., but would not\nsay in the regions in which was supposed to be more of the\nAbolition element. I now make this comment: That speech\nfrom which I have now read the quotation, and which is\nthere given correctly \u2014 perhaps too much so for good taste\n \u2014 was made away up North in the Abolition District of this\nState par excellence, in the Lovejoy District, in the personal\npresence of Lovejoy, for he was on the stand with us when I\nmade it. It had been made and put in print in that region\nonly three days less than a month before the speech made\nat Charleston, the like of which Judge Douglas thinks I\nwould not make where there was any Abolition element. I\nonly refer to this matter to say that I am altogether\nunconscious of having attempted any double-dealing\nanywhere; that upon one occasion I may say one thing, and\nleave other things unsaid, and vice versa, but that I have\nsaid anything on one occasion that is inconsistent with\nwhat I have said elsewhere, I deny, at least I deny it so far\nas the intention is concerned. I \ufb01nd that I have devoted to\nthis topic a larger portion of my time than I had intended. I\nwished to show, but I will pass it upon this occasion, that in\nthe sentiment I have occasionally advanced upon the\nDeclaration of Independence I am entirely borne out by the\nsentiments advanced by our old Whig leader, Henry Clay,\nand I have the book here to show it from but because I have\nalready occupied more time than I intended to do on that\ntopic, I pass over it.\nAt Galesburgh, I tried to show that by the Dred Scott\ndecision, pushed to its legitimate consequences, slavery\nwould be established in all the States as well as in the\nTerritories. I did this because, upon a former occasion, I\nhad asked Judge Douglas whether, if the Supreme Court\nshould make a decision declaring that the States had not\nthe power to exclude slavery from their limits, he would\n adopt and follow that decision as a rule of political action;\nand because he had not directly answered that question,\nbut had merely contented himself with sneering at it, I\nagain introduced it, and tried to show that the conclusion\nthat I stated followed inevitably and logically from the\nproposition already decided by the court. Judge Douglas\nhad the privilege of replying to me at Galesburgh, and\nagain he gave me no direct answer as to whether he would\nor would not sustain such a decision if made. I give him his\nthird chance to say yes or no. He is not obliged to do either,\nprobably he will not do either; but I give him the third\nchance. I tried to show then that this result, this\nconclusion, inevitably followed from the point already\ndecided by the court. The Judge, in his reply, again sneers\nat the thought of the court making any such decision, and\nin the course of his remarks upon this subject uses the\nlanguage which I will now read. Speaking of me, the Judge\nsays:\n\u201cHe goes on and insists that the Dred Scott decision\nwould carry slavery into the free States, notwithstanding\nthe decision itself says the contrary.\u201d And he adds:\n\u201cMr. Lincoln knows that there is no member of the\nSupreme Court that holds that doctrine. He knows that\nevery one of them in their opinions held the reverse.\u201d\nI especially introduce this subject again for the purpose\nof saying that I have the Dred Scott decision here, and I\nwill thank Judge Douglas to lay his \ufb01nger upon the place in\nthe entire opinions of the court where any one of them\n\u201csays the contrary.\u201d It is very hard to a\ufb00irm a negative with\n entire con\ufb01dence. I say, however, that I have examined that\ndecision with a good deal of care, as a lawyer examines a\ndecision and, so far as I have been able to do so, the court\nhas nowhere in its opinions said that the States have the\npower to exclude slavery, nor have they used other\nlanguage substantially that, I also say, so far as I can \ufb01nd,\nnot one of the concurring judges has said that the States\ncan \nexclude \nslavery, \nnor \nsaid \nanything \nthat \nwas\nsubstantially that. The nearest approach that any one of\nthem has made to it, so far as I can \ufb01nd, was by Judge\nNelson, and the approach he made to it was exactly, in\nsubstance, the Nebraska Bill, \u2014 that the States had the\nexclusive power over the question of slavery, so far as they\nare not limited by the Constitution of the United States. I\nasked the question, therefore, if the non-concurring judges,\nMcLean or Curtis, had asked to get an express declaration\nthat the States could absolutely exclude slavery from their\nlimits, what reason have we to believe that it would not\nhave been voted down by the majority of the judges, just as\nChase\u2019s amendment was voted down by Judge Douglas and\nhis compeers when it was o\ufb00ered to the Nebraska Bill.\nAlso, at Galesburgh, I said something in regard to those\nSpring\ufb01eld resolutions that Judge Douglas had attempted\nto use upon me at Ottawa, and commented at some length\nupon the fact that they were, as presented, not genuine.\nJudge Douglas in his reply to me seemed to be somewhat\nexasperated. He said he would never have believed that\nAbraham Lincoln, as he kindly called me, would have\nattempted such a thing as I had attempted upon that\n occasion; and among other expressions which he used\ntoward me, was that I dared to say forgery, that I had dared\nto say forgery [turning to Judge Douglas]. Yes, Judge, I did\ndare to say forgery. But in this political canvass the Judge\nought to remember that I was not the \ufb01rst who dared to say\nforgery. At Jacksonville, Judge Douglas made a speech in\nanswer to something said by Judge Trumbull, and at the\nclose of what he said upon that subject, he dared to say\nthat Trumbull had forged his evidence. He said, too, that he\nshould not concern himself with Trumbull any more, but\nthereafter he should hold Lincoln responsible for the\nslanders upon him. When I met him at Charleston after\nthat, although I think that I should not have noticed the\nsubject if he had not said he would hold me responsible for\nit, I spread out before him the statements of the evidence\nthat Judge Trumbull had used, and I asked Judge Douglas,\npiece by piece, to put his \ufb01nger upon one piece of all that\nevidence that he would say was a forgery! When I went\nthrough with each and every piece, Judge Douglas did not\ndare then to say that any piece of it was a forgery. So it\nseems that there are some things that Judge Douglas dares\nto do, and some that he dares not to do.\n[A voice: It is the same thing with you.]\nYes, sir, it is the same thing with me. I do dare to say\nforgery when it is true, and don\u2019t dare to say forgery when\nit is false. Now I will say here to this audience and to Judge\nDouglas I have not dared to say he committed a forgery,\nand I never shall until I know it; but I did dare to say \u2014 just\nto suggest to the Judge \u2014 that a forgery had been\n committed, which by his own showing had been traced to\nhim and two of his friends. I dared to suggest to him that\nhe had expressly promised in one of his public speeches to\ninvestigate that matter, and I dared to suggest to him that\nthere was an implied promise that when he investigated it\nhe would make known the result. I dared to suggest to the\nJudge that he could not expect to be quite clear of\nsuspicion of that fraud, for since the time that promise was\nmade he had been with those friends, and had not kept his\npromise in regard to the investigation and the report upon\nit. I am not a very daring man, but I dared that much,\nJudge, and I am not much scared about it yet. When the\nJudge says he would n\u2019t have believed of Abraham Lincoln\nthat he would have made such an attempt as that he\nreminds me of the fact that he entered upon this canvass\nwith the purpose to treat me courteously; that touched me\nsomewhat. It sets me to thinking. I was aware, when it was\n\ufb01rst agreed that Judge Douglas and I were to have these\nseven joint discussions, that they were the successive acts\nof a drama, perhaps I should say, to be enacted, not merely\nin the face of audiences like this, but in the face of the\nnation, and to some extent, by my relation to him, and not\nfrom anything in myself, in the face of the world; and I am\nanxious that they should be conducted with dignity and in\nthe good temper which would be be\ufb01tting the vast\naudiences before which it was conducted. But when Judge\nDouglas got home from Washington and made his \ufb01rst\nspeech in Chicago, the evening afterward I made some sort\nof a reply to it. His second speech was made at\n Bloomington, in which he commented upon my speech at\nChicago and said that I had used language ingeniously\ncontrived to conceal my intentions, or words to that e\ufb00ect.\nNow, I understand that this is an imputation upon my\nveracity and my candor. I do not know what the Judge\nunderstood by it, but in our \ufb01rst discussion, at Ottawa, he\nled o\ufb00 by charging a bargain, somewhat corrupt in its\ncharacter, upon Trumbull and myself, \u2014 that we had\nentered into a bargain, one of the terms of which was that\nTrumbull was to Abolitionize the old Democratic party, and\nI (Lincoln) was to Abolitionize the old Whig party; I\npretending to be as good an old-line Whig as ever. Judge\nDouglas may not understand that he implicated my\ntruthfulness and my honor when he said I was doing one\nthing and pretending another; and I misunderstood him if\nhe thought he was treating me in a digni\ufb01ed way, as a man\nof honor and truth, as he now claims he was disposed to\ntreat me. Even after that time, at Galesburgh, when he\nbrings forward an extract from a speech made at Chicago\nand an extract from a speech made at Charleston, to prove\nthat I was trying to play a double part, that I was trying to\ncheat the public, and get votes upon one set of principles at\none place, and upon another set of principles at another\nplace, \u2014 I do not understand but what he impeaches my\nhonor, my veracity, and my candor; and because he does\nthis, I do not understand that I am bound, if I see a truthful\nground for it, to keep my hands o\ufb00 of him. As soon as I\nlearned that Judge Douglas was disposed to treat me in this\nway, I signi\ufb01ed in one of my speeches that I should be\n driven to draw upon whatever of humble resources I might\nhave, \u2014 to adopt a new course with him. I was not entirely\nsure that I should be able to hold my own with him, but I at\nleast had the purpose made to do as well as I could upon\nhim; and now I say that I will not be the \ufb01rst to cry \u201cHold.\u201d\nI think it originated with the Judge, and when he quits, I\nprobably will. But I shall not ask any favors at all. He asks\nme, or he asks the audience, if I wish to push this matter to\nthe point of personal di\ufb00iculty. I tell him, no. He did not\nmake a mistake, in one of his early speeches, when he\ncalled me an \u201camiable\u201d man, though perhaps he did when\nhe called me an \u201cintelligent\u201d man. It really hurts me very\nmuch to suppose that I have wronged anybody on earth. I\nagain tell him, no! I very much prefer, when this canvass\nshall be over, however it may result, that we at least part\nwithout any bitter recollections of personal di\ufb00iculties.\nThe Judge, in his concluding speech at Galesburgh, says\nthat I was pushing this matter to a personal di\ufb00iculty, to\navoid the responsibility for the enormity of my principles. I\nsay to the Judge and this audience, now, that I will again\nstate our principles, as well as I hastily can, in all their\nenormity, and if the Judge hereafter chooses to con\ufb01ne\nhimself to a war upon these principles, he will probably not\n\ufb01nd me departing from the same course.\nWe have in this nation this element of domestic slavery. It\nis a matter of absolute certainty that it is a disturbing\nelement. It is the opinion of all the great men who have\nexpressed an opinion upon it, that it is a dangerous\nelement. We keep up a controversy in regard to it. That\n controversy necessarily springs from di\ufb00erence of opinion;\nand if we can learn exactly \u2014 can reduce to the lowest\nelements \u2014 what that di\ufb00erence of opinion is, we perhaps\nshall be better prepared for discussing the di\ufb00erent\nsystems of policy that we would propose in regard to that\ndisturbing element. I suggest that the di\ufb00erence of opinion,\nreduced to its lowest of terms, is no other than the\ndi\ufb00erence between the men who think slavery a wrong and\nthose who do not think it wrong. The Republican party\nthink it wrong; we think it is a moral, a social, and a\npolitical wrong. We think it as a wrong not con\ufb01ning itself\nmerely to the persons or the States where it exists, but that\nit is a wrong in its tendency, to say the least, that extends\nitself to the existence of the whole nation. Because we\nthink it wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal\nwith it as a wrong. We deal with it as with any other wrong,\nin so far as we can prevent its growing any larger, and so\ndeal with it that in the run of time there may be some\npromise of an end to it. We have a due regard to the actual\npresence of it amongst us, and the di\ufb00iculties of getting rid\nof it in any satisfactory way, and all the constitutional\nobligations thrown about it. I suppose that in reference\nboth to its actual existence in the nation, and to our\nconstitutional obligations, we have no right at all to disturb\nit in the States where it exists, and we profess that we have\nno more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to\ndo it. We go further than that: we don\u2019t propose to disturb\nit where, in one instance, we think the Constitution would\npermit us. We think the Constitution would permit us to\n disturb it in the District of Columbia. Still, we do not\npropose to do that, unless it should be in terms which I\ndon\u2019t suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to, \u2014\nthe terms of making the emancipation gradual, and\ncompensating the unwilling owners. Where we suppose we\nhave the constitutional right, we restrain ourselves in\nreference to the actual existence of the institution and the\ndi\ufb00iculties thrown about it. We also oppose it as an evil so\nfar as it seeks to spread itself. We insist on the policy that\nshall restrict it to its present limits. We don\u2019t suppose that\nin doing this we violate anything due to the actual presence\nof the institution, or anything due to the constitutional\nguaranties thrown around it.\nWe oppose the Dred Scott decision in a certain way, upon\nwhich I ought perhaps to address you a few words. We do\nnot propose that when Dred Scott has been decided to be a\nslave by the court, we, as a mob, will decide him to be free.\nWe do not propose that, when any other one, or one\nthousand, shall be decided by that court to be slaves, we\nwill in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus\nsettled; but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a\npolitical rule which shall be binding on the voter to vote for\nnobody who thinks it wrong, which shall be binding on the\nmembers of Congress or the President to favor no measure\nthat does not actually concur with the principles of that\ndecision. We do not propose to be bound by it as a political\nrule in that way, because we think it lays the foundation,\nnot merely of enlarging and spreading out what we\nconsider an evil, but it lays the foundation for spreading\n that evil into the States themselves. We propose so\nresisting it as to have it reversed if we can, and a new\njudicial rule established upon this subject.\nI will add this: that if there be any man who does not\nbelieve that slavery is wrong in the three aspects which I\nhave mentioned, or in any one of them, that man is\nmisplaced, and ought to leave us; while on the other hand,\nif there be any man in the Republican party who is\nimpatient over the necessity springing from its actual\npresence, and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties\nthrown around it, and would act in disregard of these, he\ntoo is misplaced, standing with us. He will \ufb01nd his place\nsomewhere else; for we have a due regard, so far as we are\ncapable of understanding them, for all these things. This,\ngentlemen, as well as I can give it, is a plain statement of\nour principles in all their enormity. I will say now that there\nis a sentiment in the country contrary to me, \u2014 a sentiment\nwhich holds that slavery is not wrong, and therefore it goes\nfor the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a\nwrong. That policy is the Democratic policy, and that\nsentiment is the Democratic sentiment. If there be a doubt\nin the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is\nreally the central idea of the Democratic party in relation to\nthis subject, I ask him to bear with me while I state a few\nthings tending, as I think, to prove that proposition. In the\n\ufb01rst place, the leading man \u2014 I think I may do my friend\nJudge Douglas the honor of calling him such advocating the\npresent Democratic policy never himself says it is wrong.\nHe has the high distinction, so far as I know, of never\n having said slavery is either right or wrong. Almost\neverybody else says one or the other, but the Judge never\ndoes. If there be a man in the Democratic party who thinks\nit is wrong, and yet clings to that party, I suggest to him, in\nthe \ufb01rst place, that his leader don\u2019t talk as he does, for he\nnever says that it is wrong. In the second place, I suggest\nto him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be\ncarried forward, he will \ufb01nd that he carefully excludes the\nidea that there is anything wrong in it. If you will examine\nthe arguments that are made on it, you will \ufb01nd that every\none carefully excludes the idea that there is anything\nwrong in slavery. Perhaps that Democrat who says he is as\nmuch opposed to slavery as I am will tell me that I am\nwrong about this. I wish him to examine his own course in\nregard to this matter a moment, and then see if his opinion\nwill not be changed a little. You say it is wrong; but don\u2019t\nyou constantly object to anybody else saying so? Do you not\nconstantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose\nit? You say it must not be opposed in the free States,\nbecause slavery is not here; it must not be opposed in the\nslave States, because it is there; it must not be opposed in\npolitics, because that will make a fuss; it must not be\nopposed in the pulpit, because it is not religion. Then\nwhere is the place to oppose it? There is no suitable place\nto oppose it. There is no place in the country to oppose this\nevil overspreading the continent, which you say yourself is\ncoming. Frank Blair and Gratz Brown tried to get up a\nsystem of gradual emancipation in Missouri, had an\nelection in August, and got beat, and you, Mr. Democrat,\n threw up your hat, and hallooed \u201cHurrah for Democracy!\u201d\nSo I say, again, that in regard to the arguments that are\nmade, when Judge Douglas Says he \u201cdon\u2019t care whether\nslavery is voted up or voted down,\u201d whether he means that\nas an individual expression of sentiment, or only as a sort of\nstatement of his views on national policy, it is alike true to\nsay that he can thus argue logically if he don\u2019t see anything\nwrong in it; but he cannot say so logically if he admits that\nslavery is wrong. He cannot say that he would as soon see a\nwrong voted up as voted down. When Judge Douglas says\nthat whoever or whatever community wants slaves, they\nhave a right to have them, he is perfectly logical, if there is\nnothing wrong in the institution; but if you admit that it is\nwrong, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to\ndo wrong. When he says that slave property and horse and\nhog property are alike to be allowed to go into the\nTerritories, upon the principles of equality, he is reasoning\ntruly, if there is no di\ufb00erence between them as property;\nbut if the one is property held rightfully, and the other is\nwrong, then there is no equality between the right and\nwrong; so that, turn it in anyway you can, in all the\narguments sustaining the Democratic policy, and in that\npolicy itself, there is a careful, studied exclusion of the idea\nthat there is anything wrong in slavery. Let us understand\nthis. I am not, just here, trying to prove that we are right,\nand they are wrong. I have been stating where we and they\nstand, and trying to show what is the real di\ufb00erence\nbetween us; and I now say that whenever we can get the\nquestion distinctly stated, can get all these men who\n believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong to\nstand and act with us in treating it as a wrong, \u2014 then, and\nnot till then, I think we will in some way come to an end of\nthis slavery agitation.\n  r.  I\n \n \n      \nI\n  .\nMY FRIENDS: \u2014 Since Judge Douglas has said to you in\nhis conclusion that he had not time in an hour and a half to\nanswer all I had said in an hour, it follows of course that I\nwill not be able to answer in half an hour all that he said in\nan hour and a half.\nI wish to return to Judge Douglas my profound thanks for\nhis public annunciation here to-day, to be put on record,\nthat his system of policy in regard to the institution of\nslavery contemplates that it shall last forever. We are\ngetting a little nearer the true issue of this controversy, and\nI am profoundly grateful for this one sentence. Judge\nDouglas asks you, Why cannot the institution of slavery, or\nrather, why cannot the nation, part slave and part free,\ncontinue as our fathers made it, forever? In the \ufb01rst place, I\ninsist that our fathers did not make this nation half slave\nand half free, or part slave and part free. I insist that they\nfound the institution of slavery existing here. They did not\nmake it so but they left it so because they knew of no way\nto get rid of it at that time. When Judge Douglas undertakes\nto say that, as a matter of choice, the fathers of the\ngovernment made this nation part slave and part free, he\nassumes what is historically a falsehood. More than that:\nwhen the fathers of the government cut o\ufb00 the source of\n slavery by the abolition of the slave-trade, and adopted a\nsystem of restricting it from the new Territories where it\nhad not existed, I maintain that they placed it where they\nunderstood, and all sensible men understood, it was in the\ncourse of ultimate extinction; and when Judge Douglas asks\nme why it cannot continue as our fathers made it, I ask him\nwhy he and his friends could not let it remain as our fathers\nmade it?\nIt is precisely all I ask of him in relation to the institution\nof slavery, that it shall be placed upon the basis that our\nfathers placed it upon. Mr. Brooks, of South Carolina, once\nsaid, and truly said, that when this government was\nestablished, no one expected the institution of slavery to\nlast until this day, and that the men who formed this\ngovernment were wiser and better than the men of these\ndays; but the men of these days had experience which the\nfathers had not, and that experience had taught them the\ninvention of the cotton-gin, and this had made the\nperpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity in this\ncountry. Judge Douglas could not let it stand upon the basis\nwhich our fathers placed it, but removed it, and put it upon\nthe cotton-gin basis. It is a question, therefore, for him and\nhis friends to answer, why they could not let it remain\nwhere the fathers of the government originally placed it. I\nhope nobody has understood me as trying to sustain the\ndoctrine that we have a right to quarrel with Kentucky, or\nVirginia, or any of the slave States, about the institution of\nslavery, \u2014 thus giving the Judge an opportunity to be\neloquent and valiant against us in \ufb01ghting for their rights. I\n expressly declared in my opening speech that I had neither\nthe inclination to exercise, nor the belief in the existence of,\nthe right to interfere with the States of Kentucky or\nVirginia in doing as they pleased with slavery Or any other\nexisting institution. Then what becomes of all his eloquence\nin behalf of the rights of States, which are assailed by no\nliving man?\nBut I have to hurry on, for I have but a half hour. The\nJudge has informed me, or informed this audience, that the\nWashington Union is laboring for my election to the United\nStates Senate. This is news to me, \u2014 not very ungrateful\nnews either. [Turning to Mr. W. H. Carlin, who was on the\nstand] \u2014 I hope that Carlin will be elected to the State\nSenate, and will vote for me. [Mr. Carlin shook his head.]\nCarlin don\u2019t fall in, I perceive, and I suppose he will not do\nmuch for me; but I am glad of all the support I can get,\nanywhere, if I can get it without practicing any deception to\nobtain it. In respect to this large portion of Judge Douglas\u2019s\nspeech in which he tries to show that in the controversy\nbetween himself and the Administration party he is in the\nright, I do not feel myself at all competent or inclined to\nanswer him. I say to him, \u201cGive it to them, \u2014 give it to them\njust all you can!\u201d and, on the other hand, I say to Carlin,\nand Jake Davis, and to this man Wogley up here in\nHancock, \u201cGive it to Douglas, just pour it into him!\u201d\nNow, in regard to this matter of the Dred Scott decision,\nI wish to say a word or two. After all, the Judge will not say\nwhether, if a decision is made holding that the people of the\nStates cannot exclude slavery, he will support it or not. He\n obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that case. The\njudges of the Supreme Court as obstinately refused to say\nwhat they would do on this subject. Before this I reminded\nhim that at Galesburgh he said the judges had expressly\ndeclared the contrary, and you remember that in my\nOpening speech I told him I had the book containing that\ndecision here, and I would thank him to lay his \ufb01nger on\nthe place where any such thing was said. He has occupied\nhis hour and a half, and he has not ventured to try to\nsustain his assertion. He never will. But he is desirous of\nknowing how we are going to reverse that Dred Scott\ndecision. Judge Douglas ought to know how. Did not he and\nhis political friends \ufb01nd a way to reverse the decision of\nthat same court in favor of the constitutionality of the\nNational Bank? Didn\u2019t they \ufb01nd a way to do it so e\ufb00ectually\nthat they have reversed it as completely as any decision\never was reversed, so far as its practical operation is\nconcerned?\nAnd let me ask you, did n\u2019t Judge Douglas \ufb01nd a way to\nreverse the decision of our Supreme Court when it decided\nthat Carlin\u2019s father \u2014 old Governor Carlin had not the\nconstitutional power to remove a Secretary of State? Did he\nnot appeal to the \u201cMOBS,\u201d as he calls them? Did he not\nmake speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that\ndecision was, and how it ought to be overthrown? Did he\nnot succeed, too, in getting an act passed by the\nLegislature to have it overthrown? And did n\u2019t he himself\nsit down on that bench as one of the \ufb01ve added judges, who\nwere to overslaugh the four old ones, getting his name of\n \u201cjudge\u201d in that way, and no other? If there is a villainy in\nusing disrespect or making opposition to Supreme Court\ndecisions, I commend it to Judge Douglas\u2019s earnest\nconsideration. I know of no man in the State of Illinois who\nought to know so well about how much villainy it takes to\noppose a decision of the Supreme Court as our honorable\nfriend Stephen A. Douglas.\nJudge Douglas also makes the declaration that I say the\nDemocrats are bound by the Dred Scott decision, while the\nRepublicans are not. In the sense in which he argues, I\nnever said it; but I will tell you what I have said and what I\ndo not hesitate to repeat to-day. I have said that as the\nDemocrats believe that decision to be correct, and that the\nextension \nof \nslavery \nis \na\ufb00irmed \nin \nthe \nNational\nConstitution, they are bound to support it as such; and I\nwill tell you here that General Jackson once said each man\nwas bound to support the Constitution \u201cas he understood\nit.\u201d Now, Judge Douglas understands the Constitution\naccording to the Dred Scott decision, and he is bound to\nsupport it as he understands it. I understand it another\nway, and therefore I am bound to support it in the way in\nwhich I understand it. And as Judge Douglas believes that\ndecision to be correct, I will remake that argument if I have\ntime to do so. Let me talk to some gentleman down there\namong you who looks me in the face. We will say you are a\nmember of the Territorial Legislature, and, like Judge\nDouglas, you believe that the right to take and hold slaves\nthere is a constitutional right The \ufb01rst thing you do is to\nswear you will support the Constitution, and all rights\n guaranteed therein; that you will, whenever your neighbor\nneeds your legislation to support his constitutional rights,\nnot withhold that legislation. If you withhold that necessary\nlegislation for the support of the Constitution and\nconstitutional rights, do you not commit perjury? I ask\nevery sensible man if that is not so? That is undoubtedly\njust so, say what you please. Now, that is precisely what\nJudge Douglas says, that this is a constitutional right. Does\nthe Judge mean to say that the Territorial Legislature in\nlegislating may, by withholding necessary laws, or by\npassing unfriendly laws, nullify that constitutional right?\nDoes he mean to say that? Does he mean to ignore the\nproposition so long and well established in law, that what\nyou cannot do directly, you cannot do indirectly? Does he\nmean that? The truth about the matter is this: Judge\nDouglas has sung paeans to his \u201cPopular Sovereignty\u201d\ndoctrine until his Supreme Court, co-operating with him,\nhas squatted his Squatter Sovereignty out. But he will keep\nup this species of humbuggery about Squatter Sovereignty.\nHe has at last invented this sort of do-nothing sovereignty,\n\u2014 that the people may exclude slavery by a sort of\n\u201csovereignty\u201d that is exercised by doing nothing at all. Is\nnot that running his Popular Sovereignty down awfully?\nHas it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that\nwas made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had\nstarved to death? But at last, when it is brought to the test\nof close reasoning, there is not even that thin decoction of\nit left. It is a presumption impossible in the domain of\nthought. It is precisely no other than the putting of that\n most unphilosophical proposition, that two bodies can\noccupy the same space at the same time. The Dred Scott\ndecision covers the whole ground, and while it occupies it,\nthere is no room even for the shadow of a starved pigeon to\noccupy the same ground.\nJudge Douglas, in reply to what I have said about having\nupon a previous occasion made the speech at Ottawa as the\none he took an extract from at Charleston, says it only\nshows that I practiced the deception twice. Now, my\nfriends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that?\nJudge Douglas had said I had made a speech at Charleston\nthat I would not make up north, and I turned around and\nanswered him by showing I had made that same speech up\nnorth, \u2014 had made it at Ottawa; made it in his hearing;\nmade it in the Abolition District, \u2014 in Lovejoy\u2019s District, \u2014\nin the personal presence of Lovejoy himself, \u2014 in the same\natmosphere exactly in which I had made my Chicago\nspeech, of which he complains so much.\nNow, in relation to my not having said anything about the\nquotation from the Chicago speech: he thinks that is a\nterrible subject for me to handle. Why, gentlemen, I can\nshow you that the substance of the Chicago speech I\ndelivered two years ago in \u201cEgypt,\u201d as he calls it. It was\ndown at Spring\ufb01eld. That speech is here in this book, and I\ncould turn to it and read it to you but for the lack of time. I\nhave not now the time to read it. [\u201cRead it, read it.\u201d] No,\ngentlemen, I am obliged to use discretion in disposing most\nadvantageously of my brief time. The Judge has taken great\nexception to my adopting the heretical statement in the\n Declaration of Independence, that \u201call men are created\nequal,\u201d and he has a great deal to say about negro equality.\nI want to say that in sometimes alluding to the Declaration\nof Independence, I have only uttered the sentiments that\nHenry Clay used to hold. Allow me to occupy your time a\nmoment with what he said. Mr. Clay was at one time called\nupon in Indiana, and in a way that I suppose was very\ninsulting, to liberate his slaves; and he made a written\nreply to that application, and one portion of it is in these\nwords:\n\u201cWhat is the foundation of this appeal to me in Indiana to\nliberate the slaves under my care in Kentucky? It is a\ngeneral declaration in the act announcing to the world the\nindependence of the thirteen American colonies, that men\nare created equal. Now, as an abstract principle, there is no\ndoubt of the truth of that declaration, and it is desirable in\nthe original construction of society, and in organized\nsocieties, to keep it in view as a great fundamental\nprinciple.\u201d\nWhen I sometimes, in relation to the organization of new\nsocieties in new countries, where the soil is clean and clear,\ninsisted that we should keep that principle in view, Judge\nDouglas will have it that I want a negro wife. He never can\nbe brought to understand that there is any middle ground\non this subject. I have lived until my \ufb01ftieth year, and have\nnever had a negro woman either for a slave or a wife, and I\nthink I can live \ufb01fty centuries, for that matter, without\nhaving had one for either. I maintain that you may take\nJudge Douglas\u2019s quotations from my Chicago speech, and\n from my Charleston speech, and the Galesburgh speech, \u2014\nin his speech of to-day, \u2014 and compare them over, and I am\nwilling to trust them with you upon his proposition that\nthey show rascality or double-dealing. I deny that they do.\nThe Judge does not seem at all disposed to have peace,\nbut I \ufb01nd he is disposed to have a personal warfare with\nme. He says that my oath would not be taken against the\nbare word of Charles H. Lanphier or Thomas L. Harris.\nWell, that is altogether a matter of opinion. It is certainly\nnot for me to vaunt my word against oaths of these\ngentlemen, but I will tell Judge Douglas again the facts\nupon which I \u201cdared\u201d to say they proved a forgery. I pointed\nout at Galesburgh that the publication of these resolutions\nin the Illinois State Register could not have been the result\nof accident, as the proceedings of that meeting bore\nunmistakable evidence of being done by a man who knew it\nwas a forgery; that it was a publication partly taken from\nthe real proceedings of the Convention, and partly from the\nproceedings of a convention at another place, which\nshowed that he had the real proceedings before him, and\ntaking one part of the resolutions, he threw out another\npart, and substituted false and fraudulent ones in their\nstead. I pointed that out to him, and also that his friend\nLanphier, who was editor of the Register at that time and\nnow is, must have known how it was done. Now, whether\nhe did it, or got some friend to do it for him, I could not tell,\nbut he certainly knew all about it. I pointed out to Judge\nDouglas that in his Freeport speech he had promised to\ninvestigate that matter. Does he now say that he did not\n make that promise? I have a right to ask why he did not\nkeep it. I call upon him to tell here to-day why he did not\nkeep that promise? That fraud has been traced up so that it\nlies between him, Harris, and Lanphier. There is little room\nfor escape for Lanphier. Lanphier is doing the Judge good\nservice, and Douglas desires his word to be taken for the\ntruth. He desires Lanphier to be taken as authority in what\nhe states in his newspaper. He desires Harris to be taken as\na man of vast credibility; and when this thing lies among\nthem, they will not press it to show where the guilt really\nbelongs. Now, as he has said that he would investigate it,\nand implied that he would tell us the result of his\ninvestigation, I demand of him to tell why he did not\ninvestigate it, if he did not; and if he did, why he won\u2019t tell\nthe result. I call upon him for that.\nThis is the third time that Judge Douglas has assumed\nthat he learned about these resolutions by Harris\u2019s\nattempting to use them against Norton on the \ufb02oor of\nCongress. I tell Judge Douglas the public records of the\ncountry show that he himself attempted it upon Trumbull a\nmonth before Harris tried them on Norton; that Harris had\nthe opportunity of learning it from him, rather than he from\nHarris. I now ask his attention to that part of the record on\nthe case. My friends, I am not disposed to detain you longer\nin regard to that matter.\nI am told that I still have \ufb01ve minutes left. There is\nanother matter I wish to call attention to. He says, when he\ndiscovered there was a mistake in that case, he came\nforward magnanimously, without my calling his attention to\n it, and explained it. I will tell you how he became so\nmagnanimous. When the newspapers of our side had\ndiscovered and published it, and put it beyond his power to\ndeny it, then he came forward and made a virtue of\nnecessity by acknowledging it. Now he argues that all the\npoint there was in those resolutions, although never passed\nat Spring\ufb01eld, is retained by their being passed at other\nlocalities. Is that true? He said I had a hand in passing\nthem, in his opening speech, that I was in the convention\nand helped to pass them. Do the resolutions touch me at\nall? It strikes me there is some di\ufb00erence between holding\na man responsible for an act which he has not done and\nholding him responsible for an act that he has done. You\nwill judge whether there is any di\ufb00erence in the \u201cspots.\u201d\nAnd he has taken credit for great magnanimity in coming\nforward and acknowledging what is proved on him beyond\neven the capacity of Judge Douglas to deny; and he has\nmore capacity in that way than any other living man.\nThen he wants to know why I won\u2019t withdraw the charge\nin regard to a conspiracy to make slavery national, as he\nhas withdrawn the one he made. May it please his worship,\nI will withdraw it when it is proven false on me as that was\nproven false on him. I will add a little more than that, I will\nwithdraw it whenever a reasonable man shall be brought to\nbelieve that the charge is not true. I have asked Judge\nDouglas\u2019s attention to certain matters of fact tending to\nprove the charge of a conspiracy to nationalize slavery, and\nhe says he convinces me that this is all untrue because\nBuchanan was not in the country at that time, and because\n the Dred Scott case had not then got into the Supreme\nCourt; and he says that I say the Democratic owners of\nDred Scott got up the case. I never did say that I defy Judge\nDouglas to show that I ever said so, for I never uttered it.\n[One of Mr. Douglas\u2019s reporters gesticulated a\ufb00irmatively\nat Mr. Lincoln.] I don\u2019t care if your hireling does say I did, I\ntell you myself that I never said the \u201cDemocratic\u201d owners of\nDred Scott got up the case. I have never pretended to know\nwhether \nDred \nScott\u2019s \nowners \nwere \nDemocrats, \nor\nAbolitionists, or Freesoilers or Border Ru\ufb00ians. I have said\nthat there is evidence about the case tending to show that\nit was a made-up case, for the purpose of getting that\ndecision. I have said that that evidence was very strong in\nthe fact that when Dred Scott was declared to be a slave,\nthe owner of him made him free, showing that he had had\nthe case tried and the question settled for such use as\ncould be made of that decision; he cared nothing about the\nproperty thus declared to be his by that decision. But my\ntime is out, and I can say no more.\n     \n  \n  \nH\n  .  \n     .  ri ate.\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., FEBRUARY , .\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Your note about the little paragraph in the\nRepublican was received yesterday, since which time I have\nbeen too unwell to notice it. I had not supposed you wrote\nor approved it. The whole originated in mistake. You know\nby \nthe \nconversation \nwith \nme \nthat \nI \nthought \nthe\nestablishment of the paper unfortunate, but I always\nexpected to throw no obstacle in its way, and to patronize it\nto the extent of taking and paying for one copy. When the\npaper was brought to my house, my wife said to me, \u201cNow\nare you going to take another worthless little paper?\u201d I said\nto her evasively, \u201cI have not directed the paper to be left.\u201d\nFrom this, in my absence, she sent the message to the\ncarrier. This is the whole story.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n    \n A \n A       H\nSPEECH IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JUNE , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 I am here to-night partly by the\ninvitation of some of you, and partly by my own inclination.\nTwo weeks ago Judge Douglas spoke here on the several\nsubjects of Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and Utah. I\nlistened to the speech at the time, and have the report of it\nsince. It was intended to controvert opinions which I think\njust, and to assail (politically, not personally) those men\nwho, in common with me, entertain those opinions. For this\nreason I wished then, and still wish, to make some answer\nto it, which I now take the opportunity of doing.\nI begin with Utah. If it prove to be true, as is probable,\nthat the people of Utah are in open rebellion to the United\nStates, then Judge Douglas is in favor of repealing their\nterritorial organization, and attaching them to the adjoining\nStates for judicial purposes. I say, too, if they are in\nrebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience;\nand I am not now prepared to admit or deny that the\nJudge\u2019s mode of coercing them is not as good as any. The\nRepublicans can fall in with it without taking back anything\nthey have ever said. To be sure, it would be a considerable\nbacking down by Judge Douglas from his much-vaunted\ndoctrine of self-government for the Territories; but this is\n only additional proof of what was very plain from the\nbeginning, that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense\nfor the bene\ufb01t of slavery. Those who could not see that\nmuch in the Nebraska act itself, which forced governors,\nand secretaries, and judges on the people of the Territories\nwithout their choice or consent, could not be made to see,\nthough one should rise from the dead.\nBut in all this it is very plain the Judge evades the only\nquestion the Republicans have ever pressed upon the\nDemocracy in regard to Utah. That question the Judge well\nknew to be this: \u201cIf the people of Utah peacefully form a\nState constitution tolerating polygamy, will the Democracy\nadmit them into the Union?\u201d There is nothing in the United\nStates Constitution or law against polygamy; and why is it\nnot a part of the Judge\u2019s \u201csacred right of self-government\u201d\nfor the people to have it, or rather to keep it, if they\nchoose? These questions, so far as I know, the Judge never\nanswers. It might involve the Democracy to answer them\neither way, and they go unanswered.\nAs to Kansas. The substance of the Judge\u2019s speech on\nKansas is an e\ufb00ort to put the free-State men in the wrong\nfor not voting at the election of delegates to the\nconstitutional convention. He says:\n\u201cThere is every reason to hope and believe that the law\nwill be fairly interpreted and impartially executed, so as to\ninsure to every bona \ufb01de inhabitant the free and quiet\nexercise of the elective franchise.\u201d\nIt appears extraordinary that Judge Douglas should make\nsuch a statement.\n He knows that, by the law, no one can vote who has not\nbeen registered;\nand he knows that the free-State men place their refusal\nto vote on the\nground that but few of them have been registered. It is\npossible that this\nis not true, but Judge Douglas knows it is asserted to be\ntrue in letters,\nnewspapers, and public speeches, and borne by every\nmail and blown by\nevery breeze to the eyes and ears of the world. He knows\nit is boldly\ndeclared that the people of many whole counties, and\nmany whole\nneighborhoods in others, are left unregistered; yet he\ndoes not venture\nto contradict the declaration, or to point out how they\ncan vote without\nbeing registered; but he just slips along, not seeming to\nknow there is\nany such question of fact, and complacently declares:\n\u201cThere is every reason to hope and believe that the law\nwill be\nfairly and impartially executed, so as to insure to every\nbona \ufb01de\ninhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective\nfranchise.\u201d\n I readily agree that if all had a chance to vote they ought\nto have voted. If, on the contrary, as they allege, and Judge\nDouglas ventures not to particularly contradict, few only of\nthe free-State men had a chance to vote, they were\nperfectly right in staying from the polls in a body.\nBy the way, since the Judge spoke, the Kansas election\nhas come o\ufb00. The Judge expressed his con\ufb01dence that all\nthe Democrats in Kansas would do their duty-including\n\u201cfree-State Democrats,\u201d of course. The returns received\nhere as yet are very incomplete; but so far as they go, they\nindicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters\nhave really voted; and this, too, when not more, perhaps,\nthan one half of the rightful voters have been registered,\nthus showing the thing to have been altogether the most\nexquisite \nfarce \never \nenacted. \nI \nam \nwatching \nwith\nconsiderable interest to ascertain what \ufb01gure \u201cthe free-\nState Democrats\u201d cut in the concern. Of course they voted,\n\u2014 all Democrats do their duty, \u2014 and of course they did not\nvote for slave-State candidates. We soon shall know how\nmany delegates they elected, how many candidates they\nhad pledged to a free State, and how many votes were cast\nfor them.\nAllow me to barely whisper my suspicion that there were\nno such things in Kansas as \u201cfree-State Democrats\u201d \u2014 that\nthey were altogether mythical, good only to \ufb01gure in\nnewspapers and speeches in the free States. If there should\nprove to be one real living free-State Democrat in Kansas, I\nsuggest that it might be well to catch him, and stu\ufb00 and\n preserve his skin as an interesting specimen of that soon-\nto-be extinct variety of the genus Democrat.\nAnd now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision\ndeclares two propositions \u2014 \ufb01rst, that a negro cannot sue\nin the United States courts; and secondly, that Congress\ncannot prohibit slavery in the Territories. It was made by a\ndivided court dividing di\ufb00erently on the di\ufb00erent points.\nJudge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision,\nand in that respect I shall follow his example, believing I\ncould no more improve on McLean and Curtis than he\ncould on Taney.\nHe denounces all who question the correctness of that\ndecision, as o\ufb00ering violent resistance to it. But who resists\nit? Who has, in spite of the decision, declared Dred Scott\nfree, and resisted the authority of his master over him?\nJudicial decisions have two uses \u2014 \ufb01rst, to absolutely\ndetermine the case decided, and secondly, to indicate to the\npublic how other similar cases will be decided when they\narise. For the latter use, they are called \u201cprecedents\u201d and\n\u201cauthorities.\u201d\nWe believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in\nobedience to, and respect for, the judicial department of\ngovernment. We think its decisions on constitutional\nquestions, when fully settled, should control not only the\nparticular cases decided, but the general policy of the\ncountry, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the\nConstitution as provided in that instrument itself. More\nthan this would be revolution. But we think the Dred Scott\ndecision is erroneous. We know the court that made it has\n often overruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we\ncan to have it to overrule this. We o\ufb00er no resistance to it.\nJudicial decisions are of greater or less authority as\nprecedents according to circumstances. That this should be\nso accords both with common sense and the customary\nunderstanding of the legal profession.\nIf this important decision had been made by the\nunanimous concurrence of the judges, and without any\napparent partisan bias, and in accordance with legal public\nexpectation \nand \nwith \nthe \nsteady \npractice \nof \nthe\ndepartments throughout our history, and had been in no\npart based on assumed historical facts which are not really\ntrue; or, if wanting in some of these, it had been before the\ncourt more than once, and had there been a\ufb00irmed and\nrea\ufb00irmed through a course of years, it then might be,\nperhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to\nacquiesce in it as a precedent.\nBut when, as is true, we \ufb01nd it wanting in all these\nclaims to the public con\ufb01dence, it is not resistance, it is not\nfactious, it is not even disrespectful, to treat it as not\nhaving yet quite established a settled doctrine for the\ncountry. But Judge Douglas considers this view awful. Hear\nhim:\n\u201cThe courts are the tribunals prescribed by the\nConstitution and created by the authority of the people to\ndetermine, expound, and enforce the law. Hence, whoever\nresists the \ufb01nal decision of the highest judicial tribunal\naims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of\ngovernment \u2014 a blow which, if successful, would place all\n our rights and liberties at the mercy of passion, anarchy,\nand violence. I repeat, therefore, that if resistance to the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in a\nmatter like the points decided in the Dred Scott case,\nclearly \nwithin \ntheir \njurisdiction \nas \nde\ufb01ned \nby \nthe\nConstitution, shall be forced upon the country as a political\nissue, it will become a distinct and naked issue between the\nfriends and enemies of the Constitution \u2014 the friends and\nthe enemies of the supremacy of the laws.\u201d\nWhy, this same Supreme Court once decided a national\nbank to be constitutional; but General Jackson, as President\nof the United States, disregarded the decision, and vetoed\na bill for a recharter, partly on constitutional ground,\ndeclaring that each public functionary must support the\nConstitution \u201cas he understands it.\u201d But hear the General\u2019s\nown words. Here they are, taken from his veto message:\n\u201cIt is maintained by the advocates of the bank that its\nconstitutionality, in all its features, ought to be considered\nas settled by precedent, and by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt. To this conclusion I cannot assent. Mere precedent\nis a dangerous source of authority, and should not be\nregarded as deciding questions of constitutional power,\nexcept where the acquiescence of the people and the States\ncan be considered as well settled. So far from this being\nthe case on this subject, an argument against the bank\nmight be based on precedent. One Congress, in ,\ndecided in favor of a bank; another, in , decided\nagainst it. One Congress, in , decided against a bank;\nanother, in , decided in its favor. Prior to the present\n Congress, therefore, the precedents drawn from that\ncourse were equal. If we resort to the States, the\nexpressions of legislative, judicial, and executive opinions\nagainst the bank have been probably to those in its favor as\nfour to one. There is nothing in precedent, therefore,\nwhich, if its authority were admitted, ought to weigh in\nfavor of the act before me.\u201d\nI drop the quotations merely to remark that all there ever\nwas in the way of precedent up to the Dred Scott decision,\non the points therein decided, had been against that\ndecision. But hear General Jackson further:\n\u201cIf the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole\nground of this act, it ought not to control the coordinate\nauthorities \nof \nthis \ngovernment. \nThe \nCongress, \nthe\nexecutive, and the courts must, each for itself, be guided by\nits own opinion of the Constitution. Each public o\ufb00icer who\ntakes an oath to support the Constitution swears that he\nwill support it as he understands it, and not as it is\nunderstood by others.\u201d\nAgain and again have I heard Judge Douglas denounce\nthat bank decision and applaud General Jackson for\ndisregarding it. It would be interesting for him to look over\nhis recent speech, and see how exactly his \ufb01erce philippics\nagainst us for resisting Supreme Court decisions fall upon\nhis own head. It will call to mind a long and \ufb01erce political\nwar in this country, upon an issue which, in his own\nlanguage, and, of course, in his own changeless estimation,\n\u201cwas a distinct issue between the friends and the enemies\n of the Constitution,\u201d and in which war he fought in the\nranks of the enemies of the Constitution.\nI have said, in substance, that the Dred Scott decision\nwas in part based on assumed historical facts which were\nnot really true, and I ought not to leave the subject without\ngiving some reasons for saying this; I therefore give an\ninstance or two, which I think fully sustain me. Chief\nJustice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of\nthe court, insists at great length that negroes were no part\nof the people who made, or for whom was made, the\nDeclaration of Independence, or the Constitution of the\nUnited States.\nOn the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion,\nshows that in \ufb01ve of the then thirteen States \u2014 to wit, New\nHampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and\nNorth Carolina \u2014 free negroes were voters, and in\nproportion to their numbers had the same part in making\nthe Constitution that the white people had. He shows this\nwith so much particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth;\nand as a sort of conclusion on that point, holds the\nfollowing language:\n\u201cThe Constitution was ordained and established by the\npeople of the United States, through the action, in each\nState, of those persons who were quali\ufb01ed by its laws to act\nthereon in behalf of themselves and all other citizens of the\nState. In some of the States, as we have seen, colored\npersons were among those quali\ufb01ed by law to act on the\nsubject. These colored persons were not only included in\nthe body of \u2018the people of the United States\u2019 by whom the\n Constitution was ordained and established; but in at least\n\ufb01ve of the States they had the power to act, and doubtless\ndid act, by their su\ufb00rages, upon the question of its\nadoption.\u201d\nAgain, Chief Justice Taney says:\n\u201cIt is di\ufb00icult at this day to realize the state of public\nopinion, in relation to that unfortunate race, which\nprevailed in the civilized and enlightened portions of the\nworld at the time of the Declaration of Independence, and\nwhen the Constitution of the United States was framed and\nadopted.\u201d\nAnd again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:\n\u201cThe general words above quoted would seem to include\nthe whole human family, and if they were used in a similar\ninstrument at this day, would be so understood.\u201d\nIn these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but\nplainly assumes as a fact, that the public estimate of the\nblack man is more favorable now than it was in the days of\nthe Revolution. This assumption is a mistake. In some\ntri\ufb02ing particulars the condition of that race has been\nameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change\nbetween then and now is decidedly the other way, and their\nultimate destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the\nlast three or four years. In two of the \ufb01ve States \u2014 New\nJersey and North Carolina \u2014 that then gave the free negro\nthe right of voting, the right has since been taken away,\nand in a third \u2014 New York \u2014 it has been greatly abridged;\nwhile it has not been extended, so far as I know, to a single\nadditional State, though the number of the States has more\n than doubled. In those days, as I understand, masters\ncould, at their own pleasure, emancipate their slaves; but\nsince then such legal restraints have been made upon\nemancipation as to amount almost to prohibition. In those\ndays Legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish\nslavery in their respective States, but now it is becoming\nquite fashionable for State constitutions to withhold that\npower from the Legislatures. In those days, by common\nconsent, the spread of the black man\u2019s bondage to the new\ncountries was prohibited, but now Congress decides that it\nwill not continue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court\ndecides that it could not if it would. In those days our\nDeclaration of Independence was held sacred by all, and\nthought to include all; but now, to aid in making the\nbondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed\nand sneered at and construed and hawked at and torn, till,\nif its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at\nall recognize it. All the powers of earth seem rapidly\ncombining against him. Mammon is after him, ambition\nfollows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the day fast\njoining the cry. They have him in his prison house; they\nhave searched his person, and left no prying instrument\nwith him. One after another they have closed the heavy iron\ndoors upon him; and now they have him, as it were, bolted\nin with a lock of hundred keys, which can never be\nunlocked without the concurrence of every key \u2014 the keys\nin the hands of a hundred di\ufb00erent men, and they scattered\nto hundred di\ufb00erent and distant places; and they stand\nmusing as to what invention, in all the dominions of mind\n and matter, can be produced to make the impossibility of\nhis escape more complete than it is.\nIt is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public\nestimate of the negro is more favorable now than it was at\nthe origin of the government.\nThree years and a half ago, Judge Douglas brought\nforward his famous Nebraska Bill. The country was at once\nin a blaze. He scorned all opposition, and carried it through\nCongress. Since then he has seen himself superseded in a\nPresidential nomination by one indorsing the general\ndoctrine of his measure, but at the same time standing\nclear of the odium of its untimely agitation and its gross\nbreach of national faith; and he has seen that successful\nrival constitutionally elected, not by the strength of friends,\nbut by the division of adversaries, being in a popular\nminority of nearly four hundred thousand votes. He has\nseen his chief aids in his own State, Shields and\nRichardson, \npolitically \nspeaking, \nsuccessively \ntried,\nconvicted, and executed for an o\ufb00ence not their own but\nhis. And now he sees his own case standing next on the\ndocket for trial.\nThere is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white\npeople at the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the\nwhite and black races; and Judge Douglas evidently is\nbasing his chief hope upon the chances of his being able to\nappropriate the bene\ufb01t of this disgust to himself. If he can,\nby much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of that\nidea upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle\nthrough the storm. He therefore clings to this hope, as a\n drowning man to the last plank. He makes an occasion for\nlugging it in from the opposition to the Dred Scott decision.\nHe \ufb01nds the Republicans insisting that the Declaration of\nIndependence includes all men, black as well as white, and\nforthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all,\nand proceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does,\ndo so only because they want to vote, and eat, and sleep,\nand marry with negroes. He will have it that they cannot be\nconsistent else. Now I protest against the counterfeit logic\nwhich concludes that, because I do not want a black woman\nfor a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. I need\nnot have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some\nrespects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural\nright to eat the bread she earns with her own hands,\nwithout asking leave of any one else, she is my equal and\nthe equal of all others.\nChief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case,\nadmits that the language of the Declaration is broad\nenough to include the whole human family, but he and\nJudge Douglas argue that the authors of that instrument\ndid not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did\nnot at once actually place them on an equality with the\nwhites. Now this grave argument comes to just nothing at\nall, by the other fact that they did not at once, or ever\nafterward, actually place all white people on an equality\nwith one another. And this is the staple argument of both\nthe Chief Justice and the Senator for doing this obvious\nviolence to the plain, unmistakable language of the\nDeclaration.\n I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to\ninclude all men, but they did not intend to declare all men\nequal in all respects. They did not mean to say all were\nequal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social\ncapacity. They de\ufb01ned with tolerable distinctness in what\nrespects they did consider all men created equal \u2014 equal\nwith \u201ccertain inalienable rights, among which are life,\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d This they said, and\nthis they meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious\nuntruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality,\nnor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon\nthem. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon.\nThey \nmeant \nsimply \nto \ndeclare \nthe \nright, \nso \nthat\nenforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances\nshould permit.\nThey meant to set up a standard maxim for free society,\nwhich should be familiar to all, and revered by all;\nconstantly looked to, constantly labored for, and, even\nthough never perfectly attained, constantly approximated,\nand thereby constantly spreading and deepening its\nin\ufb02uence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to\nall people of all colors everywhere. The assertion that \u201call\nmen are created equal\u201d was of no practical use in e\ufb00ecting\nour separation from Great Britain; and it was placed in the\nDeclaration not for that, but for future use. Its authors\nmeant it to be \u2014 as thank God, it is now proving itself \u2014\nstumbling-block to all those who in after times might seek\nto turn a free people back into the hateful paths of\ndespotism. They knew the proneness of prosperity to breed\n tyrants, and they meant when such should reappear in this\nfair land and commence their vocation, they should \ufb01nd left\nfor them at least one hard nut to crack.\nI have now brie\ufb02y expressed my view of the meaning and\nobject of that part of the Declaration of Independence\nwhich declares that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d\nNow let us hear Judge Douglas\u2019s view of the same\nsubject, as I \ufb01nd it in the printed report of his late speech.\nHere it is:\n\u201cNo man can vindicate the character, motives, and\nconduct of the signers of the Declaration of Independence,\nexcept upon the hypothesis that they referred to the white\nrace alone, and not to the African, when they declared all\nmen to have been created equal; that they were speaking of\nBritish subjects on this continent being equal to British\nsubjects born and residing in Great Britain; that they were\nentitled to the same inalienable rights, and among them\nwere enumerated life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nThe Declaration was adopted for the purpose of justifying\nthe colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in\nwithdrawing their allegiance from the British crown, and\ndissolving their connection with the mother country.\u201d\nMy good friends, read that carefully over some leisure\nhour, and ponder well upon it; see what a mere wreck \u2014\nmangled ruin \u2014 it makes of our once glorious Declaration.\n\u201cThey were speaking of British subjects on this continent\nbeing equal to British subjects born and residing in Great\nBritain\u201d! Why, according to this, not only negroes but white\npeople outside of Great Britain and America were not\n spoken of in that instrument. The English, Irish, and\nScotch, along with white Americans, were included, to be\nsure, but the French, Germans, and other white people of\nthe world are all gone to pot along with the Judge\u2019s inferior\nraces!\nI had thought the Declaration promised something better\nthan the condition of British subjects; but no, it only meant\nthat we should be equal to them in their own oppressed and\nunequal condition. According to that, it gave no promise\nthat, having kicked o\ufb00 the king and lords of Great Britain,\nwe should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of\nour own.\nI \nhad \nthought \nthe \nDeclaration \ncontemplated \nthe\nprogressive improvement in the condition of all men\neverywhere; but no, it merely \u201cwas adopted for the purpose\nof justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world\nin withdrawing their allegiance from the British crown, and\ndissolving their connection with the mother country.\u201d Why,\nthat object having been e\ufb00ected some eighty years ago, the\nDeclaration is of no practical use now \u2014 mere rubbish \u2014\nold wadding left to rot on the battle\ufb01eld after the victory is\nwon.\nI understand you are preparing to celebrate the\n\u201cFourth,\u201d to-morrow week. What for? The doings of that\nday had no reference to the present; and quite half of you\nare not even descendants of those who were referred to at\nthat day. But I suppose you will celebrate, and will even go\nso far as to read the Declaration. Suppose, after you read it\n once in the old-fashioned way, you read it once more with\nJudge Douglas\u2019s version. It will then run thus:\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all British\nsubjects who were on this continent eighty-one years ago\nwere created equal to all British subjects born and then\nresiding in Great Britain.\u201d\nAnd now I appeal to all \u2014 to Democrats as well as others\n\u2014 are you really willing that the Declaration shall thus be\nfrittered away? \u2014 thus left no more, at most, than an\ninteresting memorial of the dead past? \u2014 thus shorn of its\nvitality and practical value, and left without the germ or\neven the suggestion of the individual rights of man in it?\nBut Judge Douglas is especially horri\ufb01ed at the thought\nof the mixing of blood by the white and black races. Agreed\nfor once \u2014 a thousand times agreed. There are white men\nenough to marry all the white women and black men\nenough to many all the black women; and so let them be\nmarried. On this point we fully agree with the Judge, and\nwhen he shall show that his policy is better adapted to\nprevent amalgamation than ours, we shall drop ours and\nadopt his. Let us see. In  there were in the United\nStates , mulattoes. Very few of these are the\no\ufb00spring of whites and free blacks; nearly all have sprung\nfrom black slaves and white masters. A separation of the\nraces is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation; but as\nan immediate separation is impossible, the next best thing\nis to keep them apart where they are not already together.\nIf white and black people never get together in Kansas,\nthey will never mix blood in Kansas. That is at least one\n self-evident truth. A few free colored persons may get into\nthe free States, in any event; but their number is too\ninsigni\ufb01cant to amount to much in the way of mixing blood.\nIn  there were in the free States , mulattoes; but\nfor the most part they were not born there \u2014 they came\nfrom the slave States, ready made up. In the same year the\nslave States had , mulattoes, all of home production.\nThe proportion of free mulattoes to free blacks \u2014 the only\ncolored classes in the free States is much greater in the\nslave than in the free States. It is worthy of note, too, that\namong the free States those which make the colored man\nthe nearest equal to the white have proportionably the\nfewest mulattoes, the least of amalgamation. In New\nHampshire, the State which goes farthest toward equality\nbetween the races, there are just  mulattoes, while\nthere are in Virginia \u2014 how many do you think? \u2014 ,,\nbeing , more than in all the free States together.\nThese statistics show that slavery is the greatest source\nof amalgamation, and next to it, not the elevation, but the\ndegradation of the free blacks. Yet Judge Douglas dreads\nthe slightest restraints on the spread of slavery, and the\nslightest human recognition of the negro, as tending\nhorribly to amalgamation!\nThe very Dred Scott case a\ufb00ords a strong test as to\nwhich party most favors amalgamation, the Republicans or\nthe dear Union-saving Democracy. Dred Scott, his wife, and\ntwo daughters were all involved in the suit. We desired the\ncourt to have held that they were citizens so far at least as\nto entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were free or\n not; and then, also, that they were in fact and in law really\nfree. Could we have had our way, the chances of these\nblack girls ever mixing their blood with that of white people\nwould have been diminished at least to the extent that it\ncould not have been without their consent. But Judge\nDouglas is delighted to have them decided to be slaves, and\nnot human enough to have a hearing, even if they were\nfree, and thus left subject to the forced concubinage of\ntheir masters, and liable to become the mothers of\nmulattoes in spite of themselves: the very state of case that\nproduces nine tenths of all the mulattoes all the mixing of\nblood in the nation.\nOf course, I state this case as an illustration only, not\nmeaning to say or intimate that the master of Dred Scott\nand his family, or any more than a percentage of masters\ngenerally, are inclined to exercise this particular power\nwhich they hold over their female slaves.\nI have said that the separation of the races is the only\nperfect preventive of amalgamation. I have no right to say\nall the members of the Republican party are in favor of this,\nnor to say that as a party they are in favor of it. There is\nnothing in their platform directly on the subject. But I can\nsay a very large proportion of its members are for it, and\nthat the chief plank in their platform \u2014 opposition to the\nspread of slavery \u2014 is most favorable to that separation.\nSuch separation, if ever e\ufb00ected at all, must be e\ufb00ected\nby colonization; and no political party, as such, is now doing\nanything directly for colonization. Party operations at\npresent only favor or retard colonization incidentally. The\n enterprise is a di\ufb00icult one; but \u201cwhere there is a will there\nis a way,\u201d and what colonization needs most is a hearty will.\nWill springs from the two elements of moral sense and self-\ninterest. Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, and\nat the same time favorable to, or at least not against, our\ninterest to transfer the African to his native clime, and we\nshall \ufb01nd a way to do it, however great the task may be.\nThe children of Israel, to such numbers as to include four\nhundred thousand \ufb01ghting men, went out of Egyptian\nbondage in a body.\nHow di\ufb00erently the respective courses of the Democratic\nand Republican parties incidentally, bear on the question of\nforming a will \u2014 a public sentiment \u2014 for colonization, is\neasy to see. The Republicans inculcate, with whatever of\nability they can, that the negro is a man, that his bondage\nis cruelly wrong, and that the \ufb01eld of his oppression ought\nnot to be enlarged. The Democrats deny his manhood; deny,\nor dwarf to insigni\ufb01cance, the wrong of his bondage; so far\nas possible crush all sympathy for him, and cultivate and\nexcite hatred and disgust against him; compliment\nthemselves as Union-savers for doing so; and call the\ninde\ufb01nite outspreading of his bondage \u201ca sacred right of\nself-government.\u201d\nThe plainest print cannot be read through a gold eagle;\nand it will be ever hard to \ufb01nd many men who will send a\nslave to Liberia, and pay his passage, while they can send\nhim to a new country \u2014 Kansas, for instance \u2014 and sell him\nfor \ufb01fteen hundred dollars, and the rise.\n  \n \nI  IA\n \n I\n  .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, August, \nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th is received, and I am\nmuch obliged for the legal information you give.\nYou can scarcely be more anxious than I that the next\nelection in Iowa should result in favor of the Republicans. I\nlost nearly all the working part of last year, giving my time\nto the canvass; and I am altogether too poor to lose two\nyears together. I am engaged in a suit in the United States\nCourt at Chicago, in which the Rock Island Bridge\nCompany is a party. The trial is to commence on the th of\nSeptember, and probably will last two or three weeks.\nDuring the trial it is not improbable that all hands may\ncome over and take a look at the bridge, and, if it were\npossible to make it hit right, I could then speak at\nDavenport. My courts go right on without cessation till late\nin November. Write me again, pointing out the more\nstriking points of di\ufb00erence between your old and new\nconstitutions, and also whether Democratic and Republican\nparty lines were drawn in the adoption of it, and which\nwere for and which were against it. If, by possibility, I could\nget over among you it might be of some advantage to know\nthese things in advance.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n A \n \n  I\n  H   \n   I  A\n   I\n   A  .\n(From the Daily Press of Chicago, Sept. , .)\nHURD ET AL. vs Railroad Bridge Co.\nUnited \nStates \nCircuit \nCourt, \nHon. \nJohn \nMcLean,\nPresiding Judge.\nth day, Tuesday, Sept. , .\nMr. A. Lincoln addressed the jury. He said he did not\npurpose to assail anybody, that he expected to grow earnest\nas he proceeded but not ill-natured. \u201cThere is some con\ufb02ict\nof testimony in the case,\u201d he said, \u201cbut one quarter of such\na number of witnesses seldom agree, and even if all were\non one side some discrepancy might be expected. We are to\ntry and reconcile them, and to believe that they are not\nintentionally erroneous as long as we can.\u201d He had no\nprejudice, he said, against steamboats or steamboat men\nnor any against St. Louis, for he supposed they went about\nthis matter as other people would do in their situation. \u201cSt.\nLouis,\u201d he continued, \u201cas a commercial place may desire\nthat this bridge should not stand, as it is adverse to her\ncommerce, diverting a portion of it from the river; and it\nmay be that she supposes that the additional cost of\nrailroad transportation upon the productions of Iowa will\nforce them to go to St. Louis if this bridge is removed. The\nmeetings in St. Louis are connected with this case only as\n some witnesses are in it, and thus has some prejudice\nadded color to their testimony.\u201d The last thing that would\nbe pleasing to him, Mr. Lincoln said, would be to have one\nof these great channels, extending almost from where it\nnever freezes to where it never thaws, blocked up, but\nthere is a travel from east to west whose demands are not\nless important than those of the river. It is growing larger\nand larger, building up new countries with a rapidity never\nbefore seen in the history of the world. He alluded to the\nastonishing growth of Illinois, having grown within his\nmemory to a population of a million and a half; to Iowa and\nthe other young rising communities of the Northwest.\n\u201cThis current of travel,\u201d said he, \u201chas its rights as well as\nthat of north and south. If the river had not the advantage\nin priority and legislation we could enter into free\ncompetition with it and we could surpass it. This particular\nrailroad line has a great importance and the statement of\nits business during a little less than a year shows this\nimportance. It is in evidence that from September , ,\nto August , , , freight cars and ,\npassengers passed over this bridge. Navigation was closed\nfour days short of four months last year, and during this\ntime while the river was of no use this road and bridge\nwere valuable. There is, too, a considerable portion of time\nwhen \ufb02oating or thin ice makes the river useless while the\nbridge is as useful as ever. This shows that this bridge must\nbe treated with respect in this court and is not to be kicked\nabout with contempt. The other day Judge Wead alluded to\nthe strike of the contending interest and even a dissolution\n of the Union. The proper mode for all parties in this a\ufb00air is\nto \u2018live and let live,\u2019 and then we will \ufb01nd a cessation of this\ntrouble about the bridge. What mood were the steamboat\nmen in when this bridge was burned? Why, there was a\nshouting and ringing of bells and whistling on all the boats\nas it fell. It was a jubilee, a greater celebration than follows\nan excited election. The \ufb01rst thing I will proceed to is the\nrecord of Mr. Gurney and the complaint of Judge Wead that\nthe record did not extend back over all the time from the\ncompletion of the bridge. The principal part of the\nnavigation after the bridge was burned passed through the\nspan. When the bridge was repaired and the boats were a\nsecond time con\ufb01ned to the draw it was provided that this\nrecord should be kept. That is the simple history of that\nbook.\n\u201cFrom April th, , to May th \u2014 seventeen days \u2014\nthere were twenty accidents and all the time since then\nthere have been but twenty hits, including seven accidents,\nso that the dangers of this place are tapering o\ufb00 and as the\nboatmen get cool the accidents get less. We may soon\nexpect if this ratio is kept up that there will be no accidents\nat all.\n\u201cJudge Wead said, while admitting that the \ufb02oats went\nstraight through, there was a di\ufb00erence between a \ufb02oat\nand a boat, but I do not remember that he indulged us with\nan argument in support of this statement. Is it because\nthere is a di\ufb00erence in size? Will not a small body and a\nlarge one \ufb02oat the same way under the same in\ufb02uence?\nTrue a \ufb02atboat will \ufb02oat faster than an egg shell and the\n egg shell might be blown away by the wind, but if under\nthe same in\ufb02uence they would go the same way. Logs,\n\ufb02oats, boards, various things the witnesses say all show the\nsame current. Then is not this test reliable? At all depths\ntoo the direction of the current is the same. A series of\nthese \ufb02oats would make a line as long as a boat and would\nshow any in\ufb02uence upon any part and all parts of the boat.\n\u201cI will now speak of the angular position of the piers.\nWhat is the amount of the angle? The course of the river is\na curve and the pier is straight. If a line is produced from\nthe upper end of the long pier straight with the pier to a\ndistance of  feet, and a line is drawn from a point in the\nchannel opposite this point to the head of the pier, Colonel\nNason says they will form an angle of twenty degrees. But\nthe angle if measured at the pier is seven degrees; that is,\nwe would have to move the pier seven degrees to make it\nexactly straight with the current. Would that make the\nnavigation better or worse? The witnesses of the plainti\ufb00\nseem to think it was only necessary to say that the pier\nformed an angle with the current and that settled the\nmatter. Our more careful and accurate witnesses say that,\nthough they had been accustomed to seeing the piers\nplaced straight with the current, yet they could see that\nhere the current had been made straight by us in having\nmade this slight angle; that the water now runs just right,\nthat it is straight and cannot be improved. They think that\nif the pier was changed the eddy would be divided and the\nnavigation improved.\n \u201cI am not now going to discuss the question what is a\nmaterial obstruction. We do not greatly di\ufb00er about the law.\nThe cases produced here are, I suppose, proper to be taken\ninto consideration by the court in instructing a jury. Some\nof them I think are not exactly in point, but I am still willing\nto trust his honor, Judge McLean, and take his instructions\nas law. What is reasonable skill and care? This is a thing of\nwhich the jury are to judge. I di\ufb00er from the other side\nwhen it says that they are bound to exercise no more care\nthan was taken before the building of the bridge. If we are\nallowed by the Legislature to build the bridge which will\nrequire them to do more than before, when a pilot comes\nalong, it is unreasonable for him to dash on heedless of this\nstructure which has been legally put there. The Afton came\nthere on the th and lay at Rock Island until next morning.\nWhen a boat lies up the pilot has a holiday, and would not\nany of these jurors have then gone around to the bridge\nand gotten acquainted with the place? Pilot Parker has\nshown here that he does not understand the draw. I heard\nhim say that the fall from the head to the foot of the pier\nwas four feet; he needs information. He could have gone\nthere that day and seen there was no such fall. He should\nhave discarded passion and the chances are that he would\nhave had no disaster at all. He was bound to make himself\nacquainted with the place.\n\u201cMcCammon says that the current and the swell coming\nfrom the long pier drove her against the long pier. In other\nwords drove her toward the very pier from which the\ncurrent came! It is an absurdity, an impossibility. The only\n recollection I can \ufb01nd for this contradiction is in a current\nwhich White says strikes out from the long pier and then\nlike a ram\u2019s horn turns back, and this might have acted\nsomehow in this manner.\n\u201cIt is agreed by all that the plainti\ufb00\u2019s boat was destroyed\nand that it was destroyed upon the head of the short pier;\nthat she moved from the channel where she was with her\nbow above the head of the long pier, till she struck the\nshort one, swung around under the bridge and there was\ncrowded and destroyed.\n\u201cI shall try to prove that the average velocity of the\ncurrent through the draw with the boat in it should be \ufb01ve\nand a half miles an hour; that it is slowest at the head of\nthe pier and swiftest at the foot of the pier. Their lowest\nestimate in evidence is six miles an hour, their highest\ntwelve miles. This was the testimony of men who had made\nno experiment, only conjecture. We have adopted the most\nexact means. The water runs swiftest in high water and we\nhave taken the point of nine feet above low water. The\nwater when the Afton was lost was seven feet above low\nwater, or at least a foot lower than our time. Brayton and\nhis assistants timed the instruments, the best instruments\nknown in measuring currents. They timed them under\nvarious circumstances and they found the current \ufb01ve miles\nan hour and no more. They found that the water at the\nupper end ran slower than \ufb01ve miles; that below it was\nswifter than \ufb01ve miles, but that the average was \ufb01ve miles.\nShall men who have taken no care, who conjecture, some of\nwhom speak of twenty miles an hour, be believed against\n those who have had such a favorable and well improved\nopportunity? They should not even qualify the result.\nSeveral men have given their opinion as to the distance of\nthe steamboat Carson, and I suppose if one should go and\nmeasure that distance you would believe him in preference\nto all of them.\n\u201cThese measurements were made when the boat was not\nin the draw. It has been ascertained what is the area of the\ncross section of this stream and the area of the face of the\npiers, and the engineers say that the piers being put there\nwill increase the current proportionally as the space is\ndecreased. So with the boat in the draw. The depth of the\nchannel was twenty-two feet, the width one hundred and\nsixteen feet; multiply these and you have the square-feet\nacross the water of the draw, viz.:  feet. The Afton was\n feet wide and drew  feet, making a fourteenth of the\nsum. Now, one-fourteenth of \ufb01ve miles is \ufb01ve-fourteenths of\none mile \u2014 about one third of a mile \u2014 the increase of the\ncurrent. We will call the current \ufb01ve and a half miles per\nhour. The next thing I will try to prove is that the plainti\ufb00\u2019s\n(?) boat had power to run six miles an hour in that current.\nIt had been testi\ufb01ed that she was a strong, swift boat, able\nto run eight miles an hour up stream in a current of four\nmiles an hour, and \ufb01fteen miles down stream. Strike the\naverage and you will \ufb01nd what is her average \u2014 about\neleven and a half miles. Take the \ufb01ve and a half miles which\nis the speed of the current in the draw and it leaves the\npower of that boat in that draw at six miles an hour, \nfeet per minute and    feet to the second.\n \u201cNext I propose to show that there are no cross currents.\nI know their witnesses say that there are cross currents \u2014\nthat, as one witness says, there were three cross currents\nand two eddies; so far as mere statement, without\nexperiment, and mingled with mistakes, can go, they have\nproved. But can these men\u2019s testimony be compared with\nthe nice, exact, thorough experiments of our witnesses?\nCan you believe that these \ufb02oats go across the currents? It\nis inconceivable that they could not have discovered every\npossible current. How do boats \ufb01nd currents that \ufb02oats\ncannot discover? We assume the position then that those\ncross currents are not there. My next proposition is that\nthe Afton passed between the S. B. Carson and the Iowa\nshore. That is undisputed.\n\u201cNext I shall show that she struck \ufb01rst the short pier,\nthen the long pier, then the short one again and there she\nstopped.\u201d Mr. Lincoln then cited the testimony of eighteen\nwitnesses on this point.\n\u201cHow did the boat strike when she went in? Here is an\nendless variety of opinion. But ten of them say what pier\nshe struck; three of them testify that she struck \ufb01rst the\nshort, then the long and then the short for the last time.\nNone of the rest substantially contradict this. I assume that\nthese men have got the truth because I believe it an\nestablished fact. My next proposition is that after she\nstruck the short and long pier and before she got back to\nthe short pier the boat got right with her bow up. So says\nthe pilot Parker \u2014 that he got her through until her\nstarboard wheel passed the short pier. This would make her\n head about even with the head of the long pier. He says her\nhead was as high or higher than the head of the long pier.\nOther witnesses con\ufb01rmed this one. The \ufb01nal stroke was in\nthe splash door aft the wheel. Witnesses di\ufb00er, but the\nmajority say that she struck thus.\u201d\nCourt adjourned.\nth day, Wednesday, Sept. , .\nMr. A. LINCOLN resumed. He said he should conclude as\nsoon as possible. He said the colored map of the plainti\ufb00\nwhich was brought in during one stage of the trial showed\nitself that the cross currents alleged did not exist. That the\ncurrent as represented would drive an ascending boat to\nthe long pier but not to the short pier, as they urge. He\nexplained from a model of a boat where the splash door is,\njust behind the wheel. The boat struck on the lower\nshoulder of the short pier as she swung around in the\nsplash door; then as she went on around she struck the\npoint or end of the pier, where she rested. \u201cHer engineers,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Lincoln, \u201csay the starboard wheel then was\nrushing around rapidly. Then the boat must have struck the\nupper point of the pier so far back as not to disturb the\nwheel. It is forty feet from the stern of the Afton to the\nsplash door, and thus it appears that she had but forty feet\nto go to clear the pier. How was it that the Afton with all\nher power \ufb02anked over from the channel to the short pier\nwithout moving one foot ahead? Suppose she was in the\nmiddle of the draw, her wheel would have been  feet\nfrom the short pier. The reason she went over thus is her\nstarboard wheel was not working. I shall try to establish\n the fact that the wheel was not running and that after she\nstruck she went ahead strong on this same wheel. Upon the\nlast point the witnesses agree, that the starboard wheel\nwas running after she struck, and no witnesses say that it\nwas running while she was out in the draw \ufb02anking over.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln read from the testimonies of various\nwitnesses to prove that the starboard wheel was not\nworking while the Afton was out in the stream.\n\u201cOther witnesses show that the captain said something of\nthe machinery of the wheel, and the inference is that he\nknew the wheel was not working. The fact is undisputed\nthat she did not move one inch ahead while she was moving\nthis  feet sideways. There is evidence proving that the\ncurrent there is only \ufb01ve miles an hour, and the only\nexplanation is that her power was not all used \u2014 that only\none wheel was working. The pilot says he ordered the\nengineers to back her up. The engineers di\ufb00er from him\nand said they kept on going ahead. The bow was so swung\nthat the current pressed it over; the pilot pressed the stern\nover with the rudder, though not so fast but that the bow\ngained on it, and only one wheel being in motion the boat\nnearly stood still so far as motion up and down is\nconcerned, and thus she was thrown upon this pier. The\nAfton came into the draw after she had just passed the\nCarson, and as the Carson no doubt kept the true course\nthe Afton going around her got out of the proper way, got\nacross the current into the eddy which is west of a straight\nline drawn down from the long pier, was compelled to\nresort to these changes of wheels, which she did not do\n with su\ufb00icient adroitness to save her. Was it not her own\nfault that she entered wrong, so far wrong that she never\ngot right? Is the defence to blame for that?\n\u201cFor several days we were entertained with depositions\nabout boats \u2018smelling a bar.\u2019 Why did the Afton then, after\nshe had come up smelling so close to the long pier sheer o\ufb00\nso strangely. When she got to the centre of the very nose\nshe was smelling she seemed suddenly to have lost her\nsense of smell and to have \ufb02anked over to the short pier.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln said there was no practicability in the project\nof building a tunnel under the river, for there \u201cis not a\ntunnel that is a successful project in this world. A\nsuspension bridge cannot be built so high but that the\nchimneys of the boats will grow up till they cannot pass.\nThe steamboat men will take pains to make them grow. The\ncars of a railroad cannot without immense expense rise\nhigh enough to get even with a suspension bridge or go low\nenough to get through a tunnel; such expense is\nunreasonable.\n\u201cThe plainti\ufb00s have to establish that the bridge is a\nmaterial obstruction and that they have managed their boat\nwith reasonable care and skill. As to the last point high\nwinds have nothing to do with it, for it was not a windy day.\nThey must show due skill and care. Di\ufb00iculties going down\nstream will not do, for they were going up stream.\nDi\ufb00iculties with barges in tow have nothing to do with the\naccident, for they had no barge.\u201d Mr. Lincoln said he had\nmuch more to say, many things he could suggest to the jury,\nbut he wished to close to save time.\n  \n        . \n \nI .\nDEAR DUBOIS: \nBLOOMINGTON, DEC. , .\nJ. M. Douglas of the I. C. R. R. Co. is here and will carry\nthis letter.

I really wish you could consent to this.\nDouglas says they cannot pay more, and I believe him.\nI do not write this as a lawyer seeking an advantage for a\nclient; but only as a friend, only urging you to do what I\nthink I would do if I were in your situation.

WHITNEY, ESQ.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Coming home from Bloomington last\nnight I found your letter of the th.\nI know of no express statute or decisions as to what a J. P.\nupon the expiration of his term shall do with his docket\nbooks, papers, un\ufb01nished business, etc., but so far as I\nknow, the practice has been to hand over to the successor,\nand to cease to do anything further whatever, in perfect\nanalogy to Sections  and , and I have supposed and\ndo suppose this is the law. I think the successor may\nforthwith do whatever the retiring J. P. might have done. As\nto the proviso to Section  I think it was put in to cover\npossible cases, by way of caution, and not to authorize the\nJ. P. to go forward and \ufb01nish up whatever might have been\nbegun by him.\nThe view I take, I believe, is the Common law principle,\nas to retiring o\ufb00icers and their successors, to which I\nremember but one exception, which is the case of Sheri\ufb00\nand ministerial o\ufb00icers of that class.\nI have not had time to examine this subject fully, but I\nhave great con\ufb01dence I am right. You must not think of\no\ufb00ering me pay for this.\n Mr. John O. Johnson is my friend; I gave your name to\nhim. He is doing the work of trying to get up a Republican\norganization. I do not suppose \u201cLong John\u201d ever saw or\nheard of him. Let me say to you con\ufb01dentially, that I do not\nentirely appreciate what the Republican papers of Chicago\nare so constantly saying against \u201cLong John.\u201d I consider\nthose papers truly devoted to the Republican cause, and\nnot unfriendly to me; but I do think that more of what they\nsay against \u201cLong John\u201d is dictated by personal malice than\nthemselves are conscious of. We can not a\ufb00ord to lose the\nservices of \u201cLong John\u201d and I do believe the unrelenting\nwarfare made upon him is injuring our cause. I mean this to\nbe con\ufb01dential.\nIf you quietly co-operate with Mr. J. O. Johnson on getting\nup an organization, I think it will be right.\nYour friend as ever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n   I\n \n \n A\n \n A   \n  H \n  A    A\n HA     \n       \n            .\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 It will be very di\ufb00icult\nfor an audience so large as this to hear distinctly what a\nspeaker says, and consequently it is important that as\nprofound silence be preserved as possible.\nWhile I was at the hotel to-day, an elderly gentleman\ncalled upon me to know whether I was really in favor of\nproducing a perfect equality between the negroes and\nwhite people. While I had not proposed to myself on this\noccasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question\nwas asked me I thought I would occupy perhaps \ufb01ve\nminutes in saying something in regard to it. I will say, then,\nthat I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing\nabout in any way the social and political equality of the\nwhite and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in\nfavor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of\nqualifying them to hold o\ufb00ice, nor to intermarry with white\npeople; and I will say, in addition to this, that there is a\nphysical di\ufb00erence between the white and black races\nwhich I believe will forever forbid the two races living\ntogether on terms of social and political equality. And in as\nmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together\nthere must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as\nmuch as any other man am in favor of having the superior\n position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion\nI do not perceive that because the white man is to have the\nsuperior position the negro should be denied everything. I\ndo not understand that because I do not want a negro\nwoman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife.\nMy understanding is that I can just let her alone. I am now\nin my \ufb01ftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black\nwoman for either a slave or a wife. So it seems to me quite\npossible for us to get along without making either slaves or\nwives of negroes. I will add to this that I have never seen,\nto my knowledge, a man, woman, or child who was in favor\nof producing a perfect equality, social and political,\nbetween negroes and white men. I recollect of but one\ndistinguished instance that I ever heard of so frequently as\nto be entirely satis\ufb01ed of its correctness, and that is the\ncase of Judge Douglas\u2019s old friend Colonel Richard M.\nJohnson. I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I\nam not going to enter at large upon this subject), that I\nhave never had the least apprehension that I or my friends\nwould marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from\nit; but as Judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great\napprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep\nthem from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will\nto the very last stand by the law of this State which forbids\nthe marrying of white people with negroes. I will add one\nfurther word, which is this: that I do not understand that\nthere is any place where an alteration of the social and\npolitical relations of the negro and the white man can be\nmade, except in the State Legislature, \u2014 not in the\n Congress of the United States; and as I do not really\napprehend the approach of any such thing myself, and as\nJudge Douglas seems to be in constant horror that some\nsuch danger is rapidly approaching, I propose as the best\nmeans to prevent it that the Judge be kept at home, and\nplaced in the State Legislature to \ufb01ght the measure. I do\nnot propose dwelling longer at this time on this subject.\nWhen Judge Trumbull, our other Senator in Congress,\nreturned to Illinois in the month of August, he made a\nspeech at Chicago, in which he made what may be called a\ncharge against Judge Douglas, which I understand proved\nto be very o\ufb00ensive to him. The Judge was at that time out\nupon one of his speaking tours through the country, and\nwhen the news of it reached him, as I am informed, he\ndenounced Judge Trumbull in rather harsh terms for having\nsaid what he did in regard to that matter. I was traveling at\nthat time, and speaking at the same places with Judge\nDouglas on subsequent days, and when I heard of what\nJudge Trumbull had said of Douglas, and what Douglas had\nsaid back again, I felt that I was in a position where I could\nnot remain entirely silent in regard to the matter.\nConsequently, upon two or three occasions I alluded to it,\nand alluded to it in no other wise than to say that in regard\nto the charge brought by Trumbull against Douglas, I\npersonally knew nothing, and sought to say nothing about\nit; that I did personally know Judge Trumbull; that I\nbelieved him to be a man of veracity; that I believed him to\nbe a man of capacity su\ufb00icient to know very well whether\nan assertion he was making, as a conclusion drawn from a\n set of facts, was true or false; and as a conclusion of my\nown from that, I stated it as my belief if Trumbull should\never be called upon, he would prove everything he had\nsaid. I said this upon two or three occasions. Upon a\nsubsequent occasion, Judge Trumbull spoke again before\nan audience at Alton, and upon that occasion not only\nrepeated his charge against Douglas, but arrayed the\nevidence he relied upon to substantiate it. This speech was\npublished at length; and subsequently at Jacksonville Judge\nDouglas alluded to the matter. In the course of his speech,\nand near the close of it, he stated in regard to myself what I\nwill now read:\n\u201cJudge Douglas proceeded to remark that he should not\nhereafter occupy his time in refuting such charges made by\nTrumbull, but that, Lincoln having indorsed the character\nof Trumbull for veracity, he should hold him (Lincoln)\nresponsible for the slanders.\u201d\nI have done simply what I have told you, to subject me to\nthis invitation to notice the charge. I now wish to say that it\nhad not originally been my purpose to discuss that matter\nat all But in-as-much as it seems to be the wish of Judge\nDouglas to hold me responsible for it, then for once in my\nlife I will play General Jackson, and to the just extent I take\nthe responsibility.\nI wish to say at the beginning that I will hand to the\nreporters that portion of Judge Trumbull\u2019s Alton speech\nwhich was devoted to this matter, and also that portion of\nJudge Douglas\u2019s speech made at Jacksonville in answer to\nit. I shall thereby furnish the readers of this debate with the\n complete discussion between Trumbull and Douglas. I\ncannot now read them, for the reason that it would take\nhalf of my \ufb01rst hour to do so. I can only make some\ncomments upon them. Trumbull\u2019s charge is in the following\nwords:\n\u201cNow, the charge is, that there was a plot entered into to\nhave a constitution formed for Kansas, and put in force,\nwithout giving the people an opportunity to vote upon it,\nand that Mr. Douglas was in the plot.\u201d\nI will state, without quoting further, for all will have an\nopportunity of reading it hereafter, that Judge Trumbull\nbrings forward what he regards as su\ufb00icient evidence to\nsubstantiate this charge.\nIt will be perceived Judge Trumbull shows that Senator\nBigler, upon the \ufb02oor of the Senate, had declared there had\nbeen \na \nconference \namong \nthe \nsenators, \nin \nwhich\nconference it was determined to have an enabling act\npassed for the people of Kansas to form a constitution\nunder, and in this conference it was agreed among them\nthat it was best not to have a provision for submitting the\nconstitution to a vote of the people after it should be\nformed. He then brings forward to show, and showing, as\nhe deemed, that Judge Douglas reported the bill back to the\nSenate with that clause stricken out. He then shows that\nthere was a new clause inserted into the bill, which would\nin its nature prevent a reference of the constitution back\nfor a vote of the people, \u2014 if, indeed, upon a mere silence\nin the law, it could be assumed that they had the right to\n vote upon it. These are the general statements that he has\nmade.\nI propose to examine the points in Judge Douglas\u2019s\nspeech in which he attempts to answer that speech of\nJudge Trumbull\u2019s. When you come to examine Judge\nDouglas\u2019s speech, you will \ufb01nd that the \ufb01rst point he makes\nis:\n\u201cSuppose it were true that there was such a change in\nthe bill, and that I struck it out, \u2014 is that a proof of a plot to\nforce a constitution upon them against their will?\u201d\nHis striking out such a provision, if there was such a one\nin the bill, he argues, does not establish the proof that it\nwas stricken out for the purpose of robbing the people of\nthat right. I would say, in the \ufb01rst place, that that would be\na most manifest reason for it. It is true, as Judge Douglas\nstates, that many Territorial bills have passed without\nhaving such a provision in them. I believe it is true, though\nI am not certain, that in some instances constitutions\nframed under such bills have been submitted to a vote of\nthe people with the law silent upon the subject; but it does\nnot appear that they once had their enabling acts framed\nwith an express provision for submitting the constitution to\nbe framed to a vote of the people, then that they were\nstricken out when Congress did not mean to alter the e\ufb00ect\nof the law. That there have been bills which never had the\nprovision in, I do not question; but when was that provision\ntaken out of one that it was in? More especially does the\nevidence tend to prove the proposition that Trumbull\nadvanced, when we remember that the provision was\n stricken out of the bill almost simultaneously with the time\nthat Bigler says there was a conference among certain\nsenators, and in which it was agreed that a bill should be\npassed leaving that out. Judge Douglas, in answering\nTrumbull, omits to attend to the testimony of Bigler, that\nthere was a meeting in which it was agreed they should so\nframe the bill that there should be no submission of the\nconstitution to a vote of the people. The Judge does not\nnotice this part of it. If you take this as one piece of\nevidence, and then ascertain that simultaneously Judge\nDouglas struck out a provision that did require it to be\nsubmitted, and put the two together, I think it will make a\npretty fair show of proof that Judge Douglas did, as\nTrumbull says, enter into a plot to put in force a\nconstitution for Kansas, without giving the people any\nopportunity of voting upon it.\nBut I must hurry on. The next proposition that Judge\nDouglas puts is this:\n\u201cBut upon examination it turns out that the Toombs bill\nnever did contain a clause requiring the constitution to be\nsubmitted.\u201d\nThis is a mere question of fact, and can be determined by\nevidence. I only want to ask this question: Why did not\nJudge Douglas say that these words were not stricken out\nof the Toomb\u2019s bill, or this bill from which it is alleged the\nprovision was stricken out, \u2014 a bill which goes by the name\nof Toomb\u2019s, because he originally brought it forward? I ask\nwhy, if the Judge wanted to make a direct issue with\nTrumbull, did he not take the exact proposition Trumbull\n made in his speech, and say it was not stricken out?\nTrumbull has given the exact words that he says were in\nthe Toomb\u2019s bill, and he alleges that when the bill came\nback, they were stricken out. Judge Douglas does not say\nthat the words which Trumbull says were stricken out were\nnot so stricken out, but he says there was no provision in\nthe Toomb\u2019s bill to submit the constitution to a vote of the\npeople. We see at once that he is merely making an issue\nupon the meaning of the words. He has not undertaken to\nsay that Trumbull tells a lie about these words being\nstricken out, but he is really, when pushed up to it, only\ntaking an issue upon the meaning of the words. Now, then,\nif there be any issue upon the meaning of the words, or if\nthere be upon the question of fact as to whether these\nwords were stricken out, I have before me what I suppose\nto be a genuine copy of the Toomb\u2019s bill, in which it can be\nshown that the words Trumbull says were in it were, in\nfact, originally there. If there be any dispute upon the fact,\nI have got the documents here to show they were there. If\nthere be any controversy upon the sense of the words, \u2014\nwhether these words which were stricken out really\nconstituted a provision for submitting the matter to a vote\nof the people, \u2014 as that is a matter of argument, I think I\nmay as well use Trumbull\u2019s own argument. He says that the\nproposition is in these words:\n\u201cThat the following propositions be and the same are\nhereby o\ufb00ered to the said Convention of the people of\nKansas when formed, for their free acceptance or rejection;\nwhich, if accepted by the Convention and rati\ufb01ed by the\n people at the election for the adoption of the constitution,\nshall be obligatory upon the United States and the said\nState of Kansas.\u201d\nNow, Trumbull alleges that these last words were\nstricken out of the bill when it came back, and he says this\nwas a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of\nthe people; and his argument is this:\n\u201cWould it have been possible to ratify the land\npropositions at the election for the adoption of the\nconstitution, unless such an election was to be held?\u201d\nThis is Trumbull\u2019s argument. Now, Judge Douglas does\nnot meet the charge at all, but he stands up and says there\nwas no such proposition in that bill for submitting the\nconstitution to be framed to a vote of the people. Trumbull\nadmits that the language is not a direct provision for\nsubmitting it, but it is a provision necessarily implied from\nanother provision. He asks you how it is possible to ratify\nthe land proposition at the election for the adoption of the\nconstitution, if there was no election to be held for the\nadoption of the constitution. And he goes on to show that it\nis not any less a law because the provision is put in that\nindirect shape than it would be if it were put directly. But I\npresume I have said enough to draw attention to this point,\nand I pass it by also.\nAnother one of the points that Judge Douglas makes upon\nTrumbull, and at very great length, is, that Trumbull, while\nthe bill was pending, said in a speech in the Senate that he\nsupposed the constitution to be made would have to be\nsubmitted to the people. He asks, if Trumbull thought so\n then, what ground is there for anybody thinking otherwise\nnow? Fellow-citizens, this much may be said in reply: That\nbill had been in the hands of a party to which Trumbull did\nnot belong. It had been in the hands of the committee at\nthe head of which Judge Douglas stood. Trumbull perhaps\nhad a printed copy of the original Toomb\u2019s bill. I have not\nthe evidence on that point except a sort of inference I draw\nfrom \nthe \ngeneral \ncourse \nof \nbusiness \nthere. \nWhat\nalterations, or what provisions in the way of altering, were\ngoing on in committee, Trumbull had no means of knowing,\nuntil the altered bill was reported back. Soon afterwards,\nwhen it was reported back, there was a discussion over it,\nand perhaps Trumbull in reading it hastily in the altered\nform did not perceive all the bearings of the alterations. He\nwas hastily borne into the debate, and it does not follow\nthat because there was something in it Trumbull did not\nperceive, that something did not exist. More than this, is it\ntrue that what Trumbull did can have any e\ufb00ect on what\nDouglas did? Suppose Trumbull had been in the plot with\nthese other men, would that let Douglas out of it? Would it\nexonerate Douglas that Trumbull did n\u2019t then perceive he\nwas in the plot? He also asks the question: Why did n\u2019t\nTrumbull propose to amend the bill, if he thought it needed\nany amendment? Why, I believe that everything Judge\nTrumbull had proposed, particularly in connection with this\nquestion of Kansas and Nebraska, since he had been on the\n\ufb02oor of the Senate, had been promptly voted down by\nJudge Douglas and his friends. He had no promise that an\namendment o\ufb00ered by him to anything on this subject\n would receive the slightest consideration. Judge Trumbull\ndid bring to the notice of the Senate at that time the fact\nthat there was no provision for submitting the constitution\nabout to be made for the people of Kansas to a vote of the\npeople. I believe I may venture to say that Judge Douglas\nmade some reply to this speech of Judge Trumbull\u2019s, but he\nnever noticed that part of it at all. And so the thing passed\nby. I think, then, the fact that Judge Trumbull o\ufb00ered no\namendment does not throw much blame upon him; and if it\ndid, it does not reach the question of fact as to what Judge\nDouglas was doing. I repeat, that if Trumbull had himself\nbeen in the plot, it would not at all relieve the others who\nwere in it from blame. If I should be indicted for murder,\nand upon the trial it should be discovered that I had been\nimplicated in that murder, but that the prosecuting witness\nwas guilty too, that would not at all touch the question of\nmy crime. It would be no relief to my neck that they\ndiscovered this other man who charged the crime upon me\nto be guilty too.\nAnother one of the points Judge Douglas makes upon\nJudge Trumbull is, that when he spoke in Chicago he made\nhis charge to rest upon the fact that the bill had the\nprovision in it for submitting the constitution to a vote of\nthe people when it went into his Judge Douglas\u2019s hands,\nthat it was missing when he reported it to the Senate, and\nthat in a public speech he had subsequently said the\nalterations in the bill were made while it was in committee,\nand that they were made in consultation between him\n(Judge Douglas) and Toomb\u2019s. And Judge Douglas goes on\n to comment upon the fact of Trumbull\u2019s adducing in his\nAlton speech the proposition that the bill not only came\nback with that proposition stricken out, but with another\nclause and another provision in it, saying that \u201cuntil the\ncomplete execution of this Act there shall be no election in\nsaid Territory,\u201d \u2014 which, Trumbull argued, was not only\ntaking the provision for submitting to a vote of the people\nout of the bill, but was adding an a\ufb00irmative one, in that it\nprevented the people from exercising the right under a bill\nthat was merely silent on the question. Now, in regard to\nwhat he says, that Trumbull shifts the issue, that he shifts\nhis ground, \u2014 and I believe he uses the term that, \u201cit being\nproven false, he has changed ground,\u201d I call upon all of\nyou, when you come to examine that portion of Trumbull\u2019s\nspeech (for it will make a part of mine), to examine whether\nTrumbull has shifted his ground or not. I say he did not\nshift his ground, but that he brought forward his original\ncharge and the evidence to sustain it yet more fully, but\nprecisely as he originally made it. Then, in addition thereto,\nhe brought in a new piece of evidence. He shifted no\nground. He brought no new piece of evidence inconsistent\nwith his former testimony; but he brought a new piece,\ntending, as he thought, and as I think, to prove his\nproposition. To illustrate: A man brings an accusation\nagainst another, and on trial the man making the charge\nintroduces A and B to prove the accusation. At a second\ntrial he introduces the same witnesses, who tell the same\nstory as before, and a third witness, who tells the same\nthing, and in addition gives further testimony corroborative\n of the charge. So with Trumbull. There was no shifting of\nground, nor inconsistency of testimony between the new\npiece of evidence and what he originally introduced.\nBut Judge Douglas says that he himself moved to strike\nout that last provision of the bill, and that on his motion it\nwas stricken out and a substitute inserted. That I presume\nis the truth. I presume it is true that that last proposition\nwas stricken out by Judge Douglas. Trumbull has not said it\nwas not; Trumbull has himself said that it was so stricken\nout. He says: \u201cI am now speaking of the bill as Judge\nDouglas reported it back. It was amended somewhat in the\nSenate before it passed, but I am speaking of it as he\nbrought it back.\u201d Now, when Judge Douglas parades the\nfact that the provision was stricken out of the bill when it\ncame back, he asserts nothing contrary to what Trumbull\nalleges. Trumbull has only said that he originally put it in,\nnot that he did not strike it out. Trumbull says it was not in\nthe bill when it went to the committee. When it came back\nit was in, and Judge Douglas said the alterations were made\nby him in consultation with Toomb\u2019s. Trumbull alleges,\ntherefore, as his conclusion, that Judge Douglas put it in.\nThen, if Douglas wants to contradict Trumbull and call him\na liar, let him say he did not put it in, and not that he did n\u2019t\ntake it out again. It is said that a bear is sometimes hard\nenough pushed to drop a cub; and so I presume it was in\nthis case. I presume the truth is that Douglas put it in, and\nafterward took it out. That, I take it, is the truth about it.\nJudge Trumbull says one thing, Douglas says another thing,\nand the two don\u2019t contradict one another at all. The\n question is, what did he put it in for? In the \ufb01rst place,\nwhat did he take the other provision out of the bill for, \u2014\nthe provision which Trumbull argued was necessary for\nsubmitting the constitution to a vote of the people? What\ndid he take that out for; and, having taken it out, what did\nhe put this in for? I say that in the run of things it is not\nunlikely forces conspire to render it vastly expedient for\nJudge Douglas to take that latter clause out again. The\nquestion that Trumbull has made is that Judge Douglas put\nit in; and he don\u2019t meet Trumbull at all unless he denies\nthat.\nIn the clause of Judge Douglas\u2019s speech upon this subject\nhe uses this language toward Judge Trumbull. He says:\n\u201cHe forges his evidence from beginning to end; and by\nfalsifying the record, he endeavors to bolster up his false\ncharge.\u201d\nWell, that is a pretty serious statement \u2014 Trumbull\nforges his evidence from beginning to end. Now, upon my\nown authority I say that it is not true. What is a forgery?\nConsider the evidence that Trumbull has brought forward.\nWhen you come to read the speech, as you will be able to,\nexamine whether the evidence is a forgery from beginning\nto end. He had the bill or document in his hand like that\n[holding up a paper]. He says that is a copy of the Toomb\u2019s\nbill, \u2014 the amendment o\ufb00ered by Toomb\u2019s. He says that is a\ncopy of the bill as it was introduced and went into Judge\nDouglas\u2019s hands. Now, does Judge Douglas say that is a\nforgery? That is one thing Trumbull brought forward. Judge\nDouglas says he forged it from beginning to end! That is\n the \u201cbeginning,\u201d we will say. Does Douglas say that is a\nforgery? Let him say it to-day, and we will have a\nsubsequent examination upon this subject. Trumbull then\nholds up another document like this, and says that is an\nexact copy of the bill as it came back in the amended form\nout of Judge Douglas\u2019s hands. Does Judge Douglas say that\nis a forgery? Does he say it in his general sweeping charge?\nDoes he say so now? If he does not, then take this Toomb\u2019s\nbill and the bill in the amended form, and it only needs to\ncompare them to see that the provision is in the one and\nnot in the other; it leaves the inference inevitable that it\nwas taken out.\nBut, while I am dealing with this question, let us see\nwhat Trumbull\u2019s other evidence is. One other piece of\nevidence I will read. Trumbull says there are in this original\nToomb\u2019s bill these words:\n\u201cThat the following propositions be and the same are\nhereby o\ufb00ered to the said Convention of the people of\nKansas, when formed, for their free acceptance or\nrejection; which, if accepted by the Convention and rati\ufb01ed\nby the people at the election for the adoption of the\nconstitution, shall be obligatory upon the United States and\nthe said State of Kansas.\u201d\nNow, if it is said that this is a forgery, we will open the\npaper here and see whether it is or not. Again, Trumbull\nsays, as he goes along, that Mr. Bigler made the following\nstatement in his place in the Senate, December , :\n\u201cI was present when that subject was discussed by\nsenators before the bill was introduced, and the question\n was raised and discussed, whether the constitution, when\nformed, should be submitted to a vote of the people. It was\nheld by those most intelligent on the subject that, in view of\nall the di\ufb00iculties surrounding that Territory, the danger of\nany experiment at that time of a popular vote, it would be\nbetter there should be no such provision in the Toomb\u2019s\nbill; and it was my understanding, in all the intercourse I\nhad, that the Convention would make a constitution, and\nsend it here, without submitting it to the popular vote.\u201d\nThen Trumbull follows on:\n\u201cIn speaking of this meeting again on the st December,\n [Congressional Globe, same vol., page ], Senator\nBigler said:\n\u201c\u2018Nothing was further from my mind than to allude to\nany social or con\ufb01dential interview. The meeting was not of\nthat character. Indeed, it was semi-o\ufb00icial, and called to\npromote the public good. My recollection was clear that I\nleft the conference under the impression that it had been\ndeemed best to adopt measures to admit Kansas as a State\nthrough the agency of one popular election, and that for\ndelegates to this Convention. This impression was stronger\nbecause I thought the spirit of the bill infringed upon the\ndoctrine of non-intervention, to which I had great aversion;\nbut with the hope of accomplishing a great good, and as no\nmovement had been made in that direction in the Territory,\nI waived this objection, and concluded to support the\nmeasure. I have a few items of testimony as to the\ncorrectness of these impressions, and with their submission\nI shall be content. I have before me the bill reported by the\n senator from Illinois on the th of March, , providing\nfor the admission of Kansas as a State, the third section of\nwhich reads as follows:\n\u201cThat the following propositions be, and the same are\nhereby o\ufb00ered to the said Convention of the people of\nKansas, when formed, for their free acceptance or\nrejection; which, if accepted by the Convention and rati\ufb01ed\nby the people at the election for the adoption of the\nconstitution, shall be obligatory upon the United States and\nthe said State of Kansas.\u201d\nThe bill read in his place by the senator from Georgia on\nthe th of June, and referred to the Committee on\nTerritories, contained the same section word for word. Both\nthese bills were under consideration at the conference\nreferred to; but, sir, when the senator from Illinois reported\nthe Toombs bill to the Senate with amendments, the next\nmorning, it did not contain that portion of the third section\nwhich indicated to the Convention that the constitution\nshould be approved by the people. The words \u201cand rati\ufb01ed\nby the people at the election for the adoption of the\nconstitution\u201d had been stricken out.\nNow, these things Trumbull says were stated by Bigler\nupon the \ufb02oor of the Senate on certain days, and that they\nare recorded in the Congressional Globe on certain pages.\nDoes Judge Douglas say this is a forgery? Does he say there\nis no such thing in the Congressional Globe? What does he\nmean when he says Judge Trumbull forges his evidence\nfrom beginning to end? So again he says in another place\n that Judge Douglas, in his speech, December , \n(Congressional Globe, part I., page ), stated:\n\u201cThat during the last session of Congress, I [Mr. Douglas]\nreported a bill from the Committee on Territories, to\nauthorize the people of Kansas to assemble and form a\nconstitution for themselves. Subsequently the senator from\nGeorgia [Mr. Toombs] brought forward a substitute for my\nbill, which, after having been modi\ufb01ed by him and myself in\nconsultation, was passed by the Senate.\u201d\nNow, Trumbull says this is a quotation from a speech of\nDouglas, and is recorded in the Congressional Globe. Is it a\nforgery? Is it there or not? It may not be there, but I want\nthe Judge to take these pieces of evidence, and distinctly\nsay they are forgeries if he dare do it.\n[A voice: \u201cHe will.\u201d]\nWell, sir, you had better not commit him. He gives other\nquotations, \u2014 another from Judge Douglas. He says:\n\u201cI will ask the senator to show me an intimation, from\nany one member of the Senate, in the whole debate on the\nToombs bill, and in the Union, from any quarter, that the\nconstitution was not to be submitted to the people. I will\nventure to say that on all sides of the chamber it was so\nunderstood at the time. If the opponents of the bill had\nunderstood it was not, they would have made the point on\nit; and if they had made it, we should certainly have yielded\nto it, and put in the clause. That is a discovery made since\nthe President found out that it was not safe to take it for\ngranted that that would be done, which ought in fairness to\nhave been done.\u201d\n Judge Trumbull says Douglas made that speech, and it is\nrecorded. Does Judge Douglas say it is a forgery, and was\nnot true? Trumbull says somewhere, and I propose to skip\nit, but it will be found by any one who will read this debate,\nthat he did distinctly bring it to the notice of those who\nwere engineering the bill, that it lacked that provision; and\nthen he goes on to give another quotation from Judge\nDouglas, where Judge Trumbull uses this language:\n\u201cJudge Douglas, however, on the same day and in the\nsame debate, probably recollecting or being reminded of\nthe fact that I had objected to the Toombs bill when\npending that it did not provide for a submission of the\nconstitution to the people, made another statement, which\nis to be found in the same volume of the Globe, page , in\nwhich he says: \u2018That the bill was silent on this subject was\ntrue, and my attention was called to that about the time it\nwas passed; and I took the fair construction to be, that\npowers not delegated were reserved, and that of course the\nconstitution would be submitted to the people.\u2019\n\u201cWhether this statement is consistent with the statement\njust before made, that had the point been made it would\nhave been yielded to, or that it was a new discovery, you\nwill determine.\u201d\nSo I say. I do not know whether Judge Douglas will\ndispute this, and yet maintain his position that Trumbull\u2019s\nevidence \u201cwas forged from beginning to end.\u201d I will remark\nthat I have not got these Congressional Globes with me.\nThey are large books, and di\ufb00icult to carry about, and if\nJudge Douglas shall say that on these points where\n Trumbull has quoted from them there are no such passages\nthere, I shall not be able to prove they are there upon this\noccasion, but I will have another chance. Whenever he\npoints out the forgery and says, \u201cI declare that this\nparticular thing which Trumbull has uttered is not to be\nfound where he says it is,\u201d then my attention will be drawn\nto that, and I will arm myself for the contest, stating now\nthat I have not the slightest doubt on earth that I will \ufb01nd\nevery quotation just where Trumbull says it is. Then the\nquestion is, How can Douglas call that a forgery? How can\nhe make out that it is a forgery? What is a forgery? It is the\nbringing forward something in writing or in print\npurporting to be of certain e\ufb00ect when it is altogether\nuntrue. If you come forward with my note for one hundred\ndollars when I have never given such a note, there is a\nforgery. If you come forward with a letter purporting to be\nwritten by me which I never wrote, there is another\nforgery. If you produce anything in writing or in print\nsaying it is so and so, the document not being genuine, a\nforgery has been committed. How do you make this forgery\nwhen every piece of the evidence is genuine? If Judge\nDouglas does say these documents and quotations are false\nand forged, he has a full right to do so; but until he does it\nspeci\ufb01cally, we don\u2019t know how to get at him. If he does say\nthey are false and forged, I will then look further into it,\nand presume I can procure the certi\ufb01cates of the proper\no\ufb00icers that they are genuine copies. I have no doubt each\nof these extracts will be found exactly where Trumbull says\nit is. Then I leave it to you if Judge Douglas, in making his\n sweeping charge that Judge Trumbull\u2019s evidence is forged\nfrom beginning to end, at all meets the case, \u2014 if that is the\nway to get at the facts. I repeat again, if he will point out\nwhich one is a forgery, I will carefully examine it, and if it\nproves that any one of them is really a forgery, it will not be\nme who will hold to it any longer. I have always wanted to\ndeal with everyone I meet candidly and honestly. If I have\nmade any assertion not warranted by facts, and it is\npointed out to me, I will withdraw it cheerfully. But I do not\nchoose to see Judge Trumbull calumniated, and the\nevidence he has brought forward branded in general terms\n\u201ca forgery from beginning to end.\u201d This is not the legal way\nof meeting a charge, and I submit it to all intelligent\npersons, both friends of Judge Douglas and of myself,\nwhether it is.\nThe point upon Judge Douglas is this: The bill that went\ninto his hands had the provision in it for a submission of the\nconstitution to the people; and I say its language amounts\nto an express provision for a submission, and that he took\nthe provision out. He says it was known that the bill was\nsilent in this particular; but I say, Judge Douglas, it was not\nsilent when you got it. It was vocal with the declaration,\nwhen you got it, for a submission of the constitution to the\npeople. And now, my direct question to Judge Douglas is, to\nanswer why, if he deemed the bill silent on this point, he\nfound it necessary to strike out those particular harmless\nwords. If he had found the bill silent and without this\nprovision, he might say what he does now. If he supposes it\nwas implied that the constitution would be submitted to a\n vote of the people, how could these two lines so encumber\nthe statute as to make it necessary to strike them out? How\ncould he infer that a submission was still implied, after its\nexpress provision had been stricken from the bill? I \ufb01nd the\nbill vocal with the provision, while he silenced it. He took it\nout, and although he took out the other provision\npreventing a submission to a vote of the people, I ask, Why\ndid you \ufb01rst put it in? I ask him whether he took the\noriginal provision out, which Trumbull alleges was in the\nbill. If he admits that he did take it, I ask him what he did it\nfor. It looks to us as if he had altered the bill. If it looks\ndi\ufb00erently to him, \u2014 if he has a di\ufb00erent reason for his\naction from the one we assign him \u2014 he can tell it. I insist\nupon knowing why he made the bill silent upon that point\nwhen it was vocal before he put his hands upon it.\nI was told, before my last paragraph, that my time was\nwithin three minutes of being out. I presume it is expired\nnow; I therefore close.\n     \n A\n H    \n I I A   A  \nA\n        \n \nTO EDWARD G. MINER.\nSPRINGFIELD, FEB., .\nMY DEAR SIR: Mr. G. A.

Two or three days ago I learned that McLean had\nappointed delegates in favor of Lovejoy, and thenceforward\nI have considered his renomination a \ufb01xed fact. My opinion\n\u2014 if my opinion is of any consequence in this case, in which\nit is no business of mine to interfere \u2014 remains unchanged,\nthat running an independent candidate against Lovejoy will\nnot do; that it will result in nothing but disaster all round.\nIn the \ufb01rst place, whosoever so runs will be beaten and will\nbe spotted for life; in the second place, while the race is in\nprogress, he will be under the strongest temptation to\ntrade with the Democrats, and to favor the election of\ncertain of their friends to the Legislature; thirdly, I shall be\nheld responsible for it, and Republican members of the\nLegislature who are partial to Lovejoy will for that purpose\noppose us; and lastly, it will in the end lose us the district\naltogether. There is no safe way but a convention; and if in\nthat convention, upon a common platform which all are\nwilling to stand upon, one who has been known as an\nabolitionist, but who is now occupying none but common\n ground, can get the majority of the votes to which all look\nfor an election, there is no safe way but to submit.\nAs to the inclination of some Republicans to favor\nDouglas, that is one of the chances I have to run, and which\nI intend to run with patience.\nI write in the court room.

Wilson, Esq., and as he made his\nappearance he was greeted with a perfect storm of applause. For some\nmoments the enthusiasm continued unabated. At last, when by a wave of his\nhand partial silence was restored, Mr. LINCOLN said,]\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 On yesterday evening, upon\nthe occasion of the reception given to Senator Douglas, I\nwas furnished with a seat very convenient for hearing him,\nand was otherwise very courteously treated by him and his\nfriends, and for which I thank him and them. During the\ncourse of his remarks my name was mentioned in such a\nway as, I suppose, renders it at least not improper that I\nshould make some sort of reply to him. I shall not attempt\nto follow him in the precise order in which he addressed\nthe assembled multitude upon that occasion, though I shall\nperhaps do so in the main.\nThere was one question to which he asked the attention\nof the crowd, which I deem of somewhat less importance \u2014\nat least of propriety \u2014 for me to dwell upon than the\n others, which he brought in near the close of his speech,\nand which I think it would not be entirely proper for me to\nomit attending to, and yet if I were not to give some\nattention to it now, I should probably forget it altogether.\nWhile I am upon this subject, allow me to say that I do not\nintend to indulge in that inconvenient mode sometimes\nadopted in public speaking, of reading from documents; but\nI shall depart from that rule so far as to read a little scrap\nfrom his speech, which notices this \ufb01rst topic of which I\nshall speak, \u2014 that is, provided I can \ufb01nd it in the paper:\n\u201cI have made up my mind to appeal to the people against\nthe combination that has been made against me; the\nRepublican leaders having formed an alliance, an unholy\nand unnatural alliance, with a portion of unscrupulous\nFederal o\ufb00ice-holders. I intend to \ufb01ght that allied army\nwherever I meet them. I know they deny the alliance; but\nyet these men who are trying to divide the Democratic\nparty for the purpose of electing a Republican Senator in\nmy place are just as much the agents and tools of the\nsupporters of Mr. Lincoln. Hence I shall deal with this allied\narmy just as the Russians dealt with the Allies at\nSebastopol, \u2014 that is, the Russians did not stop to inquire,\nwhen they \ufb01red a broadside, whether it hit an Englishman,\na Frenchman, or a Turk. Nor will I stop to inquire, nor shall\nI hesitate, whether my blows shall hit the Republican\nleaders or their allies, who are holding the Federal o\ufb00ices,\nand yet acting in concert with them.\u201d\nWell, now, gentlemen, is not that very alarming? Just to\nthink of it! right at the outset of his canvass, I, a poor, kind,\n amiable, intelligent gentleman, \u2014 I am to be slain in this\nway! Why, my friend the Judge is not only, as it turns out,\nnot a dead lion, nor even a living one, \u2014 he is the rugged\nRussian Bear!\nBut if they will have it \u2014 for he says that we deny it \u2014\nthat there is any such alliance, as he says there is, \u2014 and I\ndon\u2019t propose hanging very much upon this question of\nveracity, \u2014 but if he will have it that there is such an\nalliance, that the Administration men and we are allied, and\nwe stand in the attitude of English, French, and Turk, he\noccupying the position of the Russian, in that case I beg\nthat he will indulge us while we barely suggest to him that\nthese allies took Sebastopol.\nGentlemen, only a few more words as to this alliance. For\nmy part, I have to say that whether there be such an\nalliance depends, so far as I know, upon what may be a\nright de\ufb01nition of the term alliance. If for the Republican\nparty to see the other great party to which they are\nopposed divided among themselves, and not try to stop the\ndivision, and rather be glad of it, \u2014 if that is an alliance, I\nconfess I am in; but if it is meant to be said that the\nRepublicans had formed an alliance going beyond that, by\nwhich there is contribution of money or sacri\ufb01ce of\nprinciple on the one side or the other, so far as the\nRepublican party is concerned, \u2014 if there be any such\nthing, I protest that I neither know anything of it, nor do I\nbelieve it. I will, however, say, \u2014 as I think this branch of\nthe argument is lugged in, \u2014 I would before I leave it state,\nfor the bene\ufb01t of those concerned, that one of those same\n Buchanan men did once tell me of an argument that he\nmade for his opposition to Judge Douglas. He said that a\nfriend of our Senator Douglas had been talking to him, and\nhad, among other things, said to him:\n\u201c...why, you don\u2019t want to beat Douglas?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said he,\n\u201cI do want to beat him, and I will tell you why. I believe his\noriginal Nebraska Bill was right in the abstract, but it was\nwrong in the time that it was brought forward. It was\nwrong in the application to a Territory in regard to which\nthe question had been settled; it was brought forward at a\ntime when nobody asked him; it was tendered to the South\nwhen the South had not asked for it, but when they could\nnot well refuse it; and for this same reason he forced that\nquestion upon our party. It has sunk the best men all over\nthe nation, everywhere; and now, when our President,\nstruggling with the di\ufb00iculties of this man\u2019s getting up, has\nreached the very hardest point to turn in the case, he\ndeserts him and I am for putting him where he will trouble\nus no more.\u201d\nNow, gentlemen, that is not my argument; that is not my\nargument at all. I have only been stating to you the\nargument of a Buchanan man. You will judge if there is any\nforce in it.\nPopular sovereignty! Everlasting popular sovereignty!\nLet us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular\nsovereignty. What is popular sovereignty? We recollect that\nat an early period in the history of this struggle there was\nanother name for the same thing,\u2014 \u201csquatter sovereignty.\u201d\nIt was not exactly popular sovereignty, but squatter\n sovereignty. What do those terms mean? What do those\nterms mean when used now? And vast credit is taken by\nour friend the Judge in regard to his support of it, when he\ndeclares the last years of his life have been, and all the\nfuture years of his life shall be, devoted to this matter of\npopular sovereignty. What is it? Why, it is the sovereignty of\nthe people! What was squatter sovereignty? I suppose, if it\nhad any signi\ufb01cance at all, it was the right of the people to\ngovern themselves, to be sovereign in their own a\ufb00airs\nwhile they were squatted down in a country not their own,\nwhile they had squatted on a Territory that did not belong\nto them, in the sense that a State belongs to the people\nwho inhabit it, when it belonged to the nation; such right to\ngovern themselves was called \u201csquatter sovereignty.\u201d\nNow, I wish you to mark: What has become of that\nsquatter sovereignty? what has become of it? Can you get\nanybody to tell you now that the people of a Territory have\nany authority to govern themselves, in regard to this\nmooted question of slavery, before they form a State\nconstitution? No such thing at all; although there is a\ngeneral running \ufb01re, and although there has been a hurrah\nmade in every speech on that side, assuming that policy\nhad given the people of a Territory the right to govern\nthemselves upon this question, yet the point is dodged. To-\nday it has been decided \u2014 no more than a year ago it was\ndecided \u2014 by the Supreme Court of the United States, and\nis insisted upon to-day that the people of a Territory have\nno right to exclude slavery from a Territory; that if any one\nman chooses to take slaves into a Territory, all the rest of\n the people have no right to keep them out. This being so,\nand this decision being made one of the points that the\nJudge approved, and one in the approval of which he says\nhe means to keep me down, \u2014 put me down I should not\nsay, for I have never been up, \u2014 he says he is in favor of it,\nand sticks to it, and expects to win his battle on that\ndecision, which says that there is no such thing as squatter\nsovereignty, but that any one man may take slaves into a\nTerritory, and all the other men in the Territory may be\nopposed to it, and yet by reason of the Constitution they\ncannot prohibit it. When that is so, how much is left of this\nvast matter of squatter sovereignty, I should like to know?\nWhen we get back, we get to the point of the right of the\npeople to make a constitution. Kansas was settled, for\nexample, in . It was a Territory yet, without having\nformed a constitution, in a very regular way, for three\nyears. All this time negro slavery could be taken in by any\nfew individuals, and by that decision of the Supreme Court,\nwhich the Judge approves, all the rest of the people cannot\nkeep it out; but when they come to make a constitution,\nthey may say they will not have slavery. But it is there; they\nare obliged to tolerate it some way, and all experience\nshows it will be so, for they will not take the negro slaves\nand absolutely deprive the owners of them. All experience\nshows this to be so. All that space of time that runs from\nthe beginning of the settlement of the Territory until there\nis su\ufb00iciency of people to make a State constitution, \u2014 all\nthat portion of time popular sovereignty is given up. The\nseal is absolutely put down upon it by the court decision,\n and Judge Douglas puts his own upon the top of that; yet he\nis appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his\ndevotion to popular sovereignty.\nAgain, when we get to the question of the right of the\npeople to form a State constitution as they please, to form\nit with slavery or without slavery, if that is anything new, I\nconfess I don\u2019t know it. Has there ever been a time when\nanybody said that any other than the people of a Territory\nitself should form a constitution? What is now in it that\nJudge Douglas should have fought several years of his life,\nand pledge himself to \ufb01ght all the remaining years of his\nlife for? Can Judge Douglas \ufb01nd anybody on earth that said\nthat anybody else should form a constitution for a people?\n[A voice, \u201cYes.\u201d] Well, I should like you to name him; I\nshould like to know who he was. [Same voice, \u201cJohn\nCalhoun.\u201d]\nNo, sir, I never heard of even John Calhoun saying such a\nthing. He insisted on the same principle as Judge Douglas;\nbut his mode of applying it, in fact, was wrong. It is enough\nfor my purpose to ask this crowd whenever a Republican\nsaid anything against it. They never said anything against\nit, but they have constantly spoken for it; and whoever will\nundertake to examine the platform, and the speeches of\nresponsible men of the party, and of irresponsible men, too,\nif you please, will be unable to \ufb01nd one word from anybody\nin \nthe \nRepublican \nranks \nopposed \nto \nthat \npopular\nsovereignty which Judge Douglas thinks that he has\ninvented. I suppose that Judge Douglas will claim, in a little\nwhile, that he is the inventor of the idea that the people\n should govern themselves; that nobody ever thought of\nsuch a thing until he brought it forward. We do not\nremember that in that old Declaration of Independence it is\nsaid that:\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\ncreated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\ncertain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,\nand the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights,\ngovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just\npowers from the consent of the governed.\u201d\nThere is the origin of popular sovereignty. Who, then,\nshall come in at this day and claim that he invented it?\nThe Lecompton Constitution connects itself with this\nquestion, for it is in this matter of the Lecompton\nConstitution that our friend Judge Douglas claims such vast\ncredit. \nI \nagree \nthat \nin \nopposing \nthe \nLecompton\nConstitution, so far as I can perceive, he was right. I do not\ndeny that at all; and, gentlemen, you will readily see why I\ncould not deny it, even if I wanted to. But I do not wish to;\nfor all the Republicans in the nation opposed it, and they\nwould have opposed it just as much without Judge\nDouglas\u2019s aid as with it. They had all taken ground against\nit long before he did. Why, the reason that he urges against\nthat constitution I urged against him a year before. I have\nthe printed speech in my hand. The argument that he\nmakes, why that constitution should not be adopted, that\nthe people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote,\nI pointed out in a speech a year ago, which I hold in my\nhand now, that no fair chance was to be given to the\n people. [\u201cRead it, Read it.\u201d] I shall not waste your time by\ntrying to read it. [\u201cRead it, Read it.\u201d] Gentlemen, reading\nfrom speeches is a very tedious business, particularly for an\nold man that has to put on spectacles, and more so if the\nman be so tall that he has to bend over to the light.\nA little more, now, as to this matter of popular\nsovereignty \nand \nthe \nLecompton \nConstitution. \nThe\nLecompton Constitution, as the Judge tells us, was\ndefeated. The defeat of it was a good thing or it was not. He\nthinks the defeat of it was a good thing, and so do I, and we\nagree in that. Who defeated it?\n[A voice: Judge Douglas.]\nYes, he furnished himself, and if you suppose he\ncontrolled the other Democrats that went with him, he\nfurnished three votes; while the Republicans furnished\ntwenty.\nThat is what he did to defeat it. In the House of\nRepresentatives he and his friends furnished some twenty\nvotes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd. Now, who\nwas it that did the work?\n[A voice: Douglas.]\nWhy, yes, Douglas did it! To be sure he did.\nLet us, however, put that proposition another way. The\nRepublicans could not have done it without Judge Douglas.\nCould he have done it without them? Which could have\ncome the nearest to doing it without the other?\n[A voice: Who killed the bill?]\n[Another voice: Douglas.]\n Ground was taken against it by the Republicans long\nbefore Douglas did it. The proportion of opposition to that\nmeasure is about \ufb01ve to one.\n[A voice: Why don\u2019t they come out on it?]\nYou don\u2019t know what you are talking about, my friend. I\nam quite willing to answer any gentleman in the crowd who\nasks an intelligent question.\nNow, who in all this country has ever found any of our\nfriends of Judge Douglas\u2019s way of thinking, and who have\nacted upon this main question, that has ever thought of\nuttering a word in behalf of Judge Trumbull?\n[A voice: We have.]\nI defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a\nDemocratic meeting \u2014 I take it upon myself to defy any\nman to show a printed resolution of a Democratic meeting,\nlarge or small \u2014 in favor of Judge Trumbull, or any of the\n\ufb01ve to one Republicans who beat that bill. Everything must\nbe for the Democrats! They did everything, and the \ufb01ve to\nthe one that really did the thing they snub over, and they do\nnot seem to remember that they have an existence upon\nthe face of the earth.\nGentlemen, I fear that I shall become tedious. I leave this\nbranch of the subject to take hold of another. I take up that\npart of Judge Douglas\u2019s speech in which he respectfully\nattended to me.\nJudge Douglas made two points upon my recent speech\nat Spring\ufb01eld. He says they are to be the issues of this\ncampaign. The \ufb01rst one of these points he bases upon the\nlanguage in a speech which I delivered at Spring\ufb01eld,\n which I believe I can quote correctly from memory. I said\nthere that \u201cwe are now far into the \ufb01fth year since a policy\nwas instituted for the avowed object, and with the con\ufb01dent\npromise, of putting an end to slavery agitation; under the\noperation of that policy, that agitation has not only not\nceased, but has constantly augmented.\u201d \u201cI believe it will\nnot cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed.\n\u2018A house divided against itself cannot stand.\u2019 I believe this\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half\nfree.\u201d \u201cI do not expect the Union to be dissolved,\u201d \u2014 I am\nquoting from my speech, \u201c \u2014 I do not expect the house to\nfall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will\nbecome all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents\nof slavery will arrest the spread of it and place it where the\npublic mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of\nultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward\nuntil it shall become alike lawful in all the States, north as\nwell as south.\u201d\nWhat is the paragraph? In this paragraph, which I have\nquoted in your hearing, and to which I ask the attention of\nall, Judge Douglas thinks he discovers great political\nheresy. I want your attention particularly to what he has\ninferred from it. He says I am in favor of making all the\nStates of this Union uniform in all their internal\nregulations; that in all their domestic concerns I am in\nfavor of making them entirely uniform. He draws this\ninference from the language I have quoted to you. He says\nthat I am in favor of making war by the North upon the\nSouth for the extinction of slavery; that I am also in favor of\n inviting (as he expresses it) the South to a war upon the\nNorth for the purpose of nationalizing slavery. Now, it is\nsingular enough, if you will carefully read that passage\nover, that I did not say that I was in favor of anything in it. I\nonly said what I expected would take place. I made a\nprediction only, \u2014 it may have been a foolish one, perhaps.\nI did not even say that I desired that slavery should be put\nin course of ultimate extinction. I do say so now, however,\nso there need be no longer any di\ufb00iculty about that. It may\nbe written down in the great speech.\nGentlemen, Judge Douglas informed you that this speech\nof mine was probably carefully prepared. I admit that it\nwas. I am not master of language; I have not a \ufb01ne\neducation; I am not capable of entering into a disquisition\nupon dialectics, as I believe you call it; but I do not believe\nthe language I employed bears any such construction as\nJudge Douglas puts upon it. But I don\u2019t care about a\nquibble in regard to words. I know what I meant, and I will\nnot leave this crowd in doubt, if I can explain it to them,\nwhat I really meant in the use of that paragraph.\nI am not, in the \ufb01rst place, unaware that this government\nhas endured eighty-two years half slave and half free. I\nknow that. I am tolerably well acquainted with the history\nof the country, and I know that it has endured eighty-two\nyears half slave and half free. I believe \u2014 and that is what I\nmeant to allude to there \u2014 I believe it has endured because\nduring all that time, until the introduction of the Nebraska\nBill, the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that\nslavery was in course of ultimate extinction. That was what\n gave us the rest that we had through that period of eighty-\ntwo years, \u2014 at least, so I believe. I have always hated\nslavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist, \u2014 I have been\nan Old Line Whig, \u2014 I have always hated it; but I have\nalways been quiet about it until this new era of the\nintroduction of the Nebraska Bill began. I always believed\nthat everybody was against it, and that it was in course of\nultimate extinction. [Pointing to Mr. Browning, who stood\nnear by.] Browning thought so; the great mass of the nation\nhave rested in the belief that slavery was in course of\nultimate extinction. They had reason so to believe.\nThe adoption of the Constitution and its attendant history\nled the people to believe so; and that such was the belief of\nthe framers of the Constitution itself, why did those old\nmen, about the time of the adoption of the Constitution,\ndecree that slavery should not go into the new Territory,\nwhere it had not already gone? Why declare that within\ntwenty years the African slave trade, by which slaves are\nsupplied, might be cut o\ufb00 by Congress? Why were all these\nacts? I might enumerate more of these acts; but enough.\nWhat were they but a clear indication that the framers of\nthe Constitution intended and expected the ultimate\nextinction of that institution? And now, when I say, as I said\nin my speech that Judge Douglas has quoted from, when I\nsay that I think the opponents of slavery will resist the\nfarther spread of it, and place it where the public mind\nshall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate\nextinction, I only mean to say that they will place it where\nthe founders of this government originally placed it.\n I have said a hundred times, and I have now no\ninclination to take it back, that I believe there is no right,\nand ought to be no inclination, in the people of the free\nStates to enter into the slave States and interfere with the\nquestion of slavery at all. I have said that always; Judge\nDouglas has heard me say it, if not quite a hundred times,\nat least as good as a hundred times; and when it is said that\nI am in favor of interfering with slavery where it exists, I\nknow it is unwarranted by anything I have ever intended,\nand, as I believe, by anything I have ever said. If, by any\nmeans, I have ever used language which could fairly be so\nconstrued (as, however, I believe I never have), I now\ncorrect it.\nSo much, then, for the inference that Judge Douglas\ndraws, that I am in favor of setting the sections at war with\none another. I know that I never meant any such thing, and\nI believe that no fair mind can infer any such thing from\nanything I have ever said.\nNow, in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a\ngeneral consolidation of all the local institutions of the\nvarious States. I will attend to that for a little while, and try\nto inquire, if I can, how on earth it could be that any man\ncould draw such an inference from anything I said. I have\nsaid, very many times, in Judge Douglas\u2019s hearing, that no\nman believed more than I in the principle of self-\ngovernment; that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just\ngovernment, from beginning to end. I have denied that his\nuse of that term applies properly. But for the thing itself, I\ndeny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his\n devotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in\ne\ufb00iciency in advocating it. I think that I have said it in your\nhearing, that I believe each individual is naturally entitled\nto do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labor, so\nfar as it in no wise interferes with any other man\u2019s rights;\nthat each community as a State has a right to do exactly as\nit pleases with all the concerns within that State that\ninterfere with the right of no other State; and that the\nGeneral Government, upon principle, has no right to\ninterfere with anything other than that general class of\nthings that does concern the whole. I have said that at all\ntimes. I have said, as illustrations, that I do not believe in\nthe right of Illinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of\nIndiana, the oyster laws of Virginia, or the liquor laws of\nMaine. I have said these things over and over again, and I\nrepeat them here as my sentiments.\nHow is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I hope\nto see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in the\nbelief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, that I\nam in favor of Illinois going over and interfering with the\ncranberry laws of Indiana? What can authorize him to draw\nany such inference?\nI suppose there might be one thing that at least enabled\nhim to draw such an inference that would not be true with\nme or many others: that is, because he looks upon all this\nmatter of slavery as an exceedingly little thing, \u2014 this\nmatter of keeping one sixth of the population of the whole\nnation in a state of oppression and tyranny unequaled in\nthe world. He looks upon it as being an exceedingly little\n thing, \u2014 only equal to the question of the cranberry laws of\nIndiana; as something having no moral question in it; as\nsomething on a par with the question of whether a man\nshall pasture his land with cattle, or plant it with tobacco;\nso little and so small a thing that he concludes, if I could\ndesire that anything should be done to bring about the\nultimate extinction of that little thing, I must be in favor of\nbringing about an amalgamation of all the other little\nthings in the Union. Now, it so happens \u2014 and there, I\npresume, is the foundation of this mistake \u2014 that the Judge\nthinks thus; and it so happens that there is a vast portion of\nthe American people that do not look upon that matter as\nbeing this very little thing. They look upon it as a vast\nmoral evil; they can prove it as such by the writings of\nthose who gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy,\nand that they so looked upon it, and not as an evil merely\ncon\ufb01ning itself to the States where it is situated; and while\nwe agree that, by the Constitution we assented to, in the\nStates where it exists, we have no right to interfere with it,\nbecause it is in the Constitution; and we are by both duty\nand inclination to stick by that Constitution, in all its letter\nand spirit, from beginning to end.\nSo much, then, as to my disposition \u2014 my wish to have\nall the State legislatures blotted out, and to have one\nconsolidated government, and a uniformity of domestic\nregulations in all the States, by which I suppose it is meant,\nif we raise corn here, we must make sugar-cane grow here\ntoo, and we must make those which grow North grow in the\nSouth. All this I suppose he understands I am in favor of\n doing. Now, so much for all this nonsense; for I must call it\nso. The Judge can have no issue with me on a question of\nestablishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the\nStates.\nA little now on the other point, \u2014 the Dred Scott\ndecision. Another of the issues he says that is to be made\nwith me is upon his devotion to the Dred Scott decision,\nand my opposition to it.\nI have expressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my\nopposition to the Dred Scott decision; but I should be\nallowed to state the nature of that opposition, and I ask\nyour indulgence while I do so. What is fairly implied by the\nterm Judge Douglas has used, \u201cresistance to the decision\u201d?\nI do not resist it. If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his\nmaster, I would be interfering with property, and that\nterrible di\ufb00iculty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of\ninterfering with property, would arise. But I am doing no\nsuch thing as that, but all that I am doing is refusing to\nobey it as a political rule. If I were in Congress, and a vote\nshould come up on a question whether slavery should be\nprohibited in a new Territory, in spite of the Dred Scott\ndecision, I would vote that it should.\nThat is what I should do. Judge Douglas said last night\nthat before the decision he might advance his opinion, and\nit might be contrary to the decision when it was made; but\nafter it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed.\nJust so! We let this property abide by the decision, but we\nwill try to reverse that decision. We will try to put it where\nJudge Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it\n until it is reversed. Somebody has to reverse that decision,\nsince it is made, and we mean to reverse it, and we mean to\ndo it peaceably.\nWhat are the uses of decisions of courts? They have two\nuses. As rules of property they have two uses. First, they\ndecide upon the question before the court. They decide in\nthis case that Dred Scott is a slave. Nobody resists that, not\nonly that, but they say to everybody else that persons\nstanding just as Dred Scott stands are as he is. That is, they\nsay that when a question comes up upon another person, it\nwill be so decided again, unless the court decides in\nanother way, unless the court overrules its decision. Well,\nwe mean to do what we can to have the court decide the\nother way. That is one thing we mean to try to do.\nThe sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this\ndecision is a degree of sacredness that has never been\nbefore thrown around any other decision. I have never\nheard of such a thing. Why, decisions apparently contrary\nto that decision, or that good lawyers thought were\ncontrary to that decision, have been made by that very\ncourt before. It is the \ufb01rst of its kind; it is an astonisher in\nlegal history. It is a new wonder of the world. It is based\nupon falsehood in the main as to the facts; allegations of\nfacts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many\ninstances, and no decision made on any question \u2014 the \ufb01rst\ninstance of a decision made under so many unfavorable\ncircumstances \u2014 thus placed, has ever been held by the\nprofession as law, and it has always needed con\ufb01rmation\nbefore the lawyers regarded it as settled law. But Judge\n Douglas will have it that all hands must take this\nextraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary\ncircumstances, and give their vote in Congress in\naccordance with it, yield to it, and obey it in every possible\nsense. Circumstances alter cases. Do not gentlemen here\nremember the case of that same Supreme Court some\ntwenty-\ufb01ve or thirty years ago deciding that a National\nBank was constitutional? I ask, if somebody does not\nremember that a National Bank was declared to be\nconstitutional? \nSuch \nis \nthe \ntruth, \nwhether \nit \nbe\nremembered or not. The Bank charter ran out, and a\nrecharter was granted by Congress. That recharter was\nlaid before General Jackson. It was urged upon him, when\nhe denied the constitutionality of the Bank, that the\nSupreme Court had decided that it was constitutional; and\nGeneral Jackson then said that the Supreme Court had no\nright to lay down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of\nthe government, the members of which had sworn to\nsupport the Constitution; that each member had sworn to\nsupport that Constitution as he understood it. I will venture\nhere to say that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he\napproved of General Jackson for that act. What has now\nbecome of all his tirade about \u201cresistance of the Supreme\nCourt\u201d?\nMy fellow-citizens, getting back a little, \u2014 for I pass from\nthese points, \u2014 when Judge Douglas makes his threat of\nannihilation upon the \u201calliance,\u201d he is cautious to say that\nthat warfare of his is to fall upon the leaders of the\nRepublican party. Almost every word he utters, and every\n distinction he makes, has its signi\ufb01cance. He means for the\nRepublicans who do not count themselves as leaders, to be\nhis friends; he makes no fuss over them; it is the leaders\nthat he is making war upon. He wants it understood that\nthe mass of the Republican party are really his friends. It is\nonly the leaders that are doing something that are\nintolerant, and that require extermination at his hands. As\nthis is dearly and unquestionably the light in which he\npresents that matter, I want to ask your attention,\naddressing myself to the Republicans here, that I may ask\nyou some questions as to where you, as the Republican\nparty, would be placed if you sustained Judge Douglas in his\npresent position by a re-election? I do not claim,\ngentlemen, to be unsel\ufb01sh; I do not pretend that I would\nnot like to go to the United States Senate, \u2014 I make no\nsuch hypocritical pretense; but I do say to you that in this\nmighty issue it is nothing to you \u2014 nothing to the mass of\nthe people of the nation, \u2014 whether or not Judge Douglas\nor myself shall ever be heard of after this night; it may be a\ntri\ufb02e to either of us, but in connection with this mighty\nquestion, upon which hang the destinies of the nation,\nperhaps, it is absolutely nothing: but where will you be\nplaced if you reindorse Judge Douglas? Don\u2019t you know how\napt he is, how exceedingly anxious he is at all times, to\nseize upon anything and everything to persuade you that\nsomething he has done you did yourselves? Why, he tried to\npersuade you last night that our Illinois Legislature\ninstructed him to introduce the Nebraska Bill. There was\nnobody in that Legislature ever thought of such a thing;\n and when he \ufb01rst introduced the bill, he never thought of\nit; but still he \ufb01ghts furiously for the proposition, and that\nhe did it because there was a standing instruction to our\nSenators to be always introducing Nebraska bills. He tells\nyou he is for the Cincinnati platform, he tells you he is for\nthe Dred Scott decision. He tells you, not in his speech last\nnight, but substantially in a former speech, that he cares\nnot if slavery is voted up or down; he tells you the struggle\non Lecompton is past; it may come up again or not, and if it\ndoes, he stands where he stood when, in spite of him and\nhis opposition, you built up the Republican party. If you\nindorse him, you tell him you do not care whether slavery\nbe voted up or down, and he will close or try to close your\nmouths with his declaration, repeated by the day, the week,\nthe month, and the year. Is that what you mean? [Cries of\n\u201cNo,\u201d one voice \u201cYes.\u201d] Yes, I have no doubt you who have\nalways been for him, if you mean that. No doubt of that,\nsoberly I have said, and I repeat it. I think, in the position\nin which Judge Douglas stood in opposing the Lecompton\nConstitution, he was right; he does not know that it will\nreturn, but if it does we may know where to \ufb01nd him, and if\nit does not, we may know where to look for him, and that is\non the Cincinnati platform. Now, I could ask the Republican\nparty, after all the hard names that Judge Douglas has\ncalled them by all his repeated charges of their inclination\nto marry with and hug negroes; all his declarations of Black\nRepublicanism, \u2014 by the way, we are improving, the black\nhas got rubbed o\ufb00, \u2014 but with all that, if he be indorsed by\nRepublican votes, where do you stand? Plainly, you stand\n ready saddled, bridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be\ndriven over to the slavery extension camp of the nation, \u2014\njust ready to be driven over, tied together in a lot, to be\ndriven over, every man with a rope around his neck, that\nhalter being held by Judge Douglas. That is the question. If\nRepublican men have been in earnest in what they have\ndone, I think they had better not do it; but I think that the\nRepublican party is made up of those who, as far as they\ncan peaceably, will oppose the extension of slavery, and\nwho will hope for its ultimate extinction. If they believe it is\nwrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent and\nkeeping them from the settlement of free white laborers,\nwho want the land to bring up their families upon; if they\nare in earnest, although they may make a mistake, they will\ngrow restless, and the time will come when they will come\nback again and reorganize, if not by the same name, at\nleast upon the same principles as their party now has. It is\nbetter, then, to save the work while it is begun. You have\ndone the labor; maintain it, keep it. If men choose to serve\nyou, go with them; but as you have made up your\norganization upon principle, stand by it; for, as surely as\nGod reigns over you, and has inspired your mind, and given\nyou a sense of propriety, and continues to give you hope, so\nsurely will you still cling to these ideas, and you will at last\ncome back again after your wanderings, merely to do your\nwork over again.\nWe were often, \u2014 more than once, at least, \u2014 in the\ncourse of Judge Douglas\u2019s speech last night, reminded that\nthis government was made for white men; that he believed\n it was made for white men. Well, that is putting it into a\nshape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge then\ngoes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not\nwarranted. I protest, now and forever, against that\ncounterfeit logic which presumes that because I did not\nwant a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her\nfor a wife. My understanding is that I need not have her for\neither, but, as God made us separate, we can leave one\nanother alone, and do one another much good thereby.\nThere are white men enough to marry all the white women,\nand enough black men to marry all the black women; and in\nGod\u2019s name let them be so married. The Judge regales us\nwith the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture\nof races; that the inferior race bears the superior down.\nWhy, Judge, if we do not let them get together in the\nTerritories, they won\u2019t mix there.\n[A voice: \u201cThree cheers for Lincoln\u201d. \u2014 The cheers were\ngiven with a hearty good-will.]\nI should say at least that that is a self-evident truth.\nNow, it happens that we meet together once every year,\nsometimes about the th of July, for some reason or other.\nThese th of July gatherings I suppose have their uses. If\nyou will indulge me, I will state what I suppose to be some\nof them.\nWe are now a mighty nation; we are thirty or about thirty\nmillions of people, and we own and inhabit about one\n\ufb01fteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth. We run our\nmemory back over the pages of history for about eighty-two\nyears, and we discover that we were then a very small\n people in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are\nnow, with a vastly less extent of country, with vastly less of\neverything we deem desirable among men; we look upon\nthe change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our\nposterity, and we \ufb01x upon something that happened away\nback, as in some way or other being connected with this\nrise of prosperity. We \ufb01nd a race of men living in that day\nwhom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers; they were\niron men; they fought for the principle that they were\ncontending for; and we understood that by what they then\ndid it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we\nnow enjoy has come to us. We hold this annual celebration\nto remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of\ntime, of how it was done and who did it, and how we are\nhistorically connected with it; and we go from these\nmeetings in better humor with ourselves, we feel more\nattached the one to the other, and more \ufb01rmly bound to the\ncountry we inhabit. In every way we are better men in the\nage and race and country in which we live, for these\ncelebrations. But after we have done all this we have not\nyet reached the whole. There is something else connected\nwith it. We have \u2014 besides these, men descended by blood\nfrom our ancestors \u2014 among us perhaps half our people\nwho are not descendants at all of these men; they are men\nwho have come from Europe, German, Irish, French, and\nScandinavian, \u2014 men that have come from Europe\nthemselves, or whose ancestors have come hither and\nsettled here, \ufb01nding themselves our equals in all things. If\nthey look back through this history to trace their\n connection with those days by blood, they \ufb01nd they have\nnone, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious\nepoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us;\nbut when they look through that old Declaration of\nIndependence, they \ufb01nd that those old men say that \u201cWe\nhold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\ncreated equal\u201d; and then they feel that that moral\nsentiment, taught in that day, evidences their relation to\nthose men, that it is the father of all moral principle in\nthem, and that they have a right to claim it as though they\nwere blood of the blood, and \ufb02esh of the \ufb02esh, of the men\nwho wrote that Declaration; and so they are. That is the\nelectric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of\npatriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link\nthose patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists\nin the minds of men throughout the world.\nNow, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this\nidea of \u201cdon\u2019t care if slavery is voted up or voted down,\u201d for\nsustaining the Dred Scott decision, for holding that the\nDeclaration of Independence did not mean anything at all,\nwe have Judge Douglas giving his exposition of what the\nDeclaration of Independence means, and we have him\nsaying that the people of America are equal to the people of\nEngland. According to his construction, you Germans are\nnot connected with it. Now, I ask you in all soberness if all\nthese things, if indulged in, if rati\ufb01ed, if con\ufb01rmed and\nindorsed, if taught to our children, and repeated to them,\ndo not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the\ncountry, \nand \nto \ntransform \nthis \ngovernment \ninto \na\n government of some other form. Those arguments that are\nmade, that the inferior race are to be treated with as much\nallowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as much is\nto be done for them as their condition will allow, \u2014 what\nare these arguments? They are the arguments that kings\nhave made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world.\nYou will \ufb01nd that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft\nwere of this class; they always bestrode the necks of the\npeople not that they wanted to do it, but because the\npeople were better o\ufb00 for being ridden. That is their\nargument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old\nserpent that says, You work, and I eat; you toil, and I will\nenjoy the fruits of it. Turn in whatever way you will,\nwhether it come from the mouth of a king, an excuse for\nenslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of\nmen of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of\nanother race, it is all the same old serpent; and I hold, if\nthat course of argumentation that is made for the purpose\nof convincing the public mind that we should not care\nabout this should be granted, it does not stop with the\nnegro. I should like to know, if taking this old Declaration of\nIndependence, which declares that all men are equal upon\nprinciple, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop? If\none man says it does not mean a negro, why not another\nsay it does not mean some other man? If that Declaration is\nnot the truth, let us get the statute book, in which we \ufb01nd\nit, and tear it out! Who is so bold as to do it? If it is not\ntrue, let us tear it out! [Cries of \u201cNo, no.\u201d] Let us stick to it,\nthen; let us stand \ufb01rmly by it, then.\n It may be argued that there are certain conditions that\nmake necessities and impose them upon us; and to the\nextent that a necessity is imposed upon a man, he must\nsubmit to it. I think that was the condition in which we\nfound ourselves when we established this government. We\nhad slavery among us, we could not get our Constitution\nunless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could\nnot secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more;\nand having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not\ndestroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let\nthat charter stand as our standard.\nMy friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote\nScripture. I will try it again, however. It is said in one of the\nadmonitions of our Lord, \u201cAs your Father in heaven is\nperfect, be ye also perfect.\u201d The Savior, I suppose, did not\nexpect that any human creature could be perfect as the\nFather in heaven; but he said, \u201cAs your Father in heaven is\nperfect, be ye also perfect.\u201d He set that up as a standard;\nand he who did most towards reaching that standard\nattained the highest degree of moral perfection. So I say in\nrelation to the principle that all men are created equal, let\nit be as nearly reached as we can. If we cannot give\nfreedom to every creature, let us do nothing that will\nimpose slavery upon any other creature. Let us then turn\nthis government back into the channel in which the framers\nof the Constitution originally placed it. Let us stand \ufb01rmly\nby each other. If we do not do so, we are turning in the\ncontrary direction, that our friend Judge Douglas proposes\n\u2014 not intentionally \u2014 as working in the traces tends to\n make this one universal slave nation. He is one that runs in\nthat direction, and as such I resist him.\nMy friends, I have detained you about as long as I\ndesired to do, and I have only to say: Let us discard all this\nquibbling about this man and the other man, this race and\nthat race and the other race being inferior, and therefore\nthey must be placed in an inferior position; discarding our\nstandard that we have left us. Let us discard all these\nthings, and unite as one people throughout this land, until\nwe shall once more stand up declaring that all men are\ncreated equal.\nMy friends, I could not, without launching o\ufb00 upon some\nnew topic, which would detain you too long, continue to-\nnight. I thank you for this most extensive audience that you\nhave furnished me to-night. I leave you, hoping that the\nlamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no\nlonger be a doubt that all men are created free and equal.\n   H   I\n \n \n \n A  \n  A    I\nPOLITICAL SPEECHES \n DEBATES of LINCOLN WITH\nDOUGLAS\nIn the Senatorial Campaign of  in Illinois SPEECH AT\nSPRINGFIELD, JUNE , \n[The following speech was delivered at Spring\ufb01eld, Ill., at the close of the\nRepublican State Convention held at that time and place, and by which\nConvention Mr. LINCOLN had been named as their candidate for United States\nSenator. Mr. DOUGLAS was not present.]\nMr. \nPRESIDENT \nAND \nGENTLEMEN \nOF \nTHE\nCONVENTION: \u2014 If we could \ufb01rst know where we are, and\nwhither we are tending, we could better judge what to do,\nand how to do it. We are now far into the \ufb01fth year since a\npolicy was initiated with the avowed object and con\ufb01dent\npromise of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the\noperation of that policy, that agitation has not only not\nceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion, it will\nnot cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed.\n\u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand.\u201d I believe this\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half\nfree. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved; I do not\nexpect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be\ndivided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either\n the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief\nthat it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its\nadvocates will push it forward till it shall become alike\nlawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as\nSouth.\nHave we no tendency to the latter condition?\nLet any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now\nalmost complete legal combination-piece of machinery, so\nto speak compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the\nDred Scott decision. Let him consider, not only what work\nthe machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted, but\nalso let him study the history of its construction, and trace,\nif he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of\ndesign, and concert of action, among its chief architects,\nfrom the beginning.\nThe new year of  found slavery excluded from more\nthan half the States by State Constitutions, and from most\nof the National territory by Congressional prohibition. Four\ndays later, commenced the struggle which ended in\nrepealing that Congressional prohibition. This opened all\nthe National territory to slavery, and was the \ufb01rst point\ngained.\nBut, so far, Congress only had acted, and an indorsement\nby the people, real or apparent, was indispensable to save\nthe point already gained, and give chance for more.\nThis necessity had not been overlooked, but had been\nprovided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument\nof \u201csquatter sovereignty,\u201d otherwise called \u201csacred right of\n self-government,\u201d which latter phrase, though expressive of\nthe only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted\nin this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if\nany one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall\nbe allowed to object. That argument was incorporated into\nthe Nebraska Bill itself, in the language which follows:\n\u201cIt being the true intent and meaning of this Act not to\nlegislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude\nit therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free\nto form and regulate their domestic institutions in their\nown way, subject only to the Constitution of the United\nStates.\u201d\nThen opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of\n\u201csquatter \nsovereignty,\u201d \nand \n\u201csacred \nright \nof \nself-\ngovernment.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said opposition members, \u201clet us\namend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of\nthe Territory may exclude slavery.\u201d \u201cNot we,\u201d said the\nfriends of the measure, and down they voted the\namendment.\nWhile the Nebraska Bill was passing through Congress, a\nlaw case, involving the question of a negro\u2019s freedom, by\nreason of his owner having voluntarily taken him \ufb01rst into a\nfree State, and then into a territory covered by the\nCongressional Prohibition, and held him as a slave for a\nlong time in each, was passing through the United States\nCircuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both\nNebraska Bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the\nsame month of May, . The negro\u2019s name was \u201cDred\nScott,\u201d which name now designates the decision \ufb01nally\n made in the case. Before the then next Presidential\nelection, the law case came to, and was argued in, the\nSupreme Court of the United States; but the decision of it\nwas deferred until after the election. Still, before the\nelection, Senator Trumbull, on the \ufb02oor of the Senate,\nrequested the leading advocate of the Nebraska Bill to\nstate his opinion whether the people of a territory can\nconstitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the\nlatter answers: \u201cThat is a question for the Supreme Court.\u201d\nThe election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the\nindorsement, such as it was, secured. That was the second\npoint gained. The indorsement, however, fell short of a\nclear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand\nvotes,(approximately \n of the vote) and so, perhaps, was\nnot overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory. The outgoing\nPresident, in his last annual message, as impressively as\npossible echoed back upon the people the weight and\nauthority of the indorsement. The Supreme Court met\nagain, did not announce their decision, but ordered a\nreargument. The Presidential inauguration came, and still\nno decision of the court; but the incoming President, in his\ninaugural address, fervently exhorted the people to abide\nby the forth-coming decision, whatever it might be. Then, in\na few days, came the decision.\nThe reputed author of the Nebraska Bill \ufb01nds an early\noccasion to make a speech at this capital indorsing the\nDred Scott decision, and vehemently denouncing all\nopposition to it. The new President, too, seizes the early\noccasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly\n construe that decision, and to express his astonishment\nthat any di\ufb00erent view had ever been entertained!\nAt length a squabble springs up between the President\nand the author of the Nebraska Bill, on the mere question\nof fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution was or was not\nin any just sense made by the people of Kansas; and in that\nquarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote\nfor the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be\nvoted down or voted up. I do not understand his\ndeclaration, that he cares not whether slavery be voted\ndown or voted up, to be intended by him other than as an\napt de\ufb01nition of the policy he would impress upon the\npublic mind, \u2014 the principle for which he declares he has\nsu\ufb00ered so much, and is ready to su\ufb00er to the end. And\nwell may he cling to that principle! If he has any parental\nfeeling, well may he cling to it. That principle is the only\nshred left of his original Nebraska doctrine. Under the\nDred Scott decision \u201csquatter sovereignty\u201d squatted out of\nexistence, tumbled down like temporary sca\ufb00olding; like\nthe mould at the foundry, served through one blast, and fell\nback into loose sand; helped to carry an election, and then\nwas kicked to the winds. His late joint struggle with the\nRepublicans, against the Lecompton Constitution, involves\nnothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That struggle\nwas made on a point \u2014 the right of a people to make their\nown constitution \u2014 upon which he and the Republicans\nhave never di\ufb00ered.\nThe several points of the Dred Scott decision, in\nconnection with Senator Douglas\u2019s \u201ccare not\u201d policy,\n constitute the piece of machinery, in its present state of\nadvancement. This was the third point gained. The working\npoints of that machinery are:\nFirstly, That no negro slave, imported as such from\nAfrica, and no descendant of such slave, can ever be a\ncitizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the\nConstitution of the United States. This point is made in\norder to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the\nbene\ufb01t of that provision of the United States Constitution\nwhich declares that \u201cThe citizens of each State shall be\nentitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the\nseveral States.\u201d\nSecondly, That, \u201csubject to the Constitution of the United\nStates,\u201d neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can\nexclude slavery from any United States Territory. This point\nis made in order that individual men may \ufb01ll up the\nTerritories with slaves, without danger of losing them as\nproperty, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency\nto the institution through all the future.\nThirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual\nslavery in a free State makes him free, as against the\nholder, the United States courts will not decide, but will\nleave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the\nnegro may be forced into by the master. This point is made,\nnot to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for a\nwhile, and apparently indorsed by the people at an election,\nthen to sustain the logical conclusion that what Dred\nScott\u2019s master might lawfully do with Dred Scott, in the\nfree State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do\n with any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in\nany other free State.\nAuxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it,\nthe Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate\nand mould public opinion, at least Northern public opinion,\nnot to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up. This\nshows exactly where we now are; and partially, also, wither\nwe are tending.\nIt will throw additional light on the latter, to go back and\nrun the mind over the string of historical facts already\nstated. Several things will now appear less dark and\nmysterious than they did when they were transpiring. The\npeople were to be left \u201cperfectly free,\u201d \u201csubject only to the\nConstitution.\u201d What the Constitution had to do with it,\noutsiders could not then see. Plainly enough now, \u2014 it was\nan exactly \ufb01tted niche, for the Dred Scott decision to\nafterward come in, and declare the perfect freedom of the\npeople to be just no freedom at all. Why was the\namendment, expressly declaring the right of the people,\nvoted down? Plainly enough now, \u2014 the adoption of it\nwould have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.\nWhy was the court decision held up? Why even a Senator\u2019s\nindividual opinion withheld, till after the Presidential\nelection? Plainly enough now, \u2014 the speaking out then\nwould have damaged the \u201cperfectly free\u201d argument upon\nwhich the election was to be carried. Why the outgoing\nPresident\u2019s felicitation on the indorsement? Why the delay\nof a reargument? Why the incoming President\u2019s advance\nexhortation in favor of the decision? These things look like\n the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse\npreparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded that he\nmay give the rider a fall. And why the hasty after-\nindorsement of the decision by the President and others?\nWe cannot absolutely know that all these exact\nadaptations are the result of preconcert. But when we see a\nlot of framed timbers, di\ufb00erent portions of which we know\nhave been gotten out at di\ufb00erent times and places and by\ndi\ufb00erent workmen, Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James,\nfor instance, and when we see these timbers joined\ntogether, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or\na mill, all the tenons and mortises exactly \ufb01tting, and all\nthe lengths and proportions of the di\ufb00erent pieces exactly\nadapted to their respective places, and not a piece too\nmany or too few, \u2014 not omitting even sca\ufb00olding, \u2014 or, if a\nsingle piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame\nexactly \ufb01tted and prepared yet to bring such piece in, \u2014 in\nsuch a case, we \ufb01nd it impossible not to believe that\nStephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood\none another from the beginning, and all worked upon a\ncommon plan or draft drawn up before the \ufb01rst blow was\nstruck.\nIt should not be overlooked that by the Nebraska Bill the\npeople of a State as well as Territory were to be left\n\u201cperfectly free,\u201d \u201csubject only to the Constitution.\u201d Why\nmention a State? They were legislating for Territories, and\nnot for or about States. Certainly the people of a State are\nand ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United\nStates; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely\n Territorial law? Why are the people of a Territory and the\npeople of a State therein lumped together, and their\nrelation to the Constitution therefore treated as being\nprecisely the same? While the opinion of the court, by Chief\nJustice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate\nopinions of all the concurring Judges, expressly declare\nthat the Constitution of the United States neither permits\nCongress nor a Territorial Legislature to exclude slavery\nfrom any United States Territory, they all omit to declare\nwhether or not the same Constitution permits a State, or\nthe people of a State, to exclude it. Possibly, this is a mere\nomission; but who can be quite sure, if McLean or Curtis\nhad sought to get into the opinion a declaration of\nunlimited power in the people of a State to exclude slavery\nfrom their limits, just as Chase and Mace sought to get\nsuch declaration, in behalf of the people of a Territory, into\nthe Nebraska Bill, \u2014 I ask, who can be quite sure that it\nwould not have been voted down in the one case as it had\nbeen in the other? The nearest approach to the point of\ndeclaring the power of a State over slavery is made by\nJudge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, Using the\nprecise idea, and almost the language, too, of the Nebraska\nAct. On one occasion, his exact language is, \u201cExcept in\ncases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of\nthe United States, the law of the State is supreme over the\nsubject of slavery within its jurisdiction.\u201d In what cases the\npower of the States is so restrained by the United States\nConstitution, is left an open question, precisely as the same\nquestion, as to the restraint on the power of the Territories,\n was left open in the Nebraska Act. Put this and that\ntogether, and we have another nice little niche, which we\nmay, ere long, see \ufb01lled with another Supreme Court\ndecision, declaring that the Constitution of the United\nStates does not permit a State to exclude slavery from its\nlimits. And this may especially be expected if the doctrine\nof \u201ccare not whether slavery be voted down or voted up\u201d\nshall gain upon the public mind su\ufb00iciently to give promise\nthat such a decision can be maintained when made.\nSuch a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being\nalike lawful in all the States. Welcome or unwelcome, such\ndecision is probably coming, and will soon be upon us,\nunless the power of the present political dynasty shall be\nmet and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming\nthat the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their\nState free, and we shall awake to the reality instead that\nthe Supreme Court has made Illinois a slave State. To meet\nand overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now\nbefore all those who would prevent that consummation.\nThat is what we have to do. How can we best do it?\nThere are those who denounce us openly to their friends,\nand yet whisper to us softly that Senator Douglas is the\naptest instrument there is with which to e\ufb00ect that object.\nThey wish us to infer all, from the fact that he now has a\nlittle quarrel with the present head of the dynasty, and that\nhe has regularly voted with us on a single point, upon\nwhich he and we have never di\ufb00ered. They remind us that\nhe is a great man, and that the largest of us are very small\nones. Let this be granted. But \u201ca living dog is better than a\n dead lion.\u201d Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion, for this work\nis at least a caged and toothless one. How can he oppose\nthe advances of slavery? He don\u2019t care anything about it.\nHis avowed mission is impressing the \u201cpublic heart\u201d to care\nnothing about it. A leading Douglas Democratic newspaper\nthinks Douglas\u2019s superior talent will be needed to resist the\nrevival of the African slave trade. Does Douglas believe an\ne\ufb00ort to revive that trade is approaching? He has not said\nso. Does he really think so? But if it is, how can he resist it?\nFor years he has labored to prove it a sacred right of white\nmen to take negro slaves into the new Territories. Can he\npossibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them\nwhere they can be bought cheapest? And unquestionably\nthey can be bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia. He\nhas done all in his power to reduce the whole question of\nslavery to one of a mere right of property; and, as such,\nhow can he oppose the foreign slave trade, how can he\nrefuse that trade in that \u201cproperty\u201d shall be \u201cperfectly\nfree,\u201d \u2014 unless he does it as a protection to the home\nproduction? And as the home producers will probably not\nask the protection, he will be wholly without a ground of\nopposition.\nSenator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may\nrightfully be wiser to-day than he was yesterday; that he\nmay rightfully change when he \ufb01nds himself wrong. But\ncan we, for that reason, run ahead, and infer that he will\nmake any particular change, of which he himself has given\nno intimation? Can we safely base our action upon any such\nvague inference? Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent\n Judge Douglas\u2019s position, question his motives, or do aught\nthat can be personally o\ufb00ensive to him. Whenever, if ever,\nhe and we can come together on principle so that our cause\nmay have assistance from his great ability, I hope to have\ninterposed no adventitious obstacles. But clearly he is not\nnow with us; he does not pretend to be, \u2014 he does not\npromise ever to be.\nOur cause, then, must be intrusted to, and conducted by,\nits own undoubted friends, \u2014 those whose hands are free,\nwhose hearts are in the work, who do care for the result.\nTwo years ago the Republicans of the nation mustered over\nthirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under the\nsingle impulse of resistance to a common danger, with\nevery external circumstance against us. Of strange,\ndiscordant, and even hostile elements we gathered from\nthe four winds, and formed and fought the battle through,\nunder the constant hot \ufb01re of a disciplined, proud, and\npampered enemy. Did we brave all then to falter now, \u2014\nnow, when that same enemy is wavering, dissevered, and\nbelligerent? The result is not doubtful. We shall not fail; if\nwe stand \ufb01rm, we shall not fail. Wise counsels may\naccelerate, or mistakes delay it, but, sooner or later, the\nvictory is sure to come.\n   .

S. \u2014 Give full notice to all surrounding country. A.L.\n   A\n \n  \n       H A   A I   I  .\nSEPT. , .\nLET US INQUIRE what Judge Douglas really invented when\nhe introduced the Nebraska Bill? He called it Popular\nSovereignty. \nWhat \ndoes \nthat \nmean? \nIt \nmeans \nthe\nsovereignty of the people over their own a\ufb00airs \u2014 in other\nwords, the right of the people to govern themselves. Did\nJudge Douglas invent this? Not quite. The idea of popular\nsovereignty was \ufb02oating about several ages before the\nauthor of the Nebraska Bill was born \u2014 indeed, before\nColumbus set foot on this continent. In the year  it\ntook form in the noble words which you are all familiar\nwith: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men\nare created equal,\u201d etc. Was not this the origin of popular\nsovereignty as applied to the American people? Here we\nare told that governments are instituted among men\nderiving their just powers from the consent of the\ngoverned. If that is not popular sovereignty, then I have no\nconception of the meaning of words. If Judge Douglas did\nnot invent this kind of popular sovereignty, let us pursue\nthe inquiry and \ufb01nd out what kind he did invent. Was it the\nright of emigrants to Kansas and Nebraska to govern\nthemselves, and a lot of \u201cniggers,\u201d too, if they wanted\nthem? Clearly this was no invention of his because General\n Cass put forth the same doctrine in  in his so called\nNicholson letter, six years before Douglas thought of such a\nthing. Then what was it that the \u201cLittle Giant\u201d invented? It\nnever occurred to General Cass to call his discovery by the\nodd name of popular sovereignty. He had not the face to\nsay that the right of the people to govern \u201cniggers\u201d was the\nright of the people to govern themselves. His notions of the\n\ufb01tness of things were not moulded to the brazenness of\ncalling the right to put a hundred \u201cniggers\u201d through under\nthe lash in Nebraska a \u201csacred\u201d right of self-government.\nAnd here I submit to you was Judge Douglas\u2019s discovery,\nand the whole of it: He discovered that the right to breed\nand \ufb02og negroes in Nebraska was popular sovereignty.\n      H A    I\n \n  I  I\nI \nSEPTEMBER , .\nTHE QUESTIONS ARE sometimes asked \u201cWhat is all this fuss\nthat is being made about negroes? What does it amount to?\nAnd where will it end?\u201d These questions imply that those\nwho ask them consider the slavery question a very\ninsigni\ufb01cant matter they think that it amounts to little or\nnothing and that those who agitate it are extremely foolish.\nNow it must be admitted that if the great question which\nhas caused so much trouble is insigni\ufb01cant, we are very\nfoolish to have anything to do with it \u2014 if it is of no\nimportance we had better throw it aside and busy ourselves\nwith something else. But let us inquire a little into this\ninsigni\ufb01cant matter, as it is called by some, and see if it is\nnot important enough to demand the close attention of\nevery well-wisher of the Union. In one of Douglas\u2019s recent\nspeeches, I \ufb01nd a reference to one which was made by me\nin Spring\ufb01eld some time ago. The judge makes one\nquotation from that speech that requires some little notice\nfrom me at this time. I regret that I have not my Spring\ufb01eld\nspeech before me, but the judge has quoted one particular\npart of it so often that I think I can recollect it. It runs I\nthink as follows:\n \u201cWe are now far into the \ufb01fth year since a policy was\ninitiated with the avowed object and con\ufb01dent promise of\nputting an end to slavery agitation. Under the operation of\nthat policy that agitation has not only not ceased but has\nconstantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until\na crisis shall have been reached and passed.\n\u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half\nfree. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not\nexpect the house to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be\ndivided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either\nthe opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief\nthat it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its\nadvocates will push it forward till it shall become alike\nlawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as\nSouth.\u201d\nJudge Douglas makes use of the above quotation, and\n\ufb01nds a great deal of fault with it. He deals unfairly with me,\nand tries to make the people of this State believe that I\nadvocated dangerous doctrines in my Spring\ufb01eld speech.\nLet us see if that portion of my Spring\ufb01eld speech of which\nJudge Douglas complains so bitterly, is as objectionable to\nothers as it is to him. We are, certainly, far into the \ufb01fth\nyear since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and\ncon\ufb01dent promise of putting an end to slavery agitation. On\nthe fourth day of January, , Judge Douglas introduced\nthe Kansas-Nebraska bill. He initiated a new policy, and\nthat policy, so he says, was to put an end to the agitation of\n the slavery question. Whether that was his object or not I\nwill not stop to discuss, but at all events some kind of a\npolicy was initiated; and what has been the result? Instead\nof the quiet and good feeling which were promised us by\nthe self-styled author of Popular Sovereignty, we have had\nnothing but ill-feeling and agitation. According to Judge\nDouglas, the passage of the Nebraska bill would tranquilize\nthe whole country \u2014 there would be no more slavery\nagitation in or out of Congress, and the vexed question\nwould be left entirely to the people of the Territories. Such\nwas the opinion of Judge Douglas, and such were the\nopinions of the leading men of the Democratic Party. Even\nas late as the spring of  Mr. Buchanan said, a short\ntime subsequent to his nomination by the Cincinnati\nconvention, that the territory of Kansas would be tranquil\nin less than six weeks. Perhaps he thought so, but Kansas\nhas not been and is not tranquil, and it may be a long time\nbefore she may be so.\nWe all know how \ufb01erce the agitation was in Congress last\nwinter, and what a narrow escape Kansas had from being\nadmitted into the Union with a constitution that was\ndetested by ninety-nine hundredths of her citizens. Did the\nangry debates which took place at Washington during the\nlast season of Congress lead you to suppose that the\nslavery agitation was settled?\nAn election was held in Kansas in the month of August,\nand the constitution which was submitted to the people was\nvoted down by a large majority. So Kansas is still out of the\nUnion, and there is a probability that she will remain out\n for some time. But Judge Douglas says the slavery question\nis settled. He says the bill he introduced into the Senate of\nthe United States on the th day of January, , settled\nthe slavery question forever! Perhaps he can tell us how\nthat bill settled the slavery question, for if he is able to\nsettle a question of such great magnitude he ought to be\nable to explain the manner in which he does it. He knows\nand you know that the question is not settled, and that his\nill-timed experiment to settle it has made it worse than it\never was before.\nAnd now let me say a few words in regard to Douglas\u2019s\ngreat hobby of negro equality. He thinks \u2014 he says at least\n\u2014 that the Republican party is in favor of allowing whites\nand blacks to intermarry, and that a man can\u2019t be a good\nRepublican unless he is willing to elevate black men to\no\ufb00ice and to associate with them on terms of perfect\nequality. He knows that we advocate no such doctrines as\nthese, but he cares not how much he misrepresents us if he\ncan gain a few votes by so doing. To show you what my\nopinion of negro equality was in times past, and to prove to\nyou that I stand on that question where I always stood, I\nwill read you a few extracts from a speech that was made\nby me in Peoria in . It was made in reply to one of\nJudge Douglas\u2019s speeches.\n(Mr. Lincoln then read a number of extracts which had\nthe ring of the true metal. We have rarely heard anything\nwith which we have been more pleased. And the audience\nafter hearing the extracts read, and comparing their\nconservative sentiments with those now advocated by Mr.\n Lincoln, testi\ufb01ed their approval by loud applause. How any\nreasonable man can hear one of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s speeches\nwithout being converted to Republicanism is something\nthat we can\u2019t account for. Ed.)\nSlavery, continued Mr. Lincoln, is not a matter of little\nimportance, it overshadows every other question in which\nwe are interested. It has divided the Methodist and\nPresbyterian churches, and has sown discord in the\nAmerican Tract Society. The churches have split and the\nsociety will follow their example before long. So it will be\nseen that slavery is agitated in the religious as well as in\nthe political world. Judge Douglas is very much afraid in\nthe triumph that the Republican party will lead to a general\nmixture of the white and black races. Perhaps I am wrong\nin saying that he is afraid, so I will correct myself by saying\nthat he pretends to fear that the success of our party will\nresult in the amalgamation of the blacks and whites. I think\nI can show plainly, from documents now before me, that\nJudge Douglas\u2019s fears are groundless. The census of \ntells us that in that year there were over four hundred\nthousand mulattoes in the United States. Now let us take\nwhat is called an Abolition State \u2014 the Republican, slavery-\nhating State of New Hampshire \u2014 and see how many\nmulattoes we can \ufb01nd within her borders. The number\namounts to just one hundred and eighty-four. In the Old\nDominion \u2014 in the Democratic and aristocratic State of\nVirginia \u2014 there were a few more mulattoes than the\nCensus-takers found in New Hampshire. How many do you\nsuppose \nthere \nwere? \nSeventy-nine \nthousand, \nseven\n hundred and seventy-\ufb01ve \u2014 twenty-three thousand more\nthan there were in all the free States! In the slave States\nthere were in , three hundred and forty-eight thousand\nmulattoes all of home production; and in the free States\nthere were less than sixty thousand mulattoes \u2014 and a\nlarge number of them were imported from the South.\n   A\n \n  \n       H A   \nA \n  I     I  .\nSEPT. , .\nI HAVE BEEN requested to give a concise statement of the\ndi\ufb00erence, as I understand it, between the Democratic and\nRepublican parties, on the leading issues of the campaign.\nThis question has been put to me by a gentleman whom I\ndo not know. I do not even know whether he is a friend of\nmine or a supporter of Judge Douglas in this contest, nor\ndoes that make any di\ufb00erence. His question is a proper\none. Lest I should forget it, I will give you my answer\nbefore proceeding with the line of argument I have marked\nout for this discussion.\nThe \ndi\ufb00erence \nbetween \nthe \nRepublican \nand \nthe\nDemocratic parties on the leading issues of this contest, as\nI understand it, is that the former consider slavery a moral,\nsocial and political wrong, while the latter do not consider\nit either a moral, a social or a political wrong; and the\naction of each, as respects the growth of the country and\nthe expansion of our population, is squared to meet these\nviews. I will not a\ufb00irm that the Democratic party consider\nslavery morally, socially and politically right, though their\ntendency to that view has, in my opinion, been constant and\nunmistakable for the past \ufb01ve years. I prefer to take, as the\naccepted maxim of the party, the idea put forth by Judge\n Douglas, that he \u201cdon\u2019t care whether slavery is voted down\nor voted up.\u201d I am quite willing to believe that many\nDemocrats would prefer that slavery should be always\nvoted down, and I know that some prefer that it be always\nvoted up; but I have a right to insist that their action,\nespecially if it be their constant action, shall determine\ntheir ideas and preferences on this subject. Every measure\nof the Democratic party of late years, bearing directly or\nindirectly on the slavery question, has corresponded with\nthis notion of utter indi\ufb00erence whether slavery or freedom\nshall outrun in the race of empire across to the Paci\ufb01c \u2014\nevery measure, I say, up to the Dred Scott decision, where,\nit seems to me, the idea is boldly suggested that slavery is\nbetter than freedom. The Republican party, on the contrary,\nhold that this government was instituted to secure the\nblessings of freedom, and that slavery is an unquali\ufb01ed evil\nto the negro, to the white man, to the soil, and to the State.\nRegarding it as an evil, they will not molest it in the States\nwhere it exists, they will not overlook the constitutional\nguards which our fathers placed around it; they will do\nnothing that can give proper o\ufb00ence to those who hold\nslaves by legal sanction; but they will use every\nconstitutional method to prevent the evil from becoming\nlarger and involving more negroes, more white men, more\nsoil, and more States in its deplorable consequences. They\nwill, if possible, place it where the public mind shall rest in\nthe belief that it is in course of ultimate peaceable\nextinction in God\u2019s own good time. And to this end they\nwill, if possible, restore the government to the policy of the\n fathers, the policy of preserving the new Territories from\nthe \nbaneful \nin\ufb02uence \nof \nhuman \nbondage, \nas \nthe\nNorthwestern Territories were sought to be preserved by\nthe Ordinance of , and the Compromise Act of .\nThey will oppose, in all its length and breadth, the modern\nDemocratic idea, that slavery is as good as freedom, and\nought to have room for expansion all over the continent, if\npeople can be found to carry it. All, or nearly all, of Judge\nDouglas\u2019s arguments are logical, if you admit that slavery is\nas good and as right as freedom, and not one of them is\nworth a rush if you deny it. This is the di\ufb00erence, as I\nunderstand it, between the Republican and Democratic\nparties.\nMy friends, I have endeavored to show you the logical\nconsequences of the Dred Scott decision, which holds that\nthe people of a Territory cannot prevent the establishment\nof slavery in their midst. I have stated what cannot be\ngainsaid, that the grounds upon which this decision is made\nare equally applicable to the free States as to the free\nTerritories, and that the peculiar reasons put forth by Judge\nDouglas for indorsing this decision commit him, in advance,\nto the next decision and to all other decisions corning from\nthe same source. And when, by all these means, you have\nsucceeded in dehumanizing the negro; when you have put\nhim down and made it impossible for him to be but as the\nbeasts of the \ufb01eld; when you have extinguished his soul in\nthis world and placed him where the ray of hope is blown\nout as in the darkness of the damned, are you quite sure\nthat the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you?\n What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and\nindependence? It is not our frowning battlements, our\nbristling sea coasts, our army and our navy. These are not\nour reliance against tyranny All of those may be turned\nagainst us without making us weaker for the struggle. Our\nreliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in\nus. Our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the\nheritage of all men, in all lands everywhere. Destroy this\nspirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism at your\nown doors. Familiarize yourselves with the chains of\nbondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them.\nAccustomed to trample on the rights of others, you have\nlost the genius of your own independence and become the\n\ufb01t subjects of the \ufb01rst cunning tyrant who rises among you.\nAnd let me tell you, that all these things are prepared for\nyou by the teachings of history, if the elections shall\npromise that the next Dred Scott decision and all future\ndecisions will be quietly acquiesced in by the people.\n        \n   I\nI \nSeptember ,? .\nTO \u201cLINNIE\u201d:\n    A sweet plaintive song did I hear\n    And I fancied that she was the singer.\n    May emotions as pure as that song set astir\n    Be the wont that the future shall bring her.\n  \n \n   A   \n \nTO J. U. BROWN.\nSPRINGFIELD, OCT ,  HON. J. U. BROWN.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 I do not perceive how I can express\nmyself more plainly than I have in the fore-going extracts.\nIn four of them I have expressly disclaimed all intention to\nbring about social and political equality between the white\nand black races and in all the rest I have done the same\nthing by clear implication.\nI have made it equally plain that I think the negro is\nincluded in the word \u201cmen\u201d used in the Declaration of\nIndependence.\nI believe the declaration that \u201call men are created equal\u201d\nis the great fundamental principle upon which our free\ninstitutions rest; that negro slavery is violative of that\nprinciple; but that, by our frame of government, that\nprinciple has not been made one of legal obligation; that by\nour frame of government, States which have slavery are to\nretain it, or surrender it at their own pleasure; and that all\nothers \u2014 individuals, free States and national Government\n\u2014 are constitutionally bound to leave them alone about it.\nI believe our Government was thus framed because of\nthe necessity springing from the actual presence of slavery,\nwhen it was framed.\n That such necessity does not exist in the Territories when\nslavery is not present.\nIn his Mendenhall speech Mr. Clay says: \u201cNow as an\nabstract principle there is no doubt of the truth of that\ndeclaration (all men created equal), and it is desirable, in\nthe original construction of society, to keep it in view as a\ngreat fundamental principle.\u201d\nAgain, in the same speech Mr. Clay says: \u201cIf a state of\nnature existed and we were about to lay the foundations of\nsociety, no man would be more strongly opposed than I\nshould to incorporate the institution of slavery among its\nelements.\u201d\nExactly so. In our new free Territories, a state of nature\ndoes exist. In them Congress lays the foundations of\nsociety; and in laying those foundations, I say, with Mr.\nClay, it is desirable that the declaration of the equality of all\nmen shall be kept in view as a great fundamental principle,\nand that Congress, which lays the foundations of society,\nshould, like Mr. Clay, be strongly opposed to the\nincorporation of slavery and its elements.\nBut it does not follow that social and political equality\nbetween whites and blacks must be incorporated because\nslavery must not. The declaration does not so require.\nYours as ever,\nA. LINCOLN\n[Newspaper cuttings of Lincoln\u2019s speeches at Peoria, in\n, at Spring\ufb01eld, Ottawa, Chicago, and Charleston, in\n.

I think we have fairly entered upon\na durable struggle as to whether this nation is to ultimately\nbecome all slave or all free, and though I fall early in the\ncontest, it is nothing if I shall have contributed, in the least\ndegree, to the \ufb01nal rightful result.\nRespectfully yours, A.

(Read the section.)\nSpecial legislation always trenches upon the judicial\ndepartment; and in so far violates Section Two of the\nConstitution. (Read it.)\nJust reasoning \u2014 policy \u2014 is in favor of general\nlegislation \u2014 else the Legislature will be loaded down with\nthe investigation of smaller cases \u2014 a work which the\ncourts ought to perform, and can perform much more\n perfectly. How can the Legislature rightly decide the facts\nbetween P. \n B. and S.C.\nIt is said that under a general law, whenever a R. R. Co.\ngets tired of its debts, it may transfer fraudulently to get\nrid of them. So they may \u2014 so may individuals; and which\n\u2014 the Legislature or the courts \u2014 is best suited to try the\nquestion of fraud in either case?\nIt is said, if a purchaser have acquired legal rights, let\nhim not be robbed of them, but if he needs legislation let\nhim submit to just terms to obtain it.\nLet him, say we, have general law in advance (guarded in\nevery possible way against fraud), so that, when he\nacquires a legal right, he will have no occasion to wait for\nadditional legislation; and if he has practiced fraud let the\ncourts so decide.\n A   \nA  \n I\nI\n    A  AHA\n  I\n \n \n.\nTHE TH SECTION of the Act of Congress, approved Feb.\n, , prescribing rules for the subdivision of sections\nof land within the United States system of surveys,\nstanding unrepealed, in my opinion, is binding on the\nrespective purchasers of di\ufb00erent parts of the same\nsection, and furnishes the true rule for surveyors in\nestablishing lines between them. That law, being in force at\nthe time each became a purchaser, becomes a condition of\nthe purchase.\nAnd, by that law, I think the true rule for dividing into\nquarters any interior section or sections, which is not\nfractional, is to run straight lines through the section from\nthe opposite quarter section corners, \ufb01xing the point where\nsuch straight lines cross, or intersect each other, as the\nmiddle or centre of the section.\nNearly, perhaps quite, all the original surveys are to\nsome extent erroneous, and in some of the sections, greatly\nso. In each of the latter, it is obvious that a more equitable\nmode of division than the above might be adopted; but as\nerror is in\ufb01nitely various perhaps no better single rules can\nbe prescribed.\nAt all events I think the above has been prescribed by the\ncompetent authority.\n SPRINGFIELD, Jany. , .\nA.

MORRIS, Esq.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Your kind note inviting me to deliver a\nlecture at Galesburg is received. I regret to say I cannot do\nso now; I must stick to the courts awhile. I read a sort of\nlecture to three di\ufb00erent audiences during the last month\nand this; but I did so under circumstances which made it a\nwaste of no time whatever.\nYours very truly,\n  \n H.  .  I     A\n \n H   .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April , .\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 YOUR kind note inviting me to attend a\nfestival in Boston, on the th instant, in honor of the\nbirthday of Thomas Je\ufb00erson, was duly received. My\nengagements are such that I cannot attend.\nBearing in mind that about seventy years ago two great\npolitical parties were \ufb01rst formed in this country, that\nThomas Je\ufb00erson was the head of one of them and Boston\nthe headquarters of the other, it is both curious and\ninteresting that those supposed to descend politically from\nthe party opposed to Je\ufb00erson should now be celebrating\nhis birthday in their own original seat of empire, while\nthose claiming political descent from him have nearly\nceased to breathe his name everywhere.\nRemembering, too, that the Je\ufb00erson party was formed\nupon its supposed superior devotion to the personal rights\nof men, holding the rights of property to be secondary only,\nand greatly inferior, and assuming that the so-called\nDemocracy of to-day are the Je\ufb00erson, and their opponents\nthe anti-Je\ufb00erson, party, it will be equally interesting to\nnote how completely the two have changed hands as to the\nprinciple upon which they were originally supposed to be\ndivided. The Democracy of to-day hold the liberty of one\n man to be absolutely nothing, when in con\ufb02ict with another\nman\u2019s right of property; Republicans, on the contrary, are\nfor both the man and the dollar, but in case of con\ufb02ict the\nman before the dollar.\nI remember being once much amused at seeing two\npartially intoxicated men engaged in a \ufb01ght with their\ngreat-coats on, which \ufb01ght, after a long and rather\nharmless contest, ended in each having fought himself out\nof his own coat and into that of the other. If the two leading\nparties of this day are really identical with the two in the\ndays of Je\ufb00erson and Adams, they have performed the same\nfeat as the two drunken men.\nBut soberly, it is now no child\u2019s play to save the\nprinciples of Je\ufb00erson from total overthrow in this nation.\nOne would state with great con\ufb01dence that he could\nconvince any sane child that the simpler propositions of\nEuclid are true; but nevertheless he would fail, utterly, with\none who should deny the de\ufb01nitions and axioms. The\nprinciples of Je\ufb00erson are the de\ufb01nitions and axioms of free\nsociety. And yet they are denied and evaded, with no small\nshow of success. One dashingly calls them \u201cglittering\ngeneralities.\u201d Another bluntly calls them \u201cself-evident lies.\u201d\nAnd others insidiously argue that they apply to \u201csuperior\nraces.\u201d These expressions, di\ufb00ering in form, are identical in\nobject and e\ufb00ect \u2014 the supplanting the principles of free\ngovernment, and restoring those of classi\ufb01cation, caste,\nand legitimacy. They would delight a convocation of\ncrowned heads plotting against the people. They are the\nvanguard, the miners and sappers, of returning despotism.\n We must repulse them, or they will subjugate us. This is a\nworld of compensation; and he who would be no slave must\nconsent to have no slave. Those who deny freedom to\nothers deserve it not for themselves, and, under a just God,\ncannot long retain it. All honor to Je\ufb00erson to the man who,\nin the concrete pressure of a struggle for national\nindependence by a single people, had the coolness,\nforecast, \nand \ncapacity \nto \nintroduce \ninto \na \nmere\nrevolutionary document an abstract truth, applicable to all\nmen and all times, and so to embalm it there that to-day\nand in all coming days it shall be a rebuke and a stumbling-\nblock to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and\noppression.\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

THEODORE CANISIUS.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Your note asking, in behalf of yourself and\nother German citizens, whether I am for or against the\nconstitutional provision in regard to naturalized citizens,\nlately adopted by Massachusetts, and whether I am for or\nagainst a fusion of the Republicans and other opposition\nelements for the canvass of , is received.\nMassachusetts is a sovereign and independent State; and\nit is no privilege of mine to scold her for what she does.\nStill, if from what she has done an inference is sought to be\ndrawn as to what I would do, I may without impropriety\nspeak out. I say, then, that, as I understand the\nMassachusetts provision, I am against its adoption in\nIllinois, or in any other place where I have a right to oppose\nit. Understanding the spirit of our institutions to aim at the\nelevation of men, I am opposed to whatever tends to\ndegrade \nthem. \nI \nhave \nsome \nlittle \nnotoriety \nfor\ncommiserating the oppressed negro; and I should be\nstrangely inconsistent if I could favor any project for\ncurtailing the existing rights of white men, even though\nborn in di\ufb00erent lands, and speaking di\ufb00erent languages\nfrom myself. As to the matter of fusion, I am for it if it can\n be had on Republican grounds; and I am not for it on any\nother terms. A fusion on any other terms would be as\nfoolish as unprincipled. It would lose the whole North,\nwhile the common enemy would still carry the whole South.\nThe question of men is a di\ufb00erent one. There are good,\npatriotic men and able statesmen in the South whom I\nwould cheerfully support, if they would now place\nthemselves on Republican ground, but I am against letting\ndown the Republican standard a hairsbreadth.\nI have written this hastily, but I believe it answers your\nquestions substantially.\nYours truly, A.

And under this act considered by itself\nthe creditors would have a right to require such bonds. But\nyour inquiry in regard to a class of bonds on which no\ninterest is to be paid or shall begin to run until January ,\n, is whether the Act of February , , would not\n authorize you to refuse to give bonds with any coupons\nattached payable before the \ufb01rst day of July, . We have\nvery maturely considered this question and have arrived at\nthe conclusion that you have a right to use such measures\nas will secure the State against the loss of six months\u2019\ninterest on these bonds by the inde\ufb01niteness of the Act of\n. While it cannot be denied that the letter of the laws\nfavor the construction claimed by some of the creditors that\ninterest-bearing bonds were required to be issued to them,\ninasmuch as the restriction that no interest is to run on\nsaid bonds until st January, , relates solely to the\nbonds issued under the Act of . And the Act of \ndirecting you to issue new bonds does not contain this\nrestriction, but directs you to issue coupon bonds.\nNevertheless the very inde\ufb01niteness and generality of the\nAct of , giving no rate of interest, no time due, no\nplace of payment, no postponement of the time when\ninterest \ncommences, \nnecessarily \nimplies \nthat \nthe\nLegislature intended to invest you with a discretion to\nimpose such terms and restrictions as would protect the\ninterest of the State; and we think you have a right and that\nit is your duty to see that the State Bonds are so issued that\nthe State shall not lose six months\u2019 interest. Two plans\npresent themselves either of which will secure the State.\nst. If in literal compliance with the law you issue bonds\nbearing interest from st July, , you may deduct from\nthe bonds presented three thousand from every  ,\nof bonds and issue  , of coupon bonds; by this plan\n  out of  , of principal would be extinguished\n in consideration of paying   interest on the \ufb01rst of\nJanuary,  \u2014 and the interest on the   would\nforever cease; this would be no doubt most advantageous\nto the State. But if the Auditor will not consent to this,\nthen, nd. Cut o\ufb00 of each bond all the coupons payable\nbefore st July, .\nOne of these plans would undoubtedly have been\nprescribed by the Legislature if its attention had been\ndirected to this question.\nMay , .\n   I\n \n \n      A   \nTO H.

I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and\nan \nagreed \nstarting-point \nfor \na \ndiscussion \nbetween\nRepublicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by\nSenator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry: What was the\nunderstanding \nthose \nfathers \nhad \nof \nthe \nquestion\nmentioned?\nWhat is the frame of Government under which we live?\n The answer must be \u2014 the Constitution of the United\nStates. That Constitution consists of the original, framed in\n (and under which the present Government \ufb01rst went\ninto \noperation), \nand \ntwelve \nsubsequently \nframed\namendments, the \ufb01rst ten of which were framed in .\nWho were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I\nsuppose \nthe \n\u201cthirty-nine\u201d \nwho \nsigned \nthe \noriginal\ninstrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that\npart of the present Government. It is almost exactly true to\nsay they framed it, and it is altogether true to say they\nfairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole\nnation at that time.\nTheir names, being familiar to nearly all, and accessible\nto quite all, need not now be repeated.\nI take these \u201cthirty-nine,\u201d for the present, as being our\n\u201cfathers who framed the Government under which we live.\u201d\nWhat is the question which, according to the text, those\nfathers understood \u201cjust as well, and even better than we\ndo now\u201d?\nIt is this: Does the proper division of local from Federal\nauthority, or anything in the Constitution, forbid our\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in our Federal\nTerritories?\nUpon this Senator Douglas holds the a\ufb00irmative, and\nRepublicans the negative. This a\ufb00irmation and denial form\nan issue, and this issue \u2014 this question is precisely what\nthe text declares our fathers understood \u201cbetter than we.\u201d\nLet us now inquire whether the \u201cthirty-nine,\u201d or any of\nthem, acted upon this question; and if they did, how they\n acted upon it \u2014 how they expressed that better\nunderstanding.\nIn , three years before the Constitution \u2014 the\nUnited States then owning the Northwestern Territory, and\nno other \u2014 the Congress of the Confederation had before\nthem the question of prohibiting slavery in that Territory;\nand four of the \u201cthirty nine\u201d who afterward framed the\nConstitution were in that Congress and voted on that\nquestion. Of these, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mi\ufb04in, and\nHugh Williamson voted for the prohibition, thus showing\nthat, in their understanding, no line dividing local from\nFederal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in Federal\nterritory. The other of the four \u2014 James McHenry voted\nagainst the prohibition, showing that, for some cause, he\nthought it improper to vote for it.\nIn , still before the Constitution, but while the\nconvention was in session framing it, and while the\nNorthwestern Territory still was the only Territory owned\nby the United States, the same question of prohibiting\nslavery in the Territory again came before the Congress of\nthe Confederation; and two more of the \u201cthirty-nine\u201d who\nafterward signed the Constitution were in that Congress,\nand voted on the question. They were William Blount and\nWilliam Few; and they both voted for the prohibition thus\nshowing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local\nfrom Federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade\nthe Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal\n territory. This time the prohibition became a law, being part\nof what is now well known as the Ordinance of \u2018.\nThe question of Federal control of slavery in the\nTerritories seems not to have been directly before the\nconvention which framed the original Constitution; and\nhence it is not recorded that the \u201cthirty-nine,\u201d or any of\nthem, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any\nopinion on that precise question.\nIn , by the \ufb01rst Congress which sat under the\nConstitution, an act was passed to enforce the Ordinance of\n\u2018, \nincluding \nthe \nprohibition \nof \nslavery \nin \nthe\nNorthwestern Territory. The bill for this act was reported\nby one of the \u201cthirty-nine,\u201d Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a\nmember \nof \nthe \nHouse \nof \nRepresentatives \nfrom\nPennsylvania. It went through all its stages without a word\nof opposition, and \ufb01nally passed both branches without\nyeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage.\nIn this Congress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine\nfathers who framed the original Constitution. They were\nJohn Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, Wm. S. Johnnson, Roger\nSherman, Robert Morris, Thos. Fitzsimmons, William Few,\nAbraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson, George\nClaimer, Richard Bassett, George Read, Pierce Butler,\nDaniel Carroll, James Madison.\nThis shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing\nlocal \nfrom \nFederal \nauthority, \nnor \nanything \nin \nthe\nConstitution, properly forbade Congress to prohibit slavery\nin the Federal territory; else both their \ufb01delity to correct\n principles and their oath to support the Constitution would\nhave constrained them to oppose the prohibition.\nAgain: George Washington, another of the \u201cthirty nine,\u201d\nwas then President of the United States, and, as such,\napproved and signed the bill; thus completing its validity as\na law, and thus showing that, in his understanding, no line\ndividing local from Federal authority, nor anything in the\nConstitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as\nto slavery in Federal territory.\nNo great while after the adoption of the original\nConstitution, \nNorth \nCarolina \nceded \nto \nthe \nFederal\nGovernment the country now constituting the State of\nTennessee; and, a few years later, Georgia ceded that which\nnow constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama. In\nboth deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding\nStates that the Federal Government should not prohibit\nslavery in the ceded country. Besides this, slavery was then\nactually in the ceded country. Under these circumstances,\nCongress, on taking charge of these countries, did not\nabsolutely prohibit slavery within them. But they did\ninterfere with it \u2014 take control of it \u2014 even there, to a\ncertain extent. In , Congress organized the Territory of\nMississippi: In the act of organization they prohibited the\nbringing of slaves into the Territory from any place without\nthe United States, by \ufb01ne and giving freedom to slaves so\nbrought. This act passed both branches of Congress\nwithout yeas and nays. In that Congress were three of the\n\u201cthirty-nine\u201d who framed the original Constitution. They\nwere John Langdon, George Read, and Abraham Baldwin.\n They all, probably, voted for it. Certainly they would have\nplaced their opposition to it upon record, if, in their\nunderstanding, any line dividing local from Federal\nauthority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade\nthe Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal\nterritory.\nIn \n, \nthe \nFederal \nGovernment \npurchased \nthe\nLouisiana country. Our former territorial acquisitions came\nfrom certain of our own States; but this Louisiana country\nwas acquired from a foreign nation. In , Congress gave\na territorial organization to that part of it which now\nconstitutes the State of Lousiana. New Orleans, lying\nwithin that part, was an old and comparatively large city.\nThere were other considerable towns and settlements, and\nslavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with\nthe people. Congress did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit\nslavery; but they did interfere with it take control of it \u2014 in\na more marked and extensive way than they did in the case\nof Mississippi. The substance of the provision therein made\nin relation to slaves was:\nFirst. That no slave should be imported into the Territory\nfrom foreign parts.\nSecond. That no slave should be carried into it who had\nbeen imported into the United States since the \ufb01rst day of\nMay, .\nThird. That no slave should be carried into it except by\nthe owner, and for his own use as a settler; the penalty in\nall the cases being a \ufb01ne upon the violator of the law, and\nfreedom to the slave.\n This act also was passed without yeas and nays. In the\nCongress which passed it there were two of the \u201cthirty-\nnine.\u201d They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton.\nAs stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable they both\nvoted for it. They would not have allowed it to pass without\nrecording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it\nviolated either the line properly dividing local from Federal\nauthority, or any provision of the Constitution.\nIn - came and passed the Missouri question. Many\nvotes were taken, by yeas and nays, in both branches of\nCongress, upon the various phases of the general question.\nTwo of the \u201cthirty-nine\u201d \u2014 Rufus King and Charles\nPinckney were members of that Congress. Mr. King steadily\nvoted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises,\nwhile Mr. Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery\nprohibition, and against all compromises. By this, Mr. King\nshowed that, in his understanding, no line dividing local\nfrom Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution,\nwas violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in Federal\nterritory; while Mr. Pinckney, by his vote, showed that in his\nunderstanding there was some su\ufb00icient reason for\nopposing such prohibition in that case.\nThe cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the\n\u201cthirty-nine,\u201d or of any of them, upon the direct issue,\nwhich I have been able to discover.\nTo enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four\nin , two in , seventeen in , three in , two\nin , and two in - \u2014 there would be thirty of\nthem. But this would be counting, John Langdon, Roger\n Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read, each\ntwice, and Abraham Baldwin three times. The true number\nof those of the \u201cthirty-nine\u201d whom I have shown to have\nacted upon the question which, by the text, they\nunderstood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen\nnot shown to have acted upon it in any way.\nHere, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine\nfathers \u201cwho framed the Government under which we live,\u201d\nwho have, upon their o\ufb00icial responsibility and their\ncorporal oaths, acted upon the very question which the text\na\ufb00irms they \u201cunderstood just as well, and even better than\nwe do now\u201d; and twenty-one of them \u2014 a clear majority of\nthe whole \u201cthirty-nine\u201d \u2014 so acting upon it as to make them\nguilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury, if, in\ntheir understanding, any proper division between local and\nFederal authority, or anything in the Constitution they had\nmade themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal\nTerritories. Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions\nspeak \nlouder \nthan \nwords, \nso \nactions \nunder \nsuch\nresponsibilities speak still louder.\nTwo of the twenty-three voted against Congressional\nprohibition of slavery in the Federal Territories, in the\ninstances in which they acted upon the question. But for\nwhat reasons they so voted is not known. They may have\ndone so because they thought a proper division of local\nfrom Federal authority, or some provision or principle of\nthe Constitution, stood in the way; or they may, without any\nsuch question, have voted against the prohibition on what\n appeared to them to be su\ufb00icient grounds of expediency.\nNo one who has sworn to support the Constitution can\nconscientiously vote for what he understands to be an\nunconstitutional measure, however expedient he may think\nit; but one may and ought to vote against a measure which\nhe deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he deems it\ninexpedient. It therefore would be unsafe to set down even\nthe two who voted against the prohibition as having done\nso because, in their understanding, any proper division of\nlocal \nfrom \nFederal \nauthority, \nor \nanything \nin \nthe\nConstitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as\nto slavery in Federal territory.\nThe remaining sixteen of the \u201cthirty-nine,\u201d so far as I\nhave discovered, have left no record of their understanding\nupon the direct question of Federal control on slavery in\nthe Federal Territories. But there is much reason to believe\nthat their understanding upon that question would not have\nappeared \ndi\ufb00erent \nfrom \nthat \nof \ntheir \ntwenty-three\ncompeers, had it been manifested at all.\nFor the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have\npurposely omitted whatever understanding may have been\nmanifested by any person, however distinguished, other\nthan the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original\nConstitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted\nwhatever understanding may have been manifested by any\nof the \u201cthirty tine\u201d even on any other phase of the general\nquestion of slavery. If we should look into their acts and\ndeclarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave\ntrade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it\n would appear to us that on the direct question of Federal\ncontrol of slavery in Federal Territories, the sixteen, if they\nhad acted at all, would probably have acted just as the\ntwenty-three did. Among that sixteen were several of the\nmost noted anti-slavery men of those times \u2014 as Dr.\nFranklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Gouverneur Morris\nwhile there was not one now known to have been\notherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South\nCarolina.\nThe sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers\nwho framed the original Constitution, twenty-one \u2014 a clear\nmajority of the whole \u2014 certainly understood that no\nproper division of local from Federal authority, nor any part\nof the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to\ncontrol slavery in the Federal Territories; whilst all the rest\nprobably \nhad \nthe \nsame \nunderstanding. \nSuch,\nunquestionably, was the understanding of our fathers who\nframed the original Constitution; and the text a\ufb00irms that\nthey understood the question \u201cbetter than we.\u201d\nBut, so far, I have been considering the understanding of\nthe question manifested by the framers of the original\nConstitution. In and by the original instrument, a mode was\nprovided for amending it; and, as I have already stated, the\npresent frame of \u201cthe Government under which we live\u201d\nconsists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles\nframed and adopted since. Those who now insist that\nFederal control of slavery in Federal Territories violates the\nConstitution, point us to the provisions which they suppose\nit thus violates; and, as I understand, they all \ufb01x upon\n provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the\noriginal instrument. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott\ncase, plant themselves upon the \ufb01fth amendment, which\nprovides that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or\nproperty without due process of law\u201d; while Senator\nDouglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon\nthe tenth amendment, providing that \u201cthe powers not\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution\u201d \u201care\nreserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d\nNow, it so happens that these amendments were framed\nby the \ufb01rst Congress which sat under the Constitution \u2014\nthe identical Congress which passed the act already\nmentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the\nNorthwestern Territory. Not only was it the same Congress,\nbut they were the identical same individual men who, at the\nsame session, and at the same time within the session, had\nunder consideration, and in progress toward maturity,\nthese Constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting\nslavery in all the territory the nation then owned. The\nConstitutional amendments were introduced before and\npassed after the act enforcing the Ordinance of \u2018; so that,\nduring the whole pendency of the act to enforce the\nOrdinance, the Constitutional amendments were also\npending.\nThe seventy-six members of that Congress, including\nsixteen of the framers of the original Constitution, as\nbefore stated, were pre-eminently our fathers who framed\nthat part of \u201cthe Government under which we live,\u201d which\n is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to\ncontrol slavery in the Federal Territories.\nIs it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to\na\ufb00irm that the two things which that Congress deliberately\nframed, and carried to maturity at the same time, are\nabsolutely inconsistent with each other? And does not such\na\ufb00irmation become impudently absurd when coupled with\nthe other a\ufb00irmation from the same mouth, that those who\ndid the two things alleged to be inconsistent understood\nwhether they really were inconsistent better than we \u2014\nbetter than he who a\ufb00irms that they are inconsistent?\nIt is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine framers of\nthe original Constitution, and the seventy-six members of\nthe Congress which framed the amendments thereto, taken\ntogether, do certainly include those who may be fairly\ncalled \u201cour fathers who framed the Government under\nwhich we live.\u201d And, so assuming, I defy any man to show\nthat any one of them ever, in his whole life, declared that,\nin his understanding, any proper division of local from\nFederal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade\nthe Federal Government to control as to slavery in the\nFederal Territories. I go a step further. I defy any one to\nshow that any living man in the world ever did, prior to the\nbeginning of the present century (and I might almost say\nprior to the beginning of the last half of the present\ncentury), declare that, in his understanding, any proper\ndivision of local from Federal authority, or any part of the\nConstitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as\nto slavery in the Federal Territories. To those who now so\n declare, I give not only \u201cour fathers who framed the\nGovernment under which we live,\u201d but with them all other\nliving men within the century in which it was framed,\namong whom to search, and they shall not be able to \ufb01nd\nthe evidence of a single man agreeing with them.\nNow and here let me guard a little against being\nmisunderstood. I do not mean to say we are bound to follow\nimplicitly in whatever our fathers did. To do so would be to\ndiscard all the lights of current experience to reject all\nprogress, all improvement. What I do say is that, if we\nwould supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any\ncase, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and\nargument so clear, that even their great authority, fairly\nconsidered and weighed, cannot stand; and most surely not\nin a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the\nquestion better than we.\nIf any man at this day sincerely believes that proper\ndivision of local from Federal authority, or any part of the\nConstitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as\nto slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so,\nand to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair\nargument which he can. But he has no right to mislead\nothers who have less access to history, and less leisure to\nstudy it, into the false belief that \u201cour fathers who framed\nthe Government under which we live\u201d were of the same\nopinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for\ntruthful evidence and fair argument. If any man at this day\nsincerely \nbelieves \n\u201cour \nfathers, \nwho \nframed \nthe\nGovernment under which we live,\u201d used and applied\n principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them to\nunderstand that a proper division of local from Federal\nauthority, or some part of the Constitution, forbids the\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal\nTerritories, he is right to say so. But he should, at the same\ntime, brave the responsibility of declaring that, in his\nopinion, he understands their principles better than they\ndid themselves; and especially should he not shirk that\nresponsibility by asserting that they \u201cunderstood the\nquestion just as well, and even better than we do now.\u201d\nBut enough! Let all who believe that \u201cour fathers, who\nframed the Government under which we live, understood\nthis question just as well, and even better than we do now,\u201d\nspeak as they spoke, and act as they acted upon it. This is\nall Republicans ask \u2014 all Republicans desire \u2014 in relation\nto slavery. As those fathers marked it, so let it be again\nmarked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated\nand protected only because of, and so far as, its actual\npresence among us makes that toleration and protection a\nnecessity. Let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not\ngrudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained. For this\nRepublicans contend, and with this, so far as I know or\nbelieve, they will be content.\nAnd now, if they would listen \u2014 as I suppose they will not\n\u2014 I would address a few words to the Southern people.\nI would say to them: You consider yourselves a\nreasonable and a just people; and I consider that in the\ngeneral qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior\nto any other people. Still, when you speak of us\n Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or,\nat the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a\nhearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to\n\u201cBlack Republicans.\u201d In all your contentions with one\nanother, each of you deems an unconditional condemnation\nof \u201cBlack Republicanism\u201d as the \ufb01rst thing to be attended\nto. Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an\nindispensable prerequisite license, so to speak among you,\nto be admitted or permitted to speak at all: Now; can you,\nor not, be prevailed upon to pause, and to consider whether\nthis is quite just to us, or even to yourselves? Bring forward\nyour charges and speci\ufb01cations, and then be patient long\nenough to hear us deny or justify.\nYou say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an\nissue; and the burden of proof is upon you. You produce\nyour proof; and what is it? Why, that our party has no\nexistence in your section \u2014 gets no votes in your section.\nThe fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If\nit does, then in case we should, without change of principle,\nbegin to get votes in your section, we should thereby cease\nto be sectional. You cannot escape this conclusion; and yet,\nare you willing to abide by it? If you are, you will probably\nsoon \ufb01nd that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall\nget votes in your section this very year. You will then begin\nto discover, as the truth plainly is, that your proof, does not\ntouch the issue. The fact that we get no votes in your\nsection is a fact of your making, and not of ours. And if\nthere be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and\nremains so until you show that we repel you by, some\n wrong principle or practice. If we do repel you by any\nwrong principle or practice, the fault is ours; but this\nbrings you to where you ought to have started to a\ndiscussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If our\nprinciple, put in practice, would wrong your section for the\nbene\ufb01t of ours, or for any other object, then our principle,\nand we with it, are sectional, and are justly opposed and\ndenounced as such. Meet us, then, on the question of\nwhether our principle, put in practice, would wrong your\nsection; and so meet us as if it were possible that\nsomething may be said on our side. Do you accept the\nchallenge? No! Then you really believe that the principle\nwhich \u201cour fathers who framed the Government under\nwhich we live\u201d thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and\nindorse it again and again, upon their o\ufb00icial oaths, is in\nfact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation\nwithout a moment\u2019s consideration.\nSome of you delight to \ufb02aunt in our faces the warning\nagainst sectional parties given by Washington in his\nFarewell Address. Less than eight years before Washington\ngave that warning, he had, as President of the United\nStates, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing\nthe prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory,\nwhich act embodied the policy of the Government upon that\nsubject up to, and at, the very moment he penned that\nwarning; and about one year after he penned it, he wrote\nLa Fayette that he considered that prohibition a wise\nmeasure, expressing in the same connection his hope that\nwe should at some time have a confederacy of free States.\n Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has\nsince arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a\nweapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against\nyou? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the\nblame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy,\nor upon you, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of\nWashington, and we commend it to you, together with his\nexample pointing to the right application of it.\nBut \nyou \nsay \nyou \nare \nconservative \n\u2014 \neminently\nconservative \u2014 while we are revolutionary, destructive, or\nsomething, of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not\nadherence to the old and tried, against a new and untried?\nWe stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the\npoint in controversy which was adopted by \u201cour fathers\nwho framed the Government under which we live\u201d; while\nyou with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that\nold policy and insist upon substituting something new.\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that\nsubstitute shall be. You are divided on new propositions\nand plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and\ndenouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you are\nfor \nreviving \nthe \nforeign \nslave \ntrade; \nsome \nfor \na\nCongressional slave code for the Territories; some for\nCongress forbidding the Territories to prohibit slavery\nwithin their limits; some for maintaining slavery in the\nTerritories through the judiciary; some for the \u201cgur-reat\npur-rinciple\u201d that \u201cif one man would enslave another, no\nthird man should object,\u201d fantastically called \u201cpopular\nsovereignty\u201d; but never a man among you in favor of\n Federal prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories,\naccording to the practice of \u201cour fathers who framed the\nGovernment under which we live.\u201d Not one of all your\nvarious plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the\ncentury within which our Government originated. Consider,\nthen, whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves,\nand your charge of destructiveness against us, are based\non the most clear and stable foundations.\nAgain: You say we have made the slavery question more\nprominent than it formerly was. We deny it. We admit that\nit is more prominent, but we deny that we made it so. It\nwas not we, but you, who discarded the old policy of the\nfathers. We resisted and still resist your innovation; and\nthence comes the greater prominence of the question.\nWould you have that question reduced to its former\nproportions? Go back to that old policy. What has been will\nbe again, under the same conditions. If you would have the\npeace of the old times, readopt the precepts and policy of\nthe old times.\nYou charge that we stir up insurrections among your\nslaves. We deny it; and what is your proof\u2019? Harper\u2019s Ferry!\nJohn Brown!! John Brown was no Republican; and you have\nfailed to implicate a single Republican in his Harper\u2019s Ferry\nenterprise. If any member of our party is guilty in that\nmatter you know it or you do not know it. If you do know it,\nyou are inexcusable for not designating the man and\nproving the fact. If you do not know it, you are inexcusable\nfor asserting it, and especially for persisting in the\nassertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof.\n You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one\ndoes not know to be true is simply malicious slander.\nSome of you admit that no Republican designedly aided\nor encouraged the Harper\u2019s Ferry a\ufb00air, but still insist that\nour doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such\nresults. We do not believe it. We know we hold to no\ndoctrine, and make no declaration, which were not held to\nand made by our fathers who framed the Government\nunder which we live. You never dealt fairly by us in relation\nto this a\ufb00air. When it occurred, some important State\nelections were near at hand, and you were in evident glee\nwith the belief that, by charging the blame upon us, you\ncould get an advantage of us in those elections. The\nelections came, and your expectations were not quite\nful\ufb01lled. Every Republican man knew that, as to himself at\nleast, your charge was a slander, and he was not much\ninclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. Republican\ndoctrines and declarations are accompanied with a\ncontinued protest against any interference whatever with\nyour slaves, or with you about your slaves. Surely, this does\nnot encourage them to revolt. True, we do, in common with\n\u201cour fathers, who framed the Government under which we\nlive,\u201d declare our belief that slavery is wrong; but the\nslaves do not hear us declare even this. For any thing we\nsay or do, the slaves would scarcely know there is a\nRepublican party. I believe they would not, in fact,\ngenerally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in\ntheir hearing. In your political contests among yourselves,\neach faction charges the other with sympathy with Black\n Republicanism; and then, to give point to the charge,\nde\ufb01nes Black Republicanism to simply be insurrection,\nblood, and thunder among the slaves.\nSlave insurrections are no more common now than they\nwere before the Republican party was organized. What\ninduced the Southampton insurrection, twenty-eight years\nago, in which, at least, three times as many lives were lost\nas at Harper\u2019s Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your very\nelastic fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was \u201cgot\nup by Black Republicanism.\u201d In the present state of things\nin the United States, I do not think a general or even a very\nextensive slave insurrection is possible. The indispensable\nconcert of action cannot be attained. The slaves have no\nmeans of rapid communication; nor can incendiary\nfreemen, black or white, supply it. The explosive materials\nare everywhere in parcels; but there neither are, nor can\nbe supplied the indispensable connecting trains.\nMuch is said by Southern people about the a\ufb00ection of\nslaves for their masters and mistresses; and a part of it, at\nleast, is true. A plot for an uprising could scarcely be\ndevised and communicated to twenty individuals before\nsome one of them, to save the life of a favorite master or\nmistress, would divulge it. This is the rule; and the slave\nrevolution in Hayti was not an exception to it, but a case\noccurring under peculiar circumstances. The gunpowder\nplot of British history, though not connected with slaves,\nwas more in point. In that case, only about twenty were\nadmitted to the secret; and yet one of them, in his anxiety\nto save a friend, betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by\n consequence, averted the calamity. Occasional poisonings\nfrom the kitchen, and open or stealthy assassinations in the\n\ufb01eld, and local revolts, extending to a score or so, will\ncontinue to occur as the natural results of slavery; but no\ngeneral insurrection of slaves, as I think, can happen in this\ncountry for a long time. Whoever much fears or much\nhopes for such an event will be alike disappointed.\nIn the language of Mr. Je\ufb00erson, uttered many years ago,\n\u201cIt is still in our power to direct the process of\nemancipation and deportation peaceably, and in such slow\ndegrees as that the evil will wear o\ufb00 insensibly, and their\nplaces be, pari passu, \ufb01lled up by free white laborers. If, on\nthe contrary, it is left to force itself on, human nature must\nshudder at the prospect held up.\u201d\nMr. Je\ufb00erson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the\npower of emancipation is in the Federal Government. He\nspoke of Virginia; and, as to the power of emancipation, I\nspeak of the slave holding States only. The Federal\nGovernment, however, as we insist, has the power of\nrestraining the extension of the institution \u2014 the power to\ninsure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any\nAmerican soil which is now free from slavery.\nJohn Brown\u2019s e\ufb00ort was peculiar. It was not a slave\ninsurrection. It was an attempt by white men to get up a\nrevolt among slaves, in which the slaves refused to\nparticipate. In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves, with all\ntheir ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed.\nThat a\ufb00air, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many\nattempts related in history at the assassination of kings and\n emperors. An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a\npeople till he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to\nliberate them. He ventures the attempt, which ends in little\nelse than his own execution. Orsini\u2019s attempt on Louis\nNapoleon and John Brown\u2019s attempt at Harper\u2019s Ferry\nwere, in their philosophy, precisely the same. The\neagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case,\nand on New England in the other, does not disprove the\nsameness of the two things.\nAnd how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use\nof John Brown, Helper\u2019s Book, and the like, break up the\nRepublican organization? Human action can be modi\ufb01ed to\nsome extent, but human nature cannot be changed. There\nis a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation,\nwhich cast at least a million and a half of votes. You cannot\ndestroy that judgment and feeling \u2014 that sentiment \u2014 by\nbreaking up the political organization which rallies around\nit. You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has\nbeen formed into order in the face of your heaviest \ufb01re; but\nif you could, how much would you gain by forcing the\nsentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of\nthe ballot-box, into some other channel? What would that\nother channel probably be? Would the number of John\nBrowns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?\nBut you will break up the Union rather than submit to a\ndenial of your constitutional rights.\nThat has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be\npalliated, if not fully justi\ufb01ed, were we proposing, by the\nmere force of numbers, to deprive you of some right plainly\n written down in the Constitution. But we are proposing no\nsuch thing.\nWhen you make these declarations, you have a speci\ufb01c\nand well-understood allusion to an assumed constitutional\nright of yours to take slaves into the Federal Territories,\nand to hold them there as property. But no such right is\nspeci\ufb01cally written in the Constitution. That instrument is\nliterally silent about any such right. We, on the contrary,\ndeny that such a right has any existence in the\nConstitution, even by implication.\nYour purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy\nthe Government unless you be allowed to construe and\nenforce the Constitution as you please on all points in\ndispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin, in all\nevents.\nThis, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps you will\nsay \nthe \nSupreme \nCourt \nhas \ndecided \nthe \ndisputed\nconstitutional question in your favor. Not quite so. But,\nwaiving the lawyer\u2019s distinction between dictum and\ndecision, the court have decided the question for you in a\nsort of way. The court have substantially said it is your\nconstitutional right to take slaves into the Federal\nTerritories, and to hold them there as property. When I say,\nthe decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made\nin a divided court, by a bare majority of the judges, and\nthey not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for\nmaking it; that it is so made as that its avowed supporters\ndisagree with one another about its meaning, and that it\nwas mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact \u2014 the\n statement in the opinion that \u201cthe right of property in a\nslave \nis \ndistinctly \nand \nexpressly \na\ufb00irmed \nin \nthe\nConstitution.\u201d\nAn inspection of the Constitution will show that the right\nof property in a slave is not \u201cdistinctly and expressly\na\ufb00irmed\u201d in it. Bear in mind, the judges do not pledge their\njudicial opinion that such right is impliedly a\ufb00irmed in the\nConstitution; but they pledge their veracity that it is\n\u201cdistinctly and expressly\u201d a\ufb00irmed there\u2014 \u201cdistinctly,\u201d that\nis, not mingled with anything else; \u201cexpressly,\u201d that is, in\nwords meaning just that, without the aid of any inference,\nand susceptible of no other meaning.\nIf they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such\nright is a\ufb00irmed in the instrument by implication, it would\nbe open to others to show that neither the word \u201cslave\u201d nor\n\u201cslavery\u201d is to be found in the Constitution, nor the word\n\u201cproperty\u201d even, in any connection with language alluding\nto the things slave or slavery; and that wherever in that\ninstrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a \u201cperson\u201d;\nand wherever his master\u2019s legal right in relation to him is\nalluded to, it is spoken of as \u201cservice or labor which may be\ndue,\u201d as a debt payable in service or labor. Also, it would be\nopen to show, by contemporaneous history, that this mode\nof alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of speaking of\nthem, was employed on purpose to exclude from the\nConstitution the idea that there could be property in man.\nTo show all this, is easy and certain.\nWhen this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought\nto their notice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will\n withdraw the mistaken statement, and reconsider the\nconclusion based upon it?\nAnd then it is to be remembered that \u201cour fathers; who\nframed the Government under which we live\u201d, \u2014 the men\nwho \nmade \nthe \nConstitution \n\u2014 \ndecided \nthis \nsame\nconstitutional question in our favor, long ago; decided it\nwithout division among themselves, when making the\ndecision, without division among themselves about the\nmeaning of it after it was made, and, so far as any evidence\nis left, without basing it upon any mistaken statement of\nfacts.\nUnder all these circumstances, do you really feel\nyourselves justi\ufb01ed to break up this Government unless\nsuch a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted\nto as a conclusive and \ufb01nal rule of political action? But you\nwill not abide the election of a Republican President! In\nthat supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union;\nand then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it\nwill be upon us! That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol\nto my ear, and mutters through his teeth, \u201cstand and\ndeliver, or I shall kill you, and then you\u2019ll be a murderer!\u201d\nTo be sure, what the robber demanded of me-my money\nwas my own, and I had a clear right to keep it; but it was no\nmore my own than my vote is my own; and the threat of\ndeath to me, to extort my money, and the threat of\ndestruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be\ndistinguished in principle.\nA few words now to Republicans: It is exceedingly\ndesirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at\n peace and in harmony one with another. Let us Republicans\ndo our part to have it so. Even though much provoked, let\nus do nothing through passion and ill temper. Even though\nthe Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us\ncalmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our\ndeliberate view of our duty, we possibly can. Judging by all\nthey say and do, and by the subject and nature of their\ncontroversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will\nsatisfy them.\nWill they be satis\ufb01ed if the Territories be unconditionally\nsurrendered to them? We know they will not. In all their\npresent complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely\nmentioned. Invasions and insurrections are the rage now.\nWill it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing to do\nwith invasions and, insurrections? We know it will not. We\nso know because we know we never had anything to do\nwith invasions and insurrections; and yet this total\nabstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the\ndenunciation.\nThe question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this:\nWe must not only let them alone, but we must, somehow,\nconvince them that we do let them alone. This, we know by\nexperience, is no easy task. We have been so trying to\nconvince them from the very beginning of our organization,\nbut with no success. In all our platforms and speeches we\nhave constantly protested our purpose to let them alone;\nbut this has had no tendency to convince them. Alike\nunavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never\ndetected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.\n These natural and apparently adequate means all failing,\nwhat will convince them? This, and this only: cease to call\nslavery wrong, and join them in calling it right. And this\nmust be done thoroughly \u2014 done in acts as well as in\nwords. Silence will not be tolerated \u2014 we must place\nourselves avowedly with them. Senator Douglas\u2019s new\nsedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all\ndeclarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in\npolitics, in presses, in pulpits; or in private. We must arrest\nand return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We\nmust pull down our free State constitutions. The whole\natmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition\nto slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their\ntroubles proceed from us.\nI am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in\nthis way. Most of them would probably say to us, \u201cLet us\nalone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about\nslavery.\u201d But we do let them alone have never disturbed\nthem \u2014 so that after all it is what we say which dissatis\ufb01es\nthem. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we\ncease saying.\nI am also aware they have not as yet, in terms, demanded\nthe overthrow of our free State constitutions. Yet those\nconstitutions declare the wrong of slavery, with more\nsolemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it; and\nwhen all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the\noverthrow of these constitutions will be demanded, and\nnothing be left to resist the demand. It is nothing to the\ncontrary, that they do not demand the whole of this just\n now. Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do,\nthey \ncan \nvoluntarily \nstop \nnowhere \nshort \nof \nthis\nconsummation. Holding, as they do, that slavery is morally\nright, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a\nfull national recognition of it, as a legal right and a social\nblessing.\nNor can we justi\ufb01ably withhold this on any ground save\nour conviction that slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all\nwords, acts, laws, and constitutions against it are\nthemselves wrong, and should be silenced and swept away.\nIf it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality its\nuniversality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its\nextension \u2014 its enlargement. All they ask we could readily\ngrant if we thought slavery right; all we ask they could as\nreadily grant, if they thought it wrong. Their thinking it\nright and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon\nwhich depends the whole controversy. Thinking it right, as\nthey do, they are not to blame for desiring its full\nrecognition, as being right; but thinking it wrong, as we do,\ncan we yield to them? Can we cast our votes with their\nview, and against our own? In view of our moral, social, and\npolitical responsibilities, can we do this? Wrong as we think\nslavery is, we can yet a\ufb00ord to let it alone where it is,\nbecause that much is due to the necessity arising from its\nactual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes\nwill prevent it, allow it to spread into the national\nTerritories, and to overrun us here in these free States? If\nour sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty,\nfearlessly and e\ufb00ectively. Let us be diverted by none of\n those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so\nindustriously plied and belabored-contrivances such as\ngroping for some middle ground between the right and the\nwrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither\na living man nor a dead man-such as a policy of \u201cdon\u2019t\ncare\u201d on a question about which all true men do care \u2014\nsuch as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield\nto Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling, not\nthe sinners, but the righteous to repentance \u2014 such as\ninvocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what\nWashington said, and undo what Washington did.\nNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false\naccusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces\nof destruction to the Government nor of dungeons to\nourselves. LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES\nMIGHT, AND IN THAT FAITH LET US, TO THE END, DARE\nTO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT.\n      H A  \n \n HA  \n   \n   I \n   \nA  H\n      \nMR. PRESIDENT, AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW\nHAVEN: \u2014 If the Republican party of this nation shall ever\nhave the national House entrusted to its keeping, it will be\nthe duty of that party to attend to all the a\ufb00airs of national\nhousekeeping. Whatever matters of importance may come\nup, \nwhatever \ndi\ufb00iculties \nmay \narise \nin \nits \nway \nof\nadministration of the Government, that party will then have\nto attend to. It will then be compelled to attend to other\nquestions, besides this question which now assumes an\noverwhelming importance \u2014 the question of slavery. It is\ntrue that in the organization of the Republican party this\nquestion of slavery was more important than any other:\nindeed, so much more important has it become that no\nmore national question can even get a hearing just at\npresent. The old question of tari\ufb00 \u2014 a matter that will\nremain one of the chief a\ufb00airs of national house-keeping to\nall time; the question of the management of \ufb01nancial\na\ufb00airs; the question of the disposition of the public domain\nhow shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well\nsettled, and of making there the homes of a free and happy\npeople? these will remain open and require attention for a\ngreat while yet, and these questions will have to be\nattended to by whatever party has the control of the\n Government. Yet, just now, they cannot even obtain a\nhearing, and I do not propose to detain you upon these\ntopics or what sort of hearing they should have when\nopportunity shall come.\nFor, whether we will or not, the question of slavery is the\nquestion, the all-absorbing topic of the day. It is true that\nall of us \u2014 and by that I mean, not the Republican party\nalone, but the whole American people, here and elsewhere\n\u2014 all of us wish this question settled, wish it out of the way.\nIt stands in the way, and prevents the adjustment, and the\ngiving of necessary attention to other questions of national\nhouse-keeping. The people of the whole nation agree that\nthis question ought to be settled, and yet it is not settled.\nAnd the reason is that they are not yet agreed how it shall\nbe settled. All wish it done, but some wish one way and\nsome another, and some a third, or fourth, or \ufb01fth; di\ufb00erent\nbodies are pulling in di\ufb00erent directions, and none of them,\nhaving a decided majority, are able to accomplish the\ncommon object.\nIn the beginning of the year , a new policy was\ninaugurated with the avowed object and con\ufb01dent promise\nthat it would entirely and forever put an end to the slavery\nagitation. It was again and again declared that under this\npolicy, when once successfully established, the country\nwould be forever rid of this whole question. Yet under the\noperation of that policy this agitation has not only not\nceased, but it has been constantly augmented. And this too,\nalthough, from the day of its introduction, its friends, who\npromised that it would wholly end all agitation, constantly\n insisted, down to the time that the Lecompton Bill was\nintroduced, that it was working admirably, and that its\ninevitable tendency was to remove the question forever\nfrom the politics of the country. Can you call to mind any\nDemocratic speech, made after the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise, down to the time of the Lecompton Bill, in\nwhich it was not predicted that the slavery agitation was\njust at an end, that \u201cthe abolition excitement was played\nout,\u201d \u201cthe Kansas question was dead,\u201d \u201cthey have made the\nmost they can out of this question and it is now forever\nsettled\u201d? But since the Lecompton Bill no Democrat, within\nmy experience, has ever pretended that he could see the\nend. That cry has been dropped. They themselves do not\npretend, now, that the agitation of this subject has come to\nan end yet.\nThe truth is that this question is one of national\nimportance, and we cannot help dealing with it; we must do\nsomething about it, whether we will or not. We cannot\navoid it; the subject is one we cannot avoid considering; we\ncan no more avoid it than a man can live without eating. It\nis upon us; it attaches to the body politic as much and\nclosely as the natural wants attach to our natural bodies.\nNow I think it important that this matter should be taken\nup in earnest, and really settled: And one way to bring\nabout a true settlement of the question is to understand its\ntrue magnitude.\nThere have been many e\ufb00orts made to settle it. Again\nand again it has been fondly hoped that it was settled; but\nevery time it breaks out afresh, and more violently than\n ever. It was settled, our fathers hoped, by the Missouri\nCompromise, but it did not stay settled. Then the\ncompromises of  were declared to be a full and \ufb01nal\nsettlement of the question. The two great parties, each in\nnational convention, adopted resolutions declaring that the\nsettlement made by the Compromise of  was a \ufb01nality\nthat it would last forever. Yet how long before it was\nunsettled again? It broke out again in , and blazed\nhigher and raged more furiously than ever before, and the\nagitation has not rested since.\nThese repeated settlements must have some faults about\nthem. There must be some inadequacy in their very nature\nto the purpose to which they were designed. We can only\nspeculate as to where that fault, that inadequacy, is, but we\nmay perhaps pro\ufb01t by past experiences.\nI think that one of the causes of these repeated failures is\nthat \nour \nbest \nand \ngreatest \nmen \nhave \ngreatly\nunderestimated the size of this question. They have\nconstantly brought forward small cures for great sores \u2014\nplasters too small to cover the wound. That is one reason\nthat \nall \nsettlements \nhave \nproved \ntemporary \n\u2014 \nso\nevanescent.\nLook at the magnitude of this subject: One sixth of our\npopulation, in round numbers \u2014 not quite one sixth, and\nyet more than a seventh, \u2014 about one sixth of the whole\npopulation of the United States are slaves. The owners of\nthese slaves consider them property. The e\ufb00ect upon the\nminds of the owners is that of property, and nothing else it\ninduces them to insist upon all that will favorably a\ufb00ect its\n value as property, to demand laws and institutions and a\npublic policy that shall increase and secure its value, and\nmake it durable, lasting, and universal. The e\ufb00ect on the\nminds of the owners is to persuade them that there is no\nwrong in it. The slaveholder does not like to be considered\na mean fellow for holding that species of property, and\nhence, he has to struggle within himself and sets about\narguing himself into the belief that slavery is right. The\nproperty in\ufb02uences his mind. The dissenting minister who\nargued some theological point with one of the established\nchurch was always met with the reply, \u201cI can\u2019t see it so.\u201d\nHe opened a Bible and pointed him a passage, but the\northodox minister replied, \u201cI can\u2019t see it so.\u201d Then he\nshowed him a single word\u2014 \u201cCan you see that?\u201d \u201cYes, I see\nit,\u201d was the reply. The dissenter laid a guinea over the word\nand asked, \u201cDo you see it now?\u201d So here. Whether the\nowners of this species of property do really see it as it is, it\nis not for me to say, but if they do, they see it as it is\nthrough two thousand millions of dollars, and that is a\npretty thick coating. Certain it is that they do not see it as\nwe see it. Certain it is that this two thousand millions of\ndollars, invested in this species of property, all so\nconcentrated that the mind can grasp it at once \u2014 this\nimmense pecuniary interest \u2014 has its in\ufb02uence upon their\nminds.\nBut here in Connecticut and at the North slavery does\nnot exist, and we see it through no such medium.\nTo us it appears natural to think that slaves are human\nbeings; men, not property; that some of the things, at least,\n stated about men in the Declaration of Independence apply\nto them as well as to us. I say we think, most of us, that this\ncharter of freedom applies to the slaves as well as to\nourselves; that the class of arguments put forward to batter\ndown that idea are also calculated to break down the very\nidea of a free government, even for white men, and to\nundermine the very foundations of free society. We think\nslavery a great moral wrong, and, while we do not claim\nthe right to touch it where it exists, we wish to treat it as a\nwrong in the Territories, where our votes will reach it. We\nthink that a respect for ourselves, a regard for future\ngenerations and for the God that made us, require that we\nput down this wrong where our votes will properly reach it.\nWe think that species of labor an injury to free white men\n\u2014 in short, we think slavery a great moral, social, and\npolitical evil, tolerable only because, and so far as, its\nactual existence makes it necessary to tolerate it, and that\nbeyond that it ought to be treated as a wrong.\nNow these two ideas, the property idea that slavery is\nright, and the idea that it is wrong, come into collision, and\ndo actually produce that irrepressible con\ufb02ict which Mr.\nSeward has been so roundly abused for mentioning. The\ntwo ideas con\ufb02ict, and must con\ufb02ict.\nAgain, in its political aspect, does anything in any way\nendanger the perpetuity of this Union but that single thing,\nslavery? Many of our adversaries are anxious to claim that\nthey are specially devoted to the Union, and take pains to\ncharge upon us hostility to the Union. Now we claim that\nwe are the only true Union men, and we put to them this\n one proposition: Whatever endangers this Union, save and\nexcept slavery? Did any other thing ever cause a moment\u2019s\nfear? All men must agree that this thing alone has ever\nendangered the perpetuity of the Union. But if it was\nthreatened by any other in\ufb02uence, would not all men say\nthat the best thing that could be done, if we could not or\nought not to destroy it, would be at least to keep it from\ngrowing any larger? Can any man believe, that the way to\nsave the Union is to extend and increase the only thing that\nthreatens the Union, and to su\ufb00er it to grow bigger and\nbigger?\nWhenever this question shall be settled, it must be\nsettled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not\nrest upon some philosophical opinion can be permanently\nmaintained. And hence there are but two policies in regard\nto slavery that can be at all maintained. The \ufb01rst, based on\nthe property view that slavery is right, conforms to that\nidea throughout, and demands that we shall do everything\nfor it that we ought to do if it were right. We must sweep\naway all opposition, for opposition to the right is wrong; we\nmust agree that slavery is right, and we must adopt the\nidea that property has persuaded the owner to believe that\nslavery is morally right and socially elevating. This gives a\nphilosophical \nbasis \nfor \na \npermanent \npolicy \nof\nencouragement.\nThe other policy is one that squares with the idea that\nslavery is wrong, and it consists in doing everything that\nwe ought to do if it is wrong. Now, I don\u2019t wish to be\nmisunderstood, \nnor \nto \nleave \na \ngap \ndown \nto \nbe\n misrepresented, even. I don\u2019t mean that we ought to attack\nit where it exists. To me it seems that if we were to form a\ngovernment anew, in view of the actual presence of slavery\nwe should \ufb01nd it necessary to frame just such a\ngovernment as our fathers did \u2014 giving to the slaveholder\nthe entire control where the system was established, while\nwe possessed the power to restrain it from going outside\nthose limits. From the necessities of the case we should be\ncompelled to form just such a government as our blessed\nfathers gave us; and, surely, if they have so made it, that\nadds another reason why we should let slavery alone where\nit exists.\nIf I saw a venomous snake crawling in the road, any man\nwould say I might seize the nearest stick and kill it; but if I\nfound that snake in bed with my children, that would be\nanother question. I might hurt the children more than the\nsnake, and it might bite them. Much more if I found it in\nbed with my neighbor\u2019s children, and I had bound myself by\na solemn compact not to meddle with his children under\nany circumstances, it would become me to let that\nparticular mode of getting rid of the gentleman alone. But\nif there was a bed newly made up, to which the children\nwere to be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of\nyoung snakes and put them there with them, I take it no\nman would say there was any question how I ought to\ndecide!\nThat is just the case. The new Territories are the newly\nmade bed to which our children are to go, and it lies with\nthe nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up\n with them or not. It does not seem as if there could be\nmuch hesitation what our policy should be!\nNow I have spoken of a policy based on the idea that\nslavery is wrong, and a policy based on the idea that it is\nright. But an e\ufb00ort has been made for a policy that shall\ntreat it as neither right nor wrong. It is based upon utter\nindi\ufb00erence. Its leading advocate [Douglas] has said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t care whether it be voted up or down.\u201d \u201cIt is merely a\nmatter of dollars and cents.\u201d \u201cThe Almighty has drawn a\nline across this continent, on one side of which all soil must\nforever be cultivated by slave labor, and on the other by\nfree.\u201d \u201cWhen the struggle is between the white man and\nthe negro, I am for the white man; when it is between the\nnegro and the crocodile, I am for the negro.\u201d Its central\nidea is indi\ufb00erence. It holds that it makes no more\ndi\ufb00erence to us whether the Territories become free or\nslave States than whether my neighbor stocks his farm with\nhorned cattle or puts in tobacco. All recognize this policy,\nthe plausible sugar-coated name of which is \u201cpopular\nsovereignty.\u201d\nThis policy chie\ufb02y stands in the way of a permanent\nsettlement of the question. I believe there is no danger of\nits becoming the permanent policy of the country, for it is\nbased on a public indi\ufb00erence. There is nobody that \u201cdon\u2019t\ncare.\u201d All the people do care one way or the other! I do not\ncharge that its author, when he says he \u201cdon\u2019t care,\u201d states\nhis individual opinion; he only expresses his policy for the\ngovernment. I understand that he has never said as an\nindividual whether he thought slavery right or wrong \u2014\n and he is the only man in the nation that has not! Now such\na policy may have a temporary run; it may spring up as\nnecessary to the political prospects of some gentleman; but\nit is utterly baseless: the people are not indi\ufb00erent, and it\ncan therefore have no durability or permanence.\nBut suppose it could: Then it could be maintained only by\na public opinion that shall say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care.\u201d There must\nbe a change in public opinion; the public mind must be so\nfar debauched as to square with this policy of caring not at\nall. The people must come to consider this as \u201cmerely a\nquestion of dollars and cents,\u201d and to believe that in some\nplaces the Almighty has made slavery necessarily eternal.\nThis policy can be brought to prevail if the people can be\nbrought round to say honestly, \u201cWe don\u2019t care\u201d; if not, it\ncan never be maintained. It is for you to say whether that\ncan be done.\nYou are ready to say it cannot, but be not too fast!\nRemember what a long stride has been taken since the\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise! Do you know of any\nDemocrat, of either branch of the party \u2014 do you know one\nwho declares that he believes that the Declaration of\nIndependence has any application to the negro? Judge\nTaney declares that it has not, and Judge Douglas even\nvili\ufb01es me personally and scolds me roundly for saying that\nthe Declaration applies to all men, and that negroes are\nmen. Is there a Democrat here who does not deny that the\nDeclaration applies to the negro? Do any of you know of\none? Well, I have tried before perhaps \ufb01fty audiences, some\nlarger and some smaller than this, to \ufb01nd one such\n Democrat, and never yet have I found one who said I did\nnot place him right in that. I must assume that Democrats\nhold that, and now, not one of these Democrats can show\nthat he said that \ufb01ve years ago! I venture to defy the whole\nparty to produce one man that ever uttered the belief that\nthe Declaration did not apply to negroes, before the repeal\nof the Missouri Compromise! Four or \ufb01ve years ago we all\nthought negroes were men, and that when \u201call men\u201d were\nnamed, negroes were included. But the whole Democratic\nparty has deliberately taken negroes from the class of men\nand put them in the class of brutes. Turn it as you will it is\nsimply the truth! Don\u2019t be too hasty, then, in saying that the\npeople cannot be brought to this new doctrine, but note\nthat long stride. One more as long completes the journey\nfrom where negroes are estimated as men to where they\nare estimated as mere brutes \u2014 as rightful property!\nThat saying \u201cIn the struggle between white men and the\nnegro,\u201d etc., which I know came from the same source as\nthis policy \u2014 that saying marks another step. There is a\nfalsehood wrapped up in that statement. \u201cIn the struggle\nbetween the white man and the negro\u201d assumes that there\nis a struggle, in which either the white man must enslave\nthe negro or the negro must enslave the white. There is no\nsuch struggle! It is merely the ingenious falsehood to\ndegrade and brutalize the negro. Let each let the other\nalone, and there is no struggle about it. If it was like two\nwrecked seamen on a narrow plank, when each must push\nthe other o\ufb00 or drown himself, I would push the negro o\ufb00\nor a white man either, but it is not; the plank is large\n enough for both. This good earth is plenty broad enough for\nwhite man and negro both, and there is no need of either\npushing the other o\ufb00.\nSo that saying, \u201cIn the struggle between the negro and\nthe crocodile,\u201d etc., is made up from the idea that down\nwhere the crocodile inhabits, a white man can\u2019t labor; it\nmust be nothing else but crocodile or negro; if the negro\ndoes not the crocodile must possess the earth; in that case\nhe declares for the negro. The meaning of the whole is just\nthis: As a white man is to a negro, so is a negro to a\ncrocodile; and as the negro may rightfully treat the\ncrocodile, so may the white man rightfully treat the negro.\nThis very dear phrase coined by its author, and so dear that\nhe deliberately repeats it in many speeches, has a tendency\nto still further brutalize the negro, and to bring public\nopinion to the point of utter indi\ufb00erence whether men so\nbrutalized are enslaved or not. When that time shall come,\nif ever, I think that policy to which I refer may prevail. But I\nhope the good freemen of this country will never allow it to\ncome, and until then the policy can never be maintained.\nNow consider the e\ufb00ect of this policy. We in the States\nare not to care whether freedom or slavery gets the better,\nbut the people in the Territories may care. They are to\ndecide, and they may think what they please; it is a matter\nof dollars and cents! But are not the people of the\nTerritories detailed from the States? If this feeling of\nindi\ufb00erence this absence of moral sense about the question\nprevails in the States, will it not be carried into the\nTerritories? Will not every man say, \u201cI don\u2019t care, it is\n nothing to me\u201d? If any one comes that wants slavery, must\nthey not say, \u201cI don\u2019t care whether freedom or slavery be\nvoted up or voted down\u201d? It results at last in nationalizing\nthe institution of slavery. Even if fairly carried out, that\npolicy is just as certain to nationalize slavery as the\ndoctrine of Je\ufb00 Davis himself. These are only two roads to\nthe same goal, and \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d is just as sure\nand almost as short as the other.\nWhat we want, and all we want, is to have with us the\nmen who think slavery wrong. But those who say they hate\nslavery, and are opposed to it, but yet act with the\nDemocratic party \u2014 where are they? Let us apply a few\ntests. You say that you think slavery is wrong, but you\ndenounce all attempts to restrain it. Is there anything else\nthat you think wrong that you are not willing to deal with\nas wrong? Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one\nwrong and no other? You will not let us do a single thing as\nif it was wrong; there is no place where you will even allow\nit to be called wrong! We must not call it wrong in the free\nStates, because it is not there, and we must not call it\nwrong in the slave States, because it is there; we must not\ncall it wrong in politics because that is bringing morality\ninto politics, and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit\nbecause that is bringing politics into religion; we must not\nbring it into the Tract Society or the other societies,\nbecause those are such unsuitable places \u2014 and there is no\nsingle place, according to you, where this wrong thing can\nproperly be called wrong!\n Perhaps you will plead that if the people of the slave\nStates should themselves set on foot an e\ufb00ort for\nemancipation, you would wish them success, and bid them\nGod-speed. Let us test that: In  the emancipation party\nof Missouri, with Frank Blair at their head, tried to get up a\nmovement for that purpose, and having started a party\ncontested the State. Blair was beaten, apparently if not\ntruly, and when the news came to Connecticut, you, who\nknew that Frank Blair was taking hold of this thing by the\nright end, and doing the only thing that you say can\nproperly be done to remove this wrong \u2014 did you bow your\nheads in sorrow because of that defeat? Do you, any of you,\nknow one single Democrat that showed sorrow over that\nresult? Not one! On the contrary every man threw up his\nhat, and hallooed at the top of his lungs, \u201cHooray for\nDemocracy!\u201d\nNow, gentlemen, the Republicans desire to place this\ngreat question of slavery on the very basis on which our\nfathers placed it, and no other. It is easy to demonstrate\nthat \u201cour fathers, who framed this Government under\nwhich we live,\u201d looked on slavery as wrong, and so framed\nit and everything about it as to square with the idea that it\nwas wrong, so far as the necessities arising from its\nexistence permitted. In forming the Constitution they found\nthe slave trade existing, capital invested in it, \ufb01elds\ndepending upon it for labor, and the whole system resting\nupon the importation of slave labor. They therefore did not\nprohibit the slave trade at once, but they gave the power to\nprohibit it after twenty years. Why was this? What other\n foreign trade did they treat in that way? Would they have\ndone this if they had not thought slavery wrong?\nAnother thing was done by some of the same men who\nframed the Constitution, and afterwards adopted as their\nown the act by the \ufb01rst Congress held under that\nConstitution, of which many of the framers were members,\nthat prohibited the spread of slavery into Territories. Thus\nthe same men, the framers of the Constitution, cut o\ufb00 the\nsupply and prohibited the spread of slavery, and both acts\nshow conclusively that they considered that the thing was\nwrong.\nIf additional proof is wanted it can be found in the\nphraseology of the Constitution. When men are framing a\nsupreme law and chart of government, to secure blessings\nand prosperity to untold generations yet to come, they use\nlanguage as short and direct and plain as can be found, to\nexpress their meaning In all matters but this of slavery the\nframers of the Constitution used the very clearest, shortest,\nand most direct language. But the Constitution alludes to\nslavery three times without mentioning it once The\nlanguage used becomes ambiguous, roundabout, and\nmystical. They speak of the \u201cimmigration of persons,\u201d and\nmean the importation of slaves, but do not say so. In\nestablishing a basis of representation they say \u201call other\npersons,\u201d when they mean to say slaves \u2014 why did they not\nuse the shortest phrase? In providing for the return of\nfugitives they say \u201cpersons held to service or labor.\u201d If they\nhad said slaves it would have been plainer, and less liable\nto misconstruction. Why did n\u2019t they do it? We cannot doubt\n that it was done on purpose. Only one reason is possible,\nand that is supplied us by one of the framers of the\nConstitution \u2014 and it is not possible for man to conceive of\nany other \u2014 they expected and desired that the system\nwould come to an end, and meant that when it did, the\nConstitution should not show that there ever had been a\nslave in this good free country of ours.\nI will dwell on that no longer. I see the signs of\napproaching triumph of the Republicans in the bearing of\ntheir political adversaries. A great deal of their war with us\nnowadays is mere bushwhacking. At the battle of Waterloo,\nwhen Napoleon\u2019s cavalry had charged again and again\nupon the unbroken squares of British infantry, at last they\nwere giving up the attempt, and going o\ufb00 in disorder, when\nsome of the o\ufb00icers in mere vexation and complete despair\n\ufb01red their pistols at those solid squares. The Democrats are\nin that sort of extreme desperation; it is nothing else. I will\ntake up a few of these arguments.\nThere is \u201cthe irrepressible con\ufb02ict.\u201d How they rail at\nSeward for that saying! They repeat it constantly; and,\nalthough the proof has been thrust under their noses again\nand again that almost every good man since the formation\nof our Government has uttered that same sentiment, from\nGeneral Washington, who \u201ctrusted that we should yet have\na confederacy of free States,\u201d with Je\ufb00erson, Jay, Monroe,\ndown to the latest days, yet they refuse to notice that at all,\nand persist in railing at Seward for saying it. Even Roger A.\nPryor, editor of the Richmond Enquirer, uttered the same\nsentiment in almost the same language, and yet so little\n o\ufb00ence did it give the Democrats that he was sent for to\nWashington to edit the States \u2014 the Douglas organ there \u2014\nwhile Douglas goes into hydrophobia and spasms of rage\nbecause Seward dared to repeat it. This is what I call\nbushwhacking, a sort of argument that they must know any\nchild can see through.\nAnother is John Brown: \u201cYou stir up insurrections, you\ninvade the South; John Brown! Harper\u2019s Ferry!\u201d Why, John\nBrown was not a Republican! You have never implicated a\nsingle Republican in that Harper\u2019s Ferry enterprise. We tell\nyou that if any member of the Republican party is guilty in\nthat matter, you know it or you do not know it. If you do\nknow it, you are inexcusable not to designate the man and\nprove the fact. If you do not know it, you are inexcusable to\nassert it, and especially to persist in the assertion after you\nhave tried and failed to make the proof. You need not be\ntold that persisting in a charge which one does not know to\nbe true is simply malicious slander. Some of you admit that\nno Republican designedly aided or encouraged the\nHarper\u2019s Ferry a\ufb00air, but still insist that our doctrines and\ndeclarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not\nbelieve it. We know we hold to no doctrines, and make no\ndeclarations, which were not held to and made by our\nfathers who framed the Government \u2018under which we live,\nand we cannot see how declarations that were patriotic\nwhen they made them are villainous when we make them.\nYou never dealt fairly by us in relation to that a\ufb00air \u2014 and I\nwill say frankly that I know of nothing in your character\nthat should lead us to suppose that you would. You had just\n been soundly thrashed in elections in several States, and\nothers were soon to come. You rejoiced at the occasion, and\nonly were troubled that there were not three times as many\nkilled in the a\ufb00air. You were in evident glee; there was no\nsorrow for the killed nor for the peace of Virginia\ndisturbed; you were rejoicing that by charging Republicans\nwith this thing you might get an advantage of us in New\nYork, and the other States. You pulled that string as tightly\nas you could, but your very generous and worthy\nexpectations were not quite ful\ufb01lled. Each Republican knew\nthat the charge was a slander as to himself at least, and\nwas not inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. It was\nmere bushwhacking, because you had nothing else to do.\nYou are still on that track, and I say, go on! If you think you\ncan slander a woman into loving you or a man into voting\nfor you, try it till you are satis\ufb01ed!\nAnother specimen of this bushwhacking, that \u201cshoe\nstrike.\u201d Now be it understood that I do not pretend to know\nall about the matter. I am merely going to speculate a little\nabout some of its phases. And at the outset, I am glad to\nsee that a system of labor prevails in New England under\nwhich laborers can strike when they want to, where they\nare not obliged to work under all circumstances, and are\nnot tied down and obliged to labor whether you pay them\nor not! I like the system which lets a man quit when he\nwants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere. One of the\nreasons why I am opposed to slavery is just here. What is\nthe true condition of the laborer? I take it that it is best for\nall to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he\n can. Some will get wealthy. I don\u2019t believe in a law to\nprevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm\nthan good. So, while we do not propose any war upon\ncapital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal\nchance to get rich with everybody else. When one starts\npoor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that\nhe knows he can better his condition; he knows that there\nis no \ufb01xed condition of labor for his whole life. I am not\nashamed to confess that twenty-\ufb01ve years ago I was a hired\nlaborer, mauling rails, at work on a \ufb02atboat \u2014 just what\nmight happen to any poor man\u2019s son! I want every man to\nhave a chance \u2014 and I believe a Black man is entitled to it\n\u2014 in which he can better his condition; when he may look\nforward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the\nnext, work for himself afterward, and \ufb01nally to hire men to\nwork for him! That is the system. Up here in New England,\nyou have a soil that scarcely sprouts black-eyed beans, and\nyet where will you \ufb01nd wealthy men so wealthy, and\npoverty so rarely in extremity? There is not another such\nplace on earth! I desire that if you get too thick here, and\n\ufb01nd it hard to better your condition on this soil, you may\nhave a chance to strike and go somewhere else, where you\nmay not be degraded, nor have your families corrupted, by\nforced rivalry with negro slaves. I want you to have a clean\nbed and no snakes in it! Then you can better your\ncondition, and so it may go on and on in one endless round\nso long as man exists on the face of the earth!\nNow, to come back to this shoe strike, \u2014 if, as the\nsenator from Illinois asserts, this is caused by withdrawal\n of Southern votes, consider brie\ufb02y how you will meet the\ndi\ufb00iculty. You have done nothing, and have protested that\nyou have done nothing, to injure the South. And yet, to get\nback the shoe trade, you must leave o\ufb00 doing something\nwhich you are now doing. What is it? You must stop\nthinking slavery wrong! Let your institutions be wholly\nchanged; let your State constitutions be subverted; glorify\nslavery, and so you will get back the shoe trade \u2014 for what?\nYou have brought owned labor with it, to compete with your\nown labor, to underwork you, and to degrade you! Are you\nready to get back the trade on those terms?\nBut the statement is not correct. You have not lost that\ntrade; orders were never better than now! Senator Mason,\na Democrat, comes into the Senate in homespun, a proof\nthat the dissolution of the Union has actually begun! but\norders are the same. Your factories have not struck work,\nneither those where they make anything for coats, nor for\npants nor for shirts, nor for ladies\u2019 dresses. Mr. Mason has\nnot reached the manufacturers who ought to have made\nhim a coat and pants! To make his proof good for anything\nhe should have come into the Senate barefoot!\nAnother bushwhacking contrivance; simply that, nothing\nelse! I \ufb01nd a good many people who are very much\nconcerned about the loss of Southern trade. Now either\nthese people are sincere or they are not. I will speculate a\nlittle about that. If they are sincere, and are moved by any\nreal danger of the loss of Southern trade, they will simply\nget their names on the white list, and then, instead of\npersuading Republicans to do likewise, they will be glad to\n keep you away! Don\u2019t you see that they cut o\ufb00 competition?\nThey would not be whispering around to Republicans to\ncome in and share the pro\ufb01ts with them. But if they are not\nsincere, and are merely trying to fool Republicans out of\ntheir votes, they will grow very anxious about your\npecuniary prospects; they are afraid you are going to get\nbroken up and ruined; they do not care about Democratic\nvotes, oh, no, no, no! You must judge which class those\nbelong to whom you meet: I leave it to you to determine\nfrom the facts.\nLet us notice some more of the stale charges against\nRepublicans. You say\nwe are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and\nthe burden of proof\nis upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why,\nthat our party\nhas no existence in your section \u2014 gets no votes in your\nsection. The fact\nis substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If it\ndoes, then in\ncase we should, without change of principle, begin to get\nvotes in your\nsection, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You\ncannot escape this\nconclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you\nare, you will\nprobably soon \ufb01nd that we have ceased to be sectional,\nfor we shall get\n votes in your section this very year. The fact that we get\nno votes in\nyour section is a fact of your making and not of ours. And\nif there be\nfault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and\nremains so until\nyou show that we repel you by some wrong principle or\npractice. If we\nours; but this brings you to where you ought to have\nstarted \u2014 to a\ndiscussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If our\nprinciple, put\nin practice, would wrong your section for the bene\ufb01t of\nours, or for any\nother object, then our principle, and we with it, are\nsectional, and are\njustly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on\nthe question of\nwhether our principle put in practice would wrong your\nsection; and so\nmeet it as if it were possible that something may be said\non our side. Do\nyou accept the challenge? No? Then you really believe\nthat the principle\nwhich our fathers who framed the Government under\nwhich we live thought so\nclearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and\nagain, upon their\n o\ufb00icial oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand\nour condemnation\nwithout a moment\u2019s consideration. Some of you delight to\n\ufb02aunt in our\nfaces the warning against sectional parties given by\nWashington in his\nFarewell \nAddress. \nLess \nthan \neight \nyears \nbefore\nWashington gave that\nwarning, he had, as President of the United States,\napproved and signed an\nact of Congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in\nthe Northwestern\nTerritory, which act embodied the policy of government\nupon that subject,\nup to and at the very moment he penned that warning;\nand about one year\nafter he penned it he wrote La Fayette that he\nconsidered that prohibition\na wise measure, expressing in the same connection his\nhope that we should\nsometime have a confederacy of free States.\nBearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has\nsince arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a\nweapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against\nyou? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the\nblame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy,\nor upon you, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of\nWashington, and we commend it to you, together with his\nexample pointing to the right application of it.\n But \nyou \nsay \nyou \nare \nconservative \n\u2014 \neminently\nconservative \u2014 while we are revolutionary, destructive, or\nsomething of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not\nadherence to the old and tried, against the new and\nuntried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on\nthe point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers\nwho framed the Government under which we live; while\nyou with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old\npolicy, and insist upon substituting something new.\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that\nsubstitute shall be. You have considerable variety of new\npropositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting\nand denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you\nare for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a\ncongressional slave code for the Territories; some for\nCongress forbidding the Territories to prohibit slavery\nwithin their limits; some for maintaining slavery in the\nTerritories through the judiciary; some for the \u201cgur-reat\npur-rinciple\u201d that if one man would enslave another, no\nthird man should object \u2014 fantastically called \u201cpopular\nsovereignty.\u201d But never a man among you in favor of\nprohibition of slavery in Federal Territories, according to\nthe practice of our fathers who framed the Government\nunder which we live. Not one of all your various plans can\nshow a precedent or an advocate in the century within\nwhich our Government originated. And yet you draw\nyourselves up and say, \u201cWe are eminently conservative.\u201d\nIt is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great\nconfederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony one with\n another. Let us Republicans do our part to have it so. Even\nthough much provoked, let us do nothing through passion\nand ill-temper. Even though the Southern people will not so\nmuch as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands,\nand yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we\npossibly can. Judging by all they say and do, and by the\nsubject and nature of their controversy with us, let us\ndetermine, if we can, what will satisfy them.\nWill they be satis\ufb01ed if the Territories be unconditionally\nsurrendered to them? We know they will not. In all their\npresent complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely\nmentioned. Invasions and insurrections are the rage now.\nWill it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do\nwith invasions and insurrections? We know it will not. We\nso know because we know we never had anything to do\nwith invasions and insurrections; and yet this total\nabstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the\ndenunciation.\nThe question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this:\nwe must not only let them alone, but we must, somehow,\nconvince them that we do let them alone. This, we know by\nexperience, is no easy task. We have been so trying to\nconvince \nthem, \nfrom \nthe \nvery \nbeginning \nof \nour\norganization, but with no success. In all our platforms and\nspeeches, we have constantly protested our purpose to let\nthem alone; but this had no tendency to convince them.\nAlike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have\nnever detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.\n These natural and apparently adequate means all failing,\nwhat will convince them? This, and this only: cease to call\nslavery wrong, and join them in calling it right. And this\nmust be done thoroughly \u2014 done in acts as well as in\nwords. Silence will not be tolerated \u2014 we must place\nourselves avowedly with them. Douglas\u2019s new sedition law\nmust be enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations\nthat slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses,\nin pulpits, or in private. We must arrest and return their\nfugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull down\nour free State constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be\ndisinfected of all taint of opposition to slavery, before they\nwill cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us.\nSo long as we call slavery wrong, whenever a slave runs\naway they will overlook the obvious fact that he ran away\nbecause he was oppressed, and declare he was stolen o\ufb00.\nWhenever a master cuts his slaves with a lash, and they cry\nout under it, he will overlook the obvious fact that the\nnegroes cry out because they are hurt, and insist that they\nwere put up to it by some rascally abolitionist.\nI am quite aware that they do not state their case\nprecisely in this way. Most of them would probably say to\nus, \u201cLet us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please\nabout slavery.\u201d But we do let them alone \u2014 have never\ndisturbed them \u2014 so that, after all, it is what we say which\ndissatis\ufb01es them. They will continue to accuse us of doing,\nuntil we cease saying.\nI am also aware that they have not as yet in terms\ndemanded the overthrow of our free-State constitutions.\n Yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery with\nmore solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it;\nand when all these other sayings shall have been silenced,\nthe overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded. It is\nnothing to the contrary that they do not demand the whole\nof this just now. Demanding what they do, and for the\nreason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of\nthis consummation. Holding as they do that slavery is\nmorally right, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to\ndemand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right,\nand a social blessing.\nNor can we justi\ufb01ably withhold this on any ground save\nour conviction that slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all\nwords, acts, laws, and constitutions against it are\nthemselves wrong and should be silenced and swept away.\nIf it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality \u2014 its\nuniversality: if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its\nextension \u2014 its enlargement. All they ask, we could readily\ngrant, if we thought slavery right; all we ask, they could as\nreadily grant, if they thought it wrong. Their thinking it\nright and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact on which\ndepends the whole controversy. Thinking it right as they do,\nthey are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as\nbeing right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield\nto them? Can we cast our votes with their view, and against\nour own? In view of our moral, social, and political\nresponsibilities, can we do this?\nWrong as we think slavery is, we can yet a\ufb00ord to let it\nalone where it is because that much is due to the necessity\n arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we,\nwhile our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the\nnational Territories, and to overrun us here in these free\nStates?\nIf our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our\nduty, fearlessly and e\ufb00ectively. Let us be diverted by none\nof those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so\nindustriously plied and belabored \u2014 contrivances such as\ngroping for some middle ground between the right and the\nwrong, vain as the search for a man who would be neither a\nliving man nor a dead man \u2014 such as a policy of \u201cdon\u2019t\ncare\u201d on a question about which all free men do care \u2014\nsuch as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield\nto Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and caning, not\nthe sinners, but the righteous to repentance \u2014 such as\ninvocations of Washington, imploring men to unsay what\nWashington did.\nNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false\naccusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces\nof destruction to the Government, nor of dungeons to\nourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might; and in\nthat faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we\nunderstand it.\n[As Mr. Lincoln concluded his address, there was\nwitnessed the wildest scene of enthusiasm and excitement\nthat has been in New Haven for years.

MCNEIL, Esq.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Reaching home yesterday, I found yours of\nthe d March, inclosing a slip from The Middleport Press.\nIt is not true that I ever charged anything for a political\nspeech in my life; but this much is true: Last October I was\nrequested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in Mr.\nBeecher\u2019s church, in Brooklyn \u2014 two hundred dollars being\no\ufb00ered in the \ufb01rst letter. I wrote that I could do it in\nFebruary, provided they would take a political speech if I\ncould \ufb01nd time to get up no other. They agreed; and\nsubsequently I informed them the speech would have to be\na political one. When I reached New York, I for the \ufb01rst\ntime learned that the place was changed to \u201cCooper\nInstitute.\u201d I made the speech, and left for New Hampshire,\nwhere I have a son at school, neither asking for pay nor\nhaving any o\ufb00ered me. Three days after a check for two\nhundred dollars was sent to me at New Hampshire; and I\ntook it, and did not know it was wrong. My understanding\nnow is \u2014 though I knew nothing of it at the time \u2014 that\n they did charge for admittance to the Cooper Institute, and\nthat they took in more than twice two hundred dollars.\nI have made this explanation to you as a friend; but I\nwish no explanation made to our enemies. What they want\nis a squabble and a fuss, and that they can have if we\nexplain; and they cannot have it if we don\u2019t.\nWhen I returned through New York from New England, I\nwas told by the gentlemen who sent me the Check that a\ndrunken vagabond in the club, having learned something\nabout the two hundred dollars, made the exhibition out of\nwhich The Herald manufactured the article quoted by The\nPress of your town.\nMy judgment is, and therefore my request is, that you\ngive no denial and no explanation.\nThanking you for your kind interest in the matter, I\nremain, Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n H.  A  \n .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., April , .\nHAWKINS TAYLOR, ESQ.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th is just received. It\nsurprises me that you have written twice, without receiving\nan answer. I have answered all I ever received from you;\nand certainly one since my return from the East.\nOpinions here, as to the prospect of Douglas being\nnominated, are quite con\ufb02icting \u2014 some very con\ufb01dent he\nwill, and others that he will not be. I think his nomination\npossible, but that the chances are against him.\nI am glad there is a prospect of your party passing this\nway to Chicago.

Follett, Foster, \n Co.\u2019s Life of me is not\nby my authority; and I have scarcely been so much\nastounded by anything, as by their public announcement\nthat it is authorized by me. They have fallen into some\nstrange \nmisunderstanding. \nI \ncertainly \nknew \nthey\ncontemplated publishing a biography, and I certainly did\nnot object to their doing so, upon their own responsibility. I\neven took pains to facilitate them. But, at the same time, I\nmade myself tiresome, if not hoarse, with repeating to Mr.\nHoward, their only agent seen by me, my protest that I\nauthorized nothing \u2014 would be responsible for nothing.\nHow \nthey \ncould \nso \nmisunderstand \nme, \npasses\ncomprehension. As a matter wholly my own, I would\nauthorize no biography, without time and opportunity [sic]\nto carefully examine and consider every word of it and, in\nthis case, in the nature of things, I can have no such time\nand Opportunity [sic]. But, in my present position, when, by\nthe lessons of the past, and the united voice of all discreet\nfriends, I can neither write nor speak a word for the public,\n how dare I to send forth, by my authority, a volume of\nhundreds of pages, for adversaries to make points upon\nwithout end? Were I to do so, the convention would have a\nright to re-assemble and substitute another name for mine.\nFor these reasons, I would not look at the proof sheets \u2014\nI am determined to maintain the position of [sic] truly\nsaying I never saw the proof sheets, or any part of their\nwork, before its publication.\nNow, do not mistake me \u2014 I feel great kindness for\nMessrs. F., F., \n Co. \u2014 do not think they have intentionally\ndone wrong. There may be nothing wrong in their proposed\nbook \u2014 I sincerely hope there will not. I barely suggest that\nyou, or any of the friends there, on the party account, look\nit over, and exclude what you may think would embarrass\nthe party bearing in mind, at all times, that I authorize\nnothing \u2014 will be responsible for nothing.\nYour friend, as ever, A.

MY DEAR SIR: \u2014 It\nappears to me that you and I ought to be acquainted, and\naccordingly I write this as a sort of introduction of myself to\nyou. You \ufb01rst entered the Senate during the single term I\nwas a member of the House of Representatives, but I have\nno recollection that we were introduced. I shall be pleased\nto receive a line from you.\nThe prospect of Republican success now appears very\n\ufb02attering, so far as I can perceive. Do you see anything to\nthe contrary?\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n A.  \nA .\n(Con\ufb01dential.) SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JULY , .\nHON. A. JONAS.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th is received. I suppose\nas good or even better men than I may have been in\nAmerican or Know-Nothing lodges; but in point of fact, I\nnever was in one at Quincy or elsewhere. I was never in\nQuincy but one day and two nights while Know-Nothing\nlodges were in existence, and you were with me that day\nand both those nights. I had never been there before in my\nlife, and never afterward, till the joint debate with Douglas\nin . It was in  when I spoke in some hall there,\nand after the speaking, you, with others, took me to an\noyster-saloon, passed an hour there, and you walked with\nme to, and parted with me at, the Quincy House, quite late\nat night. I left by stage for Naples before daylight in the\nmorning, having come in by the same route after dark the\nevening, previous to the speaking, when I found you\nwaiting at the Quincy House to meet me. A few days after I\nwas there, Richardson, as I understood, started this same\nstory about my having been in a Know-Nothing lodge.\nWhen I heard of the charge, as I did soon after; I taxed my\nrecollection for some incident which could have suggested\nit; and I remembered that on parting with you the last night\n I went to the o\ufb00ice of the hotel to take my stage-passage\nfor the morning, was told that no stage-o\ufb00ice for that line\nwas kept there, and that I must see the driver before\nretiring, to insure his calling for me in the morning; and a\nservant was sent with me to \ufb01nd the driver, who, after\ntaking me a square or two, stopped me, and stepped\nperhaps a dozen steps farther, and in my hearing called to\nsome one, who answered him, apparently from the upper\npart of a building, and promised to call with the stage for\nme at the Quincy House. I returned, and went to bed, and\nbefore day the stage called and took me. This is all.\nThat I never was in a Know-Nothing lodge in Quincy, I\nshould expect could be easily proved by respectable men\nwho were always in the lodges and never saw me there. An\na\ufb00idavit of one or two such would put the matter at rest.\nAnd now a word of caution. Our adversaries think they\ncan gain a point if they could force me to openly deny the\ncharge, by which some degree of o\ufb00ence would be given to\nthe Americans. For this reason it must not publicly appear\nthat I am paying any attention to the charge.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \nH\n  .    .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, August , .\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th, inclosing the letter of\nHON. John Minor Botts, was duly received. The latter is\nherewith returned according to your request. It contains\none of the many assurances I receive from the South, that\nin no probable event will there be any very formidable\ne\ufb00ort to break up the Union. The people of the South have\ntoo much of good sense and good temper to attempt the\nruin of the government rather than see it administered as it\nwas administered by the men who made it. At least so I\nhope and believe. I thank you both for your own letter and\na sight of that of Mr. Botts.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  H\n  \n \n  \nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. August  .\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th was received this\nmorning. Douglas is managing the Bell element with great\nadroitness. He had his men in Kentucky to vote for the Bell\ncandidate, producing a result which has badly alarmed and\ndamaged Breckenridge, and at the same time has induced\nthe Bell men to suppose that Bell will certainly be\nPresident, if they can keep a few of the Northern States\naway from us by throwing them to Douglas. But you, better\nthan I, understand all this.\nI think there will be the most extraordinary e\ufb00ort ever\nmade to carry New York for Douglas. You and all others\nwho write me from your State think the e\ufb00ort cannot\nsucceed, and I hope you are right. Still, it will require close\nwatching and great e\ufb00orts on the other side.\nHerewith I send you a copy of a letter written at New\nYork, which su\ufb00iciently explains itself, and which may or\nmay not give you a valuable hint. You have seen that Bell\ntickets have been put on the track both here and in Indiana.\nIn both cases the object has been, I think, the same as the\nHunt movement in New York \u2014 to throw States to Douglas.\nIn our State, we know the thing is engineered by Douglas\n men, and we do not believe they can make a great deal out\nof it.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n   \n  \n  I   \n  \n   I\nI\nA I\nTO HON. JOHN \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 \n(PRIVATE.) SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. , \nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th is duly received.

HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 I am annoyed some by a letter from a\nfriend in Chicago, in which the following passage occurs:\n\u201cHamlin has written Colfax that two members of Congress\nwill, he fears, be lost in Maine, the \ufb01rst and sixth districts;\nand that Washburne\u2019s majority for governor will not exceed\nsix thousand.\u201d\nI had heard something like this six weeks ago, but had\nbeen assured since that it was not so. Your secretary of\nstate, \u2014 Mr. Smith, I think, \u2014 whom you introduced to me\nby \nletter, \ngave \nthis \nassurance; \nmore \nrecently, \nMr.\nFessenden, our candidate for Congress in one of those\ndistricts, wrote a relative here that his election was sure by\nat least \ufb01ve thousand, and that Washburne\u2019s majority would\nbe from , to ,; and still later, Mr. Fogg, of New\nHampshire, now at New York serving on a national\ncommittee, wrote me that we were having a desperate \ufb01ght\nin Maine, which would end in a splendid victory for us.\nSuch a result as you seem to have predicted in Maine, in\nyour letter to Colfax, would, I fear, put us on the down-hill\ntrack, lose us the State elections in Pennsylvania and\n Indiana, and probably ruin us on the main turn in\nNovember.\nYou must not allow it.\nYours very truly,\nA.

Prevent, as\nfar as possible, any of our friends from demoralizing\nthemselves and our cause by entertaining propositions for\ncompromise of any sort on \u201cslavery extension.\u201d There is no\npossible compromise upon it but which puts us under\nagain, and leaves all our work to do over again. Whether it\nbe a Missouri line or Eli Thayer\u2019s popular sovereignty, it is\nall the same. Let either be done, and immediately\n\ufb01libustering and extending slavery recommences. On that\npoint hold \ufb01rm, as with a chain of steel.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  I\nI\n \n       I\nTO THURLOW WEED\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, DECEMBER , \nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th was received two\ndays ago. Should the convocation of governors of which you\nspeak seem desirous to know my views on the present\naspect of things, tell them you judge from my speeches that\nI will be in\ufb02exible on the territorial question; but I probably\nthink either the Missouri line extended, or Douglas\u2019s and\nEli Thayer\u2019s popular sovereignty would lose us everything\nwe gain by the election; that \ufb01libustering for all south of us\nand making slave States of it would follow in spite of us, in\neither case; also that I probably think all opposition, real\nand apparent, to the fugitive slave clause of the\nConstitution ought to be withdrawn.\nI believe you can pretend to \ufb01nd but little, if anything, in\nmy speeches, about secession. But my opinion is that no\nState can in any way lawfully get out of the Union without\nthe consent of the others; and that it is the duty of the\nPresident and other government functionaries to run the\nmachine as it is.\nTruly yours, A.

ALE ANDER STEVENS\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your obliging answer to my short note\nis just received, and for which please accept my thanks. I\nfully appreciate the present peril the country is in, and the\nweight of responsibility on me. Do the people of the South\nreally entertain fear that a Republican administration\nwould, directly or indirectly, interfere with the slaves, or\nwith them about the slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you,\nas once a friend, and still, I hope, not an enemy, that there\nis no cause for such fears. The South would be in no more\ndanger in this respect than it was in the days of\nWashington. I suppose, however, this does not meet the\ncase. You think slavery is right and ought to be extended,\nwhile we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted. That,\nI suppose, is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial\ndi\ufb00erence between us.\nYours very truly, A.

HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 I need a man of Democratic\nantecedents from New England. I cannot get a fair share of\nthat element in without. This stands in the way of Mr.\nAdams. I think of Governor Banks, Mr. Welles, and Mr.\nTuck. Which of them do the New England delegation\nprefer? Or shall I decide for myself?\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n     \nTO WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\n(Private.) SPRINGFIELD. ILL., January , .\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours without signature was received last\nnight. I have been considering your suggestions as to my\nreaching Washington somewhat earlier than is usual. It\nseems to me the inauguration is not the most dangerous\npoint for us. Our adversaries have us now clearly at\ndisadvantage on the second Wednesday of February, when\nthe votes should be o\ufb00icially counted. If the two houses\nrefuse to meet at all, or meet without a quorum of each,\nwhere shall we be? I do not think that this counting is\nconstitutionally essential to the election, but how are we to\nproceed in the absence of it? In view of this, I think it is\nbest for me not to attempt appearing in Washington till the\nresult of that ceremony is known.\nIt certainly would be of some advantage if you could\nknow who are to be at the heads of the War and Navy\ndepartments, but until I can ascertain de\ufb01nitely whether I\ncan get any suitable men from the South, and who, and\nhow many, I can not well decide. As yet, I have no word\nfrom Mr. Gilmer in answer to my request for an interview\n with him. I look for something on the subject, through you,\nbefore long.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n. H.   \nA \n.\n(Private.)\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., JANUARY , \nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th received. I still hope\nMr. Gilmer will, on a fair understanding with us, consent to\ntake a place in the Cabinet. The preference for him over\nMr. Hunt or Mr. Gentry is that, up to date \u2014 he has a living\nposition in the South, while they have not. He is only better\nthan Winter Davis in that he is farther south. I fear, if we\ncould get, we could not safely take more than one such man\n\u2014 that is, not more than one who opposed us in the election\n\u2014 the danger being to lose the con\ufb01dence of our own\nfriends. Your selection for the State Department having\nbecome public, I am happy to \ufb01nd scarcely any objection to\nit. I shall have trouble with every other Northern Cabinet\nappointment \u2014 so much so that I shall have to defer them\nas long as possible to avoid being teased into insanity, to\nmake changes.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN\n  \n  . \n. \n \nA\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. FEB. , \nSIR: \u2014 YOUR letter of the th ult. inviting me, on behalf\nof the Legislature of New York, to pass through that State\non my way to Washington, and tendering me the\nhospitalities of her authorities and people, has been duly\nreceived. With the feelings of deep gratitude to you and\nthem for this testimonial of regard and esteem I beg you to\nnotify them that I accept the invitation so kindly tendered.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN\nP.S. \u2014 Please let the ceremonies be only such as to take\nthe least time possible. A. L.\n  A  \nA\n    AI\nTO THURLOW WEED\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., FEBRUARY , \nDEAR SIR: \u2014 I have both your letter to myself and that\nto Judge Davis, in relation to a certain gentleman in your\nState claiming to dispense patronage in my name, and also\nto be authorized to use my name to advance the chances of\nMr. Greeley for an election to the United States Senate.\nIt is very strange that such things should be said by any\none. The gentleman you mention did speak to me of Mr.\nGreeley in connection with the senatorial election, and I\nreplied in terms of kindness toward Mr. Greeley, which I\nreally feel, but always with an expressed protest that my\nname must not be used in the senatorial election in favor of\nor against any one. Any other representation of me is a\nmisrepresentation.\nAs to the matter of dispensing patronage, it perhaps will\nsurprise you to learn that I have information that you claim\nto have my authority to arrange that matter in New York. I\ndo not believe you have so claimed; but still so some men\nsay. On that subject you know all I have said to you is\n\u201cjustice to all,\u201d and I have said nothing more particular to\nany one. I say this to reassure you that I have not changed\nmy position.\n In the hope, however, that you will not use my name in\nthe matter, I am, Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  A  \n    A\n     A     I\n I  \n  I  I\nI \nFEBRUARY , \nMY FRIENDS: \u2014 One who has never been placed in a\nlike position cannot understand my feelings at this hour,\nnor the oppressive sadness I feel at this parting. For more\nthan twenty-\ufb01ve years I have lived among you, and during\nall that time I have received nothing but kindness at your\nhands. Here the most cherished ties of earth were\nassumed. Here my children were born, and here one of\nthem lies buried. To you, my friends, I owe all that I have,\nall that I am. All the strange checkered past seems to\ncrowd upon my mind. To-day I leave you. I go to assume a\ntask more di\ufb00icult than that which devolved upon General\nWashington. Unless the great God who assisted him shall\nbe with and aid me I cannot prevail; but if the same\nalmighty arm that directed and protected him shall guide\nand support me I shall not fail; I shall succeed. Let us pray\nthat the God of our fathers may not forsake us now. To Him\nI commend you all. Permit me to ask that with equal\nsincerity and faith you will all invoke His wisdom and\ngoodness for me.\nWith these words I must leave you; for how long I know\nnot. Friends, one and all, I must now wish you an\na\ufb00ectionate farewell.\n   \nA    A   \n \n  I  I\nI        A     \n   \nI AM LEAVING you on an errand of national importance,\nattended, as you are aware, with considerable di\ufb00iculties.\nLet us believe, as some poet has expressed it, \u201cBehind the\ncloud the sun is still shining.\u201d I bid you an a\ufb00ectionate\nfarewell.\n        \n A\n     \n  \n   \n \nI\nIA\nA \n I \nINDIANA, FEBRUARY , \nGOVERNOR MORTON AND FELLOW CITIZENS OF\nTHE STATE OF INDIANA:\nMost heartily do I thank you for this magni\ufb01cent\nreception, and while I cannot take to myself any share of\nthe compliment thus paid, more than that which pertains to\na mere instrument, an accidental instrument, perhaps I\nshould say, of a great cause, I yet must look upon it as a\nmost magni\ufb01cent reception, and as such most heartily do\nthank you for it. You have been pleased to address yourself\nto me chie\ufb02y in behalf of this glorious Union in which we\nlive, in all of which you have my hearty sympathy, and, as\nfar as may be within my power, will have, one and\ninseparable, my hearty consideration. While I do not\nexpect, upon this occasion, or until I get to Washington, to\nattempt any lengthy speech, I will only say to the salvation\nof the Union there needs but one single thing \u2014 the hearts\nof a people like yours.\nThe people \u2014 when they rise in mass in behalf of the\nUnion and the liberties of their country, truly may it be\nsaid, \u201cThe gates of hell cannot prevail against them.\u201d In all\ntrying positions in which I shall be placed \u2014 and, doubtless,\n I shall be placed in many such \u2014 my reliance will be placed\nupon you and the people of the United States; and I wish\nyou to remember, now and forever, that it is your business,\nand not mine; that if the union of these States and the\nliberties of this people shall be lost, it is but little to any\none man of \ufb01fty-two years of age, but a great deal to the\nthirty millions of people who inhabit these United States,\nand to their posterity in all coming time. It is your business\nto rise up and preserve the Union and liberty for\nyourselves, and not for me.\nI desire they should be constitutionally performed. I, as\nalready intimated, am but an accidental instrument,\ntemporary, and to serve but for a limited time; and I appeal\nto you again to constantly bear in mind that with you, and\nnot with politicians, not with Presidents, not with o\ufb00ice-\nseekers, but with you is the question, Shall the Union and\nshall the liberties of this country be preserved to the latest\ngenerations?\n A\n      \n  H    \nI  A \n   \n  I\nIA\nA  A\nI\nIA\nA \n I \nFEBRUARY , \nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA: \u2014 I\nam here to thank you much for this magni\ufb01cent welcome,\nand still more for the generous support given by your State\nto that political cause which I think is the true and just\ncause of the whole country and the whole world.\nSolomon says there is \u201ca time to keep silence,\u201d and when\nmen wrangle by the mouth with no certainty that they\nmean the same thing while using the same word, it perhaps\nwere as well if they would keep silence.\nThe words \u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cinvasion\u201d are much used in\nthese days, and often with some temper and hot blood. Let\nus make sure, if we can, the meaning of those who use\nthem. Let us get the exact de\ufb01nitions of these words, not\nfrom dictionaries, but from the men themselves, who\ncertainly deprecate the things they would represent by the\nuse of the words.\nWhat, then, is coercion? What is invasion? Would the\nmarching of an army into South Carolina, without the\nconsent of her people, and with hostile intent toward them,\nbe invasion? I certainly think it would, and it would be\ncoercion also, if the South Carolinians were forced to\n submit. But if the United States should merely hold and\nretake its own forts and other property, and collect the\nduties on foreign importations, or even withhold the mails\nfrom places where they were habitually violated, would any\nor all of these things be invasion or coercion? Do our\nprofessed lovers of the Union, who spitefully resolve that\nthey will resist coercion and invasion, understand that such\nthings as these, on the part of the United States, would be\ncoercion or invasion of a State? If so, their idea of means to\npreserve the object of their great a\ufb00ection would seem to\nbe exceedingly thin and airy. If sick, the little pills of the\nhomoeopathist would be much too large for it to swallow. In\ntheir view, the Union, as a family relation, would seem to be\nno regular marriage, but rather a sort of \u201cfree-love\u201d\narrangement, to be maintained on passional attraction.\nBy the way, in what consists the special sacredness of a\nState? I speak not of the position assigned to a State in the\nUnion by the Constitution, for that is a bond we all\nrecognize. That position, however, a State cannot carry out\nof the Union with it. I speak of that assumed primary right\nof a State to rule all which is less than itself, and to ruin all\nwhich is larger than itself. If a State and a county, in a\ngiven case, should be equal in number of inhabitants, in\nwhat, as a matter of principle, is the State better than the\ncounty? Would an exchange of name be an exchange of\nrights? Upon what principle, upon what rightful principle,\nmay a State, being no more than one \ufb01ftieth part of the\nnation in soil and population, break up the nation, and then\ncoerce a proportionably large subdivision of itself in the\n most arbitrary way? What mysterious right to play tyrant is\nconferred on a district of country, with its people, by merely\ncalling it a State? Fellow-citizens, I am not asserting\nanything. I am merely asking questions for you to consider.\nAnd now allow me to bid you farewell.\n I\n  \n I\n   \nA \n  H   \n H\nADDRESS TO THE MAYOR AND CITIZENS OF\nCINCINNATI, OHIO, FEBRUARY , \nMr. MAYOR, AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 Twenty-four hours\nago, at the capital of Indiana, I said to myself, \u201cI have never\nseen so many people assembled together in winter\nweather.\u201d I am no longer able to say that. But it is what\nmight reasonably have been expected \u2014 that this great city\nof Cincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion.\nMy friends, I am entirely overwhelmed by the magni\ufb01cence\nof the reception which has been given, I will not say to me,\nbut to the President-elect of the United States of America.\nMost heartily do I thank you, one and all, for it.\nI have spoken but once before this in Cincinnati. That\nwas a year previous to the late Presidential election. On\nthat occasion, in a playful manner, but with sincere words, I\naddressed much of what I said to the Kentuckians. I gave\nmy opinion that we, as Republicans, would ultimately beat\nthem as Democrats, but that they could postpone that\nresult longer by nominating Senator Douglas for the\nPresidency than they could by any other way. They did not,\nin any true sense of the word, nominate Mr. Douglas, and\nthe result has come certainly as soon as ever I expected. I\nalso told them how I expected they would be treated after\n they should have been beaten, and I now wish to call their\nattention to what I then said upon that subject. I then said:\n\u201cWhen we do as we say, beat you, you perhaps want to\nknow what we will do with you. I will tell you, as far as I am\nauthorized to speak for the Opposition, what we mean to do\nwith you. We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly can,\nas Washington, Je\ufb00erson, and Madison treated you. We\nmean to leave you alone, and in no way to interfere with\nyour institutions; to abide by all and every compromise of\nthe Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to the\noriginal proposition, to treat you so far as degenerate men,\nif we have degenerated, may, according to the example of\nthose noble fathers, Washington, Je\ufb00erson, and Madison.\n\u201cWe mean to remember that you are as good as we; that\nthere is no di\ufb00erence between us other than the di\ufb00erence\nof circumstances. We mean to recognize and bear in mind\nalways that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as\nother people, or as we claim to have, and treat you\naccordingly.\u201d\nFellow-citizens of Kentucky \u2014 friends and brethren, may\nI call you in my new position? \u2014 I see no occasion and feel\nno inclination to retract a word of this. If it shall not be\nmade good, be assured the fault shall not be mine.\n A\n      \n  H  \n  \nA\n   \n  \n I\n I\nA I  \nHI\nFEBRUARY , \nMR. CHAIRMAN: \u2014 I thank you and those whom you\nrepresent for the compliment you have paid me by\ntendering me this address. In so far as there is an allusion\nto our present national di\ufb00iculties, which expresses, as you\nhave said, the views of the gentlemen present, I shall have\nto beg pardon for not entering fully upon the questions\nwhich the address you have now read suggests.\nI deem it my duty \u2014 a duty which I owe to my\nconstituents \u2014 to you, gentlemen, that I should wait until\nthe last moment for a development of the present national\ndi\ufb00iculties before I express myself decidedly as to what\ncourse I shall pursue. I hope, then, not to be false to\nanything that you have expected of me.\nI agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the working men\nare the basis of all governments, for the plain reason that\nthey are all the more numerous, and as you added that\nthose were the sentiments of the gentlemen present,\nrepresenting not only the working class, but citizens of\nother callings than those of the mechanic, I am happy to\nconcur with you in these sentiments, not only of the native-\n born citizens, but also of the Germans and foreigners from\nother countries.\nMr. Chairman, I hold that while man exists it is his duty\nto improve not only his own condition, but to assist in\nameliorating the condition of mankind; and therefore,\nwithout entering upon the details of the question, I will\nsimply say that I am for those means which will give the\ngreatest good to the greatest number.\nIn regard to the Homestead law, I have to say that, in so\nfar as the government lands can be disposed of, I am in\nfavor of cutting up the wild lands into parcels, so that every\npoor man may have a home.\nIn regard to the Germans and foreigners, I esteem them\nno better than other people, nor any worse. It is not my\nnature, when I see a people borne down by the weight of\ntheir shackles \u2014 the oppression of tyranny \u2014 to make their\nlife more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens; but\nrather would I do all in my power to raise the yoke than to\nadd anything that would tend to crush them.\nInasmuch as our own country is extensive and new, and\nthe countries of Europe are densely populated, if there are\nany abroad who desire to make this the land of their\nadoption, it is not in my heart to throw aught in their way\nto prevent them from coming to the United States.\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen, I will bid you an\na\ufb00ectionate farewell.\n A\n      \n  H    \nI  A \n   \n  \nHI\n A\n \n \n \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. \nPRESIDENT \nAND \nMr. \nSPEAKER, \nAND\nGENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF OHIO: \u2014\nIt is true, as has been said by the president of the Senate,\nthat very great responsibility rests upon me in the position\nto which the votes of the American people have called me. I\nam deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility. I cannot\nbut know what you all know, that without a name, perhaps\nwithout a reason why I should have a name, there has\nfallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the\nFather of his Country; and so feeling, I can turn and look\nfor that support without which it will be impossible for me\nto perform that great task. I turn, then, and look to the\nAmerican people and to that God who has never forsaken\nthem. Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation\nto the policy of the new administration. In this I have\nreceived from some a degree of credit for having kept\nsilence, and from others some deprecation. I still think that\nI was right.\nIn the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the\npresent, and without a precedent which could enable me to\njudge by the past, it has seemed \ufb01tting that before\n speaking upon the di\ufb00iculties of the country I should have\ngained a view of the whole \ufb01eld, being at liberty to modify\nand change the course of policy as future events may make\na change necessary.\nI have not maintained silence from any want of real\nanxiety. It is a good thing that there is no more than\nanxiety, for there is nothing going wrong. It is a consoling\ncircumstance that when we look out there is nothing that\nreally hurts anybody. We entertain di\ufb00erent views upon\npolitical questions, but nobody is su\ufb00ering anything. This is\na most consoling circumstance, and from it we may\nconclude that all we want is time, patience, and a reliance\non that God who has never forsaken this people.\nFellow-citizens, what I have said I have said altogether\nextemporaneously, and I will now come to a close.\n A\n     A     \n  \n I     \nHI\nFEBRUARY , \nI FEAR THAT the great con\ufb01dence placed in my ability is\nunfounded. Indeed, I am sure it is. Encompassed by vast\ndi\ufb00iculties as I am, nothing shall be wanting on my part, if\nsustained by God and the American people. I believe the\ndevotion to the Constitution is equally great on both sides\nof the river. It is only the di\ufb00erent understanding of that\ninstrument that causes di\ufb00iculty. The only dispute on both\nsides is, \u201cWhat are their rights?\u201d If the majority should not\nrule, who would be the judge? Where is such a judge to be\nfound? We should all be bound by the majority of the\nAmerican people; if not, then the minority must control.\nWould that be right? Would it be just or generous?\nAssuredly not. I reiterate that the majority should rule. If I\nadopt a wrong policy, the opportunity for condemnation will\noccur in four years\u2019 time. Then I can be turned out, and a\nbetter man with better views put in my place.\n A\n     A   I    \n \nH    \n    A\nIA\nFEBRUARY , \nI MOST CORDIALLY thank his Honor Mayor Wilson, and the\ncitizens of Pittsburg generally, for their \ufb02attering reception.\nI am the more grateful because I know that it is not given\nto me alone, but to the cause I represent, which clearly\nproves to me their good-will, and that sincere feeling is at\nthe bottom of it. And here I may remark that in every short\naddress I have made to the people, in every crowd through\nwhich I have passed of late, some allusion has been made\nto the present distracted condition of the country. It is\nnatural to expect that I should say something on this\nsubject; but to touch upon it at all would involve an\nelaborate discussion of a great many questions and\ncircumstances, requiring more time than I can at present\ncommand, and would, perhaps, unnecessarily commit me\nupon \nmatters \nwhich \nhave \nnot \nyet \nfully \ndeveloped\nthemselves. \nThe \ncondition \nof \nthe \ncountry \nis \nan\nextraordinary one, and \ufb01lls the mind of every patriot with\nanxiety. It is my intention to give this subject all the\nconsideration I possibly can before specially deciding in\nregard to it, so that when I do speak it may be as nearly\nright as possible. When I do speak I hope I may say nothing\nin opposition to the spirit of the Constitution, contrary to\n the integrity of the Union, or which will prove inimical to\nthe liberties of the people, or to the peace of the whole\ncountry. And furthermore, when the time arrives for me to\nspeak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to\ndisappoint the people generally throughout the country,\nespecially if the expectation has been based upon anything\nwhich I may have heretofore said. Notwithstanding the\ntroubles across the river [the speaker pointing southwardly\nacross the Monongahela, and smiling], there is no crisis but\nan arti\ufb01cial one. What is there now to warrant the\ncondition of a\ufb00airs presented by our friends over the river?\nTake even their own view of the questions involved, and\nthere is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing. I\nrepeat, then, there is no crisis, excepting such a one as may\nbe gotten up at any time by turbulent men aided by\ndesigning politicians, My advice to them, under such\ncircumstances, is to keep cool. If the great American people\nonly keep their temper on both sides of the line, the\ntroubles will come to an end, and the question which now\ndistracts the country will be settled, just as surely as all\nother di\ufb00iculties of a like character which have originated\nin this government have been adjusted. Let the people on\nboth sides keep their self-possession, and just as other\nclouds have cleared away in due time, so will this great\nnation continue to prosper as heretofore. But, fellow-\ncitizens, I have spoken longer on this subject than I\nintended at the outset.\nIt is often said that the tari\ufb00 is the specialty of\nPennsylvania. Assuming that direct taxation is not to be\n adopted, the tari\ufb00 question must be as durable as the\ngovernment itself. It is a question of national housekeeping.\nIt is to the government what replenishing the meal-tub is to\nthe family. Every varying circumstances will require\nfrequent modi\ufb01cations as to the amount needed and the\nsources of supply. So far there is little di\ufb00erence of opinion\namong the people. It is as to whether, and how far, duties\non imports shall be adjusted to favor home production in\nthe home market, that controversy begins. One party\ninsists that such adjustment oppresses one class for the\nadvantage of another; while the other party argues that,\nwith all its incidents, in the long run all classes are\nbene\ufb01ted. In the Chicago platform there is a plank upon\nthis subject which should be a general law to the incoming\nadministration. We should do neither more nor less than we\ngave the people reason to believe we would when they gave\nus their votes. Permit me, fellow-citizens, to read the tari\ufb00\nplank of the Chicago platform, or rather have it read in\nyour hearing by one who has younger eyes.\n[Mr. Lincoln\u2019s private secretary then read Section  of\nthe Chicago platform, as follows:]\n\u201cThat, while providing revenue for the support of the\nGeneral Government by duties upon imports, sound policy\nrequires such an adjustment of these imposts as will\nencourage the development of the industrial interest of the\nwhole country; and we commend that policy of national\nexchanges which secures to working-men liberal wages, to\nagriculture \nremunerating \nprices, \nto \nmechanics \nand\nmanufacturers adequate return for their skill, labor, and\n enterprise, and to the nation commercial prosperity and\nindependence.\u201d\nAs with all general propositions, doubtless, there will be\nshades of di\ufb00erence in construing this. I have by no means\na \nthoroughly \nmatured \njudgment \nupon \nthis \nsubject,\nespecially as to details; some general ideas are about all. I\nhave long thought it would be to our advantage to produce\nany necessary article at home which can be made of as\ngood quality and with as little labor at home as abroad, at\nleast by the di\ufb00erence of the carrying from abroad. In such\ncase the carrying is demonstrably a dead loss of labor. For\ninstance, labor being the true standard of value, is it not\nplain that if equal labor get a bar of railroad iron out of a\nmine in England and another out of a mine in Pennsylvania,\neach can be laid down in a track at home cheaper than they\ncould exchange countries, at least by the carriage? If there\nbe a present cause why one can be both made and carried\ncheaper in money price than the other can be made without\ncarrying, that cause is an unnatural and injurious one, and\nought gradually, if not rapidly, to be removed. The condition\nof the treasury at this time would seem to render an early\nrevision of the tari\ufb00 indispensable. The Morrill [tari\ufb00] bill,\nnow pending before Congress, may or may not become a\nlaw. I am not posted as to its particular provisions, but if\nthey are generally satisfactory, and the bill shall now pass,\nthere will be an end for the present. If, however, it shall not\npass, I suppose the whole subject will be one of the most\npressing and important for the next Congress. By the\nConstitution, the executive may recommend measures\n which he may think proper, and he may veto those he\nthinks improper, and it is supposed that he may add to\nthese certain indirect in\ufb02uences to a\ufb00ect the action of\nCongress. My political education strongly inclines me\nagainst a very free use of any of these means by the\nexecutive to control the legislation of the country. As a rule,\nI think it better that Congress should originate as well as\nperfect its measures without external bias. I therefore\nwould rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he\nis to be a member of the next Congress to take an enlarged\nview, and post himself thoroughly, so as to contribute his\npart to such an adjustment of the tari\ufb00 as shall produce a\nsu\ufb00icient revenue, and in its other bearings, so far as\npossible, be just and equal to all sections of the country and\nclasses of the people.\n A\n     A        A\n  \nHI\nFEBRUARY , \nMR. \nCHAIRMAN \nAND \nFELLOW-CITIZENS \nOF\nCLEVELAND: \u2014 We have been marching about two miles\nthrough snow, rain, and deep mud. The large numbers that\nhave turned out under these circumstances testify that you\nare in earnest about something or other. But do I think so\nmeanly of you as to suppose that that earnestness is about\nme personally? I would be doing you an injustice to\nsuppose you did. You have assembled to testify your respect\nfor the Union, the Constitution, and the laws; and here let\nme say that it is with you, the people, to advance the great\ncause of the Union and the Constitution, and not with any\none man. It rests with you alone. This fact is strongly\nimpressed upon my mind at present. In a community like\nthis, whose appearance testi\ufb01es to their intelligence, I am\nconvinced that the cause of liberty and the Union can never\nbe in danger. Frequent allusion is made to the excitement\nat present existing in our national politics, and it is as well\nthat I should also allude to it here. I think that there is no\noccasion for any excitement. \u2018The crisis, as it is called, is\naltogether an arti\ufb01cial crisis. In all parts of the nation there\nare di\ufb00erences of opinion on politics. There are di\ufb00erences\nof opinion even here. You did not all vote for the person\n who now addresses you. What is happening now will not\nhurt those who are farther away from here. Have they not\nall their rights now as they ever have had? Do they not\nhave their fugitive slaves returned now as ever? Have they\nnot the same Constitution that they have lived under for\nseventy-odd years? Have they not a position as citizens of\nthis common country, and have we any power to change\nthat position? What, then, is the matter with them? Why all\nthis excitement? Why all these complaints?\nAs I said before, this crisis is all arti\ufb01cial! It has no\nfoundation in facts. It is not argued up, as the saying is, and\ncannot, therefore, be argued down. Let it alone and it will\ngo down of itself.\n[Mr. Lincoln then said that they must be content with a\nfew words from him, as he was tired, etc. Having been\ngiven to understand that the crowd was not all Republican,\nbut consisted of men of all parties, he continued:]\nThis is as it should be. If Judge Douglas had been elected\nand had been here on his way to Washington, as I am to-\nnight, the Republicans should have joined his supporters in\nwelcoming him, just as his friends have joined with mine\ntonight. If all do not join now to save the good old ship of\nthe Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot\nher on another voyage.\n A\n     A   \n  A \n  \n \n  \n  \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. MAYOR AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF BUFFALO AND\nTHE STATE OF NEW YORK: \u2014 I am here to thank you\nbrie\ufb02y for this grand reception given to me, not personally,\nbut as the representative of our great and beloved country.\nYour worthy mayor has been pleased to mention, in his\naddress to me, the fortunate and agreeable journey which I\nhave had from home, on my rather circuitous route to the\nFederal capital. I am very happy that he was enabled in\ntruth to congratulate myself and company on that fact. It is\ntrue we have had nothing thus far to mar the pleasure of\nthe trip. We have not been met alone by those who assisted\nin giving the election to me \u2014 I say not alone by them, but\nby the whole population of the country through which we\nhave passed. This is as it should be. Had the election fallen\nto any other of the distinguished candidates instead of\nmyself, under the peculiar circumstances, to say the least,\nit would have been proper for all citizens to have greeted\nhim as you now greet me. It is an evidence of the devotion\nof the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and the\nperpetuity of the liberties of this country. I am unwilling on\nany occasion that I should be so meanly thought of as to\nhave it supposed for a moment that these demonstrations\n are tendered to me personally. They are tendered to the\ncountry, to the institutions of the country, and to the\nperpetuity of the liberties of the country, for which these\ninstitutions were made and created.\nYour worthy mayor has thought \ufb01t to express the hope\nthat I may be able to relieve the country from the present,\nor, I should say, the threatened di\ufb00iculties. I am sure I\nbring a heart true to the work. For the ability to perform it,\nI must trust in that Supreme Being who has never forsaken\nthis favored land, through the instrumentality of this great\nand intelligent people. Without that assistance I shall surely\nfail; with it, I cannot fail. When we speak of threatened\ndi\ufb00iculties to the Country, it is natural that it should be\nexpected that something should be said by myself with\nregard \nto \nparticular \nmeasures. \nUpon \nmore \nmature\nre\ufb02ection, however, others will agree with me that, when it\nis considered that these di\ufb00iculties are without precedent,\nand have never been acted upon by any individual situated\nas I am, it is most proper I should wait and see the\ndevelopments, and get all the light possible, so that when I\ndo speak authoritatively, I may be as near right as possible.\nWhen I shall speak authoritatively, I hope to say nothing\ninconsistent with the Constitution, the Union, the rights of\nall the States, of each State, and of each section of the\ncountry, and not to disappoint the reasonable expectations\nof those who have con\ufb01ded to me their votes. In this\nconnection allow me to say that you, as a portion of the\ngreat American people, need only to maintain your\ncomposure, stand up to your sober convictions of right, to\n your obligations to the Constitution, and act in accordance\nwith those sober convictions, and the clouds now on the\nhorizon will be dispelled, and we shall have a bright and\nglorious future; and when this generation has passed away,\ntens of thousands will inhabit this country where only\nthousands inhabit it now. I do not propose to address you at\nlength; I have no voice for it. Allow me again to thank you\nfor this magni\ufb01cent reception, and bid you farewell.\n A\n     A   \n H       \n \n  \n  \nFEBRUARY , \nI CONFESS MYSELF, after having seen many large audiences\nsince leaving home, overwhelmed with this vast number of\nfaces at this hour of the morning. I am not vain enough to\nbelieve that you are here from any wish to see me as an\nindividual, but because I am for the time being the\nrepresentative of the American people. I could not, if I\nwould, address you at any length. I have not the strength,\neven if I had the time, for a speech at each of these many\ninterviews that are a\ufb00orded me on my way to Washington. I\nappear merely to see you, and to let you see me, and to bid\nyou farewell. I hope it will be understood that it is from no\ndisinclination to oblige anybody that I do not address you at\ngreater length.\n A\n     A     A \n    \n \n  \n  \nFEBRUARY , .\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 I See you have erected a\nvery \ufb01ne and handsome platform here for me, and I\npresume you expected me to speak from it. If I should go\nupon it, you would imagine that I was about to deliver you a\nmuch longer speech than I am. I wish you to understand\nthat I mean no discourtesy to you by thus declining. I\nintend discourtesy to no one. But I wish you to understand\nthat, though I am unwilling to go upon this platform, you\nare not at liberty to draw inferences concerning any other\nplatform with which my name has been or is connected. I\nwish you long life and prosperity individually, and pray that\nwith the perpetuity of those institutions under which we\nhave all so long lived and prospered, our happiness may be\nsecured, our future made brilliant, and the glorious destiny\nof our country established forever. I bid you a kind farewell.\n A\n     A  \n I A  \n \n  \n  \nFEBRUARY , \nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 I have no speech to\nmake to you; and no time to speak in. I appear before you\nthat I may see you, and that you may see me; and I am\nwilling to admit that so far as the ladies are concerned I\nhave the best of the bargain, though I wish it to be\nunderstood that I do not make the same acknowledgment\nconcerning the men.\n        \n  H  \nA \n  \n  A  A\n   \n \n  \n \nFEBRUARY , .\nMR. MAYOR: \u2014 I can hardly appropriate to myself the\n\ufb02attering terms in which you communicate the tender of\nthis reception, as personal to myself. I most gratefully\naccept the hospitalities tendered to me, and will not detain\nyou or the audience with any extended remarks at this\ntime. I presume that in the two or three courses through\nwhich I shall have to go, I shall have to repeat somewhat,\nand I will therefore only express to you my thanks for this\nkind reception.\n        \n \n   \n  \n \nA\n \n  \n \n  \n  \nA  A  A\n \nFEBRUARY , .\nGOVERNOR MORGAN: \u2014 I was pleased to receive an\ninvitation to visit the capital of the great Empire State of\nthis nation while on my way to the Federal capital. I now\nthank you, Mr. Governor, and you, the people of the capital\nof the State of New York, for this most hearty and\nmagni\ufb01cent welcome. If I am not at fault, the great Empire\nState at this time contains a larger population than did the\nwhole of the United States of America at the time they\nachieved their national independence, and I was proud \u2014\nto be invited to visit its capital, to meet its citizens, as I now\nhave the honor to do. I am noti\ufb01ed by your governor that\nthis reception is tendered by citizens without distinction of\nparty. Because of this I accept it the more gladly. In this\ncountry, and in any country where freedom of thought is\ntolerated, citizens attach themselves to political parties. It\nis but an ordinary degree of charity to attribute this act to\nthe supposition that, in thus attaching themselves to the\nvarious parties, each man in his own judgment supposes he\nthereby best advances the interests of the whole country.\nAnd when an election is past it is altogether be\ufb01tting a free\npeople, as I suppose, that, until the next election, they\n should be one people. The reception you have extended me\nto-day is not given to me personally, \u2014 it should not be so,\n\u2014 but as the representative, for the time being, of the\nmajority of the nation. If the election had fallen to any of\nthe more distinguished citizens who received the support of\nthe people, this same honor should have greeted him that\ngreets me this day, in testimony of the universal,\nunanimous \ndevotion \nof \nthe \nwhole \npeople \nto \nthe\nConstitution, the Union, and to the perpetual liberties of\nsucceeding generations in this country.\nI have neither the voice nor the strength to address you\nat any greater length. I beg you will therefore accept my\nmost grateful thanks for this manifest devotion \u2014 not to\nme, but the institutions of this great and glorious country.\n A\n      \n  H    \nI  A \n   \n  \n \n  \n  \nA  A  A\n \nFEBRUARY , .\nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL\nASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK: \u2014 It is with\nfeelings of great di\ufb00idence, and, I may say, with feelings of\nawe, perhaps greater than I have recently experienced,\nthat I meet you here in this place. The history of this great\nState, the renown of those great men who have stood here,\nand have spoken here, and have been heard here, all crowd\naround my fancy, and incline me to shrink from any attempt\nto address you. Yet I have some con\ufb01dence given me by the\ngenerous manner in which you have invited me, and by the\nstill more generous manner in which you have received me,\nto speak further. You have invited and received me without\ndistinction of party. I cannot for a moment suppose that this\nhas been done in any considerable degree with reference to\nmy personal services, but that it is done in so far as I am\nregarded, at this time, as the representative of the majesty\nof this great nation. I doubt not this is the truth, and the\nwhole truth of the case, and this is as it should be. It is\nmuch more gratifying to me that this reception has been\ngiven to me as the elected representative of a free people,\n than it could possibly be if tendered merely as an evidence\nof devotion to me, or to any one man personally.\nAnd now I think it were more \ufb01tting that I should close\nthese hasty remarks. It is true that, while I hold myself,\nwithout mock modesty, the humblest of all individuals that\nhave ever been elevated to the Presidency, I have a more\ndi\ufb00icult task to perform than any one of them.\nYou have generously tendered me the support \u2014 the\nunited support \u2014 of the great Empire State. For this, in\nbehalf of the nation \u2014 in behalf of the present and future of\nthe nation \u2014 in behalf of civil and religious liberty for all\ntime to come, most gratefully do I thank you. I do not\npropose to enter into an explanation of any particular line\nof policy, as to our present di\ufb00iculties, to be adopted by the\nincoming administration. I deem it just to you, to myself, to\nall, that I should see everything, that I should hear\neverything, that I should have every light that can be\nbrought within my reach, in order that, when I do so speak,\nI shall have enjoyed every opportunity to take correct and\ntrue ground; and for this reason I do not propose to speak\nat this time of the policy of the Government. But when the\ntime comes, I shall speak, as well as I am able, for the good\nof the present and future of this country for the good both\nof the North and of the South \u2014 for the good of the one and\nthe other, and of all sections of the country. In the\nmeantime, if we have patience, if we restrain ourselves, if\nwe allow ourselves not to run o\ufb00 in a passion, I still have\ncon\ufb01dence that the Almighty, the Maker of the universe,\nwill, through the instrumentality of this great and\n intelligent people, bring us through this as He has through\nall the other di\ufb00iculties of our country. Relying on this, I\nagain thank you for this generous reception.\n A\n     A    \n   \n \n  \n  \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. MAYOR AND CITIZENS OF TROY: \u2014 I thank you\nvery kindly for this great reception. Since I left my home it\nhas not been my fortune to meet an assemblage more\nnumerous and more orderly than this. I am the more\ngrati\ufb01ed at this mark of your regard since you assure me it\nis tendered, not to the individual but to the high o\ufb00ice you\nhave called me to \ufb01ll. I have neither strength nor time to\nmake any extended remarks on this occasion, and I can\nonly repeat to you my sincere thanks for the kind reception\nyou have thought proper to extend to me.\n A\n     A   \nH     I   \n \n  \n  \nFEBRUARY , \nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 IT is altogether impossible I\nshould make myself heard by any considerable portion of\nthis vast assemblage; but, although I appear before you\nmainly for the purpose of seeing you, and to let you see\nrather than hear me, I cannot refrain from saying that I am\nhighly grati\ufb01ed \u2014 as much here, indeed, under the\ncircumstances, as I have been anywhere on my route \u2014 to\nwitness this noble demonstration \u2014 made, not in honor of\nan individual, but of the man who at this time humbly, but\nearnestly, represents the majesty of the nation.\nThis reception, like all the others that have been\ntendered to me, doubtless emanates from all the political\nparties, and not from one alone. As such I accept it the\nmore gratefully, since it indicates an earnest desire on the\npart of the whole people, with out regard to political\ndi\ufb00erences, to save \u2014 not the country, because the country\nwill save itself but to save the institutions of the country,\nthose institutions under which, in the last three quarters of\na century, we have grown to a great, and intelligent, and a\nhappy people \u2014 the greatest, the most intelligent, and the\nhappiest people in the world. These noble manifestations\nindicate, with unerring certainty, that the whole people are\n willing to make common cause for this object; that if, as it\never must be, some have been successful in the recent\nelection and some have been beaten, if some are satis\ufb01ed\nand some are dissatis\ufb01ed, the defeated party are not in\nfavor of sinking the ship, but are desirous of running it\nthrough the tempest in safety, and willing, if they think the\npeople have committed an error in their verdict now, to\nwait in the hope of reversing it and setting it right next\ntime. I do not say that in the recent election the people did\nthe wisest thing, that could have been done \u2014 indeed, I do\nnot think they did; but I do say that in accepting the great\ntrust committed to me, which I do with a determination to\nendeavor to prove worthy of it, I must rely upon you, upon\nthe people of the whole country, for support; and with their\nsustaining aid, even I, humble as I am, cannot fail to carry\nthe ship of state safely through the storm.\nI have now only to thank you warmly for your kind\nattendance, and bid you all an a\ufb00ectionate farewell.\n A\n     A  H\n \n  \n \n  \n  .\nFEBRUARY , \nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 I see that you are providing a\nplatform for me. I shall have to decline standing upon it,\nbecause the president of the company tells me that I shall\nnot have time to wait until it is brought to me. As I said\nyesterday, \nunder \nsimilar \ncircumstances \nat \nanother\ngathering, you must not draw the inference that I have any\nintention of deserting any platform with which I have a\nlegitimate connection because I do not stand on yours.\nAllow me to thank you for this splendid reception, and I\nnow bid you farewell.\n A\n     A        I    \n \n  \n  \nFEBRUARY , \nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 I have but a moment to\nstand before you to listen to and return your kind greeting.\nI thank you for this reception, and for the pleasant manner\nin which it is tendered to me by our mutual friends. I will\nsay in a single sentence, in regard to the di\ufb00iculties that lie\nbefore me and our beloved country, that if I can only be as\ngenerously \nand \nunanimously \nsustained \nas \nthe\ndemonstrations I have witnessed indicate I shall be, I shall\nnot fail; but without your sustaining hands I am sure that\nneither I nor any other man can hope to surmount these\ndi\ufb00iculties. I trust that in the course I shall pursue I shall\nbe sustained not only by the party that elected me, but by\nthe patriotic people of the whole country.\n A\n     A   I H I    A\nI\nFEBRUARY , \nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 I appear before you not\nto make a speech. I have not su\ufb00icient time, if I had the\nstrength, to repeat speeches at every station where the\npeople kindly gather to welcome me as we go along. If I\nhad the strength, and should take the time, I should not get\nto Washington until after the inauguration, which you must\nbe aware would not \ufb01t exactly. That such an untoward\nevent might not transpire, I know you will readily forego\nany further remarks; and I close by bidding you farewell.\n   \nA    A   H  A  \n  H\n    \n \n  \n \n I         A          \nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 I have stepped before you\nmerely in compliance with what appears to be your wish,\nand not with the purpose of making a speech. I do not\npropose making a speech this afternoon. I could not be\nheard by any but a small fraction of you, at best; but, what\nis still worse than that, I have nothing just now to say that\nis worthy of your hearing. I beg you to believe that I do not\nnow refuse to address you from any disposition to disoblige\nyou, but to the contrary. But, at the same time, I beg of you\nto excuse me for the present.\n A\n     A  \n \n  \n    I  \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 I am rather an\nold man to avail myself of such an excuse as I am now\nabout to do. Yet the truth is so distinct, and presses itself so\ndistinctly upon me, that I cannot well avoid it \u2014 and that is,\nthat I did not understand when I was brought into this\nroom that I was to be brought here to make a speech. It\nwas not intimated to me that I was brought into the room\nwhere Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had made speeches,\nand where one in my position might be expected to do\nsomething like those men or say something worthy of\nmyself or my audience. I therefore beg you to make\nallowance for the circumstances in which I have been by\nsurprise brought before you. Now I have been in the habit\nof \nthinking \nand \nsometimes \nspeaking \nupon \npolitical\nquestions that have for some years past agitated the\ncountry; and, if I were disposed to do so, and we could take\nup some one of the issues, as the lawyers call them, and I\nwere called upon to make an argument about it to the best\nof my ability, I could do so without much preparation. But\nthat is not what you desire to have done here to-night.\nI have been occupying a position, since the Presidential\nelection, of silence \u2014 of avoiding public speaking, of\n avoiding public writing. I have been doing so because I\nthought, upon full consideration, that was the proper\ncourse for me to take. I am brought before you now, and\nrequired to make a speech, when you all approve more\nthan anything else of the fact that I have been keeping\nsilence. And now it seems to me that the response you give\nto that remark ought to justify me in closing just here. I\nhave not kept silence since the Presidential election from\nany party wantonness, or from any indi\ufb00erence to the\nanxiety that pervades the minds of men about the aspect of\nthe political a\ufb00airs of this country. I have kept silence for\nthe reason that I supposed it was peculiarly proper that I\nshould do so until the time came when, according to the\ncustom of the country, I could speak o\ufb00icially.\nI still suppose that, while the political drama being\nenacted in this country at this time is rapidly shifting its\nscenes \u2014 forbidding an anticipation with any degree of\ncertainty to-day of what we shall see to-morrow \u2014 it is\npeculiarly \ufb01tting that I should see it all, up to the last\nminute, before I should take ground that I might be\ndisposed, by the shifting of the scenes afterward, also to\nshift. I have said several times upon this journey, and I now\nrepeat it to you, that when the time does come, I shall then\ntake the ground that I think is right \u2014 right for the North,\nfor the South, for the East, for the West, for the whole\ncountry. And in doing so I hope to feel no necessity pressing\nupon me to say anything in con\ufb02ict with the Constitution, in\ncon\ufb02ict with the continued union of these States, in con\ufb02ict\nwith the perpetuation of the liberties of this people, or\n anything in con\ufb02ict with anything whatever that I have ever\ngiven you reason to expect from me. And now, my friends,\nhave I said enough? [Loud cries of \u201cNo, no!\u201d and, \u201cThree\ncheers for LINCOLN!\u201d] Now, my friends, there appears to\nbe a di\ufb00erence of opinion between you and me, and I really\nfeel called upon to decide the question myself.\n        \n  H  \nA \n  \n  \n \n  \n    I  \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. MAYOR: \u2014 It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I\nmake my acknowledgments for the reception that has been\ngiven me in the great commercial city of New York. I\ncannot but remember that it is done by the people who do\nnot, by a large majority, agree with me in political\nsentiment. It is the more grateful to me because in this I\nsee that for the great principles of our Government the\npeople are pretty nearly or quite unanimous. In regard to\nthe di\ufb00iculties that confront us at this time, and of which\nyou have seen \ufb01t to speak so becomingly and so justly, I can\nonly say I agree with the sentiments expressed. In my\ndevotion to the Union I hope I am behind no man in the\nnation. As to my wisdom in conducting a\ufb00airs so as to tend\nto the preservation of the Union, I fear too great con\ufb01dence\nmay have been placed in me. I am sure I bring a heart\ndevoted to the work. There is nothing that could ever bring\nme to consent \u2014 willingly to consent \u2014 to the destruction\nof this Union (in which not only the great city of New York,\nbut the whole country, has acquired its greatness), unless it\nwould be that thing for which the Union itself was made. I\nunderstand that the ship is made for the carrying and\npreservation of the cargo; and so long as the ship is safe\n with the cargo, it shall not be abandoned. This Union shall\nnever be abandoned, unless the possibility of its existence\nshall cease to exist without the necessity of throwing\npassengers and cargo overboard. So long, then, as it is\npossible that the prosperity and liberties of this people can\nbe preserved within this Union, it shall be my purpose at all\ntunes to preserve it. And now, Mr. Mayor, renewing my\nthanks for this cordial reception, allow me to come to a\nclose.\n A\n     A          I    \n \n      \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. DAYTON AND GENTLEMEN OF THE STATE OF\nNEW JERSEY: \u2014 I shall only thank you brie\ufb02y for this very\nkind reception given me, not personally, but as the\ntemporary representative of the majesty of the nation. To\nthe kindness of your hearts, and of the hearts of your\nbrethren in your State, I should be very proud to respond,\nbut I shall not have strength to address you or other\nassemblages at length, even if I had the time to do so. I\nappear before you, therefore, for little else than to greet\nyou, and to brie\ufb02y say farewell. You have done me the very\nhigh honor to present your reception courtesies to me\nthrough your great man a man with whom it is an honor to\nbe associated anywhere, and in owning whom no State can\nbe poor. He has said enough, and by the saying of it\nsuggested enough, to require a response of an hour, well\nconsidered. I could not in an hour make a worthy response\nto it. I therefore, ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey,\ncontent myself with saying, most heartily do I indorse all\nthe sentiments he has expressed. Allow me, most gratefully,\nto bid you farewell.\n        \n  H  \nA \n  \n  \n \nA    \n \n      \nFEBRUARY , .\nMR. MAYOR: \u2014 I thank you for this reception at the city\nof Newark. With regard to the great work of which you\nspeak, I will say that I bring to it a heart \ufb01lled with love for\nmy country, and an honest desire to do what is right. I am\nsure, however, that I have not the ability to do anything\nunaided of God, and that without His support and that of\nthis free, happy, prosperous, and intelligent people, no man\ncan succeed in doing that the importance of which we all\ncomprehend. Again thanking you for the reception you have\ngiven me, I will now bid you farewell, and proceed upon my\njourney.\n A\n     I\n    \n \n A   H     \n \n H\n  \nFEBRUARY , \nI HAVE BEEN invited by your representatives to the\nLegislature to visit this the capital of your honored State,\nand in acknowledging their kind invitation, compelled to\nrespond to the welcome of the presiding o\ufb00icers of each\nbody, and I suppose they intended I should speak to you\nthrough them, as they are the representatives of all of you;\nand if I were to speak again here, I should only have to\nrepeat in a great measure much that I have said, which\nwould be disgusting to my friends around me who have met\nhere. I have no speech to make, but merely appear to see\nyou and let you look at me; and as to the latter I think I\nhave greatly the best of the bargain. My friends, allow me\nto bid you farewell.\n A\n      \n  H    \nA   \n  \n \n      \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE\nOF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY: \u2014 I am very grateful to\nyou for the honorable reception of which I have been the\nobject. I cannot but remember the place that New Jersey\nholds in our early history. In the Revolutionary struggle few\nof the States among the Old Thirteen had more of the\nbattle-\ufb01elds of the country within their limits than New\nJersey. May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I mention\nthat away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my\nbeing able to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as\nfew of the younger members have ever seen Weems\u2019s Life\nof Washington. I remember all the accounts there given of\nthe battle-\ufb01elds and struggles for the liberties of the\ncountry; and none \ufb01xed themselves upon my imagination so\ndeeply as the struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey. The\ncrossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the\ngreat hardships endured at that time, all \ufb01xed themselves\non my memory more than any single Revolutionary event;\nand you all know, for you have all been boys, how these\nearly impressions last longer than any others. I recollect\nthinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have\nbeen something more than common that these men\n struggled for. I am exceedingly anxious that that thing that\nsomething even more than national independence, that\nsomething that held out a great promise to all the people of\nthe world to all time to come \u2014 I am exceedingly anxious\nthat this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the\npeople shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original\nidea for which that struggle was made; and I shall be most\nhappy indeed if I shall be a humble instrument in the hands\nof the Almighty, and of this his almost chosen people, for\nperpetuating the object of that great struggle. You give me\nthis reception, as I understand, without distinction of party.\nI learn that this body is composed of a majority of\ngentlemen who, in the exercise of their best judgment in\nthe choice of a chief magistrate, did not think I was the\nman. I understand, nevertheless, that they come forward\nhere to greet me as the constitutionally elected President of\nthe United States \u2014 as citizens of the United States to meet\nthe man who, for the time being, is the representative of\nthe majesty of the nation \u2014 united by the single purpose to\nperpetuate the Constitution, the union, and the liberties of\nthe people. As such, I accept this reception more gratefully\nthan I could do did I believe it were tendered to me as an\nindividual.\n A\n      \n  H  A   \n    \n  \n \n       \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. SPEAKER AND GENTLEMEN: I have just enjoyed\nthe honor of a reception by the other branch of this\nLegislature, and I return to you and them my thanks for the\nreception which the people of New Jersey have given\nthrough their chosen representatives to me as the\nrepresentative, for the time being, of the majesty of the\npeople of the United States. I appropriate to myself very\nlittle of the demonstrations of respect with which I have\nbeen greeted. I think little should be given to any man, but\nthat it should be a manifestation of adherence to the Union\nand the Constitution. I understand myself to be received\nhere by the representatives of the people of New Jersey, a\nmajority of whom di\ufb00er in opinion from those with whom I\nhave acted. This manifestation is therefore to be regarded\nby me as expressing their devotion to the Union, the\nConstitution, and the liberties of the people.\nYou, Mr. Speaker, have well said that this is a time when\nthe bravest and wisest look with doubt and awe upon the\naspect presented by our national a\ufb00airs. Under these\ncircumstances you will readily see why I should not speak\nin detail of the course I shall deem it best to pursue. It is\nproper that I should avail myself of all the information and\n all the time at my command, in order that when the time\narrives in which I must speak o\ufb00icially, I shall be able to\ntake the ground which I deem best and safest, and from\nwhich I may have no occasion to swerve. I shall endeavor to\ntake the ground I deem most just to the North, the East,\nthe West, the South, and the whole country. I shall take it, I\nhope, in good temper, certainly with no malice toward any\nsection. I shall do all that may be in my power to promote a\npeaceful settlement of all our di\ufb00iculties. The man does not\nlive who is more devoted to peace than I am, none who\nwould do more to preserve it, but it may be necessary to\nput the foot down \ufb01rmly. And if I do my duty and do right,\nyou will sustain me, will you not? [Loud cheers, and cries of\n\u201cYes, yes; we will.\u201d] Received as I am by the members of a\nLegislature the majority of whom do not agree with me in\npolitical sentiments, I trust that I may have their assistance\nin piloting the ship of state through this voyage,\nsurrounded by perils as it is; for if it should su\ufb00er wreck\nnow, there will be no pilot ever needed for another voyage.\nGentlemen, I have already spoken longer than I intended,\nand must beg leave to stop here.\n        \n  H  \nA \n  \n   HI A\n   HIA\n  \n    A\nIA\nFEBRUARY , \nMR. \nMAYOR \nAND \nFELLOW-CITIZENS \nOF\nPHILADELPHIA: \u2014 I appear before you to make no lengthy\nspeech, but to thank you for this reception. The reception\nyou have given me to-night is not to me, the man, the\nindividual, but to the man who temporarily represents, or\nshould represent, the majesty of the nation. It is true, as\nyour worthy mayor has said, that there is great anxiety\namongst the citizens of the United States at this time. I\ndeem it a happy circumstance that this dissatis\ufb01ed portion\nof our fellow-citizens does not point us to anything in which\nthey are being injured or about to be injured; for which\nreason I have felt all the while justi\ufb01ed in concluding that\nthe crisis, the panic, the anxiety of the country at this time\nis arti\ufb01cial. If there be those who di\ufb00er with me upon this\nsubject, they have not pointed out the substantial di\ufb00iculty\nthat exists. I do not mean to say that an arti\ufb01cial panic may\nnot do considerable harm; that it has done such I do not\ndeny. The hope that has been expressed by your mayor, that\nI may be able to restore peace, harmony, and prosperity to\nthe country, is most worthy of him; and most happy, indeed,\nwill I be if I shall be able to verify and ful\ufb01l that hope. I\n promise you that I bring to the work a sincere heart.\nWhether I will bring a head equal to that heart will be for\nfuture times to determine. It were useless for me to speak\nof details of plans now; I shall speak o\ufb00icially next Monday\nweek, if ever. If I should not speak then, it were useless for\nme to do so now. If I do speak then, it is useless for me to\ndo so now. When I do speak, I shall take such ground as I\ndeem best calculated to restore peace, harmony, and\nprosperity to the country, and tend to the perpetuity of the\nnation and the liberty of these States and these people.\nYour worthy mayor has expressed the wish, in which I join\nwith him, that it were convenient for me to remain in your\ncity \nlong \nenough \nto \nconsult \nyour \nmerchants \nand\nmanufacturers; or, as it were, to listen to those breathings\nrising \nwithin \nthe \nconsecrated \nwalls \nwherein \nthe\nConstitution of the United States and, I will add, the\nDeclaration of Independence, were originally framed and\nadopted. I assure you and your mayor that I had hoped on\nthis occasion, and upon all occasions during my life, that I\nshall do nothing inconsistent with the teachings of these\nholy and most sacred walls. I have never asked anything\nthat does not breathe from those walls. All my political\nwarfare has been in favor of the teachings that come forth\nfrom these sacred walls. May my right hand forget its\ncunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if\never I prove false to those teachings. Fellow-citizens, I have\naddressed you longer than I expected to do, and now allow\nme to bid you goodnight.\n A\n     I\n  H  HA   \n  I\n   \n \n  \n HI A\n   HIA\nFEBRUARY , \nMR. CUYLER: \u2014 I am \ufb01lled with deep emotion at \ufb01nding\nmyself standing here, in this place, where were collected\ntogether the wisdom, the devotion to principle, from which\nsprang the institutions under which we live. You have\nkindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of\nrestoring peace to the present distracted condition of the\ncountry. I can say in return, sir, that all the political\nsentiments I entertain have been drawn, so far as I have\nbeen able to draw them, from the sentiments which\noriginated and were given to the world from this hall. I\nhave never had a feeling politically that did not spring from\nthe \nsentiments \nembodied \nin \nthe \nDeclaration \nof\nIndependence. I have often pondered over the dangers\nwhich were incurred by the men who assembled here and\nframed and adopted that Declaration of Independence. I\nhave pondered over the toils that were endured by the\no\ufb00icers and soldiers of the army who achieved that\nindependence. I have often inquired of myself what great\nprinciple or idea it was that kept the confederacy so long\ntogether. It was not the mere matter of separation of the\ncolonies from the motherland, but that sentiment in the\n Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone\nto the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world for all\nfuture time. It was that which gave promise that in due\ntime the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all\nmen. This is the sentiment embodied in the Declaration of\nIndependence. Now, my friends, can the country be saved\nupon that basis? If it can, I will consider myself one of the\nhappiest men in the world if I can help to save it. If it\ncannot be saved upon that principle, it will be truly awful.\nBut if this country cannot be saved without giving up that\nprinciple, I was about to say I would rather be assassinated\non this spot than surrender it. Now, in my view of the\npresent aspect of a\ufb00airs, there need be no bloodshed or\nwar. There is no necessity for it. I am not in favor of such a\ncourse, and I may say, in advance, that there will be no\nbloodshed unless it is forced upon the Government, and\nthen it will be compelled to act in self-defence.\nMy friends; this is wholly an unexpected speech, and I\ndid not expect to be called upon to say a word when I came\nhere. I supposed it was merely to do something toward\nraising the \ufb02ag. I may, therefore, have said something\nindiscreet. I have said nothing but what I am willing to live\nby and, if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, die by.\n        \n  H  \nI \nI\n \n \n   \nA I\nFEBRUARY , \nMR. CHAIRMAN: \u2014 I feel highly \ufb02attered by the\nencomiums you have seen \ufb01t to bestow upon me. Soon after\nthe nomination of General Taylor, I attended a political\nmeeting in the city of Wilmington, and have since carried\nwith me a fond remembrance of the hospitalities of the city\non that occasion. The programme established provides for\nmy presence in Harrisburg in twenty-four hours from this\ntime. I expect to be in Washington on Saturday. It is,\ntherefore, an impossibility that I should accept your kind\ninvitation. There are no people whom I would more gladly\naccommodate than those of Delaware; but circumstances\nforbid, gentlemen. With many regrets for the character of\nthe reply I am compelled to give you, I bid you adieu.\n A\n     A   A\n A        \n    A\nIA\nFEBRUARY , \nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF OLD LANCASTER: \u2014 I\nappear not to make a speech. I have not time to make a\nspeech at length, and not strength to make them on every\noccasion; and, worse than all, I have none to make. There is\nplenty of matter to speak about in these times, but it is well\nknown that the more a man speaks the less he is\nunderstood \u2014 the more he says one thing, the more his\nadversaries contend he meant something else. I shall soon\nhave occasion to speak o\ufb00icially, and then I will endeavor to\nput my thoughts just as plain as I can express myself \u2014\ntrue to the Constitution and Union of all the States, and to\nthe perpetual liberty of all the people. Until I so speak,\nthere is no need to enter upon details. In conclusion, I greet\nyou most heartily, and bid you an a\ufb00ectionate farewell.\n A\n      \n  H    \nI  A \n   \n  \n    A\nIA  A  HA  I  \n \nFEBRUARY , \nMR. SPEAKER OF THE SENATE, AND ALSO MR.\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND\nGENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE\nSTATE OF PENNSYLVANIA: \u2014 I appear before you only for\na very few brief remarks in response to what has been said\nto me. I thank you most sincerely for this reception, and the\ngenerous words in which support has been promised me\nupon this occasion. I thank your great commonwealth for\nthe overwhelming support it recently gave, not me\npersonally, but the cause which I think a just one, in the\nlate election.\nAllusion has been made to the fact \u2014 the interesting fact\nperhaps we should say \u2014 that I for the \ufb01rst time appear at\nthe capital of the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania\nupon the birthday of the Father of his Country. In\nconnection with that beloved anniversary connected with\nthe history of this country, I have already gone through one\nexceedingly \ninteresting \nscene \nthis \nmorning \nin \nthe\nceremonies at Philadelphia. Under the kind conduct of\ngentlemen there, I was for the \ufb01rst time allowed the\nprivilege of standing in old Independence Hall to have a\n few words addressed to me there, and opening up to me an\nopportunity of manifesting my deep regret that I had not\nmore time to express something of my own feelings excited\nby the occasion, that had been really the feelings of my\nwhole life.\nBesides \nthis, \nour \nfriends \nthere \nhad \nprovided \na\nmagni\ufb01cent \ufb02ag of the country. They had arranged it so\nthat I was given the honor of raising it to the head of its\nsta\ufb00, and when it went up I was pleased that it went to its\nplace by the strength of my own feeble arm. When,\naccording to the arrangement, the cord was pulled, and it\n\ufb02oated gloriously to the wind, without an accident, in the\nbright, glowing sunshine of the morning, I could not help\nhoping that there was in the entire success of that beautiful\nceremony at least something of an omen of what is to come.\nNor could I help feeling then, as I have often felt, that in\nthe whole of that proceeding I was a very humbled\ninstrument. I had not provided the \ufb02ag; I had not made the\narrangements for elevating it to its place; I had applied but\na very small portion of even my feeble strength in raising it.\nIn the whole transaction I was in the hands of the people\nwho had arranged it, and if I can have the same generous\nco-operation of the people of this nation, I think the \ufb02ag of\nour country may yet be kept \ufb02aunting gloriously.\nI recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at\nthe hotel in regard to what has been said about the military\nsupport which the General Government may expect from\nthe commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper emergency.\nTo guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this. It\n is not with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility\nthat a necessity may arise in this country for the use of the\nmilitary arm. While I am exceedingly grati\ufb01ed to see the\nmanifestation upon your streets of your military force here,\nand exceedingly grati\ufb01ed at your promise to use that force\nupon a proper emergency \u2014 while I make these\nacknowledgments I desire to repeat, in order to preclude\nany possible misconstruction, that I do most sincerely hope\nthat we shall have no use for them; that it will never\nbecome their duty to shed blood, and most especially never\nto shed fraternal blood. I promise that so far as I may have\nwisdom to direct, if so painful a result shall in any wise be\nbrought about, it shall be through no fault of mine.\nAllusion has also been made by one of your honored\nspeakers to some remarks recently made by myself at\nPittsburg in regard to what is supposed to be the especial\ninterest of this great commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I now\nwish only to say in regard to that matter, that the few\nremarks which I uttered on that occasion were rather\ncarefully worded. I took pains that they should be so. I have\nseen no occasion since to add to them or subtract from\nthem. I leave them precisely as they stand, adding only now\nthat I am pleased to have an expression from you,\ngentlemen of Pennsylvania, signifying that they are\nsatisfactory to you.\nAnd now, gentlemen of the General Assembly of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, allow me again to return\nto you my most sincere thanks.\n        \n  H  \nA \n  \n  \nA HI\n \n  \n. .\nFEBRUARY , \nMR. MAYOR: \u2014 I thank you, and through you the\nmunicipal authorities of this city who accompany you, for\nthis welcome. And as it is the \ufb01rst time in my life, since the\npresent phase of politics has presented itself in this\ncountry, that I have said anything publicly within a region\nof country where the institution of slavery exists, I will take\nthis occasion to say that I think very much of the ill feeling\nthat has existed and still exists between the people in the\nsection from which I came and the people here, is\ndependent upon a misunderstanding of one another. I\ntherefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you, Mr.\nMayor, and all the gentlemen present, that I have not now,\nand never have had, any other than as kindly feelings\ntoward you as to the people of my own section. I have not\nnow, and never have had, any disposition to treat you in any\nrespect otherwise than as my own neighbors. I have not\nnow any purpose to withhold from you any of the bene\ufb01ts\nof the Constitution, under any circumstances, that I would\nnot feel myself constrained to withhold from my own\nneighbors; and I hope, in a word, that when we shall\nbecome better acquainted \u2014 and I say it with great\n con\ufb01dence \u2014 we shall like each other better. I thank you\nfor the kindness of this reception.\n        \n A     \nA\n  A  \nA HI\n \n  \n. .\nFEBRUARY , \nMY FRIENDS: \u2014 I suppose that I may take this as a\ncompliment paid to me, and as such please accept my\nthanks for it. I have reached this city of Washington under\ncircumstances considerably di\ufb00ering from those under\nwhich any other man has ever reached it. I am here for the\npurpose of taking an o\ufb00icial position amongst the people,\nalmost all of whom were politically opposed to me, and are\nyet opposed to me, as I suppose.\nI propose no lengthy address to you. I only propose to\nsay, as I did on yesterday, when your worthy mayor and\nboard of aldermen called upon me, that I thought much of\nthe ill feeling that has existed between you and the people\nof your surroundings and that people from among whom I\ncame, \nhas \ndepended, \nand \nnow \ndepends, \nupon \na\nmisunderstanding.\nI hope that, if things shall go along as prosperously as I\nbelieve we all desire they may, I may have it in my power to\nremove something of this misunderstanding; that I may be\nenabled to convince you, and the people of your section of\nthe country, that we regard you as in all things our equals,\nand in all things entitled to the same respect and the same\ntreatment that we claim for ourselves; that we are in no\n wise disposed, if it were in our power, to oppress you, to\ndeprive you of any of your rights under the Constitution of\nthe United States, or even narrowly to split hairs with you\nin regard to these rights, but are determined to give you, as\nfar as lies in our hands, all your rights under the\nConstitution \u2014 not grudgingly, but fully and fairly. I hope\nthat, by thus dealing with you, we will become better\nacquainted, and be better friends.\nAnd now, my friends, with these few remarks, and again\nreturning my thanks for this compliment, and expressing\nmy desire to hear a little more of your good music, I bid you\ngood-night.\n A HI\n \n   \nA   \nA  H       \n[DURING \nTHE \nSTRUGGLE \nover \nthe \nappointments \nof\nLINCOLN\u2019s Cabinet, the President-elect spoke as follows:]\nGentlemen, it is evident that some one must take the\nresponsibility of these appointments, and I will do it. My\nCabinet is completed. The positions are not de\ufb01nitely\nassigned, and will not be until I announce them privately to\nthe gentlemen whom I have selected as my Constitutional\nadvisers.\n  I    I\nA\n A  A\n      \nA  H       \nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES: \u2014 In\ncompliance with a custom as old as the Government itself, I\nappear before you to address you brie\ufb02y, and to take in\nyour presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of\nthe United States to be taken by the President \u201cbefore he\nenters on the execution of his o\ufb00ice.\u201d\nI do not consider it necessary at present for me to\ndiscuss those matters of administration about which there\nis no special anxiety or excitement.\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the\nSouthern States that by the accession of a Republican\nadministration their property and their peace and personal\nsecurity are to be endangered. There has never been any\nreasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most\nample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed\nand been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all\nthe published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do\nbut quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\n\u201cI have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere\nwith the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I\nbelieve I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no\ninclination to do so.\u201d\n Those who nominated and elected me did so with full\nknowledge that I had made this and many similar\ndeclarations, and had never recanted them. And, more than\nthis, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as\na law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic\nresolution which I now read:\n\u201cResolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of\nthe States, and especially the right of each State to order\nand control its own domestic institutions according to its\nown judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of\npower on which the perfection and endurance of our\npolitical fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless\ninvasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory,\nno matter under what pretext, as amongst the gravest of\ncrimes.\u201d\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only\npress upon the public attention the most conclusive\nevidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property,\npeace, and security of no section are to be in any wise\nendangered by the now incoming administration. I add, too,\nthat all the protection which, consistently with the\nConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully\ngiven to all the States when lawfully demanded, for\nwhatever cause \u2014 as cheerfully to one section as to\nanother.\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of\nfugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as\nplainly written in the Constitution as any other of its\nprovisions:\n \u201cNo person held to service or labor in one State, under\nthe \nlaws \nthereof, \nescaping \ninto \nanother, \nshall \nin\nconsequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged\nfrom such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on\nclaim of the party to whom such service or labor may be\ndue.\u201d\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended\nby those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call\nfugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.\nAll members of Congress swear their support to the whole\nConstitution \u2014 to this provision as much as to any other. To\nthe proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within\nthe terms of this clause \u201cshall be delivered up,\u201d their oaths\nare unanimous. Now, if they would make the e\ufb00ort in good\ntemper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame\nand pass a law by means of which to keep good that\nunanimous oath?\nThere is some di\ufb00erence of opinion whether this clause\nshould be enforced by national or by State authority; but\nsurely that di\ufb00erence is not a very material one. If the slave\nis to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to\nhim or to others by which authority it is done. And should\nany one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept\non a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be\nkept?\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the\nsafeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane\njurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not,\nin any case, surrendered as a slave? And might it not be\n well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement\nof that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\n\u201cthe citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges\nand immunities of citizens in the several States\u201d?\nI \ntake \nthe \no\ufb00icial \noath \nto-day \nwith \nno \nmental\nreservations, and with no purpose to construe the\nConstitution or laws by any hypercritical rules. And, while I\ndo not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much\nsafer for all, both in o\ufb00icial and private stations, to conform\nto and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than\nto violate any of them, trusting to \ufb01nd impunity in having\nthem held to be unconstitutional.\nIt is seventy-two years since the \ufb01rst inauguration of a\nPresident under our national Constitution. During that\nperiod \ufb01fteen di\ufb00erent and greatly distinguished citizens\nhave, in succession, administered the executive branch of\nthe Government. They have conducted it through many\nperils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this\nscope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the\nbrief constitutional term of four years under great and\npeculiar di\ufb00iculty. A disruption of the Federal Union,\nheretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the\nConstitution, the Union of these States is perpetual.\nPerpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental\nlaw of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no\ngovernment proper ever had a provision in its organic law\nfor its own termination. Continue to execute all the express\n provisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will\nendure forever \u2014 it being impossible to destroy it except by\nsome action not provided for in the instrument itself.\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper,\nbut an association of States in the nature of contract\nmerely, can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less\nthan all the parties who made it? One party to a contract\nmay violate it \u2014 break it, so to speak; but does it not\nrequire all to lawfully rescind it?\nDescending from these general principles, we \ufb01nd the\nproposition that in legal contemplation the Union is\nperpetual con\ufb01rmed by the history of the Union itself. The\nUnion is much older than the Constitution. It was formed,\nin fact, by the Articles of Association in . It was\nmatured and continued by the Declaration of Independence\nin . It was further matured, and the faith of all the\nthen thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it\nshould be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in\n. And, \ufb01nally, in  one of the declared objects for\nordaining and establishing the Constitution was \u201cto form a\nmore perfect Union.\u201d\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part\nonly of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less\nperfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital\nelement of perpetuity.\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own\nmere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that\nresolves and ordinances to that e\ufb00ect are legally void; and\nthat acts of violence, within any State or States, against the\n authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and\nthe laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my\nability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly\nenjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully\nexecuted in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a\nsimple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as\npracticable, unless my rightful masters, the American\npeople, shall withhold the requisite means, or in some\nauthoritative manner direct the contrary. I trust this will\nnot be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared\npurpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and\nmaintain itself.\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence;\nand there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the\nnational authority. The power con\ufb01ded to me will be used to\nhold, occupy, and possess the property and places\nbelonging to the Government, and to collect the duties and\nimposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these\nobjects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against\nor among the people anywhere. Where hostility to the\nUnited States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and\nuniversal as to prevent competent resident citizens from\nholding the Federal o\ufb00ices, there will be no attempt to\nforce obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.\nWhile the strict legal right may exist in the government to\nenforce the exercise of these o\ufb00ices, the attempt to do so\nwould be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal,\n that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such\no\ufb00ices.\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished\nin all parts of the Union. So far as possible, the people\neverywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which\nis most favorable to calm thought and re\ufb02ection. The\ncourse here indicated will be followed unless current\nevents and experience shall show a modi\ufb01cation or change\nto be proper, and in every case and exigency my best\ndiscretion will be exercised according to circumstances\nactually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful\nsolution of the national troubles and the restoration of\nfraternal sympathies and a\ufb00ections.\nThat there are persons in one section or another who\nseek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any\npretext to do it, I will neither a\ufb00irm nor deny; but if there\nbe such, I need address no word to them. To those,\nhowever, who really love the Union may I not speak?\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the\ndestruction of our national fabric, with all its bene\ufb01ts, its\nmemories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain\nprecisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step\nwhile there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you\n\ufb02y from have no real existence? Will you, while the certain\nills you \ufb02y to are greater than all the real ones you \ufb02y from\n\u2014 will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional\nrights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that any right,\nplainly written in the Constitution, has been denied? I think\n not. Happily the human mind is so constituted that no party\ncan reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of\na single instance in which a plainly written provision of the\nConstitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force of\nnumbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly\nwritten constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of\nview, justify revolution \u2014 certainly would if such a right\nwere a vital one. But such is not our case. All the vital\nrights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured\nto them by a\ufb00irmations and negations, guaranties and\nprohibitions, in the Constitution, that controversies never\narise concerning them. But no organic law can ever be\nframed with a provision speci\ufb01cally applicable to every\nquestion which may occur in practical administration. No\nforesight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable\nlength \ncontain, \nexpress \nprovisions \nfor \nall \npossible\nquestions. Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by\nnational or by State authority? The Constitution does not\nexpressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the\nTerritories? The Constitution does not expressly say. Must\nCongress \nprotect \nslavery \nin \nthe \nTerritories? \nThe\nConstitution does not expressly say.\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional\ncontroversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and\nminorities. If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority\nmust, or the Government must cease. There is no other\nalternative; for continuing the Government is acquiescence\non one side or the other.\n If a minority in such case will secede rather than\nacquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn will divide\nand ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from\nthem whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such\nminority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new\nconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\nprecisely as portions of the present Union now claim to\nsecede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are\nnow being educated to the exact temper of doing this.\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the\nStates to compose a new Union as to produce harmony\nonly, and prevent renewed secession?\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of\nanarchy. A majority held in restraint by constitutional\nchecks and limitations, and always changing easily with\ndeliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is\nthe only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it\ndoes, of necessity, \ufb02y to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity\nis impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent\narrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the\nmajority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all\nthat is left.\nI do not forget the position assumed by some, that\nconstitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme\nCourt; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding, in\nany case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that\nsuit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and\nconsideration in all parallel cases by all other departments\nof the government. And, while it is obviously possible that\n such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the\nevil e\ufb00ect following it, being limited to that particular case,\nwith the chance that it may be overruled and never become\na precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could\nthe evils of a di\ufb00erent practice. At the same time, the\ncandid citizen must confess that if the policy of the\ngovernment, upon vital questions a\ufb00ecting the whole\npeople, is to be irrevocably \ufb01xed by decisions of the\nSupreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary\nlitigation between parties in personal actions, the people\nwill have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that\nextent practically resigned the government into the hands\nof that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any\nassault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which\nthey may not shrink to decide cases properly brought\nbefore them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to\nturn their decisions to political purposes.\nOne section of our country believes slavery is right, and\nought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong,\nand ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial\ndispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution and\nthe law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are\neach as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a\ncommunity where the moral sense of the people imperfectly\nsupports the law itself. The great body of the people abide\nby the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break\nover in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it\nwould be worse in both cases after the separation of the\nsections than before. The foreign slave trade, now\n imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\nwithout restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,\nnow only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered\nat all by the other.\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot\nremove our respective sections from each other, nor build\nan impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may\nbe divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the\nreach of each other; but the di\ufb00erent parts of our country\ncannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue\nbetween them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse\nmore advantageous or more satisfactory after separation\nthan before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends\ncan make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\nbetween aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you\ngo to war, you cannot \ufb01ght always; and when, after much\nloss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease\n\ufb01ghting, the identical old questions as to terms of\nintercourse are again upon you.\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people\nwho inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the\nexisting government, they can exercise their constitutional\nright of amending it, or their revolutionary right to\ndismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant of the fact\nthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of\nhaving the national Constitution amended. While I make no\nrecommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the\nrightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to\n be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the\ninstrument \nitself, \nand \nI \nshould, \nunder \nexisting\ncircumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity\nbeing a\ufb00orded the people to act upon it. I will venture to\nadd that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in\nthat it allows amendments to originate with the people\nthemselves, instead of only permitting them to take or\nreject propositions originated by others not especially\nchosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely\nsuch as they would wish to either accept or refuse. I\nunderstand a proposed amendment to the Constitution\nwhich amendment, however, I have not seen \u2014 has passed\nCongress, to the e\ufb00ect that the Federal Government shall\nnever interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\nincluding that of persons held to service. To avoid\nmisconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my\npurpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to\nsay that, holding such a provision to now be implied\nconstitutional law, I have no objection to its being made\nexpress and irrevocable.\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the\npeople, and they have conferred none upon him to \ufb01x terms\nfor the separation of the States. The people themselves can\ndo this also if they choose; but the executive, as such, has\nnothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present\ngovernment, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it,\nunimpaired by him, to his successors.\nWhy should there not be a patient con\ufb01dence in the\nultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or equal\n hope in the world? In our present di\ufb00erences is either party\nwithout faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of\nnations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side\nof the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that\njustice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great\ntribunal of the American people.\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this\nsame people have wisely given their public servants but\nlittle power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom,\nprovided for the return of that little to their own hands at\nvery short intervals. While the people retain their virtue\nand vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of\nwickedness \nor \nfolly, \ncan \nvery \nseriously \ninjure \nthe\ngovernment in the short space of four years.\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon\nthis whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking\ntime. If there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste\nto a step which you would never take deliberately, that\nobject will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object\ncan be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatis\ufb01ed\nstill have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the\nsensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it;\nwhile the new administration will have no immediate\npower, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that\nyou who are dissatis\ufb01ed hold the right side in the dispute,\nthere still is no single good reason for precipitate action.\nIntelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a \ufb01rm reliance on\nHim who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still\n competent to adjust in the best way all our present\ndi\ufb00iculty.\nIn your hands, my dissatis\ufb01ed fellow-countrymen, and\nnot in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The\ngovernment will not assail you. You can have no con\ufb02ict\nwithout being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath\nregistered in heaven to destroy the government, while I\nshall have the most solemn one to \u201cpreserve, protect, and\ndefend\u201d it.\nI am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We\nmust not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it\nmust not break, our bonds of a\ufb00ection. The mystic chords\nof memory, stretching from every battle-\ufb01eld and patriot\ngrave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this\nbroad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when\nagain touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels\nof our nature.\n    \n A  \n    \nA \n    I\nA I\nTO WM. H. SEWARD.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH , .\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your note of the d instant, asking to\nwithdraw your acceptance of my invitation to take charge\nof the State Department, was duly received. It is the\nsubject of the most painful solicitude with me, and I feel\nconstrained to beg that you will countermand the\nwithdrawal. The public interest, I think, demands that you\nshould; and my personal feelings are deeply enlisted in the\nsame direction. Please consider and answer by  A.M. to-\nmorrow.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n        \n  H    \n    A\nIA \n   \nA I\nWASHINGTON, MARCH , \nMR. \nCHAIRMAN \nAND \nGENTLEMEN \nOF \nTHE\nPENNSYLVANIAN DELEGATION: \u2014 As I have so frequently\nsaid heretofore, when I have had occasion to address the\npeople of the Keystone, in my visits to that State, I can now\nbut repeat the assurance of my grati\ufb01cation at the support\nyou gave me at the election, and at the promise of a\ncontinuation of that support which is now tendered to me.\nAllusion has been made to the hope that you entertain\nthat you have a President and a government. In respect to\nthat I wish to say to you that in the position I have assumed\nI wish to do more than I have ever given reason to believe I\nwould do. I do not wish you to believe that I assume to be\nany better than others who have gone before me. I prefer\nrather to have it understood that if we ever have a\ngovernment on the principles we profess, we should\nremember, while we exercise our opinion, that others have\nalso rights to the exercise of their opinions, and that we\nshould endeavor to allow these rights, and act in such a\nmanner as to create no bad feeling. I hope we have a\ngovernment and a President. I hope, and wish it to be\nunderstood, that there may be no allusion to unpleasant\ndi\ufb00erences.\n We must remember that the people of all the States are\nentitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens\nof the several States. We should bear this in mind, and act\nin such a way as to say nothing insulting or irritating. I\nwould inculcate this idea, so that we may not, like\nPharisees, set ourselves up to be better than other people.\nNow, my friends, my public duties are pressing to-day,\nand will prevent my giving more time to you. Indeed, I\nshould not have left them now, but I could not well deny\nmyself to so large and respectable a body.\n        \n  H  \nA  A H\n      \n   \nA I\nWASHINGTON, MARCH , \nI AM THANKFUL for this renewed assurance of kind feeling\nand con\ufb01dence, and the support of the old Bay State, in so\nfar as you, Mr. Chairman, have expressed, in behalf of\nthose whom you represent, your sanction of what I have\nenunciated in my inaugural address. This is very grateful to\nmy feelings. The object was one of great delicacy, in\npresenting views at the opening of an administration under\nthe peculiar circumstances attending my entrance upon the\no\ufb00icial duties connected with the Government. I studied all\nthe points with great anxiety, and presented them with\nwhatever of ability and sense of justice I could bring to\nbear. If it met the approbation of our good friends in\nMassachusetts, I shall be exceedingly grati\ufb01ed, while I\nhope it will meet the approbation of friends everywhere. I\nam thankful for the expressions of those who have voted\nwith us; and like every other man of you, I like them as\ncertainly as I do others. As the President in the\nadministration of the Government, I hope to be man enough\nnot to know one citizen of the United States from another,\nnor one section from another. I shall be grati\ufb01ed to have\ngood friends of Massachusetts and others who have thus\n far supported me in these national views still to support me\nin carrying them out.\n  \n       A     \nA \nE ECUTIVE CHAMBER, MARCH , \nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Herewith is the diplomatic address and\nmy reply.

In case the\nreferee shall \ufb01nd himself unable to decide where the line is\nby the description of it in the treaty of June , , shall\nhe be authorized to establish a line according to the treaty\nas nearly as possible? Which of the three powers named by\n Great Britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the United\nStates?\u201d\nI \ufb01nd no reason to disapprove of the course of my\npredecessor in this important matter; but, on the contrary, I\nnot only shall receive the advice of the Senate thereon\ncheerfully, but I respectfully ask the Senate for their advice\non the three questions before recited.\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\nWASHINGTON, March , \n A\n A  A\n IA  A  \nI\n \n \n \nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\nE ECUTIVE \nMANSION, \nMARCH \n,  HON.\nSECRETARY OF STATE.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 I believe it is a necessity with us to\nmake the appointments I mentioned last night \u2014 that is,\nCharles F. Adams to England, William L. Dayton to France,\nGeorge P. Marsh to Sardinia, and Anson Burlingame to\nAustria. These gentlemen all have my highest esteem, but\nno one of them is originally suggested by me except Mr.\nDayton. Mr. Adams I take because you suggested him,\ncoupled with his eminent \ufb01tness for the place. Mr. Marsh\nand Mr. Burlingame I take because of the intense pressure\nof their respective States, and their \ufb01tness also.\nThe objection to this card is that locally they are so\nhuddled up \u2014 three being in New England and two from a\nsingle State. I have considered this, and will not shrink\nfrom the responsibility. This, being done, leaves but \ufb01ve full\nmissions undisposed of \u2014 Rome, China, Brazil, Peru, and\nChili.

LINCOLN.\n  \n    \n  A  AI\n  A\n   \n     .\n(Con\ufb01dential.) \nWASHINGTON CITY, APRIL , \nSIR: \u2014 Circumstances render it necessary to place in\ncommand of your ship (and for a special purpose) an o\ufb00icer\nwho is fully informed and instructed in relation to the\nwishes of the Government, and you will therefore consider\nyourself detached. But in taking this step the Government\ndoes not in the least re\ufb02ect upon your e\ufb00iciency or\npatriotism; on the contrary, have the fullest con\ufb01dence in\nyour ability to perform any duty required of you. Hoping\nsoon to be able to give you a better command than the one\nyou now enjoy, and trusting that you will have full\ncon\ufb01dence in the disposition of the Government toward\nyou, I remain, etc., A. LINCOLN.\n       A     \nA \n    I\n  \n   \n \nMEMORANDUM FROM SECRETARY SEWARD, APRIL ,\n\nSOME THOUGHTS FOR the President\u2019s Consideration,\nFirst. We are at the end of a month\u2019s administration, and\nyet without a policy either domestic or foreign.\nSecond. This, however, is not culpable, and it has even\nbeen unavoidable. The presence of the Senate, with the\nneed to meet applications for patronage, have prevented\nattention to other and more grave matters.\nThird. But further delay to adopt and prosecute our\npolicies for both domestic and foreign a\ufb00airs would not\nonly bring scandal on the administration, but danger upon\nthe country.\nFourth. To do this we must dismiss the applicants for\no\ufb00ice. But how? I suggest that we make the local\nappointments forthwith, leaving foreign or general ones for\nulterior and occasional action.\nFifth. The policy at home. I am aware that my views are\nsingular, and perhaps not su\ufb00iciently explained. My system\nis built upon this idea as a ruling one, namely, that we must\nCHANGE THE QUESTION BEFORE THE PUBLIC FROM\nONE UPON SLAVERY, OR ABOUT SLAVERY, for a question\nupon UNION OR DISUNION: In other words, from what\n would be regarded as a party question, to one of patriotism\nor union.\nThe occupation or evacuation of Fort Sumter, although\nnot in fact a slavery or a party question, is so regarded.\nWitness the temper manifested by the Republicans in the\nfree States, and even by the Union men in the South.\nI would therefore terminate it as a safe means for\nchanging the issue. I deem it fortunate that the last\nadministration created the necessity.\nFor the rest, I would simultaneously defend and reinforce\nall the ports in the gulf, and have the navy recalled from\nforeign stations to be prepared for a blockade. Put the\nisland of Key West under martial law.\nThis will raise distinctly the question of union or\ndisunion. I would maintain every fort and possession in the\nSouth.\nFOR FOREIGN NATIONS,\nI would demand explanations from Spain and France,\ncategorically, at once.\nI would seek explanations from Great Britain and Russia,\nand send agents into Canada, Mexico, and Central America\nto rouse a vigorous continental spirit of independence on\nthis continent against European intervention.\nAnd, if satisfactory explanations are not received from\nSpain and France,\nWould convene Congress and declare war against them.\nBut whatever policy we adopt, there must be an\nenergetic prosecution of it.\n For this purpose it must be somebody\u2019s business to\npursue and direct it incessantly.\nEither the President must do it himself, and be all the\nwhile active in it, or Devolve it on some member of his\nCabinet. Once adopted, debates on it must end, and all\nagree and abide.\nIt is not in my especial province; But I neither seek to\nevade nor assume responsibility.\n        \n       A     \nA \n \n \n A\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, APRIL , \nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Since parting with you I have been\nconsidering your paper dated this day, and entitled \u201cSome\nThoughts for the President\u2019s Consideration.\u201d The \ufb01rst\nproposition in it is, \u201cFirst, We are at the end of a month\u2019s\nadministration, and yet without a policy either domestic or\nforeign.\u201d\nAt the beginning of that month, in the inaugural, I said:\n\u201cThe power con\ufb01ded to me will be used to hold, occupy,\nand possess the property and places belonging to the\nGovernment, and to Collect the duties and imposts.\u201d This\nhad your distinct approval at the time; and, taken in\nconnection with the order I immediately gave General\nScott, directing him to employ every means in his power to\nstrengthen and hold the forts, comprises the exact\ndomestic policy you now urge, with the single exception\nthat it does not propose to abandon Fort Sumter.\nAgain, I do not perceive how the reinforcement of Fort\nSumter would be done on a slavery or a party issue, while\nthat of Fort Pickens would be on a more national and\npatriotic one.\n The news received yesterday in regard to St. Domingo\ncertainly brings a new item within the range of our foreign\npolicy; but up to that time we have been preparing\ncirculars and instructions to ministers and the like, all in\nperfect harmony, without even a suggestion that we had no\nforeign policy.\nUpon your Closing propositions \u2014 that, \u201cWhatever policy\nwe adopt, there must be an energetic prosecution of it.\n\u201cFor this purpose it must be somebody\u2019s business to\npursue and direct it incessantly.\n\u201cEither the President must do it himself, and be all the\nwhile active in it, or, \u201cDevolve it on some member of his\nCabinet. Once adopted, debates on it must end, and all\nagree and abide\u201d \u2014 I remark that if this must be done, I\nmust do it. When a general line of policy is adopted, I\napprehend there is no danger of its being changed without\ngood reason, or continuing to be a subject of unnecessary\ndebate; still, upon points arising in its progress I wish, and\nsuppose I am entitled to have, the advice of all the Cabinet.\nYour obedient servant,\nA. LINCOLN.\n        \n A  \nI       \n  H   I \nI\nIA\n \n  \n I\n  A  I         \nHON. WILLIAM BALLARD PRESTON, ALE ANDER H.\nH. STUART, GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, Esq.\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 As a committee of the Virginia\nConvention now in Session, you present me a preamble and\nresolution in these words:\n\u201cWhereas, in the opinion of this Convention, the\nuncertainty which prevails in the public mind as to the\npolicy which the Federal Executive intends to pursue\ntoward the seceded States is extremely injurious to the\nindustrial and commercial interests of the country, tends to\nkeep up an excitement which is unfavorable to the\nadjustment \nof \npending \ndi\ufb00iculties, \nand \nthreatens \na\ndisturbance of the public peace: therefore\n\u201cResolved, that a committee of three delegates be\nappointed by this Convention to wait upon the President of\nthe United States, present to him this preamble and\nresolution, and respectfully ask him to communicate to this\nConvention the policy which the Federal Executive intends\nto pursue in regard to the Confederate States.\n\u201cAdopted by the Convention of the State of Virginia,\nRichmond, April , .\u201d\nIn answer I have to say that, having at the beginning of\nmy o\ufb00icial term expressed my intended policy as plainly as\n I was able, it is with deep regret and some morti\ufb01cation I\nnow learn that there is great and injurious uncertainty in\nthe public mind as to what that policy is, and what course I\nintend to pursue. Not having as yet seen occasion to\nchange, it is now my purpose to pursue the course marked\nout in the inaugural address. I commend a careful\nconsideration of the whole document as the best expression\nI can give of my purposes.\nAs I then and therein said, I now repeat: \u201cThe power\ncon\ufb01ded to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the\nproperty and places belonging to the Government, and to\ncollect the duties and imposts; but beyond what is\nnecessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no\nusing of force against or among the people anywhere.\u201d By\nthe \nwords \n\u201cproperty \nand \nplaces \nbelonging \nto \nthe\nGovernment,\u201d I chie\ufb02y allude to the military posts and\nproperty which were in the possession of the Government\nwhen it came to my hands.\nBut if, as now appears to be true, in pursuit of a purpose\nto drive the United States authority from these places, an\nunprovoked assault has been made upon Fort Sumter, I\nshall hold myself at liberty to repossess, if I can, like places\nwhich had been seized before the Government was\ndevolved upon me. And in every event I shall, to the extent\nof my ability, repel force by force. In case it proves true\nthat Fort Sumter has been assaulted, as is reported, I shall\nperhaps cause the United States mails to be withdrawn\nfrom all the States which claim to have seceded, believing\n that the commencement of actual war against the\nGovernment justi\ufb01es and possibly demands this.\nI scarcely need to say that I consider the military posts\nand property situated within the States which claim to have\nseceded as yet belonging to the Government of the United\nStates as much as they did before the supposed secession.\nWhatever else I may do for the purpose, I shall not\nattempt to collect the duties and imposts by any armed\ninvasion of any part of the country; not meaning by this,\nhowever, that I may not land a force deemed necessary to\nrelieve a fort upon a border of the country.\nFrom the fact that I have quoted a part of the inaugural\naddress, it must not be inferred that I repudiate any other\npart, the whole of which I rea\ufb00irm, except so far as what I\nnow say of the mails may be regarded as a modi\ufb01cation.\n   \n  A\nA I\n  A  I\n  \n         \nI I IA\nAND CONVENING CONGRESS IN E TRA SESSION, APRIL\n, .\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA:\nA Proclamation.\nWhereas the laws of the United States have been for\nsome time past and now are opposed, and the execution\nthereof obstructed, in the States of South Carolina,\nGeorgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and\nTexas, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by\nthe ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the\npowers vested in the marshals bylaw:\nNow, therefore, I, A. LINCOLN, President of the United\nStates, in virtue of the power in me vested by the\nConstitution and the laws, have thought \ufb01t to call forth, and\nhereby do call forth, the militia of the several States of the\nUnion, to the aggregate number of seventy-\ufb01ve thousand,\nin order to suppress said combinations, and to cause the\nlaws to be duly executed.\nThe \ndetails \nfor \nthis \nobject \nwill \nbe \nimmediately\ncommunicated to the State authorities through the War\nDepartment.\n I appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid\nthis e\ufb00ort to maintain the honor, the integrity, and the\nexistence of our National Union, and the perpetuity of\npopular government; and to redress wrongs already long\nenough endured.\nI deem it proper to say that the \ufb01rst service assigned to\nthe forces hereby called forth will probably be to repossess\nthe forts, places, and property which have been seized from\nthe Union; and in every event the utmost care will be\nobserved, consistently with the objects aforesaid, to avoid\nany devastation, any destruction of or interference with\nproperty, or any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part\nof the country.\nAnd I hereby command the persons composing the\ncombinations aforesaid to disperse and retire peacefully to\ntheir respective abodes within twenty days from date.\nDeeming that the present condition of public a\ufb00airs\npresents an extraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of\nthe power in me vested by the Constitution, convene both\nHouses of Congress. Senators and Representatives are\ntherefore summoned to assemble at their respective\nchambers, at twelve o\u2019clock noon, on Thursday, the fourth\nday of July next, then and there to consider and determine\nsuch measures as, in their wisdom, the public safety and\ninterest may seem to demand.\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\nDone at the city of Washington, this \ufb01fteenth day of April,\nin the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\n sixty-one, and of the independence of the United States the\neighty-\ufb01fth.\nA. LINCOLN\nBy the President:\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\n   \n  A\nA I\n \n    \n  A\n   A  I         \nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA:\nA PROCLAMATION.\nWhereas an insurrection against the Government of the\nUnited States has broken out in the States of South\nCarolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana,\nand Texas, and the laws of the United States for the\ncollection of the revenue cannot be e\ufb00ectually executed\ntherein conformably to that provision of the Constitution\nwhich requires duties to be uniform throughout the United\nStates:\nAnd Whereas a combination of persons engaged in such\ninsurrection have threatened to grant pretended letters of\nmarque to authorize the bearers thereof to commit assaults\non the lives, vessels, and property of good citizens of the\ncountry lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas,\nand in waters of the United States:\nAnd Whereas an executive proclamation has been\nalready issued requiring the persons engaged in these\ndisorderly proceedings to desist therefrom, calling out a\nmilitia force for the purpose of repressing the same, and\nconvening Congress in extraordinary session to deliberate\nand determine thereon:\n Now, therefore, I, Abraham LINCOLN, President of the\nUnited States, with a view to the same purposes before\nmentioned, and to the protection of the public peace, and\nthe lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens\npursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have\nassembled \nand \ndeliberated \non \nthe \nsaid \nunlawful\nproceedings, or until the same shall have ceased, have\nfurther deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the\nports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws\nof the United States, and of the law of nations in such case\nprovided. For this purpose a competent force will be posted\nso as to prevent entrance and exit of vessels from the ports\naforesaid. If, therefore, with a view to violate such\nblockade, a vessel shall approach or shall attempt to leave\neither of the said ports, she will be duly warned by the\ncommander of one of the blockading vessels, who will\nindorse on her register the fact and date of such warning,\nand if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave\nthe blockaded port, she will be captured and sent to the\nnearest convenient port, for such proceedings against her\nand her cargo, as prize, as may be deemed advisable.\nAnd I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person,\nunder the pretended authority of the said States, or under\nany other pretense, shall molest a vessel of the United\nStates, or the persons or cargo on board of her, such\nperson will be held amenable to the laws of the United\nStates for the prevention and punishment of piracy.\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\n Done at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of\nApril, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred\nand sixty-one, and of the independence of the United States\nthe eighty-\ufb01fth.\nA.

SEWARD, Secretary of\nState.\n  \n \n   \n  HI    A\n \nA \n    \n.\nWASHINGTON, April , \nGOVERNOR HICKS AND MAYOR BROWN.\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 Your letter by Messrs. Bond, Dobbin,\nand Brune is received. I tender you both my sincere thanks\nfor your e\ufb00orts to keep the peace in the trying situation in\nwhich you are placed.\nFor the future troops must be brought here, but I make\nno point of bringing them through Baltimore. Without any\nmilitary knowledge myself, of course I must leave details to\nGeneral Scott. He hastily said this morning in the presence\nof these gentlemen, \u201cMarch them around Baltimore, and\nnot through it.\u201d I sincerely hope the General, on fuller\nre\ufb02ection, will consider this practical and proper, and that\nyou will not object to it. By this a collision of the people of\nBaltimore with the troops will be avoided, unless they go\nout of their way to seek it. I hope you will exert your\nin\ufb02uence to prevent this.\nNow and ever I shall do all in my power for peace\nconsistently with the maintenance of the Government.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n   \n  HI   .\nWASHINGTON, April , \nGOVERNOR HICKS: I desire to consult with you and the\nMayor of Baltimore relative to preserving the peace of\nMaryland. Please come immediately by special train, which\nyou can take at Baltimore; or, if necessary, one can be sent\nfrom here. Answer forthwith.\nLINCOLN.\n  \n    \n \n   \n   \n A \nA   A\nI\n \n     I\nORDER TO GENERAL SCOTT. WASHINGTON, April ,\n\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL SCOTT.\nMY DEAR SIR \u2014 The Maryland Legislature assembles to-\nmorrow at Annapolis, and not improbably will take action to\narm the people of that State against the United States. The\nquestion has been submitted to and considered by me\nwhether it would not be justi\ufb01able, upon the ground of\nnecessary defense, for you, as General in Chief of the\nUnited States Army, to arrest or disperse the members of\nthat body. I think it would not be justi\ufb01able nor e\ufb00icient for\nthe desired object.\nFirst. They have a clearly legal right to assemble, and we\ncannot know in advance that their action will not be lawful\nand peaceful, and if we wait until they shall have acted\ntheir arrest or dispersion will not lessen the e\ufb00ect of their\naction.\nSecondly. We cannot permanently prevent their action. If\nwe arrest them, we cannot long hold them as prisoners,\nand when liberated they will immediately reassemble and\ntake their action; and precisely the same if we simply\n disperse them \u2014 they will immediately reassemble in some\nother place.\nI therefore conclude that it is only left to the\nCommanding General to watch and await their action,\nwhich, if it shall be to arm their people against the United\nStates, he is to adopt the most prompt and e\ufb00icient means\nto counteract, even, if necessary, to the bombardment of\ntheir cities and, in the extremist necessity, the suspension\nof the writ of habeas corpus.\nYour obedient servant,\nA. LINCOLN.\n   \n  A\nA I\n \n    \n  A\n   A  I         \nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA:\nA PROCLAMATION.\nWhereas, for the reasons assigned in my proclamation of\nthe nineteenth instant, a blockade of the ports of the States\nof South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana,\nMississippi, and Texas was ordered to be established:\nAnd whereas, since that date, public property of the\nUnited States has been seized, the collection of the revenue\nobstructed, and duly commissioned o\ufb00icers of the United\nStates, while engaged in executing the orders of their\nsuperiors, have been arrested and held in custody as\nprisoners, or have been impeded in the discharge of their\no\ufb00icial duties, without due legal process, by persons\nclaiming to act under authorities of the States of Virginia\nand North Carolina:\nAn e\ufb00icient blockade of the ports of those States will also\nbe established.\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\nDone at the city of Washington, this twenty seventh day\nof April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\n hundred and sixty-one, and of the independence of the\nUnited States the eighty-\ufb01fth.\nA. LINCOLN.\n   \nA     \n A \nI I A    \n A\n \nA HI\n \n  A  I         \nI HAVE DESIRED as sincerely as any man, and I sometimes\nthink more than any other man, that our present di\ufb00iculties\nmight be settled without the shedding of blood. I will not\nsay that all hope has yet gone; but if the alternative is\npresented whether the Union is to be broken in fragments\nand the liberties of the people lost, or blood be shed, you\nwill probably make the choice with which I shall not be\ndissatis\ufb01ed.\n  \n A I  \n     A  \n  \n I  \n  HA  A\n \n  \nTO GENERAL SCOTT.\nTO THE COMMANDING GENERAL, ARMY OF THE\nUNITED STATES.\nYou are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against\nthe laws of the United States. If at any point on or in the\nvicinity of any military line which is now or which shall be\nused between the City of Philadelphia and the city of\nWashington you \ufb01nd resistance which renders it necessary\nto suspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety,\nyou personally, or through the o\ufb00icer in command at the\npoint at which resistance occurs, are authorized to suspend\nthat writ.\nA.

NATHANIEL LYON, Commanding Department of\nthe West.\nSIR: \u2014 The President of the United States directs that\nyou enroll in the military service of the United States the\nloyal citizens of Saint Louis and vicinity, not exceeding,\nwith those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand in number, for\nthe purpose of maintaining the authority of the United\nStates; for the protection of the peaceful inhabitants of\nMissouri; and you will, if deemed necessary for that\npurpose by yourself, by Messrs. Oliver F. Ferny, John How,\nJames O. Broadhead, Samuel T. Glover, J. Wilzie, Francis P.\nBlair, Jr., proclaim martial law in the city of Saint Louis.\nThe \nadditional \nforce \nhereby \nauthorized \nshall \nbe\ndischarged in part or in whole, if enlisted. As soon as it\nappears to you and the gentlemen above mentioned that\nthere is no danger of an attempt on the part of the enemies\nof the Government to take military possession of the city of\nSaint Louis, or put the city in control of the combination\nagainst the Government of the United States; and whilst\nsuch additional force remains in the service the same shall\n be governed by the Rules and Articles of War, and such\nspecial regulations as you may prescribe. I shall like the\nforce hereafter directed to be enrolled to be under your\ncommand.\nThe arms and other military stores in the Saint Louis\nArsenal not needed for the forces of the United States in\nMissouri must be removed to Spring\ufb01eld, or some other\nsafe place of deposit in the State of Illinois, as speedily as\npracticable, by the ordnance o\ufb00icers in charge at Saint\nLouis.\n(Indorsement.)\nIt is revolutionary times, and therefore I do not object to\nthe irregularity of this.

By reason of a gale, well known in advance to be\npossible and not improbable, the tugs, an essential part of\nthe plan, never reached the ground; while, by an accident\nfor which you were in no wise responsible, and possibly I to\nsome extent was, you were deprived of a war vessel, with\nher men, which you deemed of great importance to the\nenterprise.\nI most cheerfully and truly declare that the failure of the\nundertaking has not lowered you a particle, while the\nqualities \nyou \ndeveloped \nin \nthe \ne\ufb00ort \nhave \ngreatly\nheightened you in my estimation.\nFor a daring and dangerous enterprise of a similar\ncharacter you would to-day be the man of all my\nacquaintances whom I would select. You and I both\nanticipated that the cause of the country would be\n advanced by making the attempt to provision Fort Sumter,\neven if it should fail; and it is no small consolation now to\nfeel that our anticipation is justi\ufb01ed by the result.\nVery truly your friend, A.

WASHINGTON, May , \nSIR: \u2014 Mr. Dallas, in a brief despatch of May d (No.\n), tells us that Lord John Russell recently requested an\ninterview with him on account of the solicitude which his\nlordship felt concerning the e\ufb00ect of certain measures\nrepresented as likely to be adopted by the President. In\nthat conversation the British secretary told Mr. Dallas that\nthe three representatives of the Southern Confederacy\nwere then in London, that Lord John Russell had not yet\nseen them, but that he was not unwilling to see them\nuno\ufb00icially. He further informed Mr. Dallas that an\nunderstanding exists between the British and French\ngovernments which would lead both to take one and the\nsame course as to recognition. His lordship then referred to\nthe rumor of a meditated blockade by us of Southern ports,\nand a discontinuance of them as ports of entry. Mr. Dallas\nanswered that he knew nothing on those topics, and\ntherefore\n (The President\u2019s corrections, both in notes and text, are\nin\ncaps. All matter between brackets was to be marked\nout.)\ncould say nothing. He added that you were expected to\narrive in two weeks. Upon this statement Lord John Russell\nacquiesced in the expediency of waiting for the full\nknowledge you were expected to bring.\nMr. Dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of\nministerial explanations made in Parliament.\nYou will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates\nfurther than to seek explanations when necessary and\ncommunicate them to this department. [We intend to have\na clear and simple record of whatever issue may arise\nbetween us and Great Britain.]\nThe President [is surprised and grieved] regrets that Mr.\nDallas did not protest against the proposed uno\ufb00icial\nintercourse between the British Government and the\nmissionaries of the insurgents [as well as against the\ndemand for explanations made by the British Government].\nIt is due, however, to Mr. Dallas to say that our instructions\nhad been given only to you and not to him, and that his\nloyalty and \ufb01delity, too rare in these times [among our late\nrepresentatives \nabroad, \nare \nconfessed \nand] \nare\nappreciated.\nIntercourse of any kind with the so-called commissioners\nis liable to be construed as a recognition of the authority\nwhich appointed them. Such intercourse would be none the\nless [wrongful] hurtful to us for being called uno\ufb00icial, and\n it might be even more injurious, because we should have no\nmeans of knowing what points might be resolved by it.\nMoreover, uno\ufb00icial intercourse is useless and meaningless\nif it is not expected to ripen into o\ufb00icial intercourse and\ndirect recognition. It is left doubtful here whether the\nproposed uno\ufb00icial intercourse has yet actually begun.\nYour own [present] antecedent instructions are deemed\nexplicit enough, and it is hoped that you have not\nmisunderstood them. You will in any event desist from all\nintercourse whatever, uno\ufb00icial as well as o\ufb00icial, with the\nBritish Government, so long as it shall continue intercourse\nof either kind with the domestic enemies of this country\n[con\ufb01ning yourself to a delivery of a copy of this paper to\nthe Secretary of State. After doing this.] When intercourse\nshall have been arrested for this cause, you will\ncommunicate with this department and receive further\ndirections.\nLord John Russell has informed us of an understanding\nbetween the British and French governments that they will\nact together in regard to our a\ufb00airs. This communication,\nhowever, \nloses \nsomething \nof \nits \nvalue \nfrom \nthe\ncircumstance that the communication was withheld until\nafter knowledge of the fact had been acquired by us from\nother sources. We know also another fact that has not yet\nbeen o\ufb00icially communicated to us \u2014 namely, that other\nEuropean States are apprised by France and England of\ntheir agreement, and are expected to concur with or follow\nthem in whatever measures they adopt on the subject of\nrecognition. The United States have been impartial and just\n in all their conduct toward the several nations of Europe.\nThey will not complain, however, of the combination now\nannounced by the two leading powers, although they think\nthey had a right to expect a more independent, if not a\nmore friendly, course from each of them. You will take no\nnotice of that or any other alliance. Whenever the\nEuropean governments shall see \ufb01t to communicate\ndirectly with us, we shall be, as heretofore, frank and\nexplicit in our reply.\nAs to the blockade, you will say that by [the] our own\nlaws [of nature] and the laws of nature and the laws of\nnations, this Government has a clear right to suppress\ninsurrection. An exclusion of commerce from national ports\nwhich have been seized by the insurgents, in the equitable\nform of blockade, is the proper means to that end. You will\n[admit] not insist that our blockade is [not] to be respected\nif it be not maintained by a competent force; but passing by\nthat question as not now a practical, or at least an urgent,\none, you will add that [it] the blockade is now, and it will\ncontinue to be so maintained, and therefore we expect it to\nbe respected by Great Britain. You will add that we have\nalready revoked the exequatur of a Russian consul who had\nenlisted in the military service of the insurgents, and we\nshall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign agent,\nconsular or diplomatic, who shall either disobey the Federal\nlaws or disown the Federal authority.\nAs \nto \nthe \nrecognition \nof \nthe \nso-called \nSouthern\nConfederacy, it is not to be made a subject of technical\nde\ufb01nition. It is, of course, [quasi] direct recognition to\n publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and\nindependence of a new power. It is [quasi] direct\nrecognition to receive its ambassadors, ministers, agents,\nor commissioners o\ufb00icially. A concession of belligerent\nrights is liable to be construed as a recognition of them. No\none of these proceedings will [be borne] pass [unnoticed]\nunquestioned by the United States in this case.\nHitherto recognition has been moved only on the\nassumption that the so-called Confederate States are de\nfacto a self-sustaining power. Now, after long forbearance,\ndesigned to soothe discontent and avert the need of civil\nwar, the land and naval forces of the United States have\nbeen put in motion to repress the insurrection. The true\ncharacter of the pretended new State is at once revealed. It\nis seen to be a power existing in pronunciamento only, It\nhas never won a \ufb01eld. It has obtained no forts that were not\nvirtually betrayed into its hands or seized in breach of\ntrust. It commands not a single port on the coast nor any\nhighway out from its pretended capital by land. Under\nthese circumstances Great Britain is called upon to\nintervene and give it body and independence by resisting\nour measures of suppression. British recognition would be\nBritish intervention to create within our own territory a\nhostile state by overthrowing this republic itself. [When this\nact of intervention is distinctly performed, we from that\nhour shall cease to be friends, and become once more, as\nwe have twice before been forced to be, enemies of Great\nBritain.]\n As to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service,\nyou will say that this is a question exclusively our own. We\ntreat them as pirates. They are our own citizens, or persons\nemployed by our citizens, preying on the commerce of our\ncountry. If Great Britain shall choose to recognize them as\nlawful belligerents, and give them shelter from our pursuit\nand punishment, the laws of nations a\ufb00ord an adequate and\nproper remedy [and we shall avail ourselves of it. And while\nyou need not say this in advance, be sure that you say\nnothing inconsistent with it.]\nHappily, however, her Britannic Majesty\u2019s government\ncan avoid all these di\ufb00iculties. It invited us in  to\naccede to the declaration of the Congress of Paris, of which\nbody Great Britain was herself a member, abolishing\nprivateering everywhere in all cases and forever. You\nalready have our authority to propose to her our accession\nto that declaration. If she refuse to receive it, it can only be\nbecause she is willing to become the patron of privateering\nwhen aimed at our devastation.\nThese positions are not elaborately defended now,\nbecause to vindicate them would imply a possibility of our\nwaiving them.\n We are not insensible of the grave importance of\n (Drop all from this line to the end, and in lieu of it\nwrite, \u201cThis paper is for your own guidance only, and not\n[sic] to be read or shown to any one.\u201d)\n(Secretary Seward, when the despatch was returned to\nhim, added an introductory paragraph stating that the\n document was strictly con\ufb01dential. For this reason these\nlast two paragraphs remained as they are here printed.)\nthis occasion. We see how, upon the result of the debate\nin which we are engaged, a war may ensue between the\nUnited States and one, two, or even more European\nnations. War in any case is as exceptionable from the habits\nas it is revolting from the sentiments of the American\npeople. But if it come, it will be fully seen that it results\nfrom the action of Great Britain, not our own; that Great\nBritain will have decided to fraternize with our domestic\nenemy, either without waiting to hear from you our\nremonstrances and our warnings, or after having heard\nthem. War in defense of national life is not immoral, and\nwar in defense of independence is an inevitable part of the\ndiscipline of nations.\nThe dispute will be between the European and the\nAmerican branches of the British race. All who belong to\nthat race will especially deprecate it, as they ought. It may\nwell be believed that men of every race and kindred will\ndeplore it. A war not unlike it between the same parties\noccurred at the close of the last century. Europe atoned by\nforty years of su\ufb00ering for the error that Great Britain\ncommitted in provoking that contest. If that nation shall\nnow repeat the same great error, the social convulsions\nwhich will follow may not be so long, but they will be more\ngeneral. When they shall have ceased, it will, we think, be\nseen, whatever may have been the fortunes of other\nnations, that it is not the United States that will have come\nout of them with its precious Constitution altered or its\n honestly obtained dominion in any degree abridged. Great\nBritain has but to wait a few months and all her present\ninconveniences will cease with all our own troubles. If she\ntake a di\ufb00erent course, she will calculate for herself the\nultimate as well as the immediate consequences, and will\nconsider what position she will hold when she shall have\nforever lost the sympathies and the a\ufb00ections of the only\nnation on whose sympathies and a\ufb00ections she has a\nnatural claim. In making that calculation she will do well to\nremember that in the controversy she proposes to open we\nshall be actuated by neither pride, nor passion, nor\ncupidity, nor ambition; but we shall stand simply on the\nprinciple of self-preservation, and that our cause will\ninvolve the independence of nations and the rights of\nhuman nature.\nI am, Sir, respectfully your obedient servant, W.

So much of promised usefulness to one\u2019s country, and\nof bright hopes for one\u2019s self and friends, have never been\nso suddenly dashed as in his fall. In size, in years, and in\nyouthful appearance a boy only, his power to command men\nwas surpassingly great. This power, combined with a \ufb01ne\nintellectual and indomitable energy, and a taste altogether\nmilitary, constituted in him, as seemed to me, the best\nnatural talent in that department I ever knew. And yet he\nwas singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse.\nMy acquaintance with him began less than two years ago;\nyet, through the latter half of the intervening period, it was\nas intense as the disparity of our ages and my engrossing\nengagements would permit. To me he appeared to have no\nindulgences or pastimes, and I never heard him utter a\nprofane or an intemperate word. What was conclusive of\nhis good heart, he never forgot his parents. The honors he\n labored for so laudably, and for which, in the sad end, he so\ngallantly gave his life, he meant for them no less than for\nhimself.\nIn the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the\nsacredness of your sorrow, I have ventured to address you\nthis tribute to the memory of my young friend and your\nbrave and early fallen son.\nMay God give you the consolation which is beyond all\nearly power.\nSincerely your friend in common a\ufb04iction, A.

LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  \n     I\n     IA      I\nJULY , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: \u2014 Having been convened on an\nextraordinary occasion, as authorized by the Constitution,\nyour attention is not called to any ordinary subject of\nlegislation.\nAt the beginning of the present Presidential term, four\nmonths ago, the functions of the Federal Government were\nfound to be generally suspended within the several States\nof \nSouth \nCarolina, \nGeorgia, \nAlabama, \nMississippi,\nLouisiana, and Florida, excepting only those of the Post-\nO\ufb00ice Department.\nWithin these States all the forts, arsenals, dockyards,\ncustom-houses, and the like, including the movable and\nstationary property in and about them, had been seized,\nand were held in open hostility to this government,\nexcepting only Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Je\ufb00erson, on and\nnear the Florida coast, and Fort Sumter, in Charleston\nHarbor, South Carolina. The forts thus seized had been put\nin improved condition, new ones had been built, and armed\nforces had been organized and were organizing, all\navowedly with the same hostile purpose.\n The forts remaining in the possession of the Federal\nGovernment in and near these States were either besieged\nor menaced by warlike preparations, and especially Fort\nSumter was nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile\nbatteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own,\nand outnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one. A\ndisproportionate share of the Federal muskets and ri\ufb02es\nhad somehow found their way into these States, and had\nbeen \nseized \nto \nbe \nused \nagainst \nthe \ngovernment.\nAccumulations of the public revenue lying within them had\nbeen seized for the same object. The navy was scattered in\ndistant seas, leaving but a very small part of it within the\nimmediate reach of the government. O\ufb00icers of the Federal\narmy and navy had resigned in great numbers; and of those\nresigning a large proportion had taken up arms against the\ngovernment. Simultaneously, and in connection with all\nthis, the purpose to sever the Federal Union was openly\navowed. In accordance with this purpose, an ordinance had\nbeen adopted in each of these States, declaring the States\nrespectively to be separated from the national Union. A\nformula for instituting a combined government of these\nStates had been promulgated; and this illegal organization,\nin the character of confederate States, was already\ninvoking recognition, aid, and intervention from foreign\npowers.\nFinding this condition of things, and believing it to be an\nimperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent, if\npossible, the consummation of such attempt to destroy the\nFederal Union, a choice of means to that end became\n indispensable. This choice was made and was declared in\nthe inaugural address. The policy chosen looked to the\nexhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any\nstronger ones. It sought only to hold the public places and\nproperty not already wrested from the government, and to\ncollect the revenue, relying for the rest on time, discussion,\nand the ballot-box. It promised a continuance of the mails,\nat government expense, to the very people who were\nresisting the government; and it gave repeated pledges\nagainst any disturbance to any of the people, or any of their\nrights. Of all that which a President might constitutionally\nand justi\ufb01ably do in such a case, everything was forborne\nwithout which it was believed possible to keep the\ngovernment on foot.\nOn the th of March (the present incumbent\u2019s \ufb01rst full\nday in o\ufb00ice), a letter of Major Anderson, commanding at\nFort Sumter, written on the th of February and received\nat the War Department on the th of March, was by that\ndepartment placed in his hands. This letter expressed the\nprofessional opinion of the writer that reinforcements could\nnot be thrown into that fort within the time for his relief,\nrendered necessary by the limited supply of provisions, and\nwith a view of holding possession of the same, with a force\nof less than twenty thousand good and well-disciplined\nmen. This opinion was concurred in by all the o\ufb00icers of his\ncommand, and their memoranda on the subject were made\ninclosures of Major Anderson\u2019s letter. The whole was\nimmediately laid before Lieutenant-General Scott, who at\nonce concurred with Major Anderson in opinion. On\n re\ufb02ection, however, he took full time, consulting with other\no\ufb00icers, both of the army and the navy, and at the end of\nfour days came reluctantly but decidedly to the same\nconclusion as before. He also stated at the same time that\nno such su\ufb00icient force was then at the control of the\ngovernment, or could be raised and brought to the ground\nwithin the time when the provisions in the fort would be\nexhausted. In a purely military point of view, this reduced\nthe duty of the administration in the case to the mere\nmatter of getting the garrison safely out of the fort.\nIt was believed, however, that to so abandon that\nposition, under the circumstances, would be utterly\nruinous; that the necessity under which it was to be done\nwould not be fully understood; that by many it would be\nconstrued as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it\nwould discourage the friends of the Union, embolden its\nadversaries, and go far to insure to the latter a recognition\nabroad; that in fact, it would be our national destruction\nconsummated. This could not be allowed. Starvation was\nnot yet upon the garrison, and ere it would be reached Fort\nPickens might be reinforced. This last would be a clear\nindication of policy, and would better enable the country to\naccept the evacuation of Fort Sumter as a military\nnecessity. An order was at once directed to be sent for the\nlanding of the troops from the steamship Brooklyn into Fort\nPickens. This order could not go by land, but must take the\nlonger and slower route by sea. The \ufb01rst return news from\nthe order was received just one week before the fall of Fort\nSumter. The news itself was that the o\ufb00icer commanding\n the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been transferred\nfrom the Brooklyn, acting upon some quasi armistice of the\nlate administration (and of the existence of which the\npresent administration, up to the time the order was\ndespatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors to \ufb01x\nattention), had refused to land the troops. To now reinforce\nFort Pickens before a crisis would be reached at Fort\nSumter was impossible \u2014 rendered so by the near\nexhaustion of provisions in the latter-named fort. In\nprecaution against such a conjuncture, the government\nhad, a few days before, commenced preparing an\nexpedition as well adapted as might be to relieve Fort\nSumter, which expedition was intended to be ultimately\nused, or not, according to circumstances. The strongest\nanticipated case for using it was now presented, and it was\nresolved to send it forward. As had been intended in this\ncontingency, it was also resolved to notify the governor of\nSouth Carolina that he might expect an attempt would be\nmade to provision the fort; and that, if the attempt should\nnot be resisted, there would be no e\ufb00ort to throw in men,\narms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of\nan attack upon the fort. This notice was accordingly given;\nwhereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall,\nwithout even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning\nexpedition.\nIt is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort\nSumter was in no sense a matter of self-defense on the part\nof the assailants. They well knew that the garrison in the\nfort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them.\n They knew \u2014 they were expressly noti\ufb01ed \u2014 that the giving\nof bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison\nwas all which would on that occasion be attempted, unless\nthemselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more.\nThey knew that this government desired to keep the\ngarrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to\nmaintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union\nfrom actual and immediate dissolution \u2014 trusting, as\nhereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box\nfor \ufb01nal adjustment; and they assailed and reduced the fort\nfor precisely the reverse object \u2014 to drive out the visible\nauthority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to\nimmediate dissolution. That this was their object the\nexecutive well understood; and having said to them in the\ninaugural address, \u201cYou can have no con\ufb02ict without being\nyourselves the aggressors,\u201d he took pains not only to keep\nthis declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from\nthe power of ingenious sophistry that the world should not\nbe able to misunderstand it. By the a\ufb00air at Fort Sumter,\nwith its surrounding circumstances, that point was\nreached. \nThen \nand \nthereby \nthe \nassailants \nof \nthe\ngovernment began the con\ufb02ict of arms, without a gun in\nsight or in expectancy to return their \ufb01re, save only the few\nin the fort sent to that harbor years before for their own\nprotection, and still ready to give that protection in\nwhatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else, they\nhave forced upon the country the distinct issue, \u201cimmediate\ndissolution or blood.\u201d\n And this issue embraces more than the fate of these\nUnited States. It presents to the whole family of man the\nquestion whether a constitutional republic or democracy \u2014\na government of the people by the same people \u2014 can or\ncannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own\ndomestic \nfoes. \nIt \npresents \nthe \nquestion \nwhether\ndiscontented individuals, too few in numbers to control\nadministration according to organic law in any case, can\nalways, upon the pretenses made in this case, or on any\nother pretenses, or arbitrarily without any pretense, break\nup their government, and thus practically put an end to\nfree government upon the earth. It forces us to ask: Is\nthere in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness?\nMust a government, of necessity, be too strong for the\nliberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own\nexistence?\nSo viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out\nthe war power of the government, and so to resist force\nemployed for its destruction by force for its preservation.\nThe call was made, and the response of the country was\nmost gratifying, surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most\nsanguine expectation. Yet none of the States commonly\ncalled slave States, except Delaware, gave a regiment\nthrough regular State organization. A few regiments have\nbeen organized within some others of those States by\nindividual enterprise, and received into the government\nservice. Of course the seceded States, so called (and to\nwhich Texas had been joined about the time of the\ninauguration), gave no troops to the cause of the Union.\n The border States, so called, were not uniform in their\naction, some of them being almost for the Union, while in\nothers \u2014 as Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\nArkansas \u2014 the Union sentiment was nearly repressed and\nsilenced. The course taken in Virginia was the most\nremarkable \u2014 perhaps the most important. A convention\nelected by the people of that State to consider this very\nquestion of disrupting the Federal Union was in session at\nthe capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell. To this body\nthe people had chosen a large majority of professed Union\nmen. Almost immediately after the fall of Sumter, many\nmembers of that majority went over to the original disunion\nminority, and with them adopted an ordinance for\nwithdrawing the State from the Union. Whether this\nchange was wrought by their great approval of the assault\nupon \nSumter, \nor \ntheir \ngreat \nresentment \nat \nthe\ngovernment\u2019s resistance to that assault, is not de\ufb01nitely\nknown. \nAlthough \nthey \nsubmitted \nthe \nordinance \nfor\nrati\ufb01cation to a vote of the people, to be taken on a day\nthen somewhat more than a month distant, the convention\nand the Legislature (which was also in session at the same\ntime and place), with leading men of the State not members\nof either, immediately commenced acting as if the State\nwere already out of the Union. They pushed military\npreparations vigorously forward all over the State. They\nseized the United States armory at Harper\u2019s Ferry, and the\nnavy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk. They received perhaps\ninvited \u2014 into their State large bodies of troops, with their\nwarlike appointments, from the so-called seceded States.\n They formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance\nand co-operation with the so-called \u201cConfederate States,\u201d\nand sent members to their congress at Montgomery. And\n\ufb01nally, they permitted the insurrectionary government to be\ntransferred to their capital at Richmond.\nThe people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant\ninsurrection to make its nest within her borders; and this\ngovernment has no choice left but to deal with it where it\n\ufb01nds it. And it has the less regret as the loyal citizens have,\nin due form, claimed its protection. Those loyal citizens this\ngovernment is bound to recognize and protect, as being\nVirginia.\nIn the border States, so called, \u2014 in fact, the middle\nStates, \u2014 there are those who favor a policy which they call\n\u201carmed neutrality\u201d; that is, an arming of those States to\nprevent the Union forces passing one way, or the disunion\nthe other, over their soil. This would be disunion completed.\nFiguratively speaking, it would be the building of an\nimpassable wall along the line of separation \u2014 and yet not\nquite an impassable one, for under the guise of neutrality it\nwould tie the hands of Union men and freely pass supplies\nfrom among them to the insurrectionists, which it could not\ndo as an open enemy. At a stroke it would take all the\ntrouble o\ufb00 the hands of secession, except only what\nproceeds from the external blockade. It would do for the\ndisunionists that which, of all things, they most desire \u2014\nfeed them well and give them disunion without a struggle\nof their own. It recognizes no \ufb01delity to the Constitution, no\nobligation to maintain the Union; and while very many who\n have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens, it is,\nnevertheless, very injurious in e\ufb00ect.\nRecurring to the action of the government, it may be\nstated that at \ufb01rst a call was made for , militia; and,\nrapidly following this, a proclamation was issued for closing\nthe ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings in\nthe nature of blockade. So far all was believed to be strictly\nlegal. At this point the insurrectionists announced their\npurpose to enter upon the practice of privateering.\nOther calls were made for volunteers to serve for three\nyears, unless sooner discharged, and also for large\nadditions to the regular army and navy. These measures,\nwhether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon, under\nwhat appeared to be a popular demand and a public\nnecessity; trusting then, as now, that Congress would\nreadily ratify them. It is believed that nothing has been\ndone beyond the constitutional competency of Congress.\nSoon after the \ufb01rst call for militia, it was considered a\nduty to authorize the commanding general in proper cases,\naccording to his discretion, to suspend the privilege of the\nwrit of habeas corpus, or, in other words, to arrest and\ndetain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms\nof law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the\npublic safety. This authority has purposely been exercised\nbut very sparingly. Nevertheless, the legality and propriety\nof what has been done under it are questioned, and the\nattention of the country has been called to the proposition\nthat one who has sworn to \u201ctake care that the laws be\nfaithfully executed\u201d should not himself violate them. Of\n course some consideration was given to the questions of\npower and propriety before this matter was acted upon.\nThe whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully\nexecuted were being resisted and failing of execution in\nnearly one third of the States. Must they be allowed to\n\ufb01nally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear\nthat by the use of the means necessary to their execution\nsome single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the\ncitizen\u2019s liberty that, practically, it relieves more of the\nguilty than of the innocent, should to a very limited extent\nbe violated? To state the question more directly, are all the\nlaws but one to go unexecuted, and the government itself\ngo to pieces lest that one be violated? Even in such a case,\nwould not the o\ufb00icial oath be broken if the government\nshould \nbe \noverthrown \nwhen \nit \nwas \nbelieved \nthat\ndisregarding the single law would tend to preserve it? But\nit was not believed that this question was presented. It was\nnot believed that any law was violated. The provision of the\nConstitution that \u201cthe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\nshall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion\nor invasion, the public safety may require it,\u201d is equivalent\nto a provision \u2014 is a provision \u2014 that such privilege may be\nsuspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public\nsafety does require it. It was decided that we have a case of\nrebellion, and that the public safety does require the\nquali\ufb01ed suspension of the privilege of the writ which was\nauthorized to be made. Now it is insisted that Congress,\nand not the executive, is vested with this power. But the\nConstitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise\n the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a\ndangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the framers of\nthe instrument intended that in every case the danger\nshould run its course until Congress could be called\ntogether, the very assembling of which might be prevented,\nas was intended in this case, by the rebellion.\nNo more extended argument is now o\ufb00ered, as an\nopinion at some length will probably be presented by the\nattorney-general. Whether there shall be any legislation\nupon the subject, and if any, what, is submitted entirely to\nthe better judgment of Congress.\nThe forbearance of this government had been so\nextraordinary and so long continued as to lead some\nforeign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the\nearly destruction of our national Union was probable. While\nthis, on discovery, gave the executive some concern, he is\nnow happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the\nUnited States are now everywhere practically respected by\nforeign powers; and a general sympathy with the country is\nmanifested throughout the world.\nThe reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and\nthe Navy will give the information in detail deemed\nnecessary and convenient for your deliberation and action;\nwhile the executive and all the departments will stand\nready to supply omissions, or to communicate new facts\nconsidered important for you to know.\nIt is now recommended that you give the legal means for\nmaking this contest a short and decisive one: that you place\nat the control of the government for the work at least four\n hundred thousand men and  ,,. That number of\nmen is about one-tenth of those of proper ages within the\nregions where, apparently, all are willing to engage; and\nthe sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value\nowned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole. A\ndebt of  ,, now is a less sum per head than was\nthe debt of our Revolution when we came out of that\nstruggle; and the money value in the country now bears\neven a greater proportion to what it was then than does the\npopulation. Surely each man has as strong a motive now to\npreserve our liberties as each had then to establish them.\nA right result at this time will be worth more to the world\nthan ten times the men and ten times the money. The\nevidence reaching us from the country leaves no doubt that\nthe material for the work is abundant, and that it needs\nonly the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction, and the\nhand of the executive to give it practical shape and\ne\ufb00iciency. \nOne \nof \nthe \ngreatest \nperplexities \nof \nthe\ngovernment is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can\nprovide for them. In a word, the people will save their\ngovernment if the government itself will do its part only\nindi\ufb00erently well.\nIt might seem, at \ufb01rst thought, to be of little di\ufb00erence\nwhether the present movement at the South be called\n\u201csecession\u201d or \u201crebellion.\u201d The movers, however, well\nunderstand the di\ufb00erence. At the beginning they knew they\ncould never raise their treason to any respectable\nmagnitude by any name which implies violation of law. They\nknew their people possessed as much of moral sense, as\n much of devotion to law and order, and as much pride in\nand reverence for the history and government of their\ncommon country as any other civilized and patriotic people.\nThey knew they could make no advancement directly in the\nteeth of these strong and noble sentiments. Accordingly,\nthey commenced by an insidious debauching of the public\nmind. They invented an ingenious sophism which, if\nconceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps, through\nall the incidents, to the complete destruction of the Union.\nThe sophism itself is that any State of the Union may\nconsistently with the national Constitution, and therefore\nlawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without\nthe consent of the Union or of any other State. The little\ndisguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only for\njust cause, themselves to be the sole judges of its justice, is\ntoo thin to merit any notice.\nWith rebellion thus sugar-coated they have been\ndrugging the public mind of their section for more than\nthirty years, and until at length they have brought many\ngood men to a willingness to take up arms against the\ngovernment the day after some assemblage of men have\nenacted the farcical pretense of taking their State out of\nthe Union, who could have been brought to no such thing\nthe day before.\nThis sophism derives much, perhaps the whole, of its\ncurrency \nfrom \nthe \nassumption \nthat \nthere \nis \nsome\nomnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining to a State \u2014\nto each State of our Federal Union. Our States have neither\nmore nor less power than that reserved to them in the\n Union by the Constitution \u2014 no one of them ever having\nbeen a State out of the Union. The original ones passed into\nthe Union even before they cast o\ufb00 their British colonial\ndependence; and the new ones each came into the Union\ndirectly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas.\nAnd even Texas in its temporary independence was never\ndesignated a State. The new ones only took the designation\nof States on coming into the Union, while that name was\n\ufb01rst adopted for the old ones in and by the Declaration of\nIndependence. \nTherein \nthe \n\u201cUnited \nColonies\u201d \nwere\ndeclared to be \u201cfree and independent States\u201d; but even\nthen \nthe \nobject \nplainly \nwas \nnot \nto \ndeclare \ntheir\nindependence of one another or of the Union, but directly\nthe contrary, as their mutual pledge and their mutual action\nbefore, at the time, and afterward, abundantly show. The\nexpress plighting of faith by each and all of the original\nthirteen in the Articles of Confederation, two years later,\nthat the Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive.\nHaving never been States either in substance or in name\noutside of the Union, whence this magical omnipotence of\n\u201cState rights,\u201d asserting a claim of power to lawfully\ndestroy the Union itself? Much is said about the\n\u201csovereignty\u201d of the States; but the word even is not in the\nnational Constitution, nor, as is believed, in any of the State\nconstitutions. What is \u201csovereignty\u201d in the political sense of\nthe term? Would it be far wrong to de\ufb01ne it as \u201ca political\ncommunity without a political superior\u201d? Tested by this, no\none of our States except Texas ever was a sovereignty. And\neven Texas gave up the character on coming into the\n Union; by which act she acknowledged the Constitution of\nthe United States, and the laws and treaties of the United\nStates made in pursuance of the Constitution, to be for her\nthe supreme law of the land. The States have their status in\nthe Union, and they have no other legal status. If they\nbreak from this, they can only do so against law and by\nrevolution. The Union, and not themselves separately,\nprocured their independence and their liberty. By conquest\nor purchase the Union gave each of them whatever of\nindependence or liberty it has. The Union is older than any\nof the States, and, in fact, it created them as States.\nOriginally some dependent colonies made the Union, and,\nin turn, the Union threw o\ufb00 their old dependence for them,\nand made them States, such as they are. Not one of them\never had a State constitution independent of the Union. Of\ncourse, it is not forgotten that all the new States framed\ntheir \nconstitutions \nbefore \nthey \nentered \nthe \nUnion\nnevertheless, dependent upon and preparatory to coming\ninto the Union.\nUnquestionably the States have the powers and rights\nreserved to them in and by the national Constitution; but\namong these surely are not included all conceivable\npowers, however mischievous or destructive, but, at most,\nsuch only as were known in the world at the time as\ngovernmental powers; and certainly a power to destroy the\ngovernment \nitself \nhad \nnever \nbeen \nknown \nas \na\ngovernmental, as a merely administrative power. This\nrelative matter of national power and State rights, as a\nprinciple, is no other than the principle of generality and\n locality. Whatever concerns the whole should be con\ufb01ded to\nthe whole \u2014 to the General Government; while whatever\nconcerns only the State should be left exclusively to the\nState. This is all there is of original principle about it.\nWhether the national Constitution in de\ufb01ning boundaries\nbetween the two has applied the principle with exact\naccuracy, is not to be questioned. We are all bound by that\nde\ufb01ning, without question.\nWhat is now combated is the position that secession is\nconsistent with the Constitution \u2014 is lawful and peaceful. It\nis not contended that there is any express law for it; and\nnothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust\nor absurd consequences. The nation purchased with money\nthe countries out of which several of these States were\nformed. Is it just that they shall go o\ufb00 without leave and\nwithout refunding? The nation paid very large sums (in the\naggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions) to relieve\nFlorida of the aboriginal tribes. Is it just that she shall now\nbe o\ufb00 without consent or without making any return? The\nnation is now in debt for money applied to the bene\ufb01t of\nthese so-called seceding States in common with the rest. Is\nit just either that creditors shall go unpaid or the remaining\nStates pay the whole? A part of the present national debt\nwas contracted to pay the old debts of Texas. Is it just that\nshe shall leave and pay no part of this herself?\nAgain, if one State may secede, so may another; and\nwhen all shall have seceded, none is left to pay the debts. Is\nthis quite just for creditors? Did we notify them of this sage\nview of ours when we borrowed their money? If we now\n recognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go in\npeace, it is di\ufb00icult to see what we can do if others choose\nto go or to extort terms upon which they will promise to\nremain.\nThe seceders insist that our Constitution admits of\nsecession. They have assumed to make a national\nconstitution of their own, in which of necessity they have\neither discarded or retained the right of secession as they\ninsist it exists in ours. If they have discarded it, they\nthereby admit that on principle it ought not to be in ours. If\nthey have retained it, by their own construction of ours,\nthey show that to be consistent they must secede from one\nanother whenever they shall \ufb01nd it the easiest way of\nsettling their debts, or e\ufb00ecting any other sel\ufb01sh or unjust\nobject. The principle itself is one of disintegration and upon\nwhich no government can possibly endure.\nIf all the States save one should assert the power to drive\nthat one out of the Union, it is presumed the whole class of\nseceder politicians would at once deny the power and\ndenounce the act as the greatest outrage upon State rights.\nBut suppose that precisely the same act, instead of being\ncalled \u201cdriving the one out,\u201d should be called \u201cthe seceding\nof the others from that one,\u201d it would be exactly what the\nseceders claim to do, unless, indeed, they make the point\nthat the one, because it is a minority, may rightfully do\nwhat the others, because they are a majority, may not\nrightfully do. These politicians are subtle and profound on\nthe rights of minorities. They are not partial to that power\n which made the Constitution and speaks from the preamble\ncalling itself \u201cWe, the People.\u201d\nIt may well be questioned whether there is to-day a\nmajority of the legally quali\ufb01ed voters of any State except\nperhaps South Carolina in favor of disunion. There is much\nreason to believe that the Union men are the majority in\nmany, if not in every other one, of the so-called seceded\nStates. The contrary has not been demonstrated in any one\nof them. It is ventured to a\ufb00irm this even of Virginia and\nTennessee; for the result of an election held in military\ncamps, where the bayonets are all on one side of the\nquestion voted upon, can scarcely be considered as\ndemonstrating popular sentiment. At such an election, all\nthat large class who are at once for the Union and against\ncoercion would be coerced to vote against the Union.\nIt may be a\ufb00irmed without extravagance that the free\ninstitutions we enjoy have developed the powers and\nimproved the condition of our whole people beyond any\nexample in the world. Of this we now have a striking and an\nimpressive illustration. So large an army as the government\nhas now on foot was never before known without a soldier\nin it but who has taken his place there of his own free\nchoice. But more than this, there are many single\nregiments whose members, one and another, possess full\npractical knowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions,\nand whatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in\nthe world; and there is scarcely one from which there could\nnot be selected a President, a Cabinet, a Congress, and\nperhaps a court, abundantly competent to administer the\n government itself. Nor do I say this is not true also in the\narmy of our late friends, now adversaries in this contest;\nbut if it is, so much better the reason why the government\nwhich has conferred such bene\ufb01ts on both them and us\nshould not be broken up. Whoever in any section proposes\nto abandon such a government would do well to consider in\ndeference to what principle it is that he does it; what better\nhe is likely to get in its stead; whether the substitute will\ngive, or be intended to give, so much of good to the people.\nThere are some foreshadowings on this subject. Our\nadversaries \nhave \nadopted \nsome \ndeclarations \nof\nindependence in which, unlike the good old one, penned by\nJe\ufb00erson, they omit the words \u201call men are created equal.\u201d\nWhy? They have adopted a temporary national constitution,\nin the preamble of which, unlike our good old one, signed\nby Washington, they omit \u201cWe, the People,\u201d and substitute,\n\u201cWe, the deputies of the sovereign and independent\nStates.\u201d Why? Why this deliberate pressing out of view the\nrights of men and the authority of the people?\nThis is essentially a people\u2019s contest. On the side of the\nUnion it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form\nand substance of government whose leading object is to\nelevate the condition of men to lift arti\ufb01cial weights from\nall shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all;\nto a\ufb00ord all an unfettered start, and a fair chance in the\nrace of life. Yielding to partial and temporary departures,\nfrom necessity; this is the leading object of the government\nfor whose existence we contend.\n I am most happy to believe that the plain people\nunderstand and appreciate this. It is worthy of note that,\nwhile in this the government\u2019s hour of trial large numbers\nof those in the army and navy who have been favored with\nthe o\ufb00ices have resigned and proved false to the hand\nwhich had pampered them, not one common soldier or\ncommon sailor is known to have deserted his \ufb02ag.\nGreat honor is due to those o\ufb00icers who remained true,\ndespite the example of their treacherous associates; but the\ngreatest honor, and most important fact of all, is the\nunanimous \ufb01rmness of the common soldiers and common\nsailors. To the last man, so far as known, they have\nsuccessfully resisted the traitorous e\ufb00orts of those whose\ncommands, but an hour before, they obeyed as absolute\nlaw. This is the patriotic instinct of the plain people. They\nunderstand, without an argument, that the destroying of\nthe government which was made by Washington means no\ngood to them.\nOur popular government has often been called an\nexperiment. Two points in it our people have already\nsettled \u2014 the successful establishing and the successful\nadministering of it. One still remains \u2014 its successful\nmaintenance against a formidable internal attempt to\noverthrow it. It is now for them to demonstrate to the world\nthat those who can fairly carry an election can also\nsuppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful and\npeaceful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have\nfairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no\nsuccessful appeal back to bullets; that there can be no\n successful \nappeal, \nexcept \nto \nballots \nthemselves, \nat\nsucceeding elections. Such will be a great lesson of peace:\nteaching men that what they cannot take by an election,\nneither can they take it by a war; teaching all the folly of\nbeing the beginners of a war.\nLest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid\nmen as to what is to be the course of the government\ntoward the Southern States after the rebellion shall have\nbeen suppressed, the executive deems it proper to say it\nwill be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the\nConstitution and the laws; and that he probably will have\nno di\ufb00erent understanding of the powers and duties of the\nFederal Government relatively to the rights of the States\nand the people, under the Constitution, than that expressed\nin the inaugural address.\nHe desires to preserve the government, that it may be\nadministered for all as it was administered by the men who\nmade it. Loyal citizens everywhere have the right to claim\nthis of their government, and the government has no right\nto withhold or neglect it. It is not perceived that in giving it\nthere is any coercion, any conquest, or any subjugation, in\nany just sense of those terms.\nThe Constitution provides, and all the States have\naccepted the provision, that \u201cthe United States shall\nguarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of\ngovernment.\u201d But if a State may lawfully go out of the\nUnion, having done so it may also discard the republican\nform of government, so that to prevent its going out is an\nindispensable means to the end of maintaining the\n guarantee mentioned; and when an end is lawful and\nobligatory, the indispensable means to it are also lawful and\nobligatory.\nIt was with the deepest regret that the executive found\nthe duty of employing the war power in defense of the\ngovernment forced upon him. He could but perform this\nduty or surrender the existence of the government. No\ncompromise by public servants could, in this case, be a\ncure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that\nno popular government can long survive a marked\nprecedent that those who carry an election can only save\nthe government from immediate destruction by giving up\nthe main point upon which the people gave the election.\nThe people themselves, and not their servants, can safely\nreverse their own deliberate decisions.\nAs a private citizen the executive could not have\nconsented that these institutions shall perish; much less\ncould he in betrayal of so vast and so sacred a trust as\nthese free people had con\ufb01ded to him. He felt that he had\nno moral right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of\nhis own life, in what might follow. In full view of his great\nresponsibility he has, so far, done what he has deemed his\nduty. You will now, according to your own judgment,\nperform yours. He sincerely hopes that your views and your\naction may so accord with his as to assure all faithful\ncitizens who have been disturbed in their rights of a certain\nand speedy restoration to them, under the Constitution and\nthe laws.\n And having thus chosen our course, without guile and\nwith pure purpose, let us renew our trust in God, and go\nforward without fear and with manly hearts.\nA.

As citizens of the United States\nmay justly pride themselves upon their pro\ufb01ciency in\nindustrial arts, it is desirable that they should have proper\nfacilities toward taking part in the exhibition.

With this view I transmit to Congress a copy of a\ncorrespondence between the Secretary of State and the\nBritish minister here, in which the latter proposes, on\nbehalf of his government, the appointment of a joint\ncommission to inquire into the matter, in order that such\nulterior measures may be adopted as may be advisable for\nthe objects proposed.

The\nobject is to get up an e\ufb00icient force of Missourians in the\nsouthwestern part of the State. It ought to be done, and Mr.\nPhelps ought to have general superintendence of it. I see\nby a private report to me from the department that\neighteen regiments are already accepted from Missouri.\nCan it not be arranged that part of them (not yet organized,\nas I understand) may be taken from the locality mentioned\nand put under the control of Mr. Phelps, and let him have\ndiscretion to accept them for a shorter term than three\nyears \u2014 or the war \u2014 understanding, however, that he will\nget them for the full term if he can? I hope this can be\ndone, because Mr. Phelps is too zealous and e\ufb00icient and\nunderstands his ground too well for us to lose his service.\nOf course provision for arming, equipping, etc., must be\nmade.

One other\nvery worthy citizen of Kentucky did solicit me to have the\naugmenting of the force suspended for a time.\nTaking all the means within my reach to form a\njudgment, I do not believe it is the popular wish of\nKentucky that this force shall be removed beyond her\nlimits; and, with this impression, I must respectfully decline\nto so remove it.\nI most cordially sympathize with your Excellency in the\nwish to preserve the peace of my own native State,\nKentucky. It is with regret I search, and cannot \ufb01nd, in your\nnot very short letter, any declaration or intimation that you\nentertain any desire for the preservation of the Federal\nUnion.\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

Should you shoot a man, according to the\nproclamation, the Confederates would very certainly shoot\nour best men in their hands in retaliation; and so, man for\nman, inde\ufb01nitely. It is, therefore, my order that you allow\nno man to be shot under the proclamation without \ufb01rst\nhaving my approbation or consent.\nSecond. I think there is great danger that the closing\nparagraph, in relation to the con\ufb01scation of property and\nthe liberating slaves of traitorous owners, will alarm our\nSouthern Union friends and turn them against us; perhaps\nruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky. Allow me,\ntherefore, to ask that you will, as of your own motion,\nmodify that paragraph so as to conform to the \ufb01rst and\nfourth sections of the act of Congress entitled \u201cAn act to\ncon\ufb01scate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\u201d\napproved August , , and a copy of which act I\nherewith send you.\nThis letter is written in a spirit of caution, and not of\ncensure.

Assuming that you, upon the ground, could\nbetter judge of the necessities of your position than I could\nat this distance, on seeing your proclamation of August  I\nperceived no general objection to it. The particular clause,\nhowever, in relation to the con\ufb01scation of property and the\nliberation of slaves appeared to me to be objectionable in\nits nonconformity to the act of Congress passed the th of\nlast August upon the same subjects; and hence I wrote you,\nexpressing my wish that that clause should be modi\ufb01ed\naccordingly. Your answer, just received, expresses the\npreference on your part that I should make an open order\nfor the modi\ufb01cation, which I very cheerfully do. It is\ntherefore ordered that the said clause of said proclamation\nbe so modi\ufb01ed, held, and construed as to conform to, and\nnot to transcend, the provisions on the same subject\ncontained in the act of Congress entitled \u201cAn act to\ncon\ufb01scate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\u201d\napproved August , , and that said act be published at\nlength with this order.\nYour obedient servant, A.

I answered the letter you bore me from General\nFremont on yesterday, and not hearing from you during the\nday, I sent the answer to him by mail. It is not exactly\ncorrect, as you say you were told by the elder Mr. Blair, to\nsay that I sent Postmaster-General Blair to St. Louis to\nexamine into that department and report. Postmaster-\nGeneral Blair did go, with my approbation, to see and\nconverse with General Fremont as a friend. I do not feel\nauthorized to furnish you with copies of letters in my\npossession without the consent of the writers. No\nimpression has been made on my mind against the honor or\nintegrity of General Fremont, and I now enter my protest\nagainst being understood as acting in any hostility toward\nhim.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \n   H H\n  \nE ECUTIVE MANSION, SEPTEMBER , \nHON. JOSEPH HOLT.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of this day in relation to the late\nproclamation of General Fremont is received yesterday I\naddressed a letter to him, by mail, on the same subject, and\nwhich is to be made public when he receives it. I herewith\nsend you a copy of that letter, which perhaps shows my\nposition as distinctly as any new one I could write. I will\nthank you not to make it public until General Fremont shall\nhave had time to receive the original.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A    \n \nWASHINGTON, D.C., September , .\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Since conversing with you I have concluded\nto request you to frame an order for recruiting North\nCarolinians at Fort Hatteras. I suggest it to be so framed as\nfor us to accept a smaller force \u2014 even a company \u2014 if we\ncannot get a regiment or more. What is necessary to now\nsay about o\ufb00icers you will judge. Governor Seward says he\nhas a nephew (Clarence A. Seward, I believe) who would be\nwilling to go and play colonel and assist in raising the\nforce. Still it is to be considered whether the North\nCarolinians will not prefer o\ufb00icers of their own. I should\nexpect they would.\nYours very truly, A.

BROWNING.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the th is just received; and\ncoming from you, I confess it astonishes me. That you\nshould object to my adhering to a law which you had\nassisted in making and presenting to me less than a month\nbefore is odd enough. But this is a very small part. General\nFremont\u2019s proclamation as to con\ufb01scation of property and\nthe liberation of slaves is purely political and not within the\nrange of military law or necessity. If a commanding general\n\ufb01nds a necessity to seize the farm of a private owner for a\npasture, an encampment, or a forti\ufb01cation, he has the right\nto do so, and to so hold it as long as the necessity lasts; and\nthis is within military law, because within military necessity.\nBut to say the farm shall no longer belong to the owner, or\nhis heirs forever, and this as well when the farm is not\nneeded for military purposes as when it is, is purely\npolitical, without the savor of military law about it. And the\nsame is true of slaves. If the general needs them, he can\nseize them and use them; but when the need is past, it is\nnot for him to \ufb01x their permanent future condition. That\nmust be settled according to laws made by law-makers, and\n not by military proclamations. The proclamation in the\npoint in question is simply \u201cdictatorship.\u201d It assumes that\nthe general may do anything he pleases con\ufb01scate the\nlands and free the slaves of loyal people, as well as of\ndisloyal ones. And going the whole \ufb01gure, I have no doubt,\nwould be more popular with some thoughtless people than\nthat which has been done, But I cannot assume this\nreckless position, nor allow others to assume it on my\nresponsibility.\nYou speak of it as being the only means of saving the\ngovernment. On the contrary, it is itself the surrender of\nthe government. Can it be pretended that it is any longer\nthe Government of the United States \u2014 any government of\nconstitution and laws wherein a general or a president may\nmake permanent rules of property by proclamation? I do\nnot say Congress might not with propriety pass a law on\nthe point, just such as General Fremont proclaimed.\nI do not say I might not, as a member of Congress, vote\nfor it. What I object to is, that I, as President, shall\nexpressly or impliedly seize and exercise the permanent\nlegislative functions of the government.\nSo much as to principle. Now as to policy. No doubt the\nthing was popular in some quarters, and would have been\nmore so if it had been a general declaration of\nemancipation. The Kentucky Legislature would not budge\ntill that proclamation was modi\ufb01ed; and General Anderson\ntelegraphed me that on the news of General Fremont\nhaving actually issued deeds of manumission, a whole\ncompany of our volunteers threw down their arms and\n disbanded. I was so assured as to think it probable that the\nvery arms we had furnished Kentucky would be turned\nagainst us. I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to\nlose the whole game. Kentucky gone, we cannot hold\nMissouri, nor, as I think, Maryland. These all against us,\nand the job on our hands is too large for us. We would as\nwell consent to separation at once, including the surrender\nof this Capital. On the contrary, if you will give up your\nrestlessness for new positions, and back me manfully on\nthe grounds upon which you and other kind friends gave\nme the election and have approved in my public\ndocuments, we shall go through triumphantly. You must not\nunderstand I took my course on the proclamation because\nof Kentucky. I took the same ground in a private letter to\nGeneral Fremont before I heard from Kentucky.\nYou think I am inconsistent because I did not also forbid\nGeneral Fremont to shoot men under the proclamation. I\nunderstand that part to be within military law, but I also\nthink, and so privately wrote General Fremont, that it is\nimpolitic in this, that our adversaries have the power, and\nwill certainly exercise it, to shoot as many of our men as we\nshoot of theirs. I did not say this in the public letter,\nbecause it is a subject I prefer not to discuss in the hearing\nof our enemies.\nThere has been no thought of removing General Fremont\non any ground connected with his proclamation, and if\nthere has been any wish for his removal on any ground, our\nmutual friend Sam. Glover can probably tell you what it\nwas. I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground.\n Your friend, as ever,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n A\n  \n  A   A\n \n   A\n AI\n[OCTOBER ?] \nON OR ABOUT the th of October (the exact date to be\ndetermined hereafter) I wish a movement made to seize\nand hold a point on the railroad connecting Virginia and\nTennessee near the mountain-pass called Cumberland Gap.\nThat point is now guarded against us by Zollico\ufb00er, with\n or  rebels at Barboursville Ky., \u2014 say twenty-\ufb01ve\nmiles from the Gap, toward Lexington. We have a force of\n or  under General Thomas, at Camp Dick\nRobinson, about twenty-\ufb01ve miles from Lexington and\nseventy-\ufb01ve from Zollico\ufb00er\u2019s camp, On the road between\nthe two. There is not a railroad anywhere between\nLexington and the point to be seized, and along the whole\nlength of which the Union sentiment among the people\nlargely predominates. We have military possession of the\nrailroad from Cincinnati to Lexington, and from Louisville\nto Lexington, and some home guards, under General\nCrittenden, are on the latter line. We have possession of the\nrailroad from Louisville to Nashville, Tenn., so far as\nMuldraugh\u2019s Hill, about forty miles, and the rebels have\npossession of that road all south of there. At the Hill we\nhave a force of , under General Sherman, and about an\n equal force of rebels is a very short distance south, under\nGeneral Buckner.\nWe have a large force at Paducah, and a smaller at Port\nHolt, both on the Kentucky side, with some at Bird\u2019s Point,\nCairo, Mound City, Evansville, and New Albany, all on the\nother side, and all which, with the gunboats on the river,\nare perhaps su\ufb00icient to guard the Ohio from Louisville to\nits mouth.\nAbout supplies of troops, my general idea is that all from\nWisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas,\nnot now elsewhere, be left to Fremont. All from Indiana and\nMichigan, not now elsewhere, be sent to Anderson at\nLouisville. All from Ohio needed in western Virginia be sent\nthere, and any remainder be sent to Mitchell at Cincinnati,\nfor Anderson. All east of the mountains be appropriated to\nMcClellan and to the coast.\nAs to movements, my idea is that the one for the coast\nand that on Cumberland Gap be simultaneous, and that in\nthe meantime preparation, vigilant watching, and the\ndefensive only be acted upon; this, however, not to apply to\nFremont\u2019s operations in northern and middle Missouri.\nThat before these movements Thomas and Sherman shall\nrespectively watch but not attack Zollico\ufb00er and Buckner.\nThat when the coast and Gap movements shall be ready\nSherman is merely to stand fast, while all at Cincinnati and\nall at Louisville, with all on the line, concentrate rapidly at\nLexington, and thence to Thomas\u2019s camp, joining him, and\nthe whole thence upon the Gap. It is for the military men to\ndecide whether they can \ufb01nd a pass through the mountains\n at or near the Gap which cannot be defended by the enemy\nwith a greatly inferior force, and what is to be done in\nregard to this.\nThe coast and Gap movements made, Generals McClellan\nand Fremont, in their respective departments, will avail\nthemselves of any advantages the diversions may present.\n[He was entirely unable to get this started, Sherman\nwould have taken an active part if given him, the others\nwere too busy getting lines of communication guarded \u2014\nand discovering many \u201ccritical\u201d supply items that had not\nbeen sent them.

By command: E. D. TOWNSEND,\nAssistant Adjutant-General.\n A HI\n \n  \ncto er        \nTO THE COMMANDER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE\nWEST.\nSIR: \u2014 THE command of the Department of the West\nhaving devolved upon you, I propose to o\ufb00er you a few\nsuggestions. Knowing how hazardous it is to bind down a\ndistant commander in the \ufb01eld to speci\ufb01c lines and\noperations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of\nlocalities and passing events, it is intended, therefore, to\nleave a considerable margin for the exercise of your\njudgment and discretion.\nThe main rebel army (Price\u2019s) west of the Mississippi is\nbelieved to have passed Dade County in full retreat upon\nnorthwestern Arkansas, leaving Missouri almost freed from\nthe enemy, excepting in the southeast of the State.\nAssuming this basis of fact, it seems desirable, as you are\nnot likely to overtake Price, and are in danger of making\ntoo long a line from your own base of supplies and\nreinforcements, that you should give up the pursuit, halt\nyour main army, divide it into two corps of observation, one\noccupying Sedalia and the other Rolla, the present termini\nof railroads; then recruit the condition of both corps by re-\nestablishing \nand \nimproving \ntheir \ndiscipline \nand\ninstructions, perfecting their clothing and equipments, and\n providing less uncomfortable quarters. Of course, both\nrailroads must be guarded and kept open, judiciously\nemploying just so much force as is necessary for this. From\nthese two points, Sedalia and Rolla, and especially in\njudicious cooperation with Lane on the Kansas border, it\nwould be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the\nenemy returning on Missouri from the southwest, that it is\nnot probable any such attempt will be made before or\nduring the approaching cold weather. Before spring the\npeople of Missouri will probably be in no favorable mood to\nrenew for next year the troubles which have so much\na\ufb04icted and impoverished them during this. If you adopt\nthis line of policy, and if, as I anticipate, you will see no\nenemy in great force approaching, you will have a surplus\nof force which you can withdraw from these points and\ndirect to others as may be needed, the railroads furnishing\nready means of reinforcing these main points if occasion\nrequires. Doubtless local uprisings will for a time continue\nto occur, but these can be met by detachments and local\nforces of our own, and will ere long tire out of themselves.\nWhile, as stated in the beginning of the letter, a large\ndiscretion must be and is left with yourself, I feel sure that\nan inde\ufb01nite pursuit of Price or an attempt by this long and\ncircuitous route to reach Memphis will be exhaustive\nbeyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole\nforce engaged in it.\nYour obedient servant, A.

The governor further proposes that\nwhile he is allowed by the State law to appoint aides-de-\ncamp to the governor at his discretion, with the rank of\ncolonel, three only shall be reported to the United States\nfor payment. He also proposes that the State militia shall\nbe commanded by a single major-general and by such\nnumber of brigadier-generals as shall allow one for a\nbrigade of not less than four regiments, and that no greater\nnumber of sta\ufb00 o\ufb00icers shall be appointed for regimental,\nbrigade, and division duties than as provided for in the act\nof Congress of the d July, ; and that, whatever be\nthe rank of such o\ufb00icers as \ufb01xed by the law of the State,\nthe compensation that they shall receive from the United\nStates shall only be that which belongs to the rank given by\n said act of Congress to o\ufb00icers in the United States service\nperforming the same duties.\nThe \ufb01eld o\ufb00icers of a regiment in the State militia are\none colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, and one major, and the\ncompany o\ufb00icers are a captain, a \ufb01rst lieutenant, and a\nsecond lieutenant. The governor proposes that, as the\nmoney to be disbursed is the money of the United States,\nsuch sta\ufb00 o\ufb00icers in the service of the United States as may\nbe necessary to act as disbursing o\ufb00icers for the State\nmilitia shall be assigned by the War Department for that\nduty; or, if such cannot be spared from their present duty,\nhe will appoint such persons disbursing o\ufb00icers for the\nState militia as the President of the United States may\ndesignate. Such regulations as may be required, in the\njudgment of the President, to insure regularity of returns\nand to protect the United States from any fraudulent\npractices shall be observed and obeyed by all in o\ufb00ice in\nthe State militia.\nThe above propositions are accepted on the part of the\nUnited States, and the Secretary of War is directed to make\nthe necessary orders upon the Ordnance, Quartermaster\u2019s,\nCommissary, Pay, and Medical departments to carry this\nagreement into e\ufb00ect. He will cause the necessary sta\ufb00\no\ufb00icers in the United States service to be detailed for duty\nin connection with the Missouri State militia, and will order\nthem to make the necessary provision in their respective\no\ufb00ices for ful\ufb01lling this agreement. All requisitions upon\nthe di\ufb00erent o\ufb00icers of the United States under this\nagreement to be made in substance in the same mode for\n the Missouri State militia as similar requisitions are made\nfor troops in the service of the United States; and the\nSecretary of War will cause any additional regulations that\nmay be necessary to insure regularity and economy in\ncarrying this agreement into e\ufb00ect to be adopted and\ncommunicated to the Governor of Missouri for the\ngovernment of the Missouri State militia.\n[Indorsement.]\nNovember , .\nThis plan approved, with the modi\ufb01cation that the\ngovernor stipulates that when he commissions a major-\ngeneral of militia it shall be the same person at the time in\ncommand of the United States Department of the West; and\nin case the United States shall change such commander of\nthe department, he (the governor) will revoke the State\ncommission given to the person relieved and give one to\nthe person substituted to the United States command of\nsaid department.\nA.

But all this must be on the express\nand \nexplicit \nunderstanding \nthat \nthe \nfact \nof \nthese\ncommunications coming from me shall be absolutely\ncon\ufb01dential, \u2014 not to be disclosed by Greeley to his nearest\n friend, or any of his subordinates. He will be, in e\ufb00ect, my\nmouthpiece, but I must not be known to be the speaker.\nI need not tell you that I have the highest con\ufb01dence in\nMr. Greeley. He is a great power. Having him \ufb01rmly behind\nme will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred\nthousand men.\nThis was to be most severely regretted, when Greeley\nbecame a traitor to the cause, editorialized for compromise\nand separation \u2014 and promoted McClellan as Democratic\ncandidate for the Presidency.\nThat he has ever kicked the traces has been owing to his\nnot being fully informed. Tell Gilmore to say to him that, if\nhe ever objects to my policy, I shall be glad to have him\nstate to me his views frankly and fully. I shall adopt his if I\ncan. If I cannot, I will at least tell him why. He and I should\nstand together, and let no minor di\ufb00erences come between\nus; for we both seek one end, which is the saving of our\ncountry.

LINCOLN.\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of\nState.\n A\n A  \n   A\n   \n  \n    .\nWASHINGTON, December , \nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: \u2014 In the midst of unprecedented\npolitical troubles we have cause of great gratitude to God\nfor unusual good health and most abundant harvests.\nYou will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar\nexigencies of the times our intercourse with foreign nations\nhas been attended with profound solicitude, chie\ufb02y turning\nupon our own domestic a\ufb00airs.\nA disloyal portion of the American people have during\nthe whole year been engaged in an attempt to divide and\ndestroy the Union. A nation which endures factious\ndomestic division is exposed to disrespect abroad, and one\nparty, if not both, is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign\nintervention.\nNations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to\nresist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous\nambition, \nalthough \nmeasures \nadopted \nunder \nsuch\nin\ufb02uences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to\nthose adopting them.\nThe disloyal citizens of the United States who have\no\ufb00ered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and\ncomfort which they have invoked abroad have received less\n patronage \nand \nencouragement \nthan \nthey \nprobably\nexpected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have\nseemed to assume, that foreign nations in this case,\ndiscarding all moral, social, and treaty obligations, would\nact solely and sel\ufb01shly for the most speedy restoration of\ncommerce, including especially the acquisition of cotton,\nthose nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to\ntheir \nobject \nmore \ndirectly \nor \nclearly \nthrough \nthe\ndestruction than through the preservation of the Union. If\nwe could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated\nby no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a sound\nargument could be made to show them that they can reach\ntheir aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this\nrebellion than by giving encouragement to it.\nThe principal lever relied on by the insurgents for\nexciting foreign nations to hostility against us, as already\nintimated, is the embarrassment of commerce. Those\nnations, however, not improbably saw from the \ufb01rst that it\nwas the Union which made as well our foreign as our\ndomestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to\nperceive that the e\ufb00ort for disunion produces the existing\ndi\ufb00iculty, and that one strong nation promises more\ndurable peace and a more extensive, valuable, and reliable\ncommerce than can the same nation broken into hostile\nfragments.\nIt is not my purpose to review our discussions with\nforeign states, because, whatever might be their wishes or\ndispositions, the integrity of our country and the stability of\nour government mainly depend not upon them, but on the\n loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American\npeople. \nThe \ncorrespondence \nitself, \nwith \nthe \nusual\nreservations, is herewith submitted.\nI venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced\nprudence and liberality toward foreign powers, averting\ncauses of irritation and with \ufb01rmness maintaining our own\nrights and honor.\nSince, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other\nstate, \nforeign \ndangers \nnecessarily \nattend \ndomestic\ndi\ufb00iculties, \nI \nrecommend \nthat \nadequate \nand \nample\nmeasures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses\non every side. While under this general recommendation\nprovision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to\nthe mind, I also in the same connection ask the attention of\nCongress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that\nsome forti\ufb01cations and depots of arms and munitions, with\nharbor and navigation improvements, all at well-selected\npoints upon these, would be of great importance to the\nnational defense and preservation I ask attention to the\nviews of the Secretary of War, expressed in his report, upon\nthe same general subject.\nI deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east\nTennessee \nand \nwestern \nNorth \nCarolina \nshould \nbe\nconnected with Kentucky and other faithful parts of the\nUnion by rail-road. I therefore recommend, as a military\nmeasure, that Congress provide for the construction of\nsuch rail-road as speedily as possible. Kentucky will no\ndoubt co-operate, and through her Legislature make the\nmost judicious selection of a line. The northern terminus\n must connect with some existing railroad, and whether the\nroute shall be from Lexington or Nicholasville to the\nCumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in\nthe direction of Knoxville, or on some still di\ufb00erent line,\ncan easily be determined. Kentucky and the General\nGovernment co-operating, the work can be completed in a\nvery short time, and when done it will be not only of vast\npresent \nusefulness \nbut \nalso \na \nvaluable \npermanent\nimprovement, worth its cost in all the future.\nSome treaties, designed chie\ufb02y for the interests of\ncommerce, and having no grave political importance, have\nbeen negotiated, and will be submitted to the Senate for\ntheir consideration.\nAlthough we have failed to induce some of the\ncommercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration of the\nrigor of maritime war, we have removed all obstructions\nfrom the way of this humane reform except such as are\nmerely of temporary and accidental occurrence.\nI invite your attention to the correspondence between\nher \nBritannic \nMajesty\u2019s \nminister \naccredited \nto \nthis\ngovernment and the Secretary of State relative to the\ndetention of the British ship Perthshire in June last by the\nUnited States steamer Massachusetts for a supposed\nbreach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned\nby an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and as justice\nrequires that we should commit no belligerent act not\nfounded in strict right as sanctioned by public law, I\nrecommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the\n reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her\ndetention.\nI repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his\nannual message to Congress in December last in regard to\nthe disposition of the surplus which will probably remain\nafter satisfying the claims of American citizens against\nChina, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under\nthe act of the d of March, . If, however, it should not\nbe deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into\ne\ufb00ect, I would suggest that authority be given for investing\nthe principal, or the proceeds of the surplus referred to, in\ngood securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such\nother just claims of our citizens against China as are not\nunlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive\ntrade with that empire.\nBy the act of the th of August last Congress authorized\nthe President to instruct the commanders of suitable\nvessels to defend themselves against and to capture\npirates. His authority has been exercised in a single\ninstance only. For the more e\ufb00ectual protection of our\nextensive and valuable commerce in the Eastern seas\nespecially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to\nauthorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture\nany prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels\nand their cargoes, and the consular courts now established\nby law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in the\nevent that this should not be objected to by the local\nauthorities.\n If any good reason exists why we should persevere\nlonger in withholding our recognition of the independence\nand sovereignty of Haiti and Liberia, I am unable to discern\nit. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in\nregard to them without the approbation of Congress, I\nsubmit for your consideration the expediency of an\nappropriation for maintaining a charge d\u2019a\ufb00aires near each\nof those new States. It does not admit of doubt that\nimportant commercial advantages might be secured by\nfavorable treaties with them.\nThe operations of the treasury during the period which\nhas elapsed since your adjournment have been conducted\nwith signal success. The patriotism of the people has placed\nat the disposal of the government the large means\ndemanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national\nloan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes,\nwhose con\ufb01dence in their country\u2019s faith and zeal for their\ncountry\u2019s deliverance from present peril have induced them\nto contribute to the support of the government the whole of\ntheir limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar\nobligations to economy in disbursement and energy in\naction.\nThe revenue from all sources, including loans, for the\n\ufb01nancial year ending on the th of June, , was\n ,,., and the expenditures for the same period,\nincluding payments on account of the public debt, were\n ,,., leaving a balance in the treasury on the\nst of July of  ,,.. For the \ufb01rst quarter of the\n\ufb01nancial year ending on the th of September, , the\n receipts from all sources, including the balance of the st\nof \nJuly, \nwere \n ,,., \nand \nthe \nexpenses\n ,., leaving a balance on the st of October,\n, of  ,,..\nEstimates for the remaining three quarters of the year\nand for the \ufb01nancial year , together with his views of\nways and means for meeting the demands contemplated by\nthem, will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the\nTreasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenditures\nmade necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the\nresources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same\npatriotism which has thus far sustained the government\nwill continue to sustain it till peace and union shall again\nbless the land.\nI respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War\nfor information respecting the numerical strength of the\narmy and for recommendations having in view an increase\nof its e\ufb00iciency and the well-being of the various branches\nof the service intrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know\nthat the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the\noccasion, and that the number of troops tendered greatly\nexceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call\ninto the \ufb01eld.\nI refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which\nmake allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already\nattained by our troops and to the excellent sanitary\ncondition of the entire army.\nThe recommendation of the Secretary for an organization\nof the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital\n importance to the future safety of the country, and is\ncommended to the serious attention of Congress.\nThe large addition to the regular army, in connection\nwith the defection that has so considerably diminished the\nnumber of its o\ufb00icers, gives peculiar importance to his\nrecommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the\ngreatest capacity of the Military Academy.\nBy mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to\nprovide chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers. This\nsubject was brought to my notice, and I was induced to\ndraw up the form of a letter, one copy of which, properly\naddressed, has been delivered to each of the persons, and\nat the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule,\ncontaining also the form of the letter, marked A, and\nherewith transmitted.\nThese gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties\ndesignated at the times respectively stated in the schedule,\nand have labored faithfully therein ever since. I therefore\nrecommend that they be compensated at the same rate as\nchaplains in the army. I further suggest that general\nprovision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals, as\nwell as with regiments.\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail\nthe operations of that branch of the service, the activity\nand energy which have characterized its administration,\nand the results of measures to increase its e\ufb00iciency and\npower such have been the additions, by construction and\npurchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been\n created and brought into service since our di\ufb00iculties\ncommenced.\nBesides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger\nthan ever before assembled under our \ufb02ag have been put\na\ufb02oat and performed deeds which have increased our naval\nrenown.\nI would invite special attention to the recommendation of\nthe Secretary for a more perfect organization of the navy\nby introducing additional grades in the service.\nThe present organization is defective and unsatisfactory,\nand the suggestions submitted by the department will, it is\nbelieved, if adopted, obviate the di\ufb00iculties alluded to,\npromote harmony, and increase the e\ufb00iciency of the navy.\nThere are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme\nCourt \u2014 two by the decease of Justices Daniel and McLean\nand one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so\nfar forborne making nominations to \ufb01ll these vacancies for\nreasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing judges\nresided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if\nsuccessors were appointed in the same localities they could\nnot now serve upon their circuits; and many of the most\ncompetent men there probably would not take the personal\nhazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the Supreme\nbench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments\nnorth-ward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the\nSouth on the return of peace; although I may remark that\nto transfer to the North one which has heretofore been in\nthe South would not, with reference to territory and\npopulation, be unjust.\n During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge\nMcLean his circuit grew into an empire-altogether too\nlarge for any one judge to give the courts therein more\nthan a nominal attendance \u2014 rising in population from\n,, in  to ,, in .\nBesides this, the country generally has outgrown our\npresent judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended,\nthe \nsystem \nrequires \nthat \nall \nthe \nStates \nshall \nbe\naccommodated with circuit courts, attended by Supreme\njudges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,\nFlorida, Texas, California, and Oregon have never had any\nsuch courts. Nor can this well be remedied without a\nchange in the system, because the adding of judges to the\nSupreme Court, enough for the accommodation of all parts\nof the country with circuit courts, would create a court\naltogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort. And\nthe evil, if it be one, will increase as new States come into\nthe Union. Circuit courts are useful or they are not useful.\nIf useful, no State should be denied them; if not useful, no\nState should have them. Let them be provided for all or\nabolished as to all.\nThree modi\ufb01cations occur to me, either of which, I think,\nwould be an improvement upon our present system. Let the\nSupreme Court be of convenient number in every event;\nthen, \ufb01rst, let the whole country be divided into circuits of\nconvenient size, the Supreme judges to serve in a number\nof \nthem \ncorresponding \nto \ntheir \nown \nnumber, \nand\nindependent circuit judges be provided for all the rest; or,\nsecondly, let the Supreme judges be relieved from circuit\n duties and circuit judges provided for all the circuits; or,\nthirdly, dispense with circuit courts altogether, leaving the\njudicial functions wholly to the district courts and an\nindependent Supreme Court.\nI respectfully recommend to the consideration of\nCongress the present condition of the statute laws, with the\nhope that Congress will be able to \ufb01nd an easy remedy for\nmany of the inconveniences and evils which constantly\nembarrass those engaged in the practical administration of\nthem. Since the Organization of the government, Congress\nhas enacted some  acts and joint resolutions, which \ufb01ll\nmore than  closely printed pages and are scattered\nthrough many volumes. Many of these acts have been\ndrawn in haste and without su\ufb00icient caution, so that their\nprovisions are often obscure in themselves or in con\ufb02ict\nwith each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very\ndi\ufb00icult for even the best-informed persons to ascertain\nprecisely what the statute law really is.\nIt seems to me very important that the statute laws\nshould be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be\nreduced to as small a compass as may consist with the\nfullness and precision of the will of the Legislature and the\nperspicuity of its language. This well done would, I think,\ngreatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to\nassist in the administration of the laws, and would be a\nlasting bene\ufb01t to the people, by placing before them in a\nmore accessible and intelligible form the laws which so\ndeeply concern their interests and their duties.\n I am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all\nthe acts of Congress now in force and of a permanent and\ngeneral nature might be revised and rewritten so as to be\nembraced in one volume (or at most two volumes) of\nordinary and convenient size; and I respectfully recommend\nto Congress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestion\nbe approved to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall\nseem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed.\nOne of the unavoidable consequences of the present\ninsurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all\nthe ordinary means of administering civil justice by the\no\ufb00icers and in the forms of existing law. This is the case, in\nwhole or in part, in all the insurgent States; and as our\narmies advance upon and take possession of parts of those\nStates the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are\nno courts or o\ufb00icers to whom the citizens of other States\nmay apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims\nagainst citizens of the insurgent States, and there is a vast\namount of debt constituting such claims. Some have\nestimated it as high as  ,,, due in large part\nfrom insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are\neven now making great sacri\ufb01ces in the discharge of their\npatriotic duty to support the government.\nUnder these circumstances I have been urgently solicited\nto establish, by military power, courts to administer\nsummary justice in such cases. I have thus far declined to\ndo it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed \u2014\nthe collection of the debts \u2014 was just and right in itself, but\nbecause I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of\n necessity in the unusual exercise of power. But the powers\nof Congress, I suppose, are equal to the anomalous\noccasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to\nCongress, with the hope that a plan maybe devised for the\nadministration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent\nStates and Territories as may be under the control of this\ngovernment, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance\nand order or by the power of our arms; this, however, not to\nbe a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and\nto cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be\nreestablished in peace.\nIt is important that some more convenient means should\nbe provided, if possible, for the adjustment of claims\nagainst the government, especially in view of their\nincreased number by reason of the war. It is as much the\nduty of government to render prompt justice against itself\nin favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between\nprivate individuals. The investigation and adjudication of\nclaims in their nature belong to the judicial department.\nBesides, it is apparent that the attention of Congress will\nbe more than usually engaged for some time to come with\ngreat \nnational \nquestions. \nIt \nwas \nintended \nby \nthe\norganization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this\nbranch of business from the halls of Congress; but, while\nthe court has proved to be an e\ufb00ective and valuable means\nof investigation, it in great degree fails to e\ufb00ect the object\nof its creation for want of power to make its judgments\n\ufb01nal.\n Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger of the\nsubject, I commend to your careful consideration whether\nthis power of making judgments \ufb01nal may not properly be\ngiven to the court, reserving the right of appeal on\nquestions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other\nprovisions as experience may have shown to be necessary.\nI ask attention to the report of the Postmaster general,\nthe following being a summary statement of the condition\nof the department:\nThe revenue from all sources during the \ufb01scal year\nending June , , including the annual permanent\nappropriation of  , for the transportation of \u201cfree\nmail matter,\u201d was  ,,., being about  per cent.\nless than the revenue for .\nThe expenditures were  ,,., showing a\ndecrease of more than  per cent. as compared with those\nof the previous year and leaving an excess of expenditure\nover the revenue for the last \ufb01scal year of  ,,..\nThe gross revenue for the year ending June , , is\nestimated at an increase of  per cent. on that of ,\nmaking  ,,, to which should be added the earnings\nof the department in carrying free matter, viz.,  ,,\nmaking  ,,.\nThe total expenditures for  are estimated at\n ,,, leaving an estimated de\ufb01ciency of  ,,\nto be supplied from the treasury in addition to the\npermanent appropriation.\nThe present insurrection shows, I think, that the\nextension of this District across the Potomac River at the\n time of establishing the capital here was eminently wise,\nand consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of\nit which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and\ndangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency\nof regaining that part of the District and the restoration of\nthe original boundaries thereof through negotiations with\nthe State of Virginia.\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the\naccompanying documents, exhibits the condition of the\nseveral branches of the public business pertaining to that\ndepartment. The depressing in\ufb02uences of the insurrection\nhave been specially felt in the operations of the Patent and\nGeneral Land O\ufb00ices. The cash receipts from the sales of\npublic lands during the past year have exceeded the\nexpenses of our land system only about  ,. The sales\nhave been entirely suspended in the Southern States, while\nthe interruptions to the business of the country and the\ndiversion of large numbers of men from labor to military\nservice have obstructed settlements in the new States and\nTerritories of the Northwest.\nThe receipts of the Patent O\ufb00ice have declined in nine\nmonths about  ,. rendering a large reduction of\nthe force employed necessary to make it self-sustaining.\nThe demands upon the Pension O\ufb00ice will be largely\nincreased by the insurrection. Numerous applications for\npensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war,\nhave already been made. There is reason to believe that\nmany who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of\nthe bounty of the government are in the ranks of the\n insurgent army or giving them aid and comfort. The\nSecretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the\npayment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of\ntheir disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that\no\ufb00icer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken\nfrom the pension rolls.\nThe relations of the government with the Indian tribes\nhave been greatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially\nin the southern superintendency and in that of New\nMexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in the\npossession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The\nagents of the United States appointed since the th of\nMarch for this superintendency have been unable to reach\ntheir posts, while the most of those who were in o\ufb00ice\nbefore that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause,\nand assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of\ncommissions from the insurrectionists. It has been stated in\nthe public press that a portion of those Indians have been\norganized as a military force and are attached to the army\nof the insurgents. Although the government has no o\ufb00icial\ninformation upon this subject, letters have been written to\nthe Commissioner of Indian A\ufb00airs by several prominent\nchiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the United States\nand expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops to\nprotect them. It is believed that upon the repossession of\nthe country by the Federal forces the Indians will readily\ncease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former\nrelations to the government.\n Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the\nnation, has not a department nor a bureau, but a clerkship\nonly, assigned to it in the government. While it is fortunate\nthat this great interest is so independent in its nature as\nnot to have demanded and extorted more from the\ngovernment, I respectfully ask Congress to consider\nwhether something more cannot be given voluntarily with\ngeneral advantage.\nAnnual \nreports \nexhibiting \nthe \ncondition \nof \nour\nagriculture, commerce, and manufactures would present a\nfund of information of great practical value to the country.\nWhile I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the\nopinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might\npro\ufb01tably be organized.\nThe execution of the laws for the suppression of the\nAfrican slave trade has been con\ufb01ded to the Department of\nthe Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that the e\ufb00orts\nwhich have been made for the suppression of this inhuman\ntra\ufb00ic have been recently attended with unusual success.\nFive vessels being \ufb01tted out for the slave trade have been\nseized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in\nthe trade and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver\nhave been convicted and subjected to the penalty of \ufb01ne\nand imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of\nAfricans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the\nhighest grade of o\ufb00ense under our laws, the punishment of\nwhich is death.\nThe Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created\nby the last Congress, have been organized, and civil\n administration \nhas \nbeen \ninaugurated \ntherein \nunder\nauspices especially gratifying when it is considered that the\nleaven of treason was found existing in some of these new\ncountries when the Federal o\ufb00icers arrived there.\nThe abundant natural resources of these Territories, with\nthe \nsecurity \nand \nprotection \na\ufb00orded \nby \norganized\ngovernment, will doubtless invite to them a large\nimmigration when peace shall restore the business of the\ncountry \nto \nits \naccustomed \nchannels. \nI \nsubmit \nthe\nresolutions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evidence\nthe patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory. So far the\nauthority of the United States has been upheld in all the\nTerritories, as it is hoped it will be in the future. I commend\ntheir interests and defense to the enlightened and generous\ncare of Congress.\nI recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress\nthe interests of the District of Columbia. The insurrection\nhas been the cause of much su\ufb00ering and sacri\ufb01ce to its\ninhabitants, and as they have no representative in Congress\nthat body should not overlook their just claims upon the\ngovernment.\nAt your late session a joint resolution was adopted\nauthorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a\nproper representation of the industrial interests of the\nUnited States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations\nto be holden at London in the year . I regret to say I\nhave been unable to give personal attention to this subject\n\u2014 a subject at once so interesting in itself and so\nextensively and intimately connected with the material\n prosperity of the world. Through the Secretaries of State\nand of the Interior a plan or system has been devised and\npartly matured, and which will be laid before you.\nUnder and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled \u201cAn\nact \nto \ncon\ufb01scate \nproperty \nused \nfor \ninsurrectionary\npurposes,\u201d approved August , , the legal claims of\ncertain persons to the labor and service of certain other\npersons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter\nthus liberated are already dependent on the United States,\nand must be provided for in some way. Besides this, it is not\nimpossible that some of the States will pass similar\nenactments for their own bene\ufb01t respectively, and by\noperation of which persons of the same class will be thrown\nupon them for disposal. In such case I recommend that\nCongress provide for accepting such persons from such\nStates, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, pro\ntanto, of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed\non with such States respectively; that such persons, on\nsuch acceptance by the General Government, be at once\ndeemed free, and that in any event steps be taken for\ncolonizing both classes (or the one \ufb01rst mentioned if the\nother shall not be brought into existence) at some place or\nplaces in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to\nconsider, too, whether the free colored people already in\nthe United States could not, so far as individuals may\ndesire, be included in such colonization.\nTo carry out the plan of colonization may involve the\nacquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money\nbeyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition.\n Having practised the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty\nyears, the question of constitutional power to do so is no\nlonger an open one with us. The power was questioned at\n\ufb01rst by Mr. Je\ufb00erson, who, however, in the purchase of\nLouisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great\nexpediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of\nacquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this\nmeasure e\ufb00ects that object, for emigration of colored men\nleaves additional room for white men remaining or coming\nhere. Mr. Je\ufb00erson, however, placed the importance of\nprocuring Louisiana more on political and commercial\ngrounds than on providing room for population.\nOn this whole proposition, including the appropriation of\nmoney with the acquisition of territory, does not the\nexpediency amount to absolute necessity \u2014 that without\nwhich the government itself cannot be perpetuated?\nThe war continues. In considering the policy to be\nadopted for suppressing the insurrection I have been\nanxious and careful that the inevitable con\ufb02ict for this\npurpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless\nrevolutionary struggle. I have therefore in every case\nthought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union\nprominent as the primary object of the contest on our part,\nleaving all questions which are not of vital military\nimportance \nto \nthe \nmore \ndeliberate \naction \nof \nthe\nLegislature.\nIn the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to\nthe blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of\n putting in force by proclamation the law of Congress\nenacted at the late session for closing those ports.\nSo also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the\nobligations of law, instead of transcending I have adhered\nto the act of Congress to con\ufb01scate property used for\ninsurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon the same\nsubject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly\nconsidered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all\nindispensable means must be employed. We should not be\nin haste to determine that radical and extreme measures,\nwhich may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are\nindispensable.\nThe \ninaugural \naddress \nat \nthe \nbeginning \nof \nthe\nAdministration and the message to Congress at the late\nspecial session were both mainly devoted to topics\ndomestic controversy out of which the insurrection and\nconsequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or\nsubtract to or from the principles or general purposes\nstated and expressed in those documents.\nThe last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably\nexpired at the assault upon Fort Sumter, and a general\nreview of what has occurred since may not be unpro\ufb01table.\nWhat was painfully uncertain then is much better de\ufb01ned\nand more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly\nin the right direction. The insurgents con\ufb01dently claimed a\nstrong support from north of Mason and Dixon\u2019s line, and\nthe friends of the Union were not free from apprehension\non the point. This, however, was soon settled de\ufb01nitely, and\non the right side. South of the line noble little Delaware led\n o\ufb00 right from the \ufb01rst. Maryland was made to seem against\nthe Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were\nburned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we\nwere many days at one time without the ability to bring a\nsingle regiment over her soil to the capital. Now her\nbridges and railroads are repaired and open to the\ngovernment; she already gives seven regiments to the\ncause of the Union, and none to the enemy; and her people,\nat a regular election, have sustained the Union by a larger\nmajority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before\ngave to any candidate or any question. Kentucky, too, for\nsome time in doubt, is now decidedly and, I think,\nunchangeably ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is\ncomparatively quiet, and, I believe, can, not again be\noverrun by the insurrectionists. These three States of\nMaryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, neither of which would\npromise a single soldier at \ufb01rst, have now an aggregate of\nnot less than forty thousand in the \ufb01eld for the Union, while\nof their citizens certainly not more than a third of that\nnumber, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful\nexistence, are in arms against us. After a somewhat bloody\nstruggle of months, winter closes on the Union people of\nwestern Virginia, leaving them masters of their own\ncountry.\nAn insurgent force of about \ufb01fteen hundred, for months\ndominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the\ncounties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as\nEastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous\nparts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the\n people there have renewed their allegiance to and accepted\nthe protection of the old \ufb02ag. This leaves no armed\ninsurrectionist north of the Potomac or east of the\nChesapeake.\nAlso we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated\npoints on the southern coast of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee\nIsland (near Savannah), and Ship Island; and we likewise\nhave some general accounts of popular movements in\nbehalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee.\nThese things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is\nadvancing steadily and certainly southward.\nSince your last adjournment Lieutenant-General Scott\nhas retired from the head of the army. During his long life\nthe nation has not been unmindful of his merit; yet on\ncalling to mind how faithfully, ably, and brilliantly he has\nserved the country, from a time far back in our history,\nwhen few of the now living had been born, and\nthenceforward continually, I cannot but think we are still\nhis debtors. I submit, therefore, for your consideration\nwhat further mark of recognition is due to him, and to\nourselves as a grateful people.\nWith the retirement of General Scott came the Executive\nduty of appointing in his stead a general-in-chief of the\narmy. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council\nnor country was there, so far as I know, any di\ufb00erence of\nopinion as to the proper person to be selected. The retiring\nchief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of General\nMcClellan for the position, and in this the nation seemed to\ngive a unanimous concurrence. The designation of General\n McClellan is therefore in considerable degree the selection\nof the country as well as of the Executive, and hence there\nis better reason to hope there will be given him the\ncon\ufb01dence and cordial support thus by fair implication\npromised, and without which he cannot with so full\ne\ufb00iciency serve the country.\nIt has been said that one bad general is better than two\ngood ones, and the saying is true if taken to mean no more\nthan that an army is better directed by a single mind,\nthough inferior, than by two superior ones at variance and\ncross-purposes with each other.\nAnd the same is true in all joint operations wherein those\nengaged can have none but a common end in view and can\ndi\ufb00er only as to the choice of means. In a storm at sea no\none on hoard can wish the ship to sink, and yet not\nunfrequently all go down together because too many will\ndirect and no single mind can be allowed to control.\nIt continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if\nnot exclusively, a war upon the \ufb01rst principle of popular\ngovernment \u2014 the rights of the people. Conclusive\nevidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely\nconsidered public documents, as well as in the general tone\nof the insurgents. In those documents we \ufb01nd the\nabridgment of the existing right of su\ufb00rage and the denial\nto the people of all right to participate in the selection of\npublic o\ufb00icers except the legislative boldly advocated, with\nlabored arguments to prove that large control of the people\nin government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy\n itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the\npower of the people.\nIn my present position I could scarcely be justi\ufb01ed were I\nto omit raising a warning voice against this approach of\nreturning despotism. It is not needed nor \ufb01tting here that a\ngeneral argument should be made in favor of popular\ninstitutions, but there is one point, with its connections, not\nso hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\nattention. It is the e\ufb00ort to place capital on an equal footing\nwith, if not above, labor in the structure of government. It\nis assumed that labor is available only in connection with\ncapital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning\ncapital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor. This\nassumed, it is next considered whether it is best that\ncapital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by\ntheir own consent, or buy them and drive them to it without\ntheir consent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally\nconcluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or\nwhat we call slaves. And further, it is assumed that whoever\nis once a hired laborer is \ufb01xed in that condition for life.\nNow there is no such relation between capital and labor\nas assumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man being\n\ufb01xed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these\nassumptions are false, and all inferences from them are\ngroundless.\nLabor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is\nonly the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor\nhad not \ufb01rst existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and\ndeserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its\n rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other\nrights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always\nwill be, a relation between labor and capital producing\nmutual bene\ufb01ts. The error is in assuming that the whole\nlabor of community exists within that relation. A few men\nown capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with\ntheir capital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A\nlarge majority belong to neither class \u2014 neither work for\nothers nor have others working for them. In most of the\nSouthern States a majority of the whole people of all colors\nare neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a\nlarge majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their\nfamilies \u2014 wives, sons, and daughters, \u2014 work for\nthemselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their\nshops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking\nno favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or\nslaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable\nnumber of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that\nis, they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire\nothers to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and not a\ndistinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the\nexistence of this mixed class.\nAgain, as has already been said, there is not of necessity\nany such thing as the free hired laborer being \ufb01xed to that\ncondition for life. Many independent men everywhere in\nthese States a few years back in their lives were hired\nlaborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world\nlabors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy\ntools or land for himself, then labors on his own account\n another while, and at length hires another new beginner to\nhelp him. This is the just and generous and prosperous\nsystem which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and\nconsequent energy and progress and improvement of\ncondition to all. No men living are more worthy to be\ntrusted than those who toil up from poverty; none less\ninclined to take or touch aught which they have not\nhonestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a\npolitical power which they already possess, and which if\nsurrendered will surely be used to close the door of\nadvancement against such as they and to \ufb01x new\ndisabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be\nlost.\nFrom the \ufb01rst taking of our national census to the last\nare seventy years, and we \ufb01nd our population at the end of\nthe period eight times as great as it was at the beginning.\nThe increase of those other things which men deem\ndesirable has been even greater. We thus have at one view\nwhat the popular principle, applied to government through\nthe machinery of the States and the Union, has produced in\na given time, and also what if \ufb01rmly maintained it promises\nfor the future. There are already among us those who if the\nUnion be preserved will live to see it contain ,,.\nThe struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day; it is for a\nvast future also. With a reliance on Providence all the more\n\ufb01rm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which\nevents have devolved upon us.\nA.

I am, as you intimate, losing much of the\ngreat con\ufb01dence I placed in you, not from any act or\nomission of yours touching the public service, up to the\ntime you were sent to Leavenworth, but from the \ufb02ood of\ngrumbling despatches and letters I have seen from you\nsince. I knew you were being ordered to Leavenworth at\nthe time it was done; and I aver that with as tender a\nregard for your honor and your sensibilities as I had for my\nown, it never occurred to me that you were being\n\u201chumiliated, insulted, and disgraced\u201d; nor have I, up to this\nday, heard an intimation that you have been wronged,\ncoming from any one but yourself. No one has blamed you\nfor the retrograde movement from Spring\ufb01eld, nor for the\ninformation you gave General Cameron; and this you could\nreadily understand, if it were not for your unwarranted\nassumption that the ordering you to Leavenworth must\nnecessarily have been done as a punishment for some fault.\nI thought then, and think yet, the position assigned to you\n is as responsible, and as honorable, as that assigned to\nBuell \u2014 I know that General McClellan expected more\nimportant results from it. My impression is that at the time\nyou were assigned to the new Western Department, it had\nnot been determined to replace General Sherman in\nKentucky; but of this I am not certain, because the idea\nthat a command in Kentucky was very desirable, and one in\nthe farther West undesirable, had never occurred to me.\nYou constantly speak of being placed in command of only\n. Now, tell me, is this not mere impatience? Have you\nnot known all the while that you are to command four or\n\ufb01ve times that many.\nI have been, and am sincerely your friend; and if, as\nsuch, I dare to make a suggestion, I would say you are\nadopting the best possible way to ruin yourself. \u201cAct well\nyour part, there all the honor lies.\u201d He who does something\nat the head of one regiment, will eclipse him who does\nnothing at the head of a hundred.\nYour friend, as ever, A.

LINCOLN.\n[Similar despatch to Buell same date.]\n     \n I     \n   I\n \n  A     I\n \n IA  \n    .\n \n  . \nA  \nA .\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., July , .\nHON. SAMUEL GALLOWAY.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your very complimentary, not to say\n\ufb02attering, letter of the d inst. is received. Dr. Reynolds\nhad induced me to expect you here; and I was disappointed\nnot a little by your failure to come. And yet I fear you have\nformed an estimate of me which can scarcely be sustained\non a personal acquaintance.\nTwo things done by the Ohio Republican convention \u2014\nthe repudiation of Judge Swan, and the \u201cplank\u201d for a repeal\nof the Fugitive Slave Law \u2014 I very much regretted. These\ntwo things are of a piece; and they are viewed by many\ngood men, sincerely opposed to slavery, as a struggle\n against, and in disregard of, the Constitution itself. And it is\nthe very thing that will greatly endanger our cause, if it be\nnot kept out of our national convention. There is another\nthing our friends are doing which gives me some\nuneasiness. It is their leaning toward \u201cpopular sovereignty.\u201d\nThere are three substantial objections to this: First, no\nparty can command respect which sustains this year what it\nopposed \nlast. \nSecondly, \nDouglas \n(who \nis \nthe \nmost\ndangerous enemy of liberty, because the most insidious\none) would have little support in the North, and by\nconsequence, no capital to trade on in the South, if it were\nnot for his friends thus magnifying him and his humbug.\nBut lastly, and chie\ufb02y, Douglas\u2019s popular sovereignty,\naccepted by the public mind as a just principle, nationalizes\nslavery, and revives the African slave trade inevitably.\nTaking slaves into new Territories, and buying slaves in\nAfrica, are identical things, identical rights or identical\nwrongs, and the argument which establishes one will\nestablish the other. Try a thousand years for a sound reason\nwhy Congress shall not hinder the people of Kansas from\nhaving slaves, and, when you have found it, it will be an\nequally good one why Congress should not hinder the\npeople of Georgia from importing slaves from Africa.\nAs to Governor Chase, I have a kind side for him. He was\none of the few distinguished men of the nation who gave\nus, in Illinois, their sympathy last year. I never saw him, but\nsuppose him to be able and right-minded; but still he may\nnot be the most suitable as a candidate for the Presidency.\n I must say I do not think myself \ufb01t for the Presidency. As\nyou propose a correspondence with me, I shall look for your\nletters anxiously.\nI have not met Dr. Reynolds since receiving your letter;\nbut when I shall, I will present your respects as requested.\nYours very truly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n I  I   A\n  \n     \n .\nTO HAWKINS TAYLOR\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. SEPT. , .\nHAWKINS TAYLOR, Esq.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Yours of the d is just received. There is\nsome mistake about my expected attendance of the U.S.\nCourt in your city on the d Tuesday of this month. I have\nhad no thought of being there.\nIt is bad to be poor. I shall go to the wall for bread and\nmeat if I neglect my business this year as well as last. It\nwould please me much to see the city and good people of\nKeokuk, but for this year it is little less than an\nimpossibility. I am constantly receiving invitations which I\nam compelled to decline. I was pressingly urged to go to\nMinnesota; and I now have two invitations to go to Ohio.\nThese last are prompted by Douglas going there; and I am\nreally tempted to make a \ufb02ying trip to Columbus and\nCincinnati.\nI do hope you will have no serious trouble in Iowa. What\nthinks Grimes about it? I have not known him to be\nmistaken about an election in Iowa. Present my respects to\nCol. Carter, and any other friends, and believe me Yours\ntruly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n      H A   \n \n \n   \nHI\n.\nSEPTEMBER , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF OHIO: I cannot\nfail to remember that I appear for the \ufb01rst time before an\naudience in this now great State, \u2014 an audience that is\naccustomed to hear such speakers as Corwin, and Chase,\nand \nWade, \nand \nmany \nother \nrenowned \nmen; \nand,\nremembering this, I feel that it will be well for you, as for\nme, that you should not raise your expectations to that\nstandard to which you would have been justi\ufb01ed in raising\nthem had one of these distinguished men appeared before\nyou. You would perhaps be only preparing a disappointment\nfor \nyourselves, \nand, \nas \na \nconsequence \nof \nyour\ndisappointment, morti\ufb01cation to me. I hope, therefore, that\nyou will commence with very moderate expectations; and\nperhaps, if you will give me your attention, I shall be able\nto interest you to a moderate degree.\nAppearing here for the \ufb01rst time in my life, I have been\nsomewhat embarrassed for a topic by way of introduction\nto my speech; but I have been relieved from that\nembarrassment \nby \nan \nintroduction \nwhich \nthe \nOhio\nStatesman newspaper gave me this morning. In this paper I\nhave read an article, in which, among other statements, I\n\ufb01nd the following:\n \u201cIn debating with Senator Douglas during the memorable\ncontest of last fall, Mr. Lincoln declared in favor of negro\nsu\ufb00rage, and attempted to defend that vile conception\nagainst the Little Giant.\u201d\nI mention this now, at the opening of my remarks, for the\npurpose of making three comments upon it. The \ufb01rst I have\nalready announced, \u2014 it furnishes me an introductory\ntopic; the second is to show that the gentleman is mistaken;\nthirdly, to give him an opportunity to correct it.\nIn the \ufb01rst place, in regard to this matter being a\nmistake. I have found that it is not entirely safe, when one\nis misrepresented under his very nose, to allow the\nmisrepresentation \nto \ngo \nuncontradicted. \nI \ntherefore\npropose, here at the outset, not only to say that this is a\nmisrepresentation, but to show conclusively that it is so;\nand you will bear with me while I read a couple of extracts\nfrom that very \u201cmemorable\u201d debate with Judge Douglas last\nyear, to which this newspaper refers. In the \ufb01rst pitched\nbattle which Senator Douglas and myself had, at the town\nof Ottawa, I used the language which I will now read.\nHaving been previously reading an extract, I continued as\nfollows:\n\u201cNow, gentlemen, I don\u2019t want to read at any greater\nlength, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever\nsaid in regard to the institution of slavery and the black\nrace. This is the whole of it; and anything that argues me\ninto his idea of perfect social and political equality with the\nnegro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of\nwords, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a\n chestnut horse. I will say here, while upon this subject, that\nI have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the\ninstitution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe\nI have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to\ndo so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social\nequality between the white and the black races. There is a\nphysical di\ufb00erence between the two which, in my\njudgment, will probably forbid their ever living together\nupon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it\nbecomes a necessity that there must be a di\ufb00erence, I, as\nwell as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I\nbelong having the superior position. I have never said\nanything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding\nall this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not\nentitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the\nDeclaration of Independence, \u2014 the right to life, liberty and\nthe pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled\nto these as the white man. I agree with judge Douglas, he is\nnot my equal in many respects, \u2014 certainly not in color,\nperhaps not in moral or intellectual endowments. But in the\nright to eat the bread, without leave of anybody else, which\nhis own hand earns, he is my equal, and the equal of Judge\nDouglas, and the equal of every living man.\u201d\nUpon a subsequent occasion, when the reason for\nmaking a statement like this occurred, I said:\n\u201cWhile I was at the hotel to-day an elderly gentleman\ncalled upon me to know whether I was really in favor of\nproducing perfect equality between the negroes and white\npeople. While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion\n to say much on that subject, yet, as the question was asked\nme, I thought I would occupy perhaps \ufb01ve minutes in\nsaying something in regard to it. I will say, then, that I am\nnot, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any\nway the social and political equality of the white and black\nraces; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making\nvoters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold\no\ufb00ice, or intermarry with the white people; and I will say in\naddition to this that there is a physical di\ufb00erence between\nthe white and black races which I believe will forever forbid\nthe two races living together on terms of social and\npolitical equality. And inasmuch as they can not so live,\nwhile they do remain together there must be the position of\nsuperior and inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am\nin favor of having the superior position assigned to the\nwhite race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that\nbecause the white man is to have the superior position, the\nnegro should be denied everything. I do not understand\nthat because I do not want a negro woman for a slave, I\nmust necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding is\nthat I can just let her alone. I am now in my \ufb01ftieth year,\nand I certainly never have had a black woman for either a\nslave or a wife. So it seems to me quite possible for us to\nget along without making either slaves or wives of negroes.\nI will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a\nman, woman, or child, who was in favor of producing\nperfect equality, social and political, between negroes and\nwhite men. I recollect of but one distinguished instance\nthat I ever heard of so frequently as to be satis\ufb01ed of its\n correctness, and that is the case of Judge Douglas\u2019s old\nfriend Colonel Richard M. Johnson. I will also add to the\nremarks I have made (for I am not going to enter at large\nupon this subject), that I have never had the least\napprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes, if\nthere was no law to keep them from it; but as judge\nDouglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension\nthat they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I\ngive him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last\nstand by the law of the State which forbids the marrying of\nwhite people with negroes.\u201d\nThere, my friends, you have brie\ufb02y what I have, upon\nformer occasions, said upon this subject to which this\nnewspaper, to the extent of its ability, has drawn the public\nattention. In it you not only perceive, as a probability, that\nin that contest I did not at any time say I was in favor of\nnegro su\ufb00rage, but the absolute proof that twice \u2014 once\nsubstantially, and once expressly \u2014 I declared against it.\nHaving shown you this, there remains but a word of\ncomment upon that newspaper article. It is this, that I\npresume the editor of that paper is an honest and truth-\nloving man, and that he will be greatly obliged to me for\nfurnishing him thus early an opportunity to correct the\nmisrepresentation he has made, before it has run so long\nthat malicious people can call him a liar.\nThe Giant himself has been here recently. I have seen a\nbrief report of his speech. If it were otherwise unpleasant\nto me to introduce the subject of the negro as a topic for\ndiscussion, I might be somewhat relieved by the fact that\n he dealt exclusively in that subject while he was here. I\nshall, therefore, without much hesitation or di\ufb00idence,\nenter upon this subject.\nThe American people, on the \ufb01rst day of January, ,\nfound the African slave trade prohibited by a law of\nCongress. In a majority of the States of this Union, they\nfound African slavery, or any other sort of slavery,\nprohibited by State constitutions. They also found a law\nexisting, supposed to be valid, by which slavery was\nexcluded from almost all the territory the United States\nthen owned. This was the condition of the country, with\nreference to the institution of slavery, on the \ufb01rst of\nJanuary, . A few days after that, a bill was introduced\ninto Congress, which ran through its regular course in the\ntwo branches of the national legislature, and \ufb01nally passed\ninto a law in the month of May, by which the Act of\nCongress prohibiting slavery from going into the Territories\nof the United States was repealed. In connection with the\nlaw itself, and, in fact, in the terms of the law, the then\nexisting prohibition was not only repealed, but there was a\ndeclaration of a purpose on the part of Congress never\nthereafter to exercise any power that they might have, real\nor supposed, to prohibit the extension or spread of slavery.\nThis was a very great change; for the law thus repealed\nwas of more than thirty years\u2019 standing. Following rapidly\nupon the heels of this action of Congress, a decision of the\nSupreme Court is made, by which it is declared that\nCongress, if it desires to prohibit the spread of slavery into\nthe Territories, has no constitutional power to do so. Not\n only so, but that decision lays down principles which, if\npushed to their logical conclusion, \u2014 I say pushed to their\nlogical conclusion, \u2014 would decide that the constitutions of\nfree \nStates, \nforbidding \nslavery, \nare \nthemselves\nunconstitutional. Mark me, I do not say the judges said this,\nand let no man say I a\ufb00irm the judges used these words;\nbut I only say it is my opinion that what they did say, if\npressed to its logical conclusion, will inevitably result thus.\nLooking at these things, the Republican party, as I\nunderstand its principles and policy, believes that there is\ngreat danger of the institution of slavery being spread out\nand extended until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all\nthe States of this Union; so believing, to prevent that\nincidental and ultimate consummation is the original and\nchief purpose of the Republican organization. I say \u201cchief\npurpose\u201d of the Republican organization; for it is certainly\ntrue that if the National House shall fall into the hands of\nthe Republicans, they will have to attend to all the other\nmatters of national house-keeping, as well as this. The chief\nand real purpose of the Republican party is eminently\nconservative. It proposes nothing save and except to\nrestore this government to its original tone in regard to this\nelement of slavery, and there to maintain it, looking for no\nfurther change in reference to it than that which the\noriginal framers of the Government themselves expected\nand looked forward to.\nThe chief danger to this purpose of the Republican party\nis not just now the revival of the African slave trade, or the\npassage of a Congressional slave code, or the declaring of a\n second Dred Scott decision, making slavery lawful in all the\nStates. These are not pressing us just now. They are not\nquite ready yet. The authors of these measures know that\nwe are too strong for them; but they will be upon us in due\ntime, and we will be grappling with them hand to hand, if\nthey are not now headed o\ufb00. They are not now the chief\ndanger to the purpose of the Republican organization; but\nthe most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose\nis that insidious Douglas popular sovereignty. This is the\nminer and sapper. While it does not propose to revive the\nAfrican slave trade, nor to pass a slave code, nor to make a\nsecond Dred Scott decision, it is preparing us for the\nonslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they\nshall be ready to come on, and the word of command for\nthem to advance shall be given. I say this \u201cDouglas popular\nsovereignty\u201d; for there is a broad distinction, as I now\nunderstand it, between that article and a genuine popular\nsovereignty.\nI believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty. I think a\nde\ufb01nition of \u201cgenuine popular sovereignty,\u201d in the abstract,\nwould be about this: That each man shall do precisely as he\npleases with himself, and with all those things which\nexclusively concern him. Applied to government, this\nprinciple would be, that a general government shall do all\nthose things which pertain to it, and all the local\ngovernments shall do precisely as they please in respect to\nthose \nmatters \nwhich \nexclusively \nconcern \nthem. \nI\nunderstand that this government of the United States,\nunder which we live, is based upon this principle; and I am\n misunderstood if it is supposed that I have any war to make\nupon that principle.\nNow, what is judge Douglas\u2019s popular sovereignty? It is,\nas a principle, no other than that if one man chooses to\nmake a slave of another man neither that other man nor\nanybody else has a right to object. Applied in government,\nas he seeks to apply it, it is this: If, in a new Territory into\nwhich a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose\nof making their homes, they choose to either exclude\nslavery from their limits or to establish it there, however\none or the other may a\ufb00ect the persons to be enslaved, or\nthe \nin\ufb01nitely \ngreater \nnumber \nof \npersons \nwho \nare\nafterwards to inhabit that Territory, or the other members\nof the families of communities, of which they are but an\nincipient member, or the general head of the family of\nStates as parent of all, however their action may a\ufb00ect one\nor the other of these, there is no power or right to\ninterfere. That is Douglas\u2019s popular sovereignty applied.\nHe has a good deal of trouble with popular sovereignty.\nHis explanations explanatory of explanations explained are\ninterminable. The most lengthy, and, as I suppose, the most\nmaturely considered of this long series of explanations is\nhis great essay in Harper\u2019s Magazine. I will not attempt to\nenter on any very thorough investigation of his argument as\nthere made and presented. I will nevertheless occupy a\ngood portion of your time here in drawing your attention to\ncertain points in it. Such of you as may have read this\ndocument will have perceived that the judge early in the\ndocument quotes from two persons as belonging to the\n Republican party, without naming them, but who can\nreadily be recognized as being Governor Seward of New\nYork and myself. It is true that exactly \ufb01fteen months ago\nthis day, I believe, I for the \ufb01rst time expressed a sentiment\nupon this subject, and in such a manner that it should get\ninto print, that the public might see it beyond the circle of\nmy hearers; and my expression of it at that time is the\nquotation that Judge Douglas makes. He has not made the\nquotation with accuracy, but justice to him requires me to\nsay that it is su\ufb00iciently accurate not to change the sense.\nThe sense of that quotation condensed is this: that this\nslavery element is a durable element of discord among us,\nand that we shall probably not have perfect peace in this\ncountry with it until it either masters the free principle in\nour government, or is so far mastered by the free principle\nas for the public mind to rest in the belief that it is going to\nits end. This sentiment, which I now express in this way,\nwas, at no great distance of time, perhaps in di\ufb00erent\nlanguage, and in connection with some collateral ideas,\nexpressed by Governor Seward. Judge Douglas has been so\nmuch annoyed by the expression of that sentiment that he\nhas constantly, I believe, in almost all his speeches since it\nwas uttered, been referring to it. I \ufb01nd he alluded to it in\nhis speech here, as well as in the copyright essay. I do not\nnow enter upon this for the purpose of making an elaborate\nargument to show that we were right in the expression of\nthat sentiment. In other words, I shall not stop to say all\nthat might properly be said upon this point, but I only ask\n your attention to it for the purpose of making one or two\npoints upon it.\nIf you will read the copyright essay, you will discover that\njudge Douglas himself says a controversy between the\nAmerican Colonies and the Government of Great Britain\nbegan on the slavery question in , and continued from\nthat time until the Revolution; and, while he did not say so,\nwe all know that it has continued with more or less violence\never since the Revolution.\nThen we need not appeal to history, to the declarations of\nthe framers of the government, but we know from judge\nDouglas himself that slavery began to be an element of\ndiscord among the white people of this country as far back\nas , or one hundred and sixty years ago, or \ufb01ve\ngenerations of men, \u2014 counting thirty years to a\ngeneration. Now, it would seem to me that it might have\noccurred to Judge Douglas, or anybody who had turned his\nattention to these facts, that there was something in the\nnature of that thing, slavery, somewhat durable for mischief\nand discord.\nThere is another point I desire to make in regard to this\nmatter, before I leave it. From the adoption of the\nConstitution down to  is the precise period of our\nhistory when we had comparative peace upon this question,\n\u2014 the precise period of time when we came nearer to\nhaving peace about it than any other time of that entire one\nhundred and sixty years in which he says it began, or of the\neighty years of our own Constitution. Then it would be\nworth our while to stop and examine into the probable\n reason of our coming nearer to having peace then than at\nany other time. This was the precise period of time in which\nour fathers adopted, and during which they followed, a\npolicy restricting the spread of slavery, and the whole\nUnion was acquiescing in it. The whole country looked\nforward to the ultimate extinction of the institution. It was\nwhen a policy had been adopted, and was prevailing, which\nled all just and right-minded men to suppose that slavery\nwas gradually coming to an end, and that they might be\nquiet about it, watching it as it expired. I think Judge\nDouglas might have perceived that too; and whether he did\nor not, it is worth the attention of fair-minded men, here\nand elsewhere, to consider whether that is not the truth of\nthe case. If he had looked at these two facts, \u2014 that this\nmatter has been an element of discord for one hundred and\nsixty years among this people, and that the only\ncomparative peace we have had about it was when that\npolicy prevailed in this government which he now wars\nupon, he might then, perhaps, have been brought to a more\njust appreciation of what I said \ufb01fteen months ago, \u2014 that\n\u201ca house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe that\nthis government cannot endure permanently, half slave and\nhalf free. I do not expect the house to fall, I do not expect\nthe Union to dissolve; but I do expect it will cease to be\ndivided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either\nthe opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\nand place it where the public mind will rest in the belief\nthat it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its\nadvocates will push it forward until it shall become alike\n lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as\nSouth.\u201d That was my sentiment at that time. In connection\nwith it, I said: \u201cWe are now far into the \ufb01fth year since a\npolicy was inaugurated with the avowed object and\ncon\ufb01dent promise of putting an end to slavery agitation.\nUnder the operation of the policy that agitation has not\nonly not ceased, but has constantly augmented.\u201d I now say\nto you here that we are advanced still farther into the sixth\nyear since that policy of Judge Douglas \u2014 that popular\nsovereignty of his \u2014 for quieting the slavery question was\nmade the national policy. Fifteen months more have been\nadded since I uttered that sentiment; and I call upon you\nand all other right-minded men to say whether that \ufb01fteen\nmonths have belied or corroborated my words.\nWhile I am here upon this subject, I cannot but express\ngratitude that this true view of this element of discord\namong us \u2014 as I believe it is \u2014 is attracting more and more\nattention. I do not believe that Governor Seward uttered\nthat sentiment because I had done so before, but because\nhe re\ufb02ected upon this subject and saw the truth of it. Nor\ndo I believe because Governor Seward or I uttered it that\nMr. Hickman of Pennsylvania, in, di\ufb00erent language, since\nthat time, has declared his belief in the utter antagonism\nwhich exists between the principles of liberty and slavery.\nYou see we are multiplying. Now, while I am speaking of\nHickman, let me say, I know but little about him. I have\nnever seen him, and know scarcely anything about the\nman; but I will say this much of him: Of all the anti-\nLecompton Democracy that have been brought to my\n notice, he alone has the true, genuine ring of the metal.\nAnd now, without indorsing anything else he has said, I will\nask this audience to give three cheers for Hickman. [The\naudience \nresponded \nwith \nthree \nrousing \ncheers \nfor\nHickman.]\nAnother point in the copyright essay to which I would ask\nyour attention is rather a feature to be extracted from the\nwhole thing, than from any express declaration of it at any\npoint. It is a general feature of that document, and, indeed,\nof all of Judge Douglas\u2019s discussions of this question, that\nthe Territories of the United States and the States of this\nUnion are exactly alike; that there is no di\ufb00erence between\nthem at all; that the Constitution applies to the Territories\nprecisely as it does to the States; and that the United\nStates Government, under the Constitution, may not do in a\nState what it may not do in a Territory, and what it must do\nin a State it must do in a Territory. Gentlemen, is that a true\nview of the case? It is necessary for this squatter\nsovereignty, but is it true?\nLet us consider. What does it depend upon? It depends\naltogether upon the proposition that the States must,\nwithout the interference of the General Government, do all\nthose things that pertain exclusively to themselves, \u2014 that\nare local in their nature, that have no connection with the\nGeneral Government. After Judge Douglas has established\nthis proposition, which nobody disputes or ever has\ndisputed, he proceeds to assume, without proving it, that\nslavery is one of those little, unimportant, trivial matters\nwhich are of just about as much consequence as the\n question would be to me whether my neighbor should raise\nhorned cattle or plant tobacco; that there is no moral\nquestion about it, but that it is altogether a matter of\ndollars and cents; that when a new Territory is opened for\nsettlement, the \ufb01rst man who goes into it may plant there a\nthing which, like the Canada thistle or some other of those\npests of the soil, cannot be dug out by the millions of men\nwho will come thereafter; that it is one of those little things\nthat is so trivial in its nature that it has nor e\ufb00ect upon\nanybody save the few men who \ufb01rst plant upon the soil;\nthat it is not a thing which in any way a\ufb00ects the family of\ncommunities \ncomposing \nthese \nStates, \nnor \nany \nway\nendangers the General Government. Judge Douglas ignores\naltogether the very well known fact that we have never had\na serious menace to our political existence, except it sprang\nfrom this thing, which he chooses to regard as only upon a\npar with onions and potatoes.\nTurn it, and contemplate it in another view. He says that,\naccording \nto \nhis \npopular \nsovereignty, \nthe \nGeneral\nGovernment may give to the Territories governors, judges,\nmarshals, secretaries, and all the other chief men to govern\nthem, but they, must not touch upon this other question.\nWhy? The question of who shall be governor of a Territory\nfor a year or two, and pass away, without his track being\nleft upon the soil, or an act which he did for good or for evil\nbeing left behind, is a question of vast national magnitude;\nit is so much opposed in its nature to locality that the\nnation itself must decide it: while this other matter of\nplanting slavery upon a soil, \u2014 a thing which, once planted,\n cannot be eradicated by the succeeding millions who have\nas much right there as the \ufb01rst comers, or, if eradicated,\nnot without in\ufb01nite di\ufb00iculty and a long struggle, he\nconsiders the power to prohibit it as one of these little\nlocal, trivial things that the nation ought not to say a word\nabout; that it a\ufb00ects nobody save the few men who are\nthere.\nTake these two things and consider them together,\npresent the question of planting a State with the institution\nof slavery by the side of a question who shall be Governor\nof Kansas for a year or two, and is there a man here, is\nthere a man on earth, who would not say the governor\nquestion is the little one, and the slavery question is the\ngreat one? I ask any honest Democrat if the small, the\nlocal, and the trivial and temporary question is not, Who\nshall be governor? while the durable, the important, and\nthe mischievous one is, Shall this soil be planted with\nslavery?\nThis is an idea, I suppose, which has arisen in Judge\nDouglas\u2019s mind from his peculiar structure. I suppose the\ninstitution of slavery really looks small to him. He is so put\nup by nature that a lash upon his back would hurt him, but\na lash upon anybody else\u2019s back does not hurt him. That is\nthe build of the man, and consequently he looks upon the\nmatter of slavery in this unimportant light.\nJudge \nDouglas \nought \nto \nremember, \nwhen \nhe \nis\nendeavoring to force this policy upon the American people,\nthat while he is put up in that way, a good many are not. He\nought to remember that there was once in this country a\n man by the name of Thomas Je\ufb00erson, supposed to be a\nDemocrat, \u2014 a man whose principles and policy are not\nvery prevalent amongst Democrats to-day, it is true; but\nthat man did not take exactly this view of the insigni\ufb01cance\nof the element of slavery which our friend judge Douglas\ndoes. In contemplation of this thing, we all know he was led\nto exclaim, \u201cI tremble for my country when I remember\nthat God is just!\u201d We know how he looked upon it when he\nthus expressed himself. There was danger to this country,\n\u2014 danger of the avenging justice of God, in that little\nunimportant \npopular \nsovereignty \nquestion \nof \njudge\nDouglas. He supposed there was a question of God\u2019s\neternal justice wrapped up in the enslaving of any race of\nmen, or any man, and that those who did so braved the arm\nof Jehovah; that when a nation thus dared the Almighty,\nevery friend of that nation had cause to dread his wrath.\nChoose ye between Je\ufb00erson and Douglas as to what is the\ntrue view of this element among us.\nThere is another little di\ufb00iculty about this matter of\ntreating the Territories and States alike in all things, to\nwhich I ask your attention, and I shall leave this branch of\nthe case. If there is no di\ufb00erence between them, why not\nmake the Territories States at once? What is the reason\nthat Kansas was not \ufb01t to come into the Union when it was\norganized into a Territory, in Judge Douglas\u2019s view? Can\nany of you tell any reason why it should not have come into\nthe Union at once? They are \ufb01t, as he thinks, to decide\nupon the slavery question, \u2014 the largest and most\nimportant with which they could possibly deal: what could\n they do by coming into the Union that they are not \ufb01t to do,\naccording to his view, by staying out of it? Oh, they are not\n\ufb01t to sit in Congress and decide upon the rates of postage,\nor questions of ad valorem or speci\ufb01c duties on foreign\ngoods, or live-oak timber contracts, they are not \ufb01t to\ndecide these vastly important matters, which are national\nin their import, but they are \ufb01t, \u201cfrom the jump,\u201d to decide\nthis little negro question. But, gentlemen, the case is too\nplain; I occupy too much time on this head, and I pass on.\nNear the close of the copyright essay, the judge, I think,\ncomes very near kicking his own fat into the \ufb01re. I did not\nthink, when I commenced these remarks, that I would read\nthat article, but I now believe I will:\n\u201cThis exposition of the history of these measures shows\nconclusively that the authors of the Compromise measures\nof  and of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of , as well as\nthe members of the Continental Congress of ., and the\nfounders of our system of government subsequent to the\nRevolution, regarded the people of the Territories and\nColonies as political communities which were entitled to a\nfree and exclusive power of legislation in their provisional\nlegislatures, where their representation could alone be\npreserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity.\u201d\nWhen the judge saw that putting in the word \u201cslavery\u201d\nwould contradict his own history, he put in what he knew\nwould pass synonymous with it, \u201cinternal polity.\u201d Whenever\nwe \ufb01nd that in one of his speeches, the substitute is used in\nthis manner; and I can tell you the reason. It would be too\nbald a contradiction to say slavery; but \u201cinternal polity\u201d is a\n general phrase, which would pass in some quarters, and\nwhich he hopes will pass with the reading community for\nthe same thing.\n\u201cThis right pertains to the people collectively, as a law-\nabiding and peaceful community, and not in the isolated\nindividuals who may wander upon the public domain in\nviolation of the law. It can only be exercised where there\nare inhabitants su\ufb00icient to constitute a government, and\ncapable of performing its various functions and duties, \u2014 a\nfact to be ascertained and determined by\u201d who do you\nthink? Judge Douglas says \u201cby Congress!\u201d \u201cWhether the\nnumber shall be \ufb01xed at ten, \ufb01fteen or twenty thousand\ninhabitants, does not a\ufb00ect the principle.\u201d\nNow, I have only a few comments to make. Popular\nsovereignty, by his own words, does not pertain to the few\npersons who wander upon the public domain in violation of\nlaw. We have his words for that. When it does pertain to\nthem, is when they are su\ufb00icient to be formed into an\norganized political community, and he \ufb01xes the minimum\nfor that at ten thousand, and the maximum at twenty\nthousand. Now, I would like to know what is to be done\nwith the nine thousand? Are they all to be treated, until\nthey are large enough to be organized into a political\ncommunity, as wanderers upon the public land, in violation\nof law? And if so treated and driven out, at what point of\ntime would there ever be ten thousand? If they were not\ndriven out, but remained there as trespassers upon the\npublic land in violation of the law, can they establish\nslavery there? No; the judge says popular sovereignty don\u2019t\n pertain to them then. Can they exclude it then? No; popular\nsovereignty don\u2019t pertain to them then. I would like to\nknow, in the case covered by the essay, what condition the\npeople of the Territory are in before they reach the number\nof ten thousand?\nBut the main point I wish to ask attention to is, that the\nquestion as to when they shall have reached a su\ufb00icient\nnumber to be formed into a regular organized community is\nto be decided \u201cby Congress.\u201d Judge Douglas says so. Well,\ngentlemen, that is about all we want. No, that is all the\nSoutherners want. That is what all those who are for\nslavery want. They do not want Congress to prohibit\nslavery from coming into the new Territories, and they do\nnot want popular sovereignty to hinder it; and as Congress\nis to say when they are ready to be organized, all that the\nSouth has to do is to get Congress to hold o\ufb00. Let Congress\nhold o\ufb00 until they are ready to be admitted as a State, and\nthe South has all it wants in taking slavery into and\nplanting it in all the Territories that we now have or\nhereafter may have. In a word, the whole thing, at a dash of\nthe pen, is at last put in the power of Congress; for if they\ndo not have this popular sovereignty until Congress\norganizes them, I ask if it at last does not come from\nCongress? If, at last, it amounts to anything at all, Congress\ngives it to them. I submit this rather for your re\ufb02ection\nthan for comment. After all that is said, at last, by a dash of\nthe pen, everything that has gone before is undone, and he\nputs the whole question under the control of Congress.\nAfter \ufb01ghting through more than three hours, if you\n undertake to read it, he at last places the whole matter\nunder the control of that power which he has been\ncontending against, and arrives at a result directly contrary\nto what he had been laboring to do. He at last leaves the\nwhole matter to the control of Congress.\nThere are two main objects, as I understand it, of this\nHarper\u2019s Magazine essay. One was to show, if possible, that\nthe men of our Revolutionary times were in favor of his\npopular sovereignty, and the other was to show that the\nDred Scott decision had not entirely squelched out this\npopular sovereignty. I do not propose, in regard to this\nargument drawn from the history of former times, to enter\ninto a detailed examination of the historical statements he\nhas made. I have the impression that they are inaccurate in\na great many instances, \u2014 sometimes in positive statement,\nbut very much more inaccurate by the suppression of\nstatements that really belong to the history. But I do not\npropose to a\ufb00irm that this is so to any very great extent, or\nto enter into a very minute examination of his historical\nstatements. I avoid doing so upon this principle, \u2014 that if it\nwere important for me to pass out of this lot in the least\nperiod of time possible, and I came to that fence, and saw\nby a calculation of my known strength and agility that I\ncould clear it at a bound, it would be folly for me to stop\nand consider whether I could or not crawl through a crack.\nSo I say of the whole history contained in his essay where\nhe endeavored to link the men of the Revolution to popular\nsovereignty. It only requires an e\ufb00ort to leap out of it, a\nsingle bound to be entirely successful. If you read it over,\n you will \ufb01nd that he quotes here and there from documents\nof the Revolutionary times, tending to show that the people\nof the colonies were desirous of regulating their own\nconcerns in their own way, that the British Government\nshould not interfere; that at one time they struggled with\nthe British Government to be permitted to exclude the\nAfrican slave trade, \u2014 if not directly, to be permitted to\nexclude it indirectly, by taxation su\ufb00icient to discourage\nand destroy it. From these and many things of this sort,\njudge Douglas argues that they were in favor of the people\nof our own Territories excluding slavery if they wanted to,\nor planting it there if they wanted to, doing just as they\npleased from the time they settled upon the Territory. Now,\nhowever his history may apply and whatever of his\nargument there may be that is sound and accurate or\nunsound and inaccurate, if we can \ufb01nd out what these men\ndid themselves do upon this very question of slavery in the\nTerritories, does it not end the whole thing? If, after all this\nlabor and e\ufb00ort to show that the men of the Revolution\nwere in favor of his popular sovereignty and his mode of\ndealing with slavery in the Territories, we can show that\nthese very men took hold of that subject, and dealt with it,\nwe can see for ourselves how they dealt with it. It is not a\nmatter of argument or inference, but we know what they\nthought about it.\nIt is precisely upon that part of the history of the country\nthat one important omission is made by Judge Douglas. He\nselects parts of the history of the United States upon the\nsubject of slavery, and treats it as the whole, omitting from\n his historical sketch the legislation of Congress in regard to\nthe \nadmission \nof \nMissouri, \nby \nwhich \nthe \nMissouri\nCompromise was established and slavery excluded from a\ncountry half as large as the present United States. All this\nis left out of his history, and in nowise alluded to by him, so\nfar as I can remember, save once, when he makes a remark,\nthat upon his principle the Supreme Court were authorized\nto pronounce a decision that the act called the Missouri\nCompromise was unconstitutional. All that history has been\nleft out. But this part of the history of the country was not\nmade by the men of the Revolution.\nThere was another part of our political history, made by\nthe very men who were the actors in the Revolution, which\nhas taken the name of the Ordinance of \u2018. Let me bring\nthat history to your attention. In , I believe, this same\nMr. Je\ufb00erson drew up an ordinance for the government of\nthe country upon which we now stand, or, rather, a frame\nor draft of an ordinance for the government of this country,\nhere in Ohio, our neighbors in Indiana, us who live in\nIllinois, our neighbors in Wisconsin and Michigan. In that\nordinance, drawn up not only for the government of that\nTerritory, but for the Territories south of the Ohio River, Mr.\nJe\ufb00erson expressly provided for the prohibition of slavery.\nJudge Douglas says, and perhaps is right, that that\nprovision was lost from that ordinance. I believe that is\ntrue. When the vote was taken upon it, a majority of all\npresent in the Congress of the Confederation voted for it;\nbut there were so many absentees that those voting for it\ndid not make the clear majority necessary, and it was lost.\n But \nthree \nyears \nafter \nthat, \nthe \nCongress \nof \nthe\nConfederation were together again, and they adopted a\nnew ordinance for the government of this Northwest\nTerritory, not contemplating territory south of the river, for\nthe States owning that territory had hitherto refrained from\ngiving it to the General Government; hence they made the\nordinance to apply only to what the Government owned. In\nfact, the provision excluding slavery was inserted aside,\npassed unanimously, or at any rate it passed and became a\npart of the law of the land. Under that ordinance we live.\nFirst here in Ohio you were a Territory; then an enabling\nact was passed, authorizing you to form a constitution and\nState Government, provided it was republican and not in\ncon\ufb02ict with the Ordinance of \u2018. When you framed your\nconstitution and presented it for admission, I think you will\n\ufb01nd the legislation upon the subject will show that,\nwhereas you had formed a constitution that was republican,\nand not in con\ufb02ict with the Ordinance of \u2018, therefore you\nwere admitted upon equal footing with the original States.\nThe same process in a few years was gone through with in\nIndiana, and so with Illinois, and the same substantially\nwith Michigan and Wisconsin.\nNot only did that Ordinance prevail, but it was constantly\nlooked to whenever a step was taken by a new Territory to\nbecome a State. Congress always turned their attention to\nit, and in all their movements upon this subject they traced\ntheir course by that Ordinance of \u2018. When they admitted\nnew States, they advertised them of this Ordinance, as a\npart of the legislation of the country. They did so because\n they had traced the Ordinance of \u2018 throughout the\nhistory of this country. Begin with the men of the\nRevolution, and go down for sixty entire years, and until the\nlast scrap of that Territory comes into the Union in the form\nof the State of Wisconsin, everything was made to conform\nwith the Ordinance of \u2018, excluding slavery from that vast\nextent of country.\nI omitted to mention in the right place that the\nConstitution of the United States was in process of being\nframed when that Ordinance was made by the Congress of\nthe Confederation; and one of the \ufb01rst Acts of Congress\nitself, under the new Constitution itself, was to give force to\nthat Ordinance by putting power to carry it out in the\nhands of the new o\ufb00icers under the Constitution, in the\nplace of the old ones, who had been legislated out of\nexistence by the change in the Government from the\nConfederation to the Constitution. Not only so, but I believe\nIndiana once or twice, if not Ohio, petitioned the General\nGovernment for the privilege of suspending that provision\nand allowing them to have slaves. A report made by Mr.\nRandolph, of Virginia, himself a slaveholder, was directly\nagainst it, and the action was to refuse them the privilege\nof violating the Ordinance of \u2018.\nThis period of history, which I have run over brie\ufb02y, is, I\npresume, as familiar to most of this assembly as any other\npart of the history of our country. I suppose that few of my\nhearers are not as familiar with that part of history as I am,\nand I only mention it to recall your attention to it at this\ntime. And hence I ask how extraordinary a thing it is that a\n man who has occupied a position upon the \ufb02oor of the\nSenate of the United States, who is now in his third term,\nand who looks to see the government of this whole country\nfall into his own hands, pretending to give a truthful and\naccurate history o the slavery question in this country,\nshould so entirely ignore the whole of that portion of our\nhistory \u2014 the most important of all. Is it not a most\nextraordinary spectacle that a man should stand up and ask\nfor any con\ufb01dence in his statements who sets out as he\ndoes with portions of history, calling upon the people to\nbelieve that it is a true and fair representation, when the\nleading part and controlling feature of the whole history is\ncarefully suppressed?\nBut the mere leaving out is not the most remarkable\nfeature of this most remarkable essay. His proposition is to\nestablish that the leading men of the Revolution were for\nhis great principle of nonintervention by the government in\nthe question of slavery in the Territories, while history\nshows that they decided, in the cases actually brought\nbefore them, in exactly the contrary way, and he knows it.\nNot only did they so decide at that time, but they stuck to it\nduring sixty years, through thick and thin, as long as there\nwas one of the Revolutionary heroes upon the stage of\npolitical action. Through their whole course, from \ufb01rst to\nlast, they clung to freedom. And now he asks the\ncommunity to believe that the men of the Revolution were\nin favor of his great principle, when we have the naked\nhistory that they themselves dealt with this very subject\nmatter of his principle, and utterly repudiated his principle,\n acting upon a precisely contrary ground. It is as impudent\nand absurd as if a prosecuting attorney should stand up\nbefore a jury and ask them to convict A as the murderer of\nB, while B was walking alive before them.\nI say, again, if judge Douglas asserts that the men of the\nRevolution acted upon principles by which, to be consistent\nwith themselves, they ought to have adopted his popular\nsovereignty, then, upon a consideration of his own\nargument, he had a right to make you believe that they\nunderstood the principles of government, but misapplied\nthem, that he has arisen to enlighten the world as to the\njust application of this principle. He has a right to try to\npersuade you that he understands their principles better\nthan they did, and, therefore, he will apply them now, not\nas they did, but as they ought to have done. He has a right\nto go before the community and try to convince them of\nthis, but he has no right to attempt to impose upon any one\nthe belief that these men themselves approved of his great\nprinciple. There are two ways of establishing a proposition.\nOne is by trying to demonstrate it upon reason, and the\nother is, to show that great men in former times have\nthought so and so, and thus to pass it by the weight of pure\nauthority. Now, if Judge Douglas will demonstrate somehow\nthat this is popular sovereignty, \u2014 the right of one man to\nmake a slave of another, without any right in that other or\nany one else to object, \u2014 demonstrate it as Euclid\ndemonstrated propositions, \u2014 there is no objection. But\nwhen he comes forward, seeking to carry a principle by\nbringing to it the authority of men who themselves utterly\n repudiate that principle, I ask that he shall not be\npermitted to do it.\nI see, in the judge\u2019s speech here, a short sentence in\nthese words: \u201cOur fathers, when they formed this\ngovernment under which we live, understood this question\njust as well, and even better than, we do now.\u201d That is true;\nI stick to that. I will stand by Judge Douglas in that to the\nbitter end. And now, Judge Douglas, come and stand by me,\nand truthfully show how they acted, understanding it better\nthan we do. All I ask of you, Judge Douglas, is to stick to the\nproposition that the men of the Revolution understood this\nsubject better than we do now, and with that better\nunderstanding they acted better than you are trying to act\nnow.\nI wish to say something now in regard to the Dred Scott\ndecision, as dealt with by Judge Douglas. In that\n\u201cmemorable debate\u201d between Judge Douglas and myself,\nlast year, the judge thought \ufb01t to commence a process of\ncatechising me, and at Freeport I answered his questions,\nand propounded some to him. Among others propounded to\nhim was one that I have here now. The substance, as I\nremember it, is, \u201cCan the people of a United States\nTerritory, under the Dred Scott decision, in any lawful way,\nagainst the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude\nslavery from its limits, prior to the formation of a State\nconstitution?\u201d He answered that they could lawfully\nexclude slavery from the United States Territories,\nnotwithstanding the Dred Scot decision. There was\n something about that answer that has probably been a\ntrouble to the judge ever since.\nThe Dred Scott decision expressly gives every citizen of\nthe United States a right to carry his slaves into the United\nStates Territories. And now there was some inconsistency\nin saying that the decision was right, and saying, too, that\nthe people of the Territory could lawfully drive slavery out\nagain. When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter,\nwas cleared away from it, all the cha\ufb00 was fanned out of it,\nit was a bare absurdity, \u2014 no less than that a thing may be\nlawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be.\nClear it of all the verbiage, and that is the naked truth of\nhis proposition, \u2014 that a thing may be lawfully driven from\nthe place where it has a lawful right to stay. Well, it was\nbecause the judge could n\u2019t help seeing this that he has had\nso much trouble with it; and what I want to ask your\nespecial attention to, just now, is to remind you, if you have\nnot noticed the fact, that the judge does not any longer say\nthat the people can exclude slavery. He does not say so in\nthe copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he\nmade here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to\nthe Senate he has never said, as he did at Freeport, that\nthe people of the Territories can exclude slavery. He desires\nthat you, who wish the Territories to remain free, should\nbelieve that he stands by that position; but he does not say\nit himself. He escapes to some extent the absurd position I\nhave stated, by changing his language entirely. What he\nsays now is something di\ufb00erent in language, and we will\nconsider whether it is not di\ufb00erent in sense too. It is now\n that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the Constitution\nunder that decision, does not carry slavery into the\nTerritories beyond the power of the people of the\nTerritories to control it as other property. He does not say\nthe people can drive it out, but they can control it as other\nproperty. The language is di\ufb00erent; we should consider\nwhether the sense is di\ufb00erent. Driving a horse out of this\nlot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about; it is\nputting him on the other side of the fence. Or it might be a\nsort of exclusion of him from the lot if you were to kill him\nand let the worms devour him; but neither of these things\nis the same as \u201ccontrolling him as other property.\u201d That\nwould be to feed him, to pamper him, to ride him, to use\nand abuse him, to make the most money out of him, \u201cas\nother property\u201d; but, please you, what do the men who are\nin favor of slavery want more than this? What do they really\nwant, other than that slavery, being in the Territories, shall\nbe controlled as other property? If they want anything else,\nI do not comprehend it. I ask your attention to this, \ufb01rst, for\nthe purpose of pointing out the change of ground the judge\nhas made; and, in the second place, the importance of the\nchange, \u2014 that that change is not such as to give you\ngentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power to\nexclude the institution or drive it out at all. I know the\njudge \nsometimes \nsquints \nat \nthe \nargument \nthat \nin\ncontrolling it as other property by unfriendly legislation\nthey may control it to death; as you might, in the case of a\nhorse, perhaps, feed him so lightly and ride him so much\nthat he would die. But when you come to legislative control,\n there is something more to be attended to. I have no doubt,\nmyself, that if the Territories should undertake to control\nslave property as other property that is, control it in such a\nway that it would be the most valuable as property, and\nmake it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens as\nproperty, really deal with it as property, \u2014 the Supreme\nCourt of the United States will say, \u201cGod speed you, and\namen.\u201d But I undertake to give the opinion, at least, that if\nthe Territories attempt by any direct legislation to drive the\nman with his slave out of the Territory, or to decide that his\nslave is free because of his being taken in there, or to tax\nhim to such an extent that he cannot keep him there, the\nSupreme \nCourt \nwill \nunhesitatingly \ndecide \nall \nsuch\nlegislation unconstitutional, as long as that Supreme Court\nis constructed as the Dred Scott Supreme Court is. The \ufb01rst\ntwo things they have already decided, except that there is a\nlittle quibble among lawyers between the words \u201cdicta\u201d and\n\u201cdecision.\u201d They have already decided a negro cannot be\nmade free by Territorial legislation.\nWhat is the Dred Scott decision? Judge Douglas labors to\nshow that it is one thing, while I think it is altogether\ndi\ufb00erent. It is a long opinion, but it is all embodied in this\nshort statement: \u201cThe Constitution of the United States\nforbids Congress to deprive a man of his property, without\ndue process of law; the right of property in slaves is\ndistinctly and expressly a\ufb00irmed in that Constitution:\ntherefore, if Congress shall undertake to say that a man\u2019s\nslave is no longer his slave when he crosses a certain line\ninto a Territory, that is depriving him of his property\n without due process of law, and is unconstitutional.\u201d There\nis the whole Dred Scott decision. They add that if Congress\ncannot do so itself, Congress cannot confer any power to do\nso; and hence any e\ufb00ort by the Territorial Legislature to do\neither of these things is absolutely decided against. It is a\nforegone conclusion by that court.\nNow, as to this indirect mode by \u201cunfriendly legislation,\u201d\nall lawyers here will readily understand that such a\nproposition cannot be tolerated for a moment, because a\nlegislature cannot indirectly do that which it cannot\naccomplish directly. Then I say any legislation to control\nthis property, as property, for its bene\ufb01t as property, would\nbe hailed by this Dred Scott Supreme Court, and fully\nsustained; but any legislation driving slave property out, or\ndestroying it as property, directly or indirectly, will most\nassuredly, by that court, be held unconstitutional.\nJudge Douglas says if the Constitution carries slavery\ninto the Territories, beyond the power of the people of the\nTerritories to control it as other property; then it follows\nlogically that every one who swears to support the\nConstitution of the United States must give that support to\nthat property which it needs. And, if the Constitution\ncarries slavery into the Territories, beyond the power of the\npeople, to control it as other property, then it also carries it\ninto the States, because the Constitution is the supreme\nlaw of the land. Now, gentlemen, if it were not for my\nexcessive modesty, I would say that I told that very thing to\nJudge Douglas quite a year ago. This argument is here in\nprint, and if it were not for my modesty, as I said, I might\n call your attention to it. If you read it, you will \ufb01nd that I\nnot only made that argument, but made it better than he\nhas made it since.\nThere is, however, this di\ufb00erence: I say now, and said\nthen, there is no sort of question that the Supreme Court\nhas decided that it is the right of the slave holder to take\nhis slave and hold him in the Territory; and saying this,\njudge Douglas himself admits the conclusion. He says if\nthat is so, this consequence will follow; and because this\nconsequence would follow, his argument is, the decision\ncannot, therefore, be that way,\u2014 \u201cthat would spoil my\npopular sovereignty; and it cannot be possible that this\ngreat \nprinciple \nhas \nbeen \nsquelched \nout \nin \nthis\nextraordinary way. It might be, if it were not for the\nextraordinary consequences of spoiling my humbug.\u201d\nAnother feature of the judge\u2019s argument about the Dred\nScott case is, an e\ufb00ort to show that that decision deals\naltogether \nin \ndeclarations \nof \nnegatives; \nthat \nthe\nConstitution does not a\ufb00irm anything as expounded by the\nDred Scott decision, but it only declares a want of power a\ntotal absence of power, in reference to the Territories. It\nseems to be his purpose to make the whole of that decision\nto result in a mere negative declaration of a want of power\nin Congress to do anything in relation to this matter in the\nTerritories. I know the opinion of the Judges states that\nthere is a total absence of power; but that is, unfortunately;\nnot all it states: for the judges add that the right of\nproperty in a slave is distinctly and expressly a\ufb00irmed in\nthe Constitution. It does not stop at saying that the right of\n property in a slave is recognized in the Constitution, is\ndeclared to exist somewhere in the Constitution, but says it\nis a\ufb00irmed in the Constitution. Its language is equivalent to\nsaying that it is embodied and so woven in that instrument\nthat \nit \ncannot \nbe \ndetached \nwithout \nbreaking \nthe\nConstitution itself. In a word, it is part of the Constitution.\nDouglas is singularly unfortunate in his e\ufb00ort to make\nout that decision to be altogether negative, when the\nexpress language at the vital part is that this is distinctly\na\ufb00irmed in the Constitution. I think myself, and I repeat it\nhere, that this decision does not merely carry slavery into\nthe Territories, but by its logical conclusion it carries it into\nthe States in which we live. One provision of that\nConstitution is, that it shall be the supreme law of the land,\n\u2014 I do not quote the language, \u2014 any constitution or law of\nany State to the contrary notwithstanding. This Dred Scott\ndecision says that the right of property in a slave is\na\ufb00irmed in that Constitution which is the supreme law of\nthe land, any State constitution or law notwithstanding.\nThen I say that to destroy a thing which is distinctly\na\ufb00irmed and supported by the supreme law of the land,\neven by a State constitution or law, is a violation of that\nsupreme law, and there is no escape from it. In my\njudgment there is no avoiding that result, save that the\nAmerican people shall see that constitutions are better\nconstrued than our Constitution is construed in that\ndecision. They must take care that it is more faithfully and\ntruly carried out than it is there expounded.\n I must hasten to a conclusion. Near the beginning of my\nremarks I said that this insidious Douglas popular\nsovereignty is the measure that now threatens the purpose\nof the Republican party to prevent slavery from being\nnationalized in the United States. I propose to ask your\nattention for a little while to some propositions in\na\ufb00irmance of that statement. Take it just as it stands, and\napply it as a principle; extend and apply that principle\nelsewhere; and consider where it will lead you. I now put\nthis proposition, that Judge Douglas\u2019s popular sovereignty\napplied will reopen the African slave trade; and I will\ndemonstrate it by any variety of ways in which you can turn\nthe subject or look at it.\nThe Judge says that the people of the Territories have the\nright, by his principle, to have slaves, if they want them.\nThen I say that the people in Georgia have the right to buy\nslaves in Africa, if they want them; and I defy any man on\nearth to show any distinction between the two things, \u2014 to\nshow that the one is either more wicked or more unlawful;\nto show, on original principles, that one is better or worse\nthan the other; or to show, by the Constitution, that one\ndi\ufb00ers a whit from the other. He will tell me, doubtless, that\nthere is no constitutional provision against people taking\nslaves into the new Territories, and I tell him that there is\nequally no constitutional provision against buying slaves in\nAfrica. He will tell you that a people, in the exercise of\npopular sovereignty, ought to do as they please about that\nthing, and have slaves if they want them; and I tell you that\nthe people of Georgia are as much entitled to popular\n sovereignty and to buy slaves in Africa, if they want them,\nas the people of the Territory are to have slaves if they\nwant them. I ask any man, dealing honestly with himself, to\npoint out a distinction.\nI have recently seen a letter of Judge Douglas\u2019s in which,\nwithout stating that to be the object, he doubtless\nendeavors to make a distinction between the two. He says\nhe is unalterably opposed to the repeal of the laws against\nthe African slave trade. And why? He then seeks to give a\nreason that would not apply to his popular sovereignty in\nthe Territories. What is that reason? \u201cThe abolition of the\nAfrican slave trade is a compromise of the Constitution!\u201d I\ndeny it. There is no truth in the proposition that the\nabolition of the African slave trade is a compromise of the\nConstitution. No man can put his \ufb01nger on anything in the\nConstitution, or on the line of history, which shows it. It is a\nmere barren assertion, made simply for the purpose of\ngetting up a distinction between the revival of the African\nslave trade and his \u201cgreat principle.\u201d\nAt the time the Constitution of the United States was\nadopted, it was expected that the slave trade would be\nabolished. I should assert and insist upon that, if judge\nDouglas denied it. But I know that it was equally expected\nthat slavery would be excluded from the Territories, and I\ncan show by history that in regard to these two things\npublic opinion was exactly alike, while in regard to positive\naction, there was more done in the Ordinance of \u2018 to\nresist the spread of slavery than was ever done to abolish\nthe foreign slave trade. Lest I be misunderstood, I say\n again that at the time of the formation of the Constitution,\npublic expectation was that the slave trade would be\nabolished, but no more so than the spread of slavery in the\nTerritories should be restrained. They stand alike, except\nthat in the Ordinance of \u2018 there was a mark left by public\nopinion, showing that it was more committed against the\nspread of slavery in the Territories than against the foreign\nslave trade.\nCompromise! What word of compromise was there about\nit? Why, the public sense was then in favor of the abolition\nof the slave trade; but there was at the time a very great\ncommercial interest involved in it, and extensive capital in\nthat branch of trade. There were doubtless the incipient\nstages of improvement in the South in the way of farming,\ndependent on the slave trade, and they made a proposition\nto Congress to abolish the trade after allowing it twenty\nyears, \u2014 a su\ufb00icient time for the capital and commerce\nengaged in it to be transferred to other channel. They made\nno provision that it should be abolished in twenty years; I\ndo not doubt that they expected it would be, but they made\nno bargain about it. The public sentiment left no doubt in\nthe minds of any that it would be done away. I repeat, there\nis nothing in the history of those times in favor of that\nmatter being a compromise of the constitution. It was the\npublic expectation at the time, manifested in a thousand\nways, that the spread of slavery should also be restricted.\nThen I say, if this principle is established, that there is no\nwrong in slavery, and whoever wants it has a right to have\nit, is a matter of dollars and cents, a sort of question as to\n how they shall deal with brutes, that between us and the\nnegro here there is no sort of question, but that at the\nSouth the question is between the negro and the crocodile,\nthat is all, it is a mere matter of policy, there is a perfect\nright, according to interest, to do just as you please, \u2014\nwhen this is done, where this doctrine prevails, the miners\nand sappers will have formed public opinion for the slave\ntrade. They will be ready for Je\ufb00. Davis and Stephens and\nother leaders of that company to sound the bugle for the\nrevival of the slave trade, for the second Dred Scott\ndecision, for the \ufb02ood of slavery to be poured over the free\nStates, while we shall be here tied down and helpless and\nrun over like sheep.\nIt is to be a part and parcel of this same idea to say to\nmen who want to adhere to the Democratic party, who have\nalways belonged to that party, and are only looking about\nfor some excuse to stick to it, but nevertheless hate slavery,\nthat Douglas\u2019s popular sovereignty is as good a way as any\nto oppose slavery. They allow themselves to be persuaded\neasily, in accordance with their previous dispositions, into\nthis belief, that it is about as good a way of opposing\nslavery as any, and we can do that without straining our old\nparty ties or breaking up old political associations. We can\ndo so without being called negro-worshipers. We can do\nthat without being subjected to the jibes and sneers that\nare so readily thrown out in place of argument where no\nargument can be found. So let us stick to this popular\nsovereignty, \u2014 this insidious popular sovereignty.\n Now let me call your attention to one thing that has\nreally happened, which shows this gradual and steady\ndebauching of public opinion, this course of preparation for\nthe revival of the slave trade, for the Territorial slave code,\nand the new Dred Scott decision that is to carry slavery\ninto the Free States. Did you ever, \ufb01ve years ago, hear of\nanybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in\nthe Declaration of National Independence; that it does not\nmean negroes at all; and when \u201call men\u201d were spoken of,\nnegroes were not included?\nI am satis\ufb01ed that \ufb01ve years ago that proposition was not\nput upon paper by any living being anywhere. I have been\nunable at any time to \ufb01nd a man in an audience who would\ndeclare that he had ever known of anybody saying so \ufb01ve\nyears ago. But last year there was not a Douglas popular\nsovereign in Illinois who did not say it. Is there one in Ohio\nbut declares his \ufb01rm belief that the Declaration of\nIndependence did not mean negroes at all? I do not know\nhow this is; I have not been here much; but I presume you\nare very much alike everywhere. Then I suppose that all\nnow \nexpress \nthe \nbelief \nthat \nthe \nDeclaration \nof\nIndependence never did mean negroes. I call upon one of\nthem to say that he said it \ufb01ve years ago.\nIf you think that now, and did not think it then, the next\nthing that strikes me is to remark that there has been a\nchange wrought in you, \u2014 and a very signi\ufb01cant change it\nis, being no less than changing the negro, in your\nestimation, from the rank of a man to that of a brute. They\nare taking him down and placing him, when spoken of,\n among reptiles and crocodiles, as Judge Douglas himself\nexpresses it.\nIs not this change wrought in your minds a very\nimportant change? Public opinion in this country is\neverything. In a nation like ours, this popular sovereignty\nand squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in\nthe public mind to the extent I have stated. There is no man\nin this crowd who can contradict it.\nNow, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, as much as\nanybody, I ask you to note that fact, and the like of which is\nto follow, to be plastered on, layer after layer, until very\nsoon you are prepared to deal with the negro every where\nas with the brute. If public sentiment has not been\ndebauched already to this point, a new turn of the screw in\nthat direction is all that is wanting; and this is constantly\nbeing done by the teachers of this insidious popular\nsovereignty. You need but one or two turns further, until\nyour minds, now ripening under these teachings, will be\nready for all these things, and you will receive and support,\nor submit to, the slave trade, revived with all its horrors, a\nslave code enforced in our Territories, and a new Dred\nScott decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the\nfree North. This, I must say, is but carrying out those words\nprophetically spoken by Mr. Clay, \u2014 many, many years ago,\n\u2014 I believe more than thirty years, when he told an\naudience that if they would repress all tendencies to liberty\nand ultimate emancipation they must go back to the era of\nour independence, and muzzle the cannon which thundered\nits annual joyous return on the Fourth of July; they must\n blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate\nthe human soul, and eradicate the love of liberty: but until\nthey did these things, and others eloquently enumerated by\nhim, they could not repress all tendencies to ultimate\nemancipation.\nI ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree\nthese popular sovereigns are at this work: blowing out the\nmoral lights around us; teaching that the negro is no longer\na man, but a brute; that the Declaration has nothing to do\nwith him; that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile;\nthat man, with body and soul, is a matter of dollars and\ncents. I suggest to this portion of the Ohio Republicans, or\nDemocrats, \nif \nthere \nbe \nany \npresent, \nthe \nserious\nconsideration of this fact that there is now going on among\nyou a steady process of debauching public opinion on this\nsubject. With this, my friends, I bid you adieu.\n      H A   I\n I\nA I \nHI\n       \n      \n   \nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS OF the State of Ohio: This is the \ufb01rst\ntime in my life that I have appeared before an audience in\nso great a city as this: I therefore \u2014 though I am no longer\na young man \u2014 make this appearance under some degree\nof embarrassment. But I have found that when one is\nembarrassed, usually the shortest way to get through with\nit is to quit talking or thinking about it, and go at something\nelse.\nI understand that you have had recently with you my\nvery distinguished friend Judge Douglas, of Illinois; and I\nunderstand, without having had an opportunity (not greatly\nsought, to be sure) of seeing a report of the speech that he\nmade here, that he did me the honor to mention my humble\nname. I suppose that he did so for the purpose of making\nsome objection to some sentiment at some time expressed\nby me. I should expect, it is true, that judge Douglas had\nreminded you, or informed you, if you had never before\nheard it, that I had once in my life declared it as my opinion\nthat this government cannot endure permanently, half slave\nand half free; that a house divided against itself cannot\nstand, and, as I had expressed it, I did not expect the house\nto fall, that I did not expect the Union to be dissolved, but\nthat I did expect that it would cease to be divided, that it\n would become all one thing, or all the other; that either the\nopponents of slavery would arrest the further spread of it,\nand place it where the public mind would rest in the belief\nthat it was in the course of ultimate extinction, or the\nfriends of slavery will push it forward until it becomes alike\nlawful in all the States, old or new, free as well as slave. I\ndid, \ufb01fteen months ago, express that opinion, and upon\nmany occasions Judge Douglas has denounced it, and has\ngreatly, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresented my\npurpose in the expression of that opinion.\nI presume, without having seen a report of his speech,\nthat he did so here. I presume that he alluded also to that\nopinion, in di\ufb00erent language, having been expressed at a\nsubsequent time by Governor Seward of New York, and that\nhe took the two in a lump and denounced them; that he\ntried to point out that there was something couched in this\nopinion which led to the making of an entire uniformity of\nthe local institutions of the various States of the Union, in\nutter disregard of the di\ufb00erent States, which in their nature\nwould seem to require a variety of institutions and a variety\nof laws, conforming to the di\ufb00erences in the nature of the\ndi\ufb00erent States.\nNot only so: I presume he insisted that this was a\ndeclaration of war between the free and slave States, that it\nwas the sounding to the onset of continual war between the\ndi\ufb00erent States, the slave and free States.\nThis charge, in this form, was made by Judge Douglas on,\nI believe, the th of July, , in Chicago, in my hearing.\nOn the next evening, I made some reply to it. I informed\n him that many of the inferences he drew from that\nexpression of mine were altogether foreign to any purpose\nentertained by me, and in so far as he should ascribe these\ninferences to me, as my purpose, he was entirely mistaken;\nand in so far as he might argue that, whatever might be my\npurpose, actions conforming to my views would lead to\nthese results, he might argue and establish if he could; but,\nso far as purposes were concerned, he was totally mistaken\nas to me.\nWhen I made that reply to him, I told him, on the\nquestion of declaring war between the di\ufb00erent States of\nthe Union, that I had not said that I did not expect any\npeace upon this question until slavery was exterminated;\nthat I had only said I expected peace when that institution\nwas put where the public mind should rest in the belief that\nit was in course of ultimate extinction; that I believed, from\nthe organization of our government until a very recent\nperiod of time, the institution had been placed and\ncontinued upon such a basis; that we had had comparative\npeace upon that question through a portion of that period\nof time, only because the public mind rested in that belief\nin regard to it, and that when we returned to that position\nin relation to that matter, I supposed we should again have\npeace as we previously had. I assured him, as I now, assure\nyou, that I neither then had, nor have, or ever had, any\npurpose in any way of interfering with the institution of\nslavery, where it exists. I believe we have no power, under\nthe Constitution of the United States, or rather under the\nform of government under which we live, to interfere with\n the institution of slavery, or any other of the institutions of\nour sister States, be they free or slave States. I declared\nthen, and I now re-declare, that I have as little inclination\nto interfere with the institution of slavery where it now\nexists, \nthrough \nthe \ninstrumentality \nof \nthe \nGeneral\nGovernment, or any other instrumentality, as I believe we\nhave no power to do so. I accidentally used this expression:\nI had no purpose of entering into the slave States to disturb\nthe institution of slavery. So, upon the \ufb01rst occasion that\nJudge Douglas got an opportunity to reply to me, he passed\nby the whole body of what I had said upon that subject, and\nseized upon the particular expression of mine that I had no\npurpose of entering into the slave States to disturb the\ninstitution of slavery. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said he, \u201che [Lincoln] won\u2019t\nenter into the slave States to disturb the institution of\nslavery, he is too prudent a man to do such a thing as that;\nhe only means that he will go on to the line between the\nfree and slave States, and shoot over at them. This is all he\nmeans to do. He means to do them all the harm he can, to\ndisturb them all he can, in such a way as to keep his own\nhide in perfect safety.\u201d\nWell, now, I did not think, at that time, that that was\neither a very digni\ufb01ed or very logical argument but so it\nwas, I had to get along with it as well as I could.\nIt has occurred to-me here to-night that if I ever do shoot\nover the line at the people on the other side of the line into\na slave State, and purpose to do so, keeping my skin safe,\nthat I have now about the best chance I shall ever have. I\nshould not wonder if there are some Kentuckians about this\n audience \u2014 we are close to Kentucky; and whether that be\nso or not, we are on elevated ground, and, by speaking\ndistinctly, I should not wonder if some of the Kentuckians\nwould hear me on the other side of the river. For that\nreason I propose to address a portion of what I have to say\nto the Kentuckians.\nI say, then, in the \ufb01rst place, to the Kentuckians, that I\nam what they call, as I understand it, a \u201cBlack Republican.\u201d\nI think slavery is wrong, morally and politically. I desire\nthat it should be no further spread in \u2014 these United\nStates, and I should not object if it should gradually\nterminate in the whole Union. While I say this for myself, I\nsay to you Kentuckians that I understand you di\ufb00er\nradically with me upon this proposition; that you believe\nslavery is a good thing; that slavery is right; that it ought to\nbe extended and perpetuated in this Union. Now, there\nbeing this broad di\ufb00erence between us, I do not pretend, in\naddressing \nmyself \nto \nyou \nKentuckians, \nto \nattempt\nproselyting you; that would be a vain e\ufb00ort. I do not enter\nupon it. I only propose to try to show you that you ought to\nnominate for the next Presidency, at Charleston, my\ndistinguished friend Judge Douglas. In all that there is a\ndi\ufb00erence between you and him, I understand he is\nsincerely for you, and more wisely for you than you are for\nyourselves. I will try to demonstrate that proposition.\nUnderstand, now, I say that I believe he is as sincerely for\nyou, and more wisely for you, than you are for yourselves.\nWhat do you want more than anything else to make\nsuccessful your views of slavery, \u2014 to advance the\n outspread of it, and to secure and perpetuate the\nnationality of it? What do you want more than anything\nelse? What \u2014 is needed absolutely? What is indispensable\nto you? Why, if I may, be allowed to answer the question, it\nis to retain a hold upon the North, it is to retain support\nand strength from the free States. If you can get this\nsupport and strength from the free States, you can\nsucceed. If you do not get this support and this strength\nfrom the free States, you are in the minority, and you are\nbeaten at once.\nIf that proposition be admitted, \u2014 and it is undeniable, \u2014\nthen the next thing I say to you is, that Douglas, of all the\nmen in this nation, is the only man that a\ufb00ords you any\nhold upon the free States; that no other man can give you\nany strength in the free States. This being so, if you doubt\nthe other branch of the proposition, whether he is for you\n\u2014 whether he is really for you, as I have expressed it, \u2014 I\npropose asking your attention for a while to a few facts.\nThe issue between you and me, understand, is, that I\nthink slavery is wrong, and ought not to be outspread; and\nyou think it is right, and ought to be extended and\nperpetuated. [A voice, \u201cOh, Lord!\u201d] That is my Kentuckian I\nam talking to now.\nI now proceed to try to show you that Douglas is as\nsincerely for you and more wisely for you than you are for\nyourselves.\nIn the \ufb01rst place, we know that in a government like this,\nin a government of the people, where the voice of all the\nmen of the country, substantially, enters into the execution\n \u2014 or administration, rather \u2014 of the government, in such a\ngovernment, what lies at the bottom of all of it is public\nopinion. I lay down the proposition, that Judge Douglas is\nnot only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon\nthe North, and support in the North, but he constantly\nmoulds public opinion to your ends; that in every possible\nway he can he constantly moulds the public opinion of the\nNorth to your ends; and if there are a few things in which\nhe seems to be against you, \u2014 a few things which he says\nthat appear to be against you, and a few that he forbears to\nsay which you would like to have him say you ought to\nremember that the saying of the one, or the forbearing to\nsay the other, would lose his hold upon the North, and, by\nconsequence, would lose his capacity to serve you.\nUpon this subject of moulding public opinion I call your\nattention to the fact \u2014 for a well established fact it is \u2014\nthat the Judge never says your institution of slavery is\nwrong. There is not a public man in the United States, I\nbelieve, with the exception of Senator Douglas, who has\nnot, at some time in his life, declared his opinion whether\nthe thing is right or wrong; but Senator Douglas never\ndeclares it is wrong. He leaves himself at perfect liberty to\ndo all in your favor which he would be hindered from doing\nif he were to declare the thing to be wrong. On the\ncontrary, he takes all the chances that he has for inveigling\nthe sentiment of the North, opposed to slavery, into your\nsupport, by never saying it is right. This you ought to set\ndown to his credit: You ought to give him full credit for this\n much; little though it be, in comparison to the whole which\nhe does for you.\nSome other, things I will ask your attention to. He said\nupon the \ufb02oor of the United States Senate, and he has\nrepeated it, as I understand, a great many times, that he\ndoes not care whether slavery is \u201cvoted up or voted down.\u201d\nThis again shows you, or ought to show you, if you would\nreason upon it, that he does not believe it to be wrong; for\na man may say when he sees nothing wrong in a thing; that\nhe, dues not care whether it be voted up or voted down but\nno man can logically say that he cares not whether a thing\ngoes up or goes down which to him appears to be wrong.\nYou therefore have a demonstration in this that to Judge\nDouglas\u2019s mind your favorite institution, which you would\nhave spread out and made perpetual, is no wrong.\nAnother thing he tells you, in a speech made at Memphis\nin Tennessee, shortly after the canvass in Illinois, last year.\nHe there distinctly told the people that there was a \u201cline\ndrawn by the Almighty across this continent, on the one\nside of which the soil must always be cultivated by slaves\u201d;\nthat he did not pretend to know exactly where that line\nwas, but that there was such a line. I want to ask your\nattention to that proposition again; that there is one portion\nof this continent where the Almighty has signed the soil\nshall always be cultivated by slaves; that its being\ncultivated by slaves at that place is right; that it has the\ndirect sympathy and authority of the Almighty. Whenever\nyou can get these Northern audiences to adopt the opinion\nthat slavery is right on the other side of the Ohio, whenever\n you can get them, in pursuance of Douglas\u2019s views, to\nadopt that sentiment, they will very readily make the other\nargument, which is perfectly logical, that that which is\nright on that side of the Ohio cannot be wrong on this, and\nthat if you have that property on that side of the Ohio,\nunder the seal and stamp of the Almighty, when by any\nmeans it escapes over here it is wrong to have constitutions\nand laws \u201cto devil\u201d you about it. So Douglas is moulding the\npublic opinion of the North, \ufb01rst to say that the thing is\nright in your State over the Ohio River, and hence to say\nthat that which is right there is not wrong here, and that all\nlaws and constitutions here recognizing it as being wrong\nare themselves wrong, and ought to be repealed and\nabrogated. He will tell you, men of Ohio, that if you choose\nhere to have laws against slavery, it is in conformity to the\nidea that your climate is not suited to it, that your climate\nis not suited to slave labor, and therefore you have\nconstitutions and laws against it.\nLet us attend to that argument for a little while and see if\nit be sound. You do not raise sugar-cane (except the new-\nfashioned sugar-cane, and you won\u2019t raise that long), but\nthey do raise it in Louisiana. You don\u2019t raise it in Ohio,\nbecause you can\u2019t raise it pro\ufb01tably, because the climate\ndon\u2019t suit it. They do raise it in Louisiana, because there it\nis pro\ufb01table. Now, Douglas will tell you that is precisely the\nslavery question: that they do have slaves there because\nthey are pro\ufb01table, and you don\u2019t have them here because\nthey are not pro\ufb01table. If that is so, then it leads to dealing\nwith the one precisely as with the other. Is there, then,\n anything in the constitution or laws of Ohio against raising\nsugar-cane? Have you found it necessary to put any such\nprovision in your law? Surely not! No man desires to raise\nsugar-cane in Ohio, but if any man did desire to do so, you\nwould say it was a tyrannical law that forbids his doing so;\nand whenever you shall agree with Douglas, whenever your\nminds are brought to adopt his argument, as surely you will\nhave reached the conclusion that although it is not\npro\ufb01table in Ohio, if any man wants it, is wrong to him not\nto let him have it.\nIn this matter Judge Douglas is preparing the public\nmind for you of Kentucky to make perpetual that good thing\nin your estimation, about which you and I di\ufb00er.\nIn this connection, let me ask your attention to another\nthing. I believe it is safe to assert that \ufb01ve years ago no\nliving man had expressed the opinion that the negro had no\nshare in the Declaration of Independence. Let me state that\nagain: \ufb01ve years ago no living man had expressed the\nopinion that the negro had no share in the Declaration of\nIndependence. If there is in this large audience any man\nwho ever knew of that opinion being put upon paper as\nmuch as \ufb01ve years ago, I will be obliged to him now or at a\nsubsequent time to show it.\nIf that be true I wish you then to note the next fact: that\nwithin the space of \ufb01ve years Senator Douglas, in the\nargument of this question, has got his entire party, so far as\nI know, without exception, in saying that the negro has no\nshare in the Declaration of Independence. If there be now\nin all these United States one Douglas man that does not\n say this, I have been unable upon any occasion to scare him\nup. Now, if none of you said this \ufb01ve years ago, and all of\nyou say it now, that is a matter that you Kentuckians ought\nto note. That is a vast change in the Northern public\nsentiment upon that question.\nOf what tendency is that change? The tendency of that\nchange is to bring the public mind to the conclusion that\nwhen men are spoken of, the negro is not meant; that when\nnegroes are spoken of, brutes alone are contemplated. That\nchange in public sentiment has already degraded the black\nman in the estimation of Douglas and his followers from the\ncondition of a man of some sort, and assigned him to the\ncondition of a brute. Now, you Kentuckians ought to give\nDouglas credit for this. That is the largest possible stride\nthat can be made in regard to the perpetuation of your\nthing of slavery.\nA voice: Speak to Ohio men, and not to Kentuckians!\nMr. LINCOLN: I beg permission to speak as I please.\nIn Kentucky perhaps, in many of the slave States\ncertainly, you are trying to establish the rightfulness of\nslavery by reference to the Bible. You are trying to show\nthat slavery existed in the Bible times by divine ordinance.\nNow, Douglas is wiser than you, for your own bene\ufb01t, upon\nthat subject. Douglas knows that whenever you establish\nthat slavery was \u2014 right by the Bible, it will occur that that\nslavery was the slavery of the white man, of men without\nreference to color; and he knows very well that you may\nentertain that idea in Kentucky as much as you please, but\nyou will never win any Northern support upon it. He makes\n a wiser argument for you: he makes the argument that the\nslavery of the black man; the slavery of the man who has a\nskin of a di\ufb00erent color from your own, is right. He thereby\nbrings to your support Northern voters who could not for a\nmoment be brought by your own argument of the Bible\nright of slavery. Will you give him credit for that? Will you\nnot say that in this matter he is more wisely for you than\nyou are for yourselves?\nNow, having established with his entire party this\ndoctrine, having been entirely successful in that branch of\nhis e\ufb00orts in your behalf, he is ready for another.\nAt this same meeting at Memphis he declared that in all\ncontests between the negro and the white man he was for\nthe white man, but that in all questions between the negro\nand the crocodile he was for the negro. He did not make\nthat declaration accidentally at Memphis. He made it a\ngreat many times in the canvass in Illinois last year (though\nI don\u2019t know that it was reported in any of his speeches\nthere, but he frequently made it). I believe he repeated it at\nColumbus, and I should not wonder if he repeated it here.\nIt is, then, a deliberate way of expressing himself upon that\nsubject. It is a matter of mature deliberation with him thus\nto express himself upon that point of his case. It therefore\nrequires deliberate attention.\nThe \ufb01rst inference seems to be that if you do not enslave\nthe negro, you are wronging the white man in some way or\nother, and that whoever is opposed to the negro being\nenslaved, is, in some way or other, against the white man.\nIs not that a falsehood? If there was a necessary con\ufb02ict\n between the white man and the negro, I should be for the\nwhite man as much as Judge Douglas; but I say there is no\nsuch necessary con\ufb02ict. I say that there is room enough for\nus all to be free, and that it not only does not wrong the\nwhite man that the negro should be free, but it positively\nwrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be\nenslaved; that the mass of white men are really injured by\nthe e\ufb00ects of slave labor in the vicinity of the \ufb01elds of their\nown labor.\nBut I do not desire to dwell upon this branch of the\nquestion more than to say that this assumption of his is\nfalse, and I do hope that that fallacy will not long prevail in\nthe minds of intelligent white men. At all events, you ought\nto thank Judge Douglas for it; it is for your bene\ufb01t it is\nmade.\nThe other branch of it is, that in the struggle between the\nnegro and the crocodile; he is for the negro. Well, I don\u2019t\nknow that there is any struggle between the negro and the\ncrocodile, either. I suppose that if a crocodile (or, as we old\nOhio River boatmen used to call them, alligators) should\ncome across a white man, he would kill him if he could; and\nso he would a negro. But what, at last, is this proposition? I\nbelieve it is a sort of proposition in proportion, which may\nbe stated thus: \u201cAs the negro is to the white man, so is the\ncrocodile to the negro; and as the negro may rightfully\ntreat the crocodile as a beast or reptile, so the white man\nmay rightfully treat the negro as a beast or a reptile.\u201d That\nis really the \u201cknip\u201d of all that argument of his.\n Now, my brother Kentuckians, who believe in this, you\nought to thank Judge Douglas for having put that in a much\nmore taking way than any of yourselves have done.\nAgain, Douglas\u2019s great principle, \u201cpopular sovereignty,\u201d\nas he calls it, gives you, by natural consequence, the revival\nof the slave trade whenever you want it. If you question\nthis, listen awhile, consider awhile what I shall advance in\nsupport of that proposition.\nHe says that it is the sacred right of the man who goes\ninto the Territories to have slavery if he wants it. Grant that\nfor argument\u2019s sake. Is it not the sacred right of the man\nwho don\u2019t go there equally to buy slaves in Africa, if he\nwants them? Can you point out the di\ufb00erence? The man\nwho goes into the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, or\nany other new Territory, with the sacred right of taking a\nslave there which belongs to him, would certainly have no\nmore right to take one there than I would, who own no\nslave, but who would desire to buy one and take him there.\nYou will not say you, the friends of Judge Douglas but that\nthe man who does not own a slave has an equal right to buy\none and take him to the Territory as the other does.\nA voice: I want to ask a question. Don\u2019t foreign nations\ninterfere with the slave trade?\nMr. LINCOLN: Well! I understand it to be a principle of\nDemocracy to whip foreign nations whenever, they\ninterfere with us.\nVoice: I only asked for information. I am a Republican\nmyself.\n Mr. LINCOLN: You and I will be on the best terms in the\nworld, but I do not wish to be diverted from the point I was\ntrying to press.\nI say that Douglas\u2019s popular sovereignty, establishing his\nsacred right in the people, if you please, if carried to its\nlogical conclusion gives equally the sacred right to the\npeople of the States or the Territories themselves to buy\nslaves wherever they can buy them cheapest; and if any\nman can show a distinction, I should like to hear him try it.\nIf any man can show how the people of Kansas have a\nbetter right to slaves, because they want them, than the\npeople of Georgia have to buy them in Africa, I want him to\ndo it. I think it cannot be done. If it is \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d\nfor the people to have slaves because they want them, it is\npopular sovereignty for them to buy them in Africa because\nthey desire to do so.\nI know that Douglas has recently made a little e\ufb00ort, not\nseeming to notice that he had a di\ufb00erent theory, has made\nan e\ufb00ort to get rid of that. He has written a letter,\naddressed to somebody, I believe, who resides in Iowa,\ndeclaring his opposition to the repeal of the laws that\nprohibit the Africa slave trade. He bases his opposition to\nsuch repeal upon the ground that these laws are\nthemselves one of the compromises of the Constitution of\nthe United States. Now, it would be very interesting to see\nJudge Douglas or any of his friends turn, to the Constitution\nof the United States and point out that compromise, to\nshow where there is any compromise in the Constitution, or\nprovision in the Constitution; express or implied, by which\n the administrators of that Constitution are under any\nobligation to repeal the African slave trade. I know, or at\nleast I think I know, that the framers of that Constitution\ndid expect the African slave trade would be abolished at the\nend of twenty years, to which time their prohibition against\nits \nbeing \nabolished \nextended \nthere \nis \nabundant\ncontemporaneous history to show that the framers of the\nConstitution expected it to be abolished. But while they so\nexpected, they gave nothing for that expectation, and they\nput no provision in the Constitution requiring it should be\nso abolished. The migration or importation of such persons\nas the States shall see \ufb01t to admit shall not be prohibited,\nbut a certain tax might be levied upon such importation.\nBut what was to be done after that time? The Constitution\nis as silent about that as it is silent, personally, about\nmyself. There is absolutely nothing in it about that subject;\nthere is only the expectation of the framers of the\nConstitution that the slave trade would be abolished at the\nend of that time; and they expected it would be abolished,\nowing to public sentiment, before that time; and the put\nthat provision in, in order that it should not be abolished\nbefore that time, for reasons which I suppose they thought\nto be sound ones, but which I will not now try to enumerate\nbefore you.\nBut while, they expected the slave trade would be\nabolished at that time, they expected that the spread of\nslavery into the new Territories should also be restricted. It\nis as easy to prove that the framers of the Constitution of\nthe United States expected that slavery should be\n prohibited from extending into the new Territories, as it is\nto prove that it was expected that the slave trade should be\nabolished. Both these things were expected. One was no\nmore expected than the other, and one was no more a\ncompromise of the Constitution than the other. There was\nnothing said in the Constitution in regard to the spread of\nslavery into the Territory. I grant that; but there was\nsomething very important said about it by the same\ngeneration of men in the adoption of the old Ordinance of\n\u2018, through the in\ufb02uence of which you here in Ohio, our\nneighbors in Indiana, we in Illinois, our neighbors in\nMichigan and Wisconsin, are happy, prosperous, teeming\nmillions of free men. That generation of men, though not to\nthe full extent members of the convention that framed the\nConstitution, were to some extent members of that\nconvention, holding seats at the same time in one body and\nthe other, so that if there was any compromise on either of\nthese subjects, the strong evidence is that that compromise\nwas in favor of the restriction of slavery from the new\nTerritories.\nBut Douglas says that he is unalterably opposed to the\nrepeal of those laws because, in his view, it is a compromise\nof the Constitution. You Kentuckians, no doubt, are\nsomewhat o\ufb00ended with that. You ought not to be! You\nought to be patient! You ought to know that if he said less\nthan that, he would lose the power of \u201clugging\u201d the\nNorthern States to your support. Really, what you would\npush him to do would take from him his entire power to\nserve you. And you ought to remember how long, by\n precedent, Judge Douglas holds himself obliged to stick by\ncompromises. You ought to remember that by the time you\nyourselves think you are ready to inaugurate measures for\nthe revival of the African slave trade, that su\ufb00icient time\nwill have arrived, by precedent, for Judge Douglas to break\nthrough, that compromise. He says now nothing more\nstrong than he said in  when he declared in favor of\nMissouri Compromise, \u2014 and precisely four years and a\nquarter after he declared that Compromise to be a sacred\nthing, which \u201cno ruthless hand would ever daze to touch,\u201d\nhe himself brought forward the measure ruthlessly to\ndestroy it. By a mere calculation of time it will only be four\nyears more until he is ready to take back his profession\nabout the sacredness of the Compromise abolishing the\nslave trade. Precisely as soon as you are ready to have his\nservices in that direction, by fair calculation, you may be\nsure of having them.\nBut you remember and set down to Judge Douglas\u2019s debt,\nor discredit, that he, last year, said the people of Territories\ncan, in spite of the Dred Scott decision, exclude your slaves\nfrom those Territories; that he declared, by \u201cunfriendly\nlegislation\u201d the extension of your property into the new\nTerritories may be cut o\ufb00, in the teeth of the decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States.\nHe assumed that position at Freeport on the th of\nAugust, . He said that the people of the Territories can\nexclude slavery, in so many words: You ought, however, to\nbear in mind that he has never said it since. You may hunt\nin every speech that he has since made, and he has never\n used that expression once. He has never seemed to notice\nthat he is stating his views di\ufb00erently from what he did\nthen; but by some sort of accident, he has always really\nstated it di\ufb00erently. He has always since then declared that\n\u201cthe Constitution does not carry slavery into the Territories\nof the United States beyond the power of the people legally\nto control it, as other property.\u201d Now, there is a di\ufb00erence\nin the language used upon that former occasion and in this\nlatter day. There may or may not be a di\ufb00erence in the\nmeaning, but it is worth while considering whether there is\nnot also a di\ufb00erence in meaning.\nWhat is it to exclude? Why, it is to drive it out. It is in\nsome way to put it out of the Territory. It is to force it\nacross the line, or change its character so that, as property,\nit is out of existence. But what is the controlling of it \u201cas\nother property\u201d? Is controlling it as other property the\nsame thing as destroying it, or driving it away? I should\nthink not. I should think the controlling of it as other\nproperty would be just about what you in Kentucky should\nwant. I understand the controlling of property means the\ncontrolling of it for the bene\ufb01t of the owner of it. While I\nhave no doubt the Supreme Court of the United States\nwould say \u201cGod speed\u201d to any of the Territorial Legislatures\nthat should thus control slave property, they would sing\nquite a di\ufb00erent tune if, by the pretence of controlling it,\nthey were to undertake to pass laws which virtually\nexcluded it, \u2014 and that upon a very well known principle to\nall lawyers, that what a Legislature cannot directly do, it\ncannot do by indirection; that as the Legislature has not the\n power to drive slaves out, they have no power, by\nindirection, by tax, or by imposing burdens in any way on\nthat property, to e\ufb00ect the same end, and that any attempt\nto do so would be held by the Dred Scott court\nunconstitutional.\nDouglas is not willing to stand by his \ufb01rst proposition\nthat they can exclude it, because we have seen that that\nproposition amounts to nothing more nor less than the\nnaked absurdity that you may lawfully drive out that which\nhas a lawful right to remain. He admitted at \ufb01rst that the\nslave might be lawfully taken into the Territories under the\nConstitution of the United States, and yet asserted that he\nmight be lawfully driven out. That being the proposition, it\nis the absurdity I have stated. He is not willing to stand in\nthe face of that direct, naked, and impudent absurdity; he\nhas, therefore, modi\ufb01ed his language into that of being\n\u201ccontrolled as other property.\u201d\nThe Kentuckians don\u2019t like this in Douglas! I will tell you\nwhere it will go. He now swears by the court. He was once\na leading man in Illinois to break down a court, because it\nhad made a decision he did not like. But he now not only\nswears by the court, the courts having got to working for\nyou, but he denounces all men that do not swear by the\ncourts, as unpatriotic, as bad citizens. When one of these\nacts of unfriendly legislation shall impose such heavy\nburdens as to, in e\ufb00ect, destroy property in slaves in a\nTerritory, and show plainly enough that there can be no\nmistake in the purpose of the Legislature to make them so\nburdensome, this same Supreme Court will decide that law\n to be unconstitutional, and he will be ready to say for your\nbene\ufb01t \u201cI swear by the court; I give it up\u201d; and while that is\ngoing on he has been getting all his men to swear by the\ncourts, and to give it up with him. In this again he serves\nyou faithfully, and, as I say, more wisely than you serve\nyourselves.\nAgain: I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks\nto the fact that Judge Douglas has made great complaint of\nmy having expressed the opinion that this government\n\u201ccannot endure permanently, half slave and half free.\u201d He\nhas complained of Seward for using di\ufb00erent language, and\ndeclaring that there is an \u201cirrepressible con\ufb02ict\u201d between\nthe principles of free and slave labor. [A voice: \u201cHe says it\nis not original with Seward. That it is original with\nLincoln.\u201d] I will attend to that immediately, sir. Since that\ntime, Hickman of Pennsylvania expressed the same\nsentiment. He has never denounced Mr. Hickman: why?\nThere is a little chance, notwithstanding that opinion in the\nmouth of Hickman, that he may yet be a Douglas man. That\nis the di\ufb00erence! It is not unpatriotic to hold that opinion if\na man is a Douglas man.\nBut neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the\nenviable or unenviable distinction of having \ufb01rst expressed\nthat idea. That same idea was expressed by the Richmond\nEnquirer, in Virginia, in , \u2014 quite two years before it\nwas expressed by the \ufb01rst of us. And while Douglas was\npluming himself that in his con\ufb02ict with my humble self,\nlast year, he had \u201csquelched out\u201d that fatal heresy, as he\ndelighted to call it, and had suggested that if he only had\n had a chance to be in New York and meet Seward he would\nhave \u201csquelched\u201d it there also, it never occurred to him to\nbreathe a word against Pryor. I don\u2019t think that you can\ndiscover that Douglas ever talked of going to Virginia to\n\u201csquelch\u201d out that idea there. No. More than that. That\nsame Roger A. Pryor was brought to Washington City and\nmade the editor of the par excellence Douglas paper, after\nmaking use of that expression, which, in us, is so\nunpatriotic and heretical. From all this, my Kentucky\nfriends may see that this opinion is heretical in his view\nonly when it is expressed by men suspected of a desire that\nthe country shall all become free, and not when expressed\nby those fairly known to entertain the desire that the whole\ncountry shall become slave. When expressed by that class\nof men, it is in nowise o\ufb00ensive to him. In this again, my\nfriends of Kentucky, you have Judge Douglas with you.\nThere is another reason why you Southern people ought\nto nominate Douglas at your convention at Charleston. That\nreason is the wonderful capacity of the man, \u2014 the power\nhe has of doing what would seem to be impossible. Let me\ncall your attention to one of these apparently impossible\nthings:\nDouglas had three or four very distinguished men of the\nmost extreme anti-slavery views of any men in the\nRepublican party expressing their desire for his re-election\nto the Senate last year. That would, of itself, have seemed\nto be a little wonderful; but that wonder is heightened\nwhen we see that Wise of Virginia, a man exactly opposed\nto them, a man who believes in the divine right of slavery,\n was also expressing his desire that Douglas should be\nreelected; that another man that may be said to be kindred\nto Wise, Mr. Breckinridge, the Vice-President, and of your\nown State, was also agreeing with the anti-slavery men in\nthe North that Douglas ought to be re-elected. Still to\nheighten the wonder, a senator from Kentucky, whom I\nhave always loved with an a\ufb00ection as tender and\nendearing as I have ever loved any man, who was opposed\nto the anti-slavery men for reasons which seemed su\ufb00icient\nto him, and equally opposed to Wise and Breckinridge, was\nwriting letters into Illinois to secure the reelection of\nDouglas. Now, that all these con\ufb02icting elements should be\nbrought, while at daggers\u2019 points with one another, to\nsupport him, is a feat that is worthy for you to note and\nconsider. It is quite probable that each of these classes of\nmen thought, by the re-election of Douglas, their peculiar\nviews would gain something: it is probable that the anti-\nslavery men thought their views would gain something;\nthat Wise and Breckinridge thought so too, as regards their\nopinions; that Mr. Crittenden thought that his views would\ngain something, although he was opposed to both these\nother men. It is probable that each and all of them thought\nthat they were using Douglas; and it is yet an unsolved\nproblem whether he was not using them all. If he was, then\nit is for you to consider whether that power to perform\nwonders is one for you lightly to throw away.\nThere is one other thing that I will say to you, in this\nrelation. It is but my opinion, I give it to you without a fee.\nIt is my opinion that it is for you to take him or be defeated;\n and that if you do take him you may be beaten. You will\nsurely be beaten if you do not take him. We, the\nRepublicans and others forming the opposition of the\ncountry, intend to \u201cstand by our guns,\u201d to be patient and\n\ufb01rm, and in the long run to beat you, whether you take him\nor not. We know that before we fairly beat you we have to\nbeat you both together. We know that you are \u201call of a\nfeather,\u201d and that we have to beat you all together, and we\nexpect to do it. We don\u2019t intend to be very impatient about\nit. We mean to be as deliberate and calm about it as it is\npossible to be, but as \ufb01rm and resolved as it is possible for\nmen to be. When we do as we say, \u2014 beat you, \u2014 you\nperhaps want to know what we will do with you.\nI will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the\nopposition, what we mean to do with you. We mean to treat\nyou, as near as we possibly can, as Washington, Je\ufb00erson,\nand Madison treated you. We mean to leave you alone, and\nin no way interfere with your institution; to abide by all and\nevery compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word,\ncoming back to the original proposition, to treat you, so far\nas degenerated men (if we have degenerated) may,\naccording to the examples of those noble fathers,\nWashington, Je\ufb00erson, and Madison. We mean to remember\nthat you are as good as we; that there is no di\ufb00erence\nbetween us other than the di\ufb00erence of circumstances. We\nmean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have\nas good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we\nclaim to have, and treat you accordingly. We mean to marry\nyour girls when we have a chance, the white ones I mean;\n and I have the honor to inform you that I once did have a\nchance in that way.\nI have told you what we mean to do. I want to know, now,\nwhen that thing takes place, what do you mean to do? I\noften hear it intimated that you mean to divide the Union\nwhenever a Republican, or anything like it, is elected\nPresident of the United States. [A voice: \u201cThat is so.\u201d] \u201cThat\nis so,\u201d one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian? [A\nvoice: \u201cHe is a Douglas man.\u201d] Well, then, I want to know\nwhat you are going to do with your half of it? Are you going\nto split the Ohio down through, and push your half o\ufb00 a\npiece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us\noutrageous fellows? Or are you going to build up a wall\nsome way between your country and ours, by which that\nmovable property of yours can\u2019t come over here any more,\nto the danger of your losing it? Do you think you can better\nyourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no\nobligation whatever to return those specimens of your\nmovable property that come hither? You have divided the\nUnion because we would not do right with you, as you\nthink, upon that subject; when we cease to be under\nobligations to do anything for you, how much better o\ufb00 do\nyou think you will be? Will you make war upon us and kill\nus all? Why, gentlemen, I think you are as gallant and as\nbrave men as live; that you can \ufb01ght as bravely in a good\ncause, man for man, as any other people living; that you\nhave shown yourselves capable of this upon various\noccasions: but, man for man, you are not better than we\nare, and there are not so many of you as there are of us.\n You will never make much of a hand at whipping us. If we\nwere fewer in numbers than you, I think that you could\nwhip us; if we were equal, it would likely be a drawn battle;\nbut being inferior in numbers, you will make nothing by\nattempting to master us.\nBut perhaps I have addressed myself as long, or longer,\nto the Kentuckians than I ought to have done, inasmuch as\nI have said that whatever course you take we intend in the\nend to beat you. I propose to address a few remarks to our\nfriends, by way of discussing with them the best means of\nkeeping that promise that I have in good faith made.\nIt may appear a little episodical for me to mention the\ntopic of which I will speak now. It is a favorite position of\nDouglas\u2019s that the interference of the General Government,\nthrough the Ordinance of \u2018, or through any other act of\nthe General Government never has made or ever can make\na free State; the Ordinance of \u2018 did not make free States\nof Ohio, Indiana, or Illinois; that these States are free upon\nhis \u201cgreat principle\u201d of popular sovereignty, because the\npeople of those several States have chosen to make them\nso. At Columbus, and probably here, he undertook to\ncompliment the people that they themselves have made the\nState of Ohio free, and that the Ordinance of \u2018 was not\nentitled in any degree to divide the honor with them. I have\nno doubt that the people of the State of Ohio did make her\nfree according to their own will and judgment, but let the\nfacts be remembered.\nIn , I believe, it was you who made your \ufb01rst\nconstitution, with the clause prohibiting slavery, and you\n did it, I suppose, very nearly unanimously; but you should\nbear in mind that you \u2014 speaking of you as one people \u2014\nthat you did so unembarrassed by the actual presence of\nthe institution amongst you; that you made it a free State\nnot with the embarrassment upon you of already having\namong you many slaves, which if they had been here, and\nyou had sought to make a free State, you would not know\nwhat to do with. If they had been among you, embarrassing\ndi\ufb00iculties, most probably, would have induced you to\ntolerate a slave constitution instead of a free one, as indeed\nthese very di\ufb00iculties have constrained every people on this\ncontinent who have adopted slavery.\nPray what was it that made you free? What kept you\nfree? Did you not \ufb01nd your country free when you came to\ndecide that Ohio should be a free State? It is important to\ninquire by what reason you found it so. Let us take an\nillustration between the States of Ohio and Kentucky.\nKentucky is separated by this River Ohio, not a mile wide. A\nportion of Kentucky, by reason of the course of the Ohio, is\nfarther north than this portion of Ohio, in which we now\nstand. Kentucky is entirely covered with slavery; Ohio is\nentirely free from it: What made that di\ufb00erence? Was it\nclimate? No. A portion of Kentucky was farther north than\nthis portion of Ohio. Was it soil? No. There is nothing in the\nsoil of the one more favorable to slave than the other. It\nwas not climate or soil that mused one side of the line to be\nentirely covered with slavery, and the other side free of it.\nWhat was it? Study over it. Tell us, if you can, in all the\nrange of conjecture, if there be anything you can conceive\n of that made that di\ufb00erence, other than that there was no\nlaw of any sort keeping it out of Kentucky, while the\nOrdinance of \u2018 kept it out of Ohio. If there is any other\nreason than this, I confess that it is wholly beyond my\npower to conceive of it. This, then, I o\ufb00er to combat the\nidea that that Ordinance has never made any State free.\nI don\u2019t stop at this illustration. I come to the State of\nIndiana; and what I have said as between Kentucky and\nOhio, I repeat as between Indiana and Kentucky: it is\nequally applicable. One additional argument is applicable\nalso to Indiana. In her Territorial condition she more than\nonce petitioned Congress to abrogate the Ordinance\nentirely, or at least so far as to suspend its operation for a\ntime, in order that they should exercise the \u201cpopular\nsovereignty\u201d of having slaves if they wanted them. The men\nthen controlling the General Government, imitating the\nmen of the Revolution, refused Indiana that privilege. And\nso we have the evidence that Indiana supposed she could\nhave slaves, if it were not for that Ordinance; that she\nbesought Congress to put that barrier out of the way; that\nCongress refused to do so; and it all ended at last in\nIndiana being a free State. Tell me not then that the\nOrdinance of \u2018 had nothing to do with making Indiana a\nfree State, when we \ufb01nd some men cha\ufb01ng against, and\nonly restrained by, that barrier.\nCome down again to our State of Illinois. The great\nNorthwest Territory, including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\nMichigan, and Wisconsin, was acquired \ufb01rst, I believe, by\nthe British Government, in part at least, from the French.\n Before the establishment of our independence it became a\npart of Virginia, enabling Virginia afterward to transfer it to\nthe General Government. There were French settlements in\nwhat is now Illinois, and at the same time there were\nFrench settlements in what is now Missouri, in the tract of\ncountry that was not purchased till about . In these\nFrench settlements negro slavery had existed for many\nyears, perhaps more than a hundred; if not as much as two\nhundred years, \u2014 at Kaskaskia, in Illinois, and at St.\nGenevieve, or Cape Girardeau, perhaps, in Missouri. The\nnumber of slaves was not very great, but there was about\nthe same number in each place. They were there when we\nacquired the Territory. There was no e\ufb00ort made to break\nup the relation of master and slave, and even the Ordinance\nof  was not so enforced as to destroy that slavery in\nIllinois; nor did the Ordinance apply to Missouri at all.\nWhat I want to ask your attention to; at this point, is that\nIllinois and Missouri came into the Union about the same\ntime, Illinois in the latter part of , and Missouri, after a\nstruggle, I believe sometime in . They had been \ufb01lling\nup with American people about the same period of time;\ntheir progress enabling them to come into the Union about\nthe same time. At the end of that ten years, in which they\nhad been so preparing (for it was about that period of\ntime), the number of slaves in Illinois had actually\ndecreased; while in Missouri, beginning with very few, at\nthe end of that ten years there were about ten thousand.\nThis being so, and it being remembered that Missouri and\nIllinois are, to a certain extent, in the same parallel of\n latitude, that the northern half of Missouri and the\nsouthern half of Illinois are in the same parallel of latitude,\nso that climate would have the same e\ufb00ect upon one as\nupon the other, and that in the soil there is no material\ndi\ufb00erence so far as bears upon the question of slavery\nbeing settled upon one or the other, \u2014 there being none of\nthose natural causes to produce a di\ufb00erence in \ufb01lling them,\nand yet there being a broad di\ufb00erence to their \ufb01lling up, we\nare led again to inquire what was the cause of that\ndi\ufb00erence.\nIt is most natural to say that in Missouri there was no\nlaw to keep that country from \ufb01lling up with slaves, while\nin Illinois there was the Ordinance of The Ordinance being\nthere, slavery decreased during that ten years; the\nOrdinance not being in the other, it increased from a few to\nten thousand. Can anybody doubt the reason of the\ndi\ufb00erence?\nI think all these facts most abundantly prove that my\nfriend Judge Douglas\u2019s proposition, that the Ordinance of\n\u2018, or the national restriction of slavery, never had a\ntendency to make a free State, is a fallacy, \u2014 a proposition\nwithout the shadow or substance of truth about it.\nDouglas sometimes says that all the States (and it is part\nof this same proposition I have been discussing) that have\nbecome free have become so upon his \u201cgreat principle\u201d;\nthat the State of Illinois itself came into the Union as a\nslave State, and that the people, upon the \u201cgreat principle\u201d\nof popular sovereignty, have since made it a free State.\nAllow me but a little while to state to you what facts there\n are to justify him in saying that Illinois came into the Union\nas a slave State.\nI have mentioned to you that there were a few old French\nslaves there. They numbered, I think, one or two hundred.\nBesides that, there had been a Territorial law for\nindenturing black persons. Under that law, in violation of\nthe Ordinance of \u2018, but without any enforcement of the\nOrdinance to overthrow the system, there had been a small\nnumber of slaves introduced as indentured persons. Owing\nto this, the clause for the prohibition of slavery was slightly\nmodi\ufb01ed. Instead of running like yours, that neither slavery\nnor involuntary servitude, except for crime, of which the\nparty shall have been duly convicted, should exist in the\nState, they said that neither slavery nor involuntary\nservitude should thereafter be introduced; and that the\nchildren of indentured servants should be born free; and\nnothing was said about the few old French slaves. Out of\nthis fact, that the clause for prohibiting slavery was\nmodi\ufb01ed because of the actual presence of it, Douglas\nasserts again and again that Illinois came into the Union as\na slave State. How far the facts sustain the conclusion that\nhe draws, it is for intelligent and impartial men to decide. I\nleave it with you, with these remarks, worthy of being\nremembered, that that little thing, those few indentured\nservants being there, was of itself su\ufb00icient to modify a\nconstitution made by a people ardently desiring to have a\nfree constitution; showing the power of the actual presence\nof the institution of slavery to prevent any people, however\nanxious to make a free State, from making it perfectly so.\n I have been detaining you longer, perhaps, than I ought\nto do.\nI am in some doubt whether to introduce another topic\nupon which I could talk a while. [Cries of \u201cGo on,\u201d and\n\u201cGive us it.\u201d] It is this, then: Douglas\u2019s Popular sovereignty,\nas a principle, is simply this: If one man chooses to make a\nslave of another man, neither that man nor anybody else\nhas a right to object. Apply it to government, as he seeks to\napply it, and it is this: If, in a new Territory into which a few\npeople are beginning to enter for the purpose of making\ntheir homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from\ntheir limits, or to establish it there, however one or the\nother may a\ufb00ect the persons to be enslaved, or the\nin\ufb01nitely greater number of persons who are afterward to\ninhabit that Territory, or the other members of the family of\ncommunities of which they are but an incipient member, or\nthe general head of the family of States as parent of all,\nhowever their action may a\ufb00ect one or the other of these,\nthere is no power or right to interfere. That is Douglas\u2019s\npopular sovereignty applied. Now, I think that there is a\nreal popular sovereignty in the world. I think the de\ufb01nition\nof popular sovereignty, in the abstract, would be about this:\nthat each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself,\nand with all those things which exclusively concern him.\nApplied in government, this principle would be that a\ngeneral government shall do all those things which pertain\nto it, and all the local governments shall do precisely as\nthey please in respect to those matters which exclusively\nconcern them.\n Douglas looks upon slavery as so insigni\ufb01cant that the\npeople must decide that question for themselves; and yet\nthey are not \ufb01t to decide who shall be their governor, judge,\nor secretary, or who shall be any of their o\ufb00icers. These are\nvast national matters in his estimation; but the little matter\nin his estimation is that of planting slavery there. That is\npurely of local interest, which nobody should be allowed to\nsay a word about.\nLabor is the great source from which nearly all, if not all,\nhuman comforts and necessities are drawn. There is a\ndi\ufb00erence in opinion about the elements of labor in society.\nSome men assume that there is necessary connection\nbetween capital and labor, and that connection draws\nwithin it the whole of the labor of the community. They\nassume that nobody works unless capital excites them to\nwork. They begin next to consider what is the best way.\nThey say there are but two ways: one is to hire men, and to\nallure them to labor by their consent; the other is to buy\nthe men, and drive them, to it, and that is slavery. Having\nassumed that, they proceed to discuss the question of\nwhether the laborers themselves are better o\ufb00 in the\ncondition of slaves or of hired laborers, and they usually\ndecide that they are better o\ufb00 in the condition of slaves.\nIn the \ufb01rst place, I say that the whole thing is a mistake.\nThat there is a certain relation between capital and labor, I\nadmit. That it does exist, and rightfully exists, I think is\ntrue. That men who are industrious, and sober, and honest\nin the pursuit of their own interests should after a while\naccumulate capital, and after that should be allowed to\n enjoy it in peace, and also, if they should choose, when they\nhave accumulated it, to use it to save themselves from\nactual labor, and hire other people to labor for them, is\nright. In doing so they do not wrong the man they employ,\nfor they \ufb01nd men who have not of their own land to work\nupon, or shops to work in, and who are bene\ufb01ted by\nworking for others, hired laborers, receiving their capital\nfor it. Thus a few men, that own capital, hire a few others,\nand these establish the relation of capital and labor\nrightfully, a relation of which I make no complaint. But I\ninsist that that relation, after all, does not embrace more\nthan one eighth of the labor of the country.\n[The speaker proceeded to argue that the hired laborer,\nwith his ability to become an employer, must have every\nprecedence over him who labors under the inducement of\nforce. He continued:]\nI have taken upon myself in the name of some of you to\nsay that we expect upon these principles to ultimately beat\nthem. In order to do so, I think we want and must have a\nnational policy in regard to the institution of slavery that\nacknowledges and deals with that institution as being\nwrong. Whoever desires the prevention of the spread of\nslavery and the nationalization of that institution yields all\nwhen he yields to any policy that either recognizes slavery\nas being right or as being an indi\ufb00erent thing. Nothing will\nmake you successful but setting up a policy which shall\ntreat the thing as being wrong: When I say this, I do not\nmean to say that this General Government is charged with\nthe duty of redressing or preventing all the wrongs in the\n world, but I do think that it is charged with preventing and\nredressing all wrongs which are wrongs to itself. This\nGovernment is expressly charged with the duty of providing\nfor the general welfare. We believe that the spreading out\nand perpetuity of the institution of slavery impairs the\ngeneral welfare. We believe \u2014 nay, we know \u2014 that that is\nthe only thing that has ever threatened the perpetuity of\nthe Union itself. The only thing which has ever menaced\nthe destruction of the government under which we live is\nthis very thing. To repress this thing, we think, is, Providing\nfor the general welfare. Our friends in Kentucky di\ufb00er from\nus. We need not make our argument for them, but we who\nthink it is wrong in all its relations, or in some of them at\nleast, must decide as to our own actions and our own\ncourse, upon our own judgment.\nI say that we must not interfere with the institution of\nslavery in the States where it exists, because the\nConstitution forbids it, and the general welfare does not\nrequire us to do so. We must not withhold an e\ufb00icient\nFugitive Slave law, because the Constitution requires us, as\nI understand it, not to withhold such a law. But we must\nprevent the outspreading of the institution, because neither\nthe Constitution nor general welfare requires us to extend\nit. We must prevent the revival of the African slave trade,\nand the enacting by Congress of a Territorial slave code.\nWe must prevent each of these things being done by either\nCongresses or courts. The people of these United States\nare the rightful masters of both Congresses and courts, not\n to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men\nwho pervert the Constitution.\nTo do these things we must employ instrumentalities. We\nmust hold conventions; we must adopt platforms, if we\nconform to ordinary custom; we must nominate candidates;\nand we must carry elections. In all these things, I think that\nwe ought to keep in view our real purpose, and in none do\nanything that stands adverse to our purpose. If we shall\nadopt a platform that fails to recognize or express our\npurpose, or elect a man that declares himself inimical to\nour purpose, we not only take nothing by our success, but\nwe tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle than a\ndesire to have \u201cthe loaves and \ufb01shes,\u201d by which, in the end,\nour apparent success is really an injury to us.\nI know that this is very desirable with me, as with\neverybody else, that all the elements of the opposition shall\nunite in the next Presidential election and in all future time.\nI am anxious that that should be; but there are things\nseriously to be considered in relation to that matter. If the\nterms can be arranged, I am in favor of the union. But\nsuppose we shall take up some man, and put him upon one\nend or the other of the ticket, who declares himself against\nus in regard to the prevention of the spread of slavery, who\nturns up his nose and says he is tired of hearing anything\nmore about it, who is more against us than against the\nenemy, what will be the issue? Why, he will get no slave\nStates, after all, \u2014 he has tried that already until being\nbeat is the rule for him. If we nominate him upon that\nground, he will not carry a slave State; and not only so, but\n that portion of our men who are high-strung upon the\nprinciple we really \ufb01ght for will not go for him, and he\nwon\u2019t get a single electoral vote anywhere, except,\nperhaps, in the State of Maryland. There is no use in saying\nto us that we are stubborn and obstinate because we won\u2019t\ndo some such thing as this. We cannot do it. We cannot get\nour men to vote it. I speak by the card, that we cannot give\nthe State of Illinois in such case by \ufb01fty thousand. We\nwould be \ufb02atter down than the \u201cNegro Democracy\u201d\nthemselves have the heart to wish to see us.\nAfter saying this much let me say a little on the other\nside. There are plenty of men in the slave States that are\naltogether good enough for me to be either President or\nVice-President, provided they will profess their sympathy\nwith our purpose, and will place themselves on the ground\nthat our men, upon principle, can vote for them. There are\nscores of them, good men in their character for intelligence\nand talent and integrity. If such a one will place himself\nupon the right ground, I am for his occupying one place\nupon the next Republican or opposition ticket. I will\nheartily go for him. But unless he does so place himself, I\nthink it a matter of perfect nonsense to attempt to bring\nabout a union upon any other basis; that if a union be\nmade, the elements will scatter so that there can be no\nsuccess for such a ticket, nor anything like success. The\ngood old maxims of the Bible axe applicable, and truly\napplicable, to human a\ufb00airs, and in this, as in other things,\nwe may say here that he who is not for us is against us; he\nwho gathereth not with us, scattereth. I should be glad to\n have some of the many good and able and noble men of the\nSouth to place themselves where we can confer upon them\nthe high honor of an election upon one or the other end of\nour ticket. It would do my soul good to do that thing. It\nwould enable us to teach them that, inasmuch as we select\none of their own number to carry out our principles, we are\nfree from the charge that we mean more than we say.\nBut, my friends, I have detained you much longer than I\nexpected to do. I believe I may do myself the compliment to\nsay that you have stayed and heard me with great patience,\nfor which I return you my most sincere thanks.\n    \n    I    A I  \nTO EDWARD WALLACE.\nCLINTON, OCTOBER , \nDr. EDWARD WALLACE.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 I am here just now attending court.\nYesterday, before I left Spring\ufb01eld, your brother, Dr.\nWilliam S. Wallace, showed me a letter of yours, in which\nyou kindly mention my name, inquiring for my tari\ufb00 views,\nand suggest the propriety of my writing a letter upon the\nsubject. I was an old Henry-Clay-Tari\ufb00 Whig. In old times I\nmade more speeches on that subject than any other.\nI have not since changed my views. I believe yet, if we\ncould have a moderate, carefully adjusted protective tari\ufb00,\nso far acquiesced in as not to be a perpetual subject of\npolitical strife, squabbles changes, and uncertainties, it\nwould be better for us. Still it is my opinion that just now\nthe revival of that question will not advance the cause\nitself, or the man who revives it.\nI have not thought much on the subject recently, but my\ngeneral impression is that the necessity for a protective\ntari\ufb00 will ere long force its old opponents to take it up; and\nthen its old friends can join in and establish it on a more\n\ufb01rm and durable basis. We, the Old Whigs, have been\nentirely beaten out on the tari\ufb00 question, and we shall not\n be able to re-establish the policy until the absence of it\nshall have demonstrated the necessity for it in the minds of\nmen heretofore opposed to it. With this view, I should\nprefer to not now write a public letter on the subject. I\ntherefore wish this to be considered con\ufb01dential. I shall be\nvery glad to receive a letter from you.\nYours truly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \nA\n \nTO W. DUNGY.\nSPRINGFIELD, NOVEMBER, , .\nWM.

When a\nmortgage is given to secure two notes, and one of the notes\nis sold and assigned, if the mortgaged premises are only\nsu\ufb00icient to pay one note, the one assigned will take it all.\nAlso, an execution from a judgment on the assigned note\nmay take it all; it being the same thing in substance. There\nis redemption on execution sales from the United States\nCourt just as from any other court.\nYou did not mention the name of the plainti\ufb00 or\ndefendant in the suit, and so I can tell nothing about it as to\nsales, bids, etc. Write again.\nYours truly, A.

Why? Do the Republicans declare\nagainst the Union? Nothing like it. Your own statement of it\nis that if the Black Republicans elect a President, you\n\u201cwon\u2019t stand it.\u201d You will break up the Union. If we shall\nconstitutionally elect a President, it will be our duty to see\nthat you submit. Old John Brown has been executed for\ntreason against a State. We cannot object, even though he\nagreed with us in thinking slavery wrong. That cannot\nexcuse violence, bloodshed and treason. It could avail him\nnothing that he might think himself right. So, if we\nconstitutionally elect a President, and therefore you\nundertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal\nwith you as old John Brown has been dealt with. We shall\ntry to do our duty. We hope and believe that in no section\nwill a majority so act as to render such extreme measures\nnecessary.\n  \n \n. \n. \n    \n.  . H\n  A \n  A\n \n. H.\n  \n.\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. , \nMESSRS. DOLE, HUBBARD \n BROWN.\nGENT.: \u2014 Your favor of the th is at hand, and it gives\nme pleasure to be able to answer it. It is not my intention to\ntake part in any of the rivalries for the gubernatorial\nnomination; but the fear of being misunderstood upon that\nsubject ought not to deter me from doing justice to Mr.\nJudd, and preventing a wrong being done to him by the use\nof nay name in connection with alleged wrongs to me.\nIn answer to your \ufb01rst question, as to whether Mr. Judd\nwas guilty of any unfairness to me at the time of Senator\nTrumbull\u2019s \nelection, \nI \nanswer \nunhesitatingly \nin \nthe\nnegative; Mr. Judd owed no political allegiance to any party\nwhose candidate I was. He was in the Senate, holding over,\nhaving been elected by a Democratic Constituency. He\nnever was in any caucus of the friends who sought to make\nme U. S. Senator, never gave me any promises or pledges to\nsupport me, and subsequent events have greatly tended to\nprove the wisdom, politically, of Mr. Judd\u2019s course. The\nelection of Judge Trumbull strongly tended to sustain and\npreserve the position of that lion of the Democrats who\ncondemned the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and\n left them in a position of joining with us in forming the\nRepublican party, as was done at the Bloomington\nconvention in .\nDuring the canvass of  for the senatorship my belief\nwas, and still is, that I had no more sincere and faithful\nfriend than Mr. Judd \u2014 certainly none whom I trusted more.\nHis position as chairman of the State Central Committee\nled to my greater intercourse with him, and to my giving\nhim a larger share of my con\ufb01dence, than with or to almost\nany other friend; and I have never suspected that that\ncon\ufb01dence was, to any degree, misplaced.\nMy relations with Mr. Judo since the organization of the\nRepublican party, in, our State, in , and especially\nsince the adjournment of the Legislature in Feb., ,\nhave been so very intimate that I deem it an impossibility\nthat he could have been dealing treacherously with me. He\nhas also, at all times, appeared equally true and faithful to\nthe party. In his position as chairman of the committee, I\nbelieve he did all that any man could have done. The best of\nus are liable to commit errors, which become apparent by\nsubsequent developments; but I do not know of a single\nerror, even, committed by Mr. Judd, since he and I have\nacted together politically.\nI, had occasionally heard these insinuations against Mr.\nJudd, before the receipt of your letter; and in no instance\nhave I hesitated to pronounce them wholly unjust, to the\nfull extent of my knowledge and belief. I have been, and\nstill am, very anxious to take no part between the many\nfriends, all good and true, who are mentioned as candidates\n for a Republican gubernatorial nomination; but I can not\nfeel that my own honor is quite clear if I remain silent when\nI hear any one of them assailed about matters of which I\nbelieve I know more than his assailants.\nI take pleasure in adding that, of all the avowed friends I\nhad in the canvass of last year, I do not suspect any of\nhaving acted treacherously to me, or to our cause; and that\nthere is not one of them in whose honesty, honor, and\nintegrity I, today, have greater con\ufb01dence than I have in\nthose of Mr. Judd.\nI dislike to appear before the public in this matter; but\nyou are at liberty to make such use of this letter as you may\nthink justice requires.\nYours very truly,\nA.

FELL, Esq.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Herewith is a little sketch, as you\nrequested. There is not much of it, for the reason, I\nsuppose, that there is not much of me. If anything be made\nout of it, I wish it to be modest, and not to go beyond the\nmaterial. If it were thought necessary to incorporate\nanything from any of my speeches I suppose there would be\nno objection. Of course it must not appear to have been\nwritten by myself.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN\n\u2014\u2014 \u2014\nI was born February , , in Hardin County,\nKentucky. My parents were both born in Virginia, of\nundistinguished families \u2014 second families, perhaps I\nshould say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a\nfamily of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside in\nAdams, and others in Macon County, Illinois. My paternal\ngrandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from Rockingham\nCounty, Virginia, to Kentucky about  or , where a\nyear or two later he was killed by the Indians, not in battle,\nbut by stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the\n forest. His ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia\nfrom Berks County, Pennsylvania. An e\ufb00ort to identify them\nwith the New England family of the same name ended in\nnothing more de\ufb01nite than a similarity of Christian names\nin both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon,\nAbraham, and the like.\nMy father, at the death of his father, was but six years of\nage, and he grew up literally without education. He\nremoved from Kentucky to what is now Spencer County,\nIndiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home\nabout the time that State came into the Union. It was a wild\nregion, with many bears and other wild animals still in the\nwoods. There I grew up. There were some schools, so\ncalled, but no quali\ufb01cation was ever required of a teacher\nbeyond \u201creadin\u2019, writin\u2019, and cipherin\u201d\u2019 to the Rule of\nThree. If a straggler supposed to understand Latin\nhappened to sojourn in the neighborhood he was looked\nupon as a wizard. There was absolutely nothing to excite\nambition for education. Of course, when I came of age I did\nnot know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and\ncipher to the Rule of Three, but that was all. I have not\nbeen to school since. The little advance I now have upon\nthis store of education I have picked up from time to time\nunder the pressure of necessity.\nI was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was\ntwenty-two. At twenty-one I came to Illinois, Macon County.\nThen I got to New Salem, at that time in Sangamon, now in\nMenard County, where I remained a year as a sort of clerk\nin a store. Then came the Black Hawk war; and I was\n elected a captain of volunteers, a success which gave me\nmore pleasure than any I have had since. I went the\ncampaign, was elected, ran for the Legislature the same\nyear (), and was beaten \u2014 the only time I ever have\nbeen beaten by the people. The next and three succeeding\nbiennial elections I was elected to the Legislature. I was\nnot a candidate afterward. During this legislative period I\nhad studied law, and removed to Spring\ufb01eld to practice it.\nIn  I was once elected to the lower House of Congress.\nWas not a candidate for re-election. From  to ,\nboth inclusive, practiced law more assiduously than ever\nbefore. Always a Whig in politics; and generally on the\nWhig electoral tickets, making active canvasses. I was\nlosing interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise aroused me again. What I have done since\nthen is pretty well known.\nIf any personal description of me is thought desirable, it\nmay be said I am, in height, six feet four inches, nearly;\nlean in \ufb02esh, weighing on an average one hundred and\neighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair and\ngray eyes. No other marks or brands recollected.\nYours truly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \nI\nA I\n  \n  H  \nA I\nA   I   \nTo N. B. JUDD.\nSPRINGFIELD, FEBRUARY ,  HON. N. B. JUDD.\nDEAR Sir: \u2014 I am not in a position where it would hurt\nmuch for me to not be nominated on the national ticket; but\nI am where it would hurt some for me to not get the Illinois\ndelegates. What I expected when I wrote the letter to\nMessrs. \nDole \nand \nothers \nis \nnow \nhappening. \nYour\ndiscom\ufb01ted assailants are most bitter against me; and they\nwill, for revenge upon me, lay to the Bates egg in the\nSouth, and to the Seward egg in the North, and go far\ntoward squeezing me out in the middle with nothing. Can\nyou help me a little in this matter in your end of the\nvineyard. I mean this to be private.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN\n",
    "1862-1869": "  r.  I\n \n \n      \nI\n  .\nMY FRIENDS: \u2014 It will readily occur to you that I\ncannot, in half an hour, notice all the things that so able a\nman as Judge Douglas can say in an hour and a half; and I\nhope, therefore, if there be anything that he has said upon\nwhich you would like to hear something from me, but which\nI omit to comment upon, you will bear in mind that it would\nbe expecting an impossibility for me to go over his whole\nground. I can but take up some of the points that he has\ndwelt upon, and employ my half-hour specially on them.\nThe \ufb01rst thing I have to say to you is a word in regard to\nJudge Douglas\u2019s declaration about the \u201cvulgarity and\nblackguardism\u201d in the audience, that no such thing, as he\nsays, was shown by any Democrat while I was speaking.\nNow, I only wish, by way of reply on this subject, to say that\nwhile \nI \nwas \nspeaking, \nI \nused \nno \n\u201cvulgarity \nor\nblackguardism\u201d toward any Democrat.\nNow, my friends, I come to all this long portion of the\nJudge\u2019s speech, \u2014 perhaps half of it, \u2014 which he has\ndevoted to the various resolutions and platforms that have\nbeen adopted in the di\ufb00erent counties in the di\ufb00erent\nCongressional districts, and in the Illinois legislature,\nwhich he supposes are at variance with the positions I have\nassumed before you to-day. It is true that many of these\n resolutions are at variance with the positions I have here\nassumed. All I have to ask is that we talk reasonably and\nrationally about it. I happen to know, the Judge\u2019s opinion to\nthe contrary notwithstanding, that I have never tried to\nconceal my opinions, nor tried to deceive any one in\nreference to them. He may go and examine all the members\nwho voted for me for United States Senator in , after\nthe election of . They were pledged to certain things\nhere at home, and were determined to have pledges from\nme; and if he will \ufb01nd any of these persons who will tell him\nanything inconsistent with what I say now, I will resign, or\nrather retire from the race, and give him no more trouble.\nThe plain truth is this: At the introduction of the Nebraska\npolicy, we believed there was a new era being introduced in\nthe history of the Republic, which tended to the spread and\nperpetuation of slavery. But in our opposition to that\nmeasure we did not agree with one another in everything.\nThe people in the north end of the State were for stronger\nmeasures of opposition than we of the central and southern\nportions of the State, but we were all opposed to the\nNebraska doctrine. We had that one feeling and that one\nsentiment in common. You at the north end met in your\nconventions and passed your resolutions. We in the middle\nof the State and farther south did not hold such\nconventions and pass the same resolutions, although we\nhad in general a common view and a common sentiment.\nSo that these meetings which the Judge has alluded to, and\nthe resolutions he has read from, were local, and did not\nspread over the whole State. We at last met together in\n , from all parts of the State, and we agreed upon a\ncommon platform. You, who held more extreme notions,\neither yielded those notions, or, if not wholly yielding them,\nagreed to yield them practically, for the sake of embodying\nthe opposition to the measures which the opposite party\nwere pushing forward at that time. We met you then, and if\nthere was anything yielded, it was for practical purposes.\nWe agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout\nthe entire State of Illinois, and now we are all bound, as a\nparty, to that platform.\nAnd I say here to you, if any one expects of me \u2014 in case\nof my election \u2014 that I will do anything not signi\ufb01ed by our\nRepublican platform and my answers here to-day, I tell you\nvery frankly that person will be deceived. I do not ask for\nthe vote of any one who supposes that I have secret\npurposes or pledges that I dare not speak out. Cannot the\nJudge be satis\ufb01ed? If he fears, in the unfortunate case of\nmy election, that my going to Washington will enable me to\nadvocate sentiments contrary to those which I expressed\nwhen you voted for and elected me, I assure him that his\nfears are wholly needless and groundless. Is the Judge\nreally afraid of any such thing? I\u2019ll tell you what he is afraid\nof. He is afraid we\u2019ll all pull together. This is what alarms\nhim more than anything else. For my part, I do hope that all\nof us, entertaining a common sentiment in opposition to\nwhat appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate\nslavery, will waive minor di\ufb00erences on questions which\neither belong to the dead past or the distant future, and all\npull together in this struggle. What are your sentiments? If\n it be true that on the ground which I occupy \u2014 ground\nwhich I occupy as frankly and boldly as Judge Douglas does\nhis, \u2014 my views, though partly coinciding with yours, are\nnot as perfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are,\nI do say to you in all candor, go for him, and not for me. I\nhope to deal in all things fairly with Judge Douglas, and\nwith the people of the State, in this contest. And if I should\nnever be elected to any o\ufb00ice, I trust I may go down with\nno stain of falsehood upon my reputation, notwithstanding\nthe hard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of\nme.\nThe Judge has again addressed himself to the Abolition\ntendencies of a speech of mine made at Spring\ufb01eld in June\nlast. I have so often tried to answer what he is always\nsaying on that melancholy theme that I almost turn with\ndisgust from the discussion, \u2014 from the repetition of an\nanswer to it. I trust that nearly all of this intelligent\naudience have read that speech. If you have, I may venture\nto leave it to you to inspect it closely, and see whether it\ncontains any of those \u201cbugaboos\u201d which frighten Judge\nDouglas.\nThe Judge complains that I did not fully answer his\nquestions. If I have the sense to comprehend and answer\nthose questions, I have done so fairly. If it can be pointed\nout to me how I can more fully and fairly answer him, I aver\nI have not the sense to see how it is to be done. He says I\ndo not declare I would in any event vote for the admission\nof a slave State into the Union. If I have been fairly\nreported, he will see that I did give an explicit answer to\n his interrogatories; I did not merely say that I would dislike\nto be put to the test, but I said clearly, if I were put to the\ntest, and a Territory from which slavery had been excluded\nshould present herself with a State constitution sanctioning\nslavery, \u2014 a most extraordinary thing, and wholly unlikely\nto happen, \u2014 I did not see how I could avoid voting for her\nadmission. But he refuses to understand that I said so, and\nhe wants this audience to understand that I did not say so.\nYet it will be so reported in the printed speech that he\ncannot help seeing it.\nHe says if I should vote for the admission of a slave State\nI would be voting for a dissolution of the Union, because I\nhold that the Union cannot permanently exist half slave and\nhalf free. I repeat that I do not believe this government can\nendure permanently half slave and half free; yet I do not\nadmit, nor does it at all follow, that the admission of a\nsingle slave State will permanently \ufb01x the character and\nestablish this as a universal slave nation. The Judge is very\nhappy indeed at working up these quibbles. Before leaving\nthe subject of answering questions, I aver as my con\ufb01dent\nbelief, when you come to see our speeches in print, that you\nwill \ufb01nd every question which he has asked me more fairly\nand boldly and fully answered than he has answered those\nwhich I put to him. Is not that so? The two speeches may be\nplaced side by side, and I will venture to leave it to\nimpartial judges whether his questions have not been more\ndirectly and circumstantially answered than mine.\nJudge Douglas says he made a charge upon the editor of\nthe Washington Union, alone, of entertaining a purpose to\n rob the States of their power to exclude slavery from their\nlimits. I undertake to say, and I make the direct issue, that\nhe did not make his charge against the editor of the Union\nalone. I will undertake to prove by the record here that he\nmade that charge against more and higher dignitaries than\nthe editor of the Washington Union. I am quite aware that\nhe was shirking and dodging around the form in which he\nput it, but I can make it manifest that he leveled his \u201cfatal\nblow\u201d against more persons than this Washington editor.\nWill he dodge it now by alleging that I am trying to defend\nMr. Buchanan against the charge? Not at all. Am I not\nmaking the same charge myself? I am trying to show that\nyou, Judge Douglas, are a witness on my side. I am not\ndefending Buchanan, and I will tell Judge Douglas that in\nmy opinion, when he made that charge, he had an eye\nfarther north than he has to-day. He was then \ufb01ghting\nagainst people who called him a Black Republican and an\nAbolitionist. It is mixed all through his speech, and it is\ntolerably manifest that his eye was a great deal farther\nnorth than it is to-day. The Judge says that though he made\nthis charge, Toombs got up and declared there was not a\nman in the United States, except the editor of the Union,\nwho was in favor of the doctrines put forth in that article.\nAnd thereupon I understand that the Judge withdrew the\ncharge. \nAlthough \nhe \nhad \ntaken \nextracts \nfrom \nthe\nnewspaper, and then from the Lecompton Constitution, to\nshow the existence of a conspiracy to bring about a \u201cfatal\nblow,\u201d by which the States were to be deprived of the right\nof excluding slavery, it all went to pot as soon as Toombs\n got up and told him it was not true. It reminds me of the\nstory that John Phoenix, the California railroad surveyor,\ntells. He says they started out from the Plaza to the Mission\nof Dolores. They had two ways of determining distances.\nOne was by a chain and pins taken over the ground. The\nother was by a \u201cgo-it-ometer,\u201d \u2014 an invention of his own, \u2014\na three-legged instrument, with which he computed a\nseries of triangles between the points. At night he turned to\nthe chain-man to ascertain what distance they had come,\nand found that by some mistake he had merely dragged the\nchain over the ground, without keeping any record. By the\n\u201cgo-it-ometer,\u201d he found he had made ten miles. Being\nskeptical about this, he asked a drayman who was passing\nhow far it was to the Plaza. The drayman replied it was just\nhalf a mile; and the surveyor put it down in his book, \u2014 just\nas Judge Douglas says, after he had made his calculations\nand computations, he took Toombs\u2019s statement. I have no\ndoubt that after Judge Douglas had made his charge, he\nwas as easily satis\ufb01ed about its truth as the surveyor was of\nthe drayman\u2019s statement of the distance to the Plaza. Yet it\nis a fact that the man who put forth all that matter which\nDouglas deemed a \u201cfatal blow\u201d at State sovereignty was\nelected by the Democrats as public printer.\nNow, gentlemen, you may take Judge Douglas\u2019s speech of\nMarch , , beginning about the middle of page ,\nand reading to the bottom of page , and you will \ufb01nd the\nevidence on which I say that he did not make his charge\nagainst the editor of the Union alone. I cannot stop to read\nit, but I will give it to the reporters. Judge Douglas said:\n \u201cMr. \nPresident, \nyou \nhere \n\ufb01nd \nseveral \ndistinct\npropositions advanced boldly by the Washington Union\neditorially, and apparently authoritatively, and every man\nwho questions any of them is denounced as an Abolitionist,\na Free-soiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, \ufb01rst, that the\nprimary object of all government at its original institution is\nthe protection of persons and property; second, that the\nConstitution of the United States declares that the citizens\nof each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and\nimmunities of citizens in the several States; and that,\ntherefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or\notherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from\nsettling in another with their slave property, and especially\ndeclaring it forfeited, are direct violations of the original\nintention of the Government and Constitution of the United\nStates; and, fourth, that the emancipation of the slaves of\nthe Northern States was a gross outrage on the rights of\nproperty, in as much as it was involuntarily done on the\npart of the owner.\n\u201cRemember that this article was published in the Union\non the th of November, and on the th appeared the\n\ufb01rst article giving the adhesion of the Union to the\nLecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\n\u201c\u2018KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION. \u2014 The vexed\nquestion is settled. The problem is solved. The dead point\nof danger is passed. All serious trouble to Kansas a\ufb00airs is\nover and gone....\u201d\n\u201cAnd a column, nearly, of the same sort. Then, when you\ncome to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you \ufb01nd the\n same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth\neditorially in the Union. What is it?\n\u201c\u2018ARTICLE , Section i. The right of property is before\nand higher than any constitutional sanction; and the right\nof the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the\nsame and as invariable as the right of the owner of any\nproperty whatever.\u2019\n\u201cThen in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution\nmay be amended after  by a two-thirds vote.\n\u201c\u2018But no alteration shall be made to a\ufb00ect the right of\nproperty in the ownership of slaves.\u2019\n\u201cIt will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton\nConstitution that they are identical in spirit with this\nauthoritative article in the Washington Union of the day\nprevious to its indorsement of this Constitution.\n\u201cWhen I saw that article in the Union of the th of\nNovember, followed by the glori\ufb01cation of the Lecompton\nConstitution on the th of November, and this clause in\nthe Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no\nright to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there\nwas a fatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the\nStates of this Union.\u201d\nHere he says, \u201cMr. President, you here \ufb01nd several\ndistinct propositions advanced boldly, and apparently\nauthoritatively.\u201d By whose authority, Judge Douglas? Again,\nhe says in another place, \u201cIt will be seen by these clauses in\nthe Lecompton Constitution that they are identical in spirit\nwith this authoritative article.\u201d By whose authority, \u2014 who\ndo you mean to say authorized the publication of these\n articles? \nHe \nknows \nthat \nthe \nWashington \nUnion \nis\nconsidered the organ of the Administration. I demand of\nJudge Douglas by whose authority he meant to say those\narticles were published, if not by the authority of the\nPresident of the United States and his Cabinet? I defy him\nto show whom he referred to, if not to these high\nfunctionaries in the Federal Government. More than this,\nhe says the articles in that paper and the provisions of the\nLecompton \nConstitution \nare \n\u201cidentical,\u201d \nand, \nbeing\nidentical, he argues that the authors are co-operating and\nconspiring \ntogether. \nHe \ndoes \nnot \nuse \nthe \nword\n\u201cconspiring,\u201d but what other construction can you put upon\nit? He winds up:\n\u201cWhen I saw that article in the Union of the th of\nNovember, followed by the glori\ufb01cation of the Lecompton\nConstitution on the th of November, and this clause in\nthe Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no\nright to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there\nwas a fatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the\nStates of this Union.\u201d\nI ask him if all this fuss was made over the editor of this\nnewspaper. It would be a terribly \u201cfatal blow\u201d indeed which\na single man could strike, when no President, no Cabinet\no\ufb00icer, no member of Congress, was giving strength and\ne\ufb00iciency to the movement. Out of respect to Judge\nDouglas\u2019s good sense I must believe he did n\u2019t manufacture\nhis idea of the \u201cfatal\u201d character of that blow out of such a\nmiserable scapegrace as he represents that editor to be.\nBut the Judge\u2019s eye is farther south now. Then, it was very\n peculiarly and decidedly north. His hope rested on the idea\nof visiting the great \u201cBlack Republican\u201d party, and making\nit the tail of his new kite. He knows he was then expecting\nfrom day to day to turn Republican, and place himself at\nthe head of our organization. He has found that these\ndespised \u201cBlack Republicans\u201d estimate him by a standard\nwhich he has taught them none too well. Hence he is\ncrawling back into his old camp, and you will \ufb01nd him\neventually installed in full fellowship among those whom he\nwas then battling, and with whom he now pretends to be at\nsuch fearful variance.\n     \n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   \n  I A\n.\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., January ,\n. . p.m.\nGENERAL SULLIVAN, Harper\u2019s Ferry:\nHave you anything new from Winchester, Martinsburg or\nthereabouts?\nA.

Of course I am not the\nmost impartial judge; yet, with due allowance for this, I\nventure to hope that the article entitled \u201cThe President\u2019s\nPolicy\u201d will be of value to the country. I fear I am not\nworthy of all which is therein kindly said of me personally.\nThe sentence of twelve lines, commencing at the top of\npage , I could wish to be not exactly what it is. In what\nis there expressed, the writer has not correctly understood\nme. I have never had a theory that secession could absolve\nStates or people from their obligations. Precisely the\ncontrary is asserted in the inaugural address; and it was\nbecause of my belief in the continuation of those\nobligations that I was puzzled, for a time, as to denying the\nlegal rights of those citizens who remained individually\ninnocent of treason or rebellion. But I mean no more now\nthan to merely call attention to this point.\nYours respectfully, A.

LINCOLN.\n  H    \n   \n   H   \nA\n I A I\n  \n  A\nA I\nTOLD BY THE PRESIDENT, TO THE ARTIST F. B.\nCARPENTER, \nFEBRUARY , .\n\u201cIt had got to be,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201cmidsummer, .\nThings had gone on from bad to worse, until I felt that we\nhad reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations\nwe had been pursuing; that we had about played our last\ncard, and must change our tactics, or lose the game. I now\ndetermined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy;\nand without consultation with, or the knowledge of, the\nCabinet, I prepared the original draft of the proclamation,\nand, after much anxious thought, called a Cabinet meeting\nupon the subject. This was the last of July or the \ufb01rst part\nof the month of August, . [The exact date was July ,\n.]... All were present excepting Mr. Blair, the\nPostmaster-General, who was absent at the opening of the\ndiscussion, but came in subsequently. I said to the Cabinet\nthat I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them\ntogether to ask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of\na proclamation before them, suggestions as to which would\nbe in order after they had heard it read. Mr. Lovejoy was in\nerror when he informed you that it excited no comment\nexcepting on the part of Secretary Seward. Various\n suggestions were o\ufb00ered. Secretary Chase wished the\nlanguage stronger in reference to the arming of the blacks.\n\u201cMr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the policy on the\nground that it would cost the administration the fall\nelections. Nothing, however, was o\ufb00ered that I had not\nalready fully anticipated and settled in my mind, until\nSecretary Seward spoke. He said in substance, \u2018Mr.\nPresident, I approve of the proclamation, but I question the\nexpediency of its issue at this juncture. The depression of\nthe public mind, consequent upon our repeated reverses, is\nso great that I fear the e\ufb00ect of so important a step. It may\nbe viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government,\na cry for help; the government stretching forth its hands to\nEthiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to\nthe government.\u2019 His idea,\u201d said the President, \u201cwas that it\nwould be considered our last shriek on the retreat.\u201d [This\nwas his precise expression.] \u2018Now,\u2019 continued Mr. Seward,\n\u2018while I approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that you\npostpone its issue until you can give it to the country\nsupported by military success, instead of issuing it, as\nwould be the case now, upon the greatest disasters of the\nwar.\u2019 Mr. Lincoln continued \u201cThe wisdom of the view of the\nSecretary of State struck me with very great force. It was\nan aspect of the case that, in all my thought upon the\nsubject, I had entirely overlooked. The result was that I put\nthe draft of the proclamation aside, as you do your sketch\nfor a picture, waiting for a victory.\n\u201cFrom time to time I added or changed a line, touching it\nup here and there, anxiously watching the process of\n events. Well, the next news we had was of Pope\u2019s disaster\nat Bull Run. Things looked darker than ever. Finally came\nthe week of the battle of Antietam. I determined to wait no\nlonger. The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the\nadvantage was on our side. I was then staying at the\nSoldiers\u2019 Home [three miles out of Washington]. Here I\n\ufb01nished writing the second draft of the preliminary\nproclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet\ntogether to hear it, and it was published on the following\nMonday.\u201d\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A    \nI  .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February ,\n.\nMAJOR-GENERAL SEDGWICK, ARMY of Potomac:\nUnless there be some strong reason to the contrary,\nplease send General Kilpatrick to us here, for two or three\ndays.\nA.

FISHBACK, Little Rock, Arkansas: When I\n\ufb01xed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in ignorance\nthat your convention was doing the same work. Since I\nlearned the latter fact I have been constantly trying to yield\nmy plan to them. I have sent two letters to General Steele,\nand three or four despatches to you and others, saying that\nhe, General Steele, must be master, but that it will probably\nbe best for him to merely help the convention on its own\nplan. Some single mind must be master, else there will be\nno \nagreement \nin \nanything, \nand \nGeneral \nSteele,\ncommanding the military and being on the ground, is the\nbest man to be that master. Even now citizens are\ntelegraphing me to postpone the election to a later day\nthan either that \ufb01xed by the convention or by me. This\ndiscord must be silenced.\nA.

I should have \ufb01xed no day\nfor an election, presented no plan for reconstruction, had I\nknown the convention was doing the same things. It is\nprobably best that you merely assist the convention on\ntheir own plan, as to election day and all other matters I\nhave already written and telegraphed this half a dozen\ntimes.\nA.

In my reply to Mr. Jordan, which was\nbrief and hurried, I intended to say that in the county and\nState elections of Tennessee, the oath prescribed in the\nproclamation of Governor Johnson on the twenty-sixth of\nJanuary, , ordering an election in Tennessee on the\n\ufb01rst Saturday in March next, is entirely satisfactory to me\nas a test of loyalty of all persons proposing or o\ufb00ering to\nvote in said elections; and coming from him would better be\nobserved and followed. There is no con\ufb02ict between the\noath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth December,\n, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in his\nproclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo.\nNo person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth\nDecember, , and obtained a pardon thereby, and who\nintends to observe the same in good faith, should have any\nobjection to taking that prescribed by Governor Johnson as\na test of loyalty.\n I \nhave \nseen \nand \nexamined \nGovernor \nJohnson\u2019s\nproclamation, and am entirely satis\ufb01ed with his plan, which\nis to restore the State government and place it under the\ncontrol of citizens truly loyal to the Government of the\nUnited States.\nA.

SECRETARY OF WAR.\nSIR: \u2014 You ask some instructions from me in relation to\nthe Report of Special Commission constituted by an order\nof the War Department, dated December , , \u201cto revise\nthe enrolment and quotas of the City and State of New\nYork, and report whether there be any, and what, errors or\nirregularities therein, and what corrections, if any, should\nbe made.\u201d\nIn the correspondence between the Governor of New\nYork and myself last summer, I understood him to complain\nthat the enrolments in several of the districts of that State\nhad been neither accurately nor honestly made; and in view\nof this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered\nan arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the\ndistricts wherein they seemed too large, and said: \u201cAfter\nthis drawing, these four districts, and also the seventeenth\nand twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled, and, if you\nplease, agents of yours may witness every step of the\nprocess.\u201d In a subsequent letter I believe some additional\ndistricts were put into the list of those to be re-enrolled. My\nidea was to do the work over according to the law, in\npresence of the complaining party, and thereby to correct\n anything which might be found amiss. The commission,\nwhose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded\nupon a totally di\ufb00erent idea. Not going forth to \ufb01nd men at\nall, \nthey \nhave \nproceeded \naltogether \nupon \npaper\nexaminations \nand \nmental \nprocesses. \nOne \nof \ntheir\nconclusions, as I understand, is that, as the law stands, and\nattempting to follow it, the enrolling o\ufb00icers could not have\nmade the enrolments much more accurately than they did.\nThe report on this point might be useful to Congress. The\ncommission conclude that the quotas for the draft should\nbe based upon entire population, and they proceed upon\nthis basis to give a table for the State of New York, in which\nsome districts are reduced and some increased. For the\nnow ensuing draft, let the quotas stand as made by the\nenrolling o\ufb00icers, in the districts wherein this table\nrequires them to be increased; and let them be reduced\naccording to the table in the others: this to be no precedent\nfor subsequent action. But, as I think this report may, on\nfull consideration, be shown to have much that is valuable\nin it, I suggest that such consideration be given it, and that\nit be especially considered whether its suggestions can be\nconformed to without an alteration of the law.\nYours truly,\nA. LINCOLN. TELEGRAM TO GENERAL THOMAS.\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February , .\nGENERAL L.

Now, on consideration I \ufb01nd there\nis really very little to say. My knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy\u2019s\nletter having been made public came to me only the day\nyou wrote; but I had, in spite of myself, known of its\nexistence several days before. I have not yet read it, and I\nthink I shall not. I was not shocked or surprised by the\nappearance of the letter, because I had had knowledge of\nMr. Pomeroy\u2019s committee, and of secret issues which, I\nsupposed, came from it, and of secret agents who, I\nsupposed, were sent out by it for several weeks. I have\nknown just as little a these things as my friends have\nallowed me to know. They bring the documents to me, but I\ndo not read them; they tell me what they think \ufb01t to tell me,\nbut I do not inquire for more.\nI fully concur with you that neither of us can justly be\nheld responsible for what our respective friends may do\n without our instigation or countenance and I assure you, as\nyou have assured me, that no assault has been made upon\nyou by my instigation, or with my countenance.\nWhether you shall remain at the head of the Treasury\nDepartment is a question which I will not allow myself to\nconsider from any standpoint other than my judgment of\nthe public service, and, in that view, I do not perceive\noccasion for a change.\nYours truly, A.

He hopes to be useful, without\ncharge to the government, in facilitating the introduction of\nthe free-labor system on the Mississippi plantations. He is\nacquainted with, and has access to, many of the planters\nwho wish to adopt the system. He will show you two letters\nof mine on this subject, one somewhat General, and the\nother relating to named persons; they are not di\ufb00erent in\nprinciple. He will also show you some suggestions coming\nfrom some of the planters themselves. I desire that all I\npromise in these letters, so far as practicable, may be in\ngood faith carried out, and that suggestions from the\nplanters may be heard and adopted, so far as they may not\ncontravene the principles stated, nor justice, nor fairness,\nto laborers.

This extraordinary war in\nwhich we are engaged falls heavily upon all classes of\npeople but the most heavily upon the soldier. For it has\nbeen said, \u201cAll that a man hath will he give for his life;\u201d and\nwhile all contribute of their substance, the soldier puts his\nlife at stake, and often yields it up in his country\u2019s cause.\nThe highest merit, then, is due to the soldier.\nIn this extraordinary war, extraordinary developments\nhave manifested themselves, such as have not been seen in\nformer wars; and among these manifestations nothing has\nbeen more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of\nsu\ufb00ering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents of\nthese fairs are the women of America.\nI am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy: I\nhave never studied the art of paying compliments to\nwomen; but I must say, that if all that has been said by\norators and poets since the creation of the world in praise\nof women were applied to the women of America, it would\nnot do them justice for their conduct during this war. I will\nclose by saying, God bless the women of America.\n        \n A  \nI       \n  H\n  I\n \n   A  \n IA I\n \n  \n \n  \n  \nMARCH , .\nGENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:\nThe honorary membership in your association, as\ngenerously tendered, is gratefully accepted.\nYou comprehend, as your address shows, that the\nexisting rebellion means more and tends to do more than\nthe perpetuation of African slavery \u2014 that it is, in fact, a\nwar upon the rights of all working people. Partly to show\nthat this view has not escaped my attention, and partly that\nI cannot better express myself, I read a passage from the\nmessage to Congress in December, :\n\u201cIt continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if\nnot exclusively, a war upon the \ufb01rst principle of popular\ngovernment, the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence\nof this is found in the most grave and maturely considered\npublic documents, as well as in the General tone of the\ninsurgents. In those documents we \ufb01nd the abridgment of\nthe existing right of su\ufb00rage, and the denial to the people\nof all right to participate in the selection of public o\ufb00icers,\nexcept the legislature, boldly advocated, with labored\nargument to prove that large control of the people in\ngovernment is the source of all political evil. Monarchy\n itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the\npower of the people. In my present position I could scarcely\nbe justi\ufb01ed were I to omit raising a warning voice against\nthis approach of returning despotism.\n\u201cIt is not needed, nor \ufb01tting here, that a General\nargument should be made in favor of popular institutions;\nbut there is one point, with its connections, not so\nhackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention.\nIt is the e\ufb00ort to place capital on an equal footing, if not\nabove labor, in the structure of government. It is assumed\nthat labor is available only in connection with capital; that\nnobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital,\nsomehow by the use of it induces him to labor. This\nassumed, it is next considered whether it is best that\ncapital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by\ntheir own consent or buy them, and drive them to it without\ntheir consent. Having proceeded so it is naturally\nconcluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or\nwhat we call slaves. And, further, it is assumed that\nwhoever is once a hired laborer, is \ufb01xed in that condition\nfor life. Now there is no such relation between capital and\nlabor as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man\nbeing \ufb01xed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both\nthese assumptions are false, and all inferences from them\nare groundless.\n\u201cLabor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is\nonly the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor\nhad not \ufb01rst existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and\ndeserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its\n rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other\nrights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always\nwill be, a relation between capital and labor, producing\nmutual bene\ufb01ts. The error is in assuming that the whole\nlabor of a community exists within that relation. A few men\nown capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and, with\ntheir capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them. A\nlarge majority belong to neither class \u2014 neither work for\nothers, nor have others working for them. In most of the\nSouthern States, a majority of the whole people, of all\ncolors, are neither slaves nor masters; while in the\nNorthern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired.\nMen with their families, wives, sons, and daughters \u2014 work\nfor themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their\nshops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking\nno favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers\nor slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a\nconsiderable number of persons mingle their own labor\nwith capital; that is, they labor with their own hands, and\nalso buy or hire others to labor for them, but this is only a\nmixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is\ndisturbed by the existence of this mixed class.\n\u201cAgain, as has already been said, there is not, of\nnecessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer being\n\ufb01xed to that condition for life. Many independent men\neverywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives,\nwere hired laborers. The prudent penniless beginner in the\nworld labors for wages a while, saves a surplus with which\nto buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own\n account another while, and at length hires another new\nbeginner to help him. This is the just and generous and\nprosperous system which opens the way to all \u2014 gives hope\nto \nall, \nand \nconsequent \nenergy \nand \nprogress, \nand\nimprovement of condition to all. No men living are more\nworthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty \u2014\nnone less inclined to touch or take aught which they have\nnot honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a\npolitical power they already possess, and which, if\nsurrendered, will surely be used to close the door of\nadvancement against such as they, and to \ufb01x new\ndisabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall\nbe lost.\u201d\nThe views then expressed remain unchanged, nor have I\nmuch to add. None are so deeply interested to resist the\npresent rebellion as the working people. Let them beware\nof prejudices, working division and hostility among\nthemselves. The most notable feature of a disturbance in\nyour city last summer was the hanging of some working\npeople by other working people. It should never be so. The\nstrongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the family\nrelation, should be one uniting all working people, of all\nnations, and tongues, and kindreds. Nor should this lead to\na war upon property, or the owners of property. Property is\nthe fruit of labor; property is desirable; is a positive good in\nthe world. That some should be rich shows that others may\nbecome rich, and, hence, is just encouragement to industry\nand enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the\nhouse of another, but let him labor diligently and build one\n for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be\nsafe from violence when built.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   \n    .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, FORT Monroe, Va.: Hon.

H\n  .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April , .\nA. G. HODGES, ESQ., Frankfort, Kentucky:\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 You ask me to put in writing the\nsubstance of what I verbally said the other day, in your\npresence, to Governor Bramlette and Senator Dixon. It was\nabout as follows:\n\u201cI am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong,\nnothing is wrong. I cannot remember when I did not so\nthink and feel, and yet I have never understood that the\nPresidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act\no\ufb00icially upon this judgment and feeling. It was in the oath\nI took that I would to the best of my ability preserve,\nprotect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. I\ncould not take the o\ufb00ice without taking the oath. Nor was it\nmy view that I might take an oath to get power, and break\nthe oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in\nordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to\npractically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the\nmoral question of slavery. I had publicly declared this many\ntimes, and in many ways. And I aver that, to this day, I have\ndone no o\ufb00icial act in mere deference to my abstract\njudgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand, however,\nthat my oath to preserve the Constitution to the best of my\n ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by every\nindispensable means, that government, that nation, of\nwhich that Constitution was the organic law. Was it possible\nto lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution? By\nGeneral law, life and limb must be protected; yet often a\nlimb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never\nwisely given to save a limb. I felt that measures, otherwise\nunconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming\nindispensable to the preservation of the Constitution,\nthrough the preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I\nassumed this ground, and now avow it. I could not feel that\nto the best of my ability I had even tried to preserve the\nConstitution, if, to save slavery, or any minor matter, I\nshould permit the wreck of government, country, and\nConstitution, altogether. When, early in the war, General\nFremont attempted military emancipation, I forbade it,\nbecause I did not then think it an indispensable necessity.\nWhen, a little later, General Cameron, then Secretary of\nWar, suggested the arming of the blacks, I objected,\nbecause I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity.\nWhen, still later, General Hunter attempted military\nemancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think\nthe indispensable necessity had come. When, in March, and\nMay, and July, , I made earnest and successive appeals\nto the Border States to favor compensated emancipation, I\nbelieved \nthe \nindispensable \nnecessity \nfor \nmilitary\nemancipation and arming the blacks would come, unless\naverted by that measure. They declined the proposition,\nand I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of\n either surrendering the Union, and with it the Constitution,\nor of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose\nthe latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss,\nbut of this I was not entirely con\ufb01dent. More than a year of\ntrial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none\nin our home popular sentiment, none in our white military\nforce, no loss by it any how, or anywhere. On the contrary,\nit shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand\nsoldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts,\nabout which, as facts, there can be no caviling. We have the\nmen; and we could not have had them without the measure.\n\u201cAnd now let any Union man who complains of the\nmeasure test himself by writing down in one line that he is\nfor subduing the rebellion by force of arms; and in the next,\nthat he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men\nfrom the Union side, and placing them where they would be\nbut for the measure he condemns. If he cannot face his\ncase so stated, it is only because he cannot face the truth.\u201d\nI add a word which was not in the verbal conversation. In\ntelling this tale I attempt no compliment to my own\nsagacity. I claim not to have controlled events, but confess\nplainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of\nthree years\u2019 struggle, the nation\u2019s condition is not what\neither party, or any man, devised or expected. God alone\ncan claim it. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now\nwills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of\nthe North, as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for\nour complicity in that wrong, impartial history will \ufb01nd\n therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and\ngoodness of God.\nYours truly,\nA.

Is there any\ngood objection?\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n   \n  I    \nADDRESS AT SANITARY FAIR IN BALTIMORE,\nAPRIL , .\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: \u2014 Calling to mind that we\nare in Baltimore, we cannot fail to note that the world\nmoves. Looking upon these many people assembled here to\nserve, as they best may, the soldiers of the Union, it occurs\nat once that three years ago the same soldiers could not so\nmuch as pass through Baltimore. The change from then till\nnow is both great and gratifying. Blessings on the brave\nmen who have wrought the change, and the fair women\nwho strive to reward them for it!\nBut Baltimore suggests more than could happen within\nBaltimore. The change within Baltimore is part only of a far\nwider change. When the war began, three years ago,\nneither party, nor any man, expected it would last till now.\nEach looked for the end, in some way, long ere to-day.\nNeither did any anticipate that domestic slavery would be\nmuch a\ufb00ected by the war. But here we are; the war has not\nended, and slavery has been much a\ufb00ected how much\nneeds not now to be recounted. So true is it that man\nproposes and God disposes.\nBut we can see the past, though we may not claim to\nhave directed it; and seeing it, in this case, we feel more\n hopeful and con\ufb01dent for the future.\nThe world has never had a good de\ufb01nition of the word\nliberty, and the American people, just now, are much in\nwant of one. We all declare for liberty; but in using the\nsame word we do not all mean the same thing. With some\nthe word liberty may mean for each man to do as he\npleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while\nwith others the same word may mean for some men to do\nas they please with other men, and the product of other\nmen\u2019s labor. Here are two, not only di\ufb00erent, but\nincompatible things, called by the same name, liberty. And\nit follows that each of the things is, by the respective\nparties, called by two di\ufb00erent and incompatible names \u2014\nliberty and tyranny.\nThe shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep\u2019s throat, for\nwhich the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while\nthe wolf denounces him for the same act, as the destroyer\nof liberty, especially as the sheep was a black one. Plainly,\nthe sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a de\ufb01nition of\nthe word liberty; and precisely the same di\ufb00erence prevails\nto-day among us human creatures, even in the North, and\nall professing to love liberty. Hence we behold the process\nby which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke\nof bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty, and\nbewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty.\nRecently, as it seems, the people of Maryland have been\ndoing something to de\ufb01ne liberty, and thanks to them that,\nin what they have done, the wolf\u2019s dictionary has been\nrepudiated.\n It is not very becoming for one in my position to make\nspeeches at length; but there is another subject upon which\nI feel that I ought to say a word. A painful rumor, true, I\nfear, has reached us, of the massacre, by the rebel forces at\nFort Pillow, in the west end of Tennessee, on the Mississippi\nRiver, of some three hundred colored soldiers and white\no\ufb00icers [I believe it latter turned out to be ], who had\njust been overpowered by their assailants [numbering\n]. There seems to be some anxiety in the public mind\nwhether the Government is doing its duty to the colored\nsoldier, and to the service, at this point. At the beginning of\nthe war, and for some time, the use of colored troops was\nnot contemplated; and how the change of purpose was\nwrought I will not now take time to explain. Upon a clear\nconviction of duty I resolved to turn that element of\nstrength to account; and I am responsible for it to the\nAmerican people, to the Christian world, to history, and in\nmy \ufb01nal account to God. Having determined to use the\nnegro as a soldier, there is no way but to give him all the\nprotection given to any other soldier. The di\ufb00iculty is not in\nstating the principle, but in practically applying it. It is a\nmistake to suppose the Government is indi\ufb00erent to this\nmatter, or is not doing the best it can in regard to it. We do\nnot to-day know that a colored soldier, or white o\ufb00icer\ncommanding colored soldiers, has been massacred by the\nrebels when made a prisoner. We fear it, we believe it, I\nmay say, \u2014 but we do not know it. To take the life of one of\ntheir prisoners on the assumption that they murder ours,\nwhen it is short of certainty that they do murder ours,\n might be too serious, too cruel, a mistake. We are having\nthe Fort Pillow a\ufb00air thoroughly investigated; and such\ninvestigation will probably show conclusively how the truth\nis. If after all that has been said it shall turn out that there\nhas been no massacre at Fort Pillow, it will be almost safe\nto say there has been none, and will be none, elsewhere. If\nthere has been the massacre of three hundred there, or\neven the tenth part of three hundred, it will be conclusively\nproved; and being so proved, the retribution shall as surely\ncome. It will be matter of grave consideration in what exact\ncourse to apply the retribution; but in the supposed case it\nmust come.\n[There was a massacre of a black company and their\no\ufb00icers at Fort Pillow \u2014 they were prisoners who later on,\nthe day of their capture, were ordered executed. The black\nsoldiers were tied alive to individual planks \u2014 then man\nand plank were cobbled up like cord wood and burned. The\nwhite o\ufb00icers were shot.

The military is doing and\nwill continue to do the best for them within its power.

It may be remembered that in the\nannual \nmessage \nof \nDecember, \n, \nsuch \nrailroad\nconstruction was recommended.

LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  H  H\n   \n         \n A I   \nAPRIL , .\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\nIn obedience to the resolution of your honorable body, a\ncopy of which is herewith returned, I have the honor to\nmake the following brief statement, which is believed to\ncontain the information sought:\nPrior to and at the meeting of the present Congress,\nRobert C. Schenck, of Ohio, and Frank P. Blair, Jr., of\nMissouri, members elect thereto, by and with the consent\nof the Senate held commissions from the Executive as\nmajor-generals in the volunteer army. General Schenck\ntendered the resignation of his said commission, and took\nhis seat in the House of Representatives, at the assembling\nthereof, upon the distinct verbal understanding with the\nSecretary of War and the Executive that he might, at any\ntime during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said\nresignation and return to the \ufb01eld.\nGeneral Blair was, by temporary assignment of General\nSherman, in command of a corps through the battles in\nfront of Chattanooga, and in the march to the relief of\nKnoxville, which occurred in the latter days of November\nand early days of December last, and of course was not\npresent \nat \nthe \nassembling \nof \nCongress. \nWhen \nhe\n subsequently arrived here, he sought, and was allowed by\nthe Secretary of War and the Executive, the same\nconditions and promise as allowed and made to General\nSchenck.\nGeneral Schenck has not applied to withdraw his\nresignation; but when General Grant was made Lieutenant-\nGeneral, producing some change of commanders, General\nBlair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps. This\nwas made known to Generals Grant and Sherman, and\nassented to by them, and the particular corps for him\ndesignated.\nThis \nwas \nall \narranged \nand \nunderstood, \nas \nnow\nremembered, so much as a month ago; but the formal\nwithdrawal of General Blair\u2019s resignation, and making the\norder assigning him to the command of the corps, were not\nconsummated at the War Department until last week,\nperhaps on the d of April instant. As a summary of the\nwhole, it may be stated that General Blair holds no military\ncommission or appointment other than as herein stated,\nand that it is believed he is now acting as major-General\nupon the assumed validity of the commission herein stated,\nin connection with the facts herein stated, and not\notherwise. There are some letters, notes, telegrams, orders,\nentries, and perhaps other documents in connection with\nthis subject, which it is believed would throw no additional\nlight upon it, but which will be cheerfully furnished if\ndesired.\nA.

You are vigilant and self-reliant; and, pleased with\nthis, I wish not to obtrude any restraints or constraints\nupon you. While I am very anxious that any great disaster\nor capture of our men in great number shall be avoided, I\nknow that these points are less likely to escape your\nattention than they would be mine.

Our commanders are\nfollowing up their victories resolutely and successfully. I\nthink, without knowing the particulars of the plans of\nGeneral Grant, that what has been accomplished is of more\nimportance than at \ufb01rst appears. I believe, I know (and am\nespecially grateful to know) that General Grant has not\nbeen jostled in his purposes, that he has made all his\npoints, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he\nmoved his armies. I will volunteer to say that I am very glad\nat what has happened, but there is a great deal still to be\ndone. While we are grateful to all the brave men and\no\ufb00icers for the events of the past few days, we should,\nabove all, be very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us\nvictory.\nThere is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and\npatriots to perform their share of the labor and follow the\n example of the modest General at the head of our armies,\nand sink all personal consideration for the sake of the\ncountry. I commend you to keep yourselves in the same\ntranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal\nman. I have said more than I expected when I came before\nyou.

Roberts, for transportation of what\nwas called the Naval Brigade from New York to Fortress\nMonroe. This force was a special organization got up by\none Bartlett, in pretended pursuance of written authority\nfrom me, but in fact, pursuing the authority in scarcely\nanything whatever. The credit given him by Mr. Roberts,\nwas given in the teeth of the express declaration that the\nGovernment would not be responsible for the class of\nexpenses to which it belonged. After all some part of the\ntransportation became useful to the Government, and\nequitably should be paid for; but I have neither time nor\nmeans \nto \nascertain \nthis \nequitable \namount, \nor \nany\nappropriation to pay it with if ascertained. If the\nQuartermaster at New York can ascertain what would\ncompensate for so much of the transportation as did result\nusefully to the Government, it might be a step towards\nreaching justice.

It is impossible for me to attend. I\napprove, nevertheless, of whatever may tend to strengthen\nand sustain General Grant and the noble armies now under\nhis direction. My previous high estimate of General Grant\nhas been maintained and heightened by what has occurred\nin the remarkable campaign he is now conducting, while\nthe magnitude and di\ufb00iculty of the task before him does not\nprove less than I expected.

I know no\nreason to doubt that I shall accept the nomination\ntendered; and yet perhaps I should not declare de\ufb01nitely\nbefore reading and considering what is called the platform.\nI will say now, however, I approve the declaration in favor\nof so amending the Constitution as to prohibit slavery\nthroughout the nation. When the people in revolt, with a\nhundred days of explicit notice that they could within those\ndays resume their allegiance without the overthrow of their\ninstitution, and that they could not so resume it afterward,\nelected to stand out, such amendment of the Constitution\nas now proposed became a \ufb01tting and necessary conclusion\nto the \ufb01nal success of the Union cause. Such alone can\nmeet and cover all cavils. Now the unconditional Union\nmen, North and South, perceive its importance and\n embrace it. In the joint names of Liberty and Union, let us\nlabor to give it legal form and practical e\ufb00ect.\n   A  \n \n \n   H  \nI\n \nA I\nA\n \n  \n I\n H  \n I\n  A  I\n    \n.   \n  \nAND , .\n. Resolved, That it is the highest duty of every American\ncitizen to maintain against all their enemies the integrity of\nthe Union and the paramount authority of the Constitution\nand laws of the United States; and that, laying aside all\ndi\ufb00erences of political opinion, we pledge ourselves, as\nUnion men, animated by a common sentiment and aiming\nat a common object, to do everything in our power to aid\nthe Government in quelling by force of arms the rebellion\nnow raging against its authority, and in bringing to the\npunishment due to their crimes the rebels and traitors\narrayed against it.\n. Resolved, That we approve the determination of the\nGovernment of the United States not to compromise with\nrebels, or to o\ufb00er them any terms of peace, except such as\nmay be based upon an unconditional surrender of their\nhostility and a return to their just allegiance to the\nConstitution and laws of the United States, and that we call\nupon the Government to maintain this position, and to\nprosecute the war with the utmost possible vigor to the\ncomplete suppression of the rebellion, in full reliance upon\nthe self-sacri\ufb01cing patriotism, the heroic valor, and the\n undying devotion of the American people to their Country\nand its free institutions.\n. Resolved, That as slavery was the cause, and now\nconstitutes the strength, of this rebellion, and as it must be,\nalways and everywhere, hostile to the principles of\nrepublican government, justice and the national safety\ndemand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of\nthe republic; and that while we uphold and maintain the\nacts and proclamations by which the Government, in its\nown defense, has aimed a death-blow at this gigantic evil,\nwe are in favor, furthermore, of such an amendment to the\nConstitution, to be made by the people in conformity with\nits provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit the\nexistence of slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of\nthe United States.\n. Resolved, That the thanks of the American people are\ndue to the soldiers and sailors of the Army and Navy, who\nhave periled their lives in defense of their country and in\nvindication of the honor of its \ufb02ag; that the nation owes to\nthem some permanent recognition of their patriotism and\ntheir valor, and ample and permanent provision for those of\ntheir survivors who have received disabling and honorable\nwounds in the service of the country; and that the\nmemories of those who have fallen in its defense shall be\nheld in grateful and everlasting remembrance.\n. Resolved, That we approve and applaud the practical\nwisdom, the unsel\ufb01sh patriotism, and the unswerving\n\ufb01delity to the Constitution and the principles of American\nliberty, with which Abraham Lincoln has discharged under\n circumstances of unparalleled di\ufb00iculty the great duties\nand responsibilities of the Presidential o\ufb00ice; that we\napprove and indorse as demanded by the emergency and\nessential to the preservation of the nation, and as within\nthe provisions of the Constitution, the measures and acts\nwhich he has adopted to defend the nation against its open\nand \nsecret \nfoes; \nthat \nwe \napprove, \nespecially, \nthe\nProclamation of Emancipation, and the employment as\nUnion soldiers of men heretofore held in slavery; and that\nwe have full con\ufb01dence in his determination to carry these\nand all other constitutional measures essential to the\nsalvation of the country into full and complete e\ufb00ect.\n. Resolved, That we deem it essential to the General\nwelfare that harmony should prevail in the national\ncouncils, and we regard as worthy of public con\ufb01dence and\no\ufb00icial trust those only who cordially indorse the principles\nproclaimed \nin \nthese \nresolutions, \nand \nwhich \nshould\ncharacterize the administration of the Government.\n. Resolved, That the Government owes to all men\nemployed in its armies, without regard to distinction of\ncolor, the full protection of the laws of war, and that any\nviolation of these laws, or of the usages of civilized nations\nin time of war, by the rebels now in arms, should be made\nthe subject of prompt and full redress.\n. Resolved, That foreign immigration, which in the past\nhas added so much to the wealth, development of\nresources, and increase of power to this nation, the asylum\nof the oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and\nencouraged by a liberal and just policy.\n . Resolved, That we are in favor of the speedy\nconstruction of the railroad to the Paci\ufb01c coast.\n. Resolved, That the national faith, pledged for the\nredemption of the public debt, must be kept inviolate, and\nthat for this purpose we recommend economy and rigid\nresponsibility in the public expenditures, and a vigorous\nand just system of taxation: and that it is the duty of every\nloyal State to sustain the credit and promote the use of the\nnational currency.\n. Resolved, That we approve the position taken by the\nGovernment that the people of the United States can never\nregard with indi\ufb00erence the attempt of any European\npower to overthrow by force or to supplant by fraud the\ninstitutions of any republican government on the Western\nContinent, and that they will view with extreme jealousy, as\nmenacing to the peace and independence of their own\ncountry, the e\ufb00orts of any such power to obtain new\nfootholds for monarchical governments, sustained by\nforeign military force, in near proximity to the United\nStates.\n        \n A \n   \nA I\n   \n  H  \nA I\nA\nI\n   A\n \nJUNE , .\nGENTLEMEN \u2014 I can only say in response to the\nremarks of your chairman, that I am very grateful for the\nrenewed con\ufb01dence which has been accorded to me, both\nby the convention and by the National League. I am not\ninsensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this,\nyet I do not allow myself to believe that any but a small\nportion of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment\nto me. The convention and the nation, I am assured, are\nalike animated by a higher view of the interests of the\ncountry, for the present and the great future, and the part I\nam entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part\nwhich I may lay hold of as being the opinion of the\nconvention and of the League, that I am not entirely\nunworthy to be intrusted with the place I have occupied for\nthe last three years. I have not permitted myself,\ngentlemen, to conclude that I am the best man in the\ncountry; but I am reminded in this connection of a story of\nan old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion once\nthat \u201cit was not best to swap horses when crossing a\nstream.\u201d\n        \n A \n   \nA I\n   \n \nHI\nJUNE , .\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 I am very much obliged to you for this\ncompliment. I have just been saying, and will repeat it, that\nthe hardest of all speeches I have to answer is a serenade. I\nnever know what to say on these occasions. I suppose that\nyou have done me this kindness in connection with the\naction of the Baltimore convention, which has recently\ntaken place, and with which, of course, I am very well\nsatis\ufb01ed. What we want still more than Baltimore\nconventions, or Presidential elections, is success under\nGeneral Grant. I propose that you constantly bear in mind\nthat the support you owe to the brave o\ufb00icers and soldiers\nin the \ufb01eld is of the very \ufb01rst importance, and we should\ntherefore bend all our energies to that point. Now without\ndetaining you any longer, I propose that you help me to\nclose up what I am now saying with three rousing cheers\nfor General Grant and the o\ufb00icers and soldiers under his\ncommand.\n A\n      \n  H   \n \n    \n  H  HA\nAIIA\nI  A\n \nJUNE , .\nSIR: \u2014 IN every light in which the State of the Hawaiian\nIslands can be contemplated, it is an object of profound\ninterest for the United States. Virtually it was once a\ncolony. It is now a near and intimate neighbor. It is a haven\nof shelter and refreshment for our merchants, \ufb01shermen,\nseamen, and other citizens, when on their lawful occasions\nthey are navigating the eastern seas and oceans. Its people\nare free, and its laws, language, and religion are largely the\nfruit of our own teaching and example. The distinguished\npart which you, Mr. Minister, have acted in the history of\nthat interesting country, is well known here. It gives me\npleasure to assure you of my sincere desire to do what I\ncan to render now your sojourn in the United States\nagreeable to yourself, satisfactory to your sovereign, and\nbene\ufb01cial to the Hawaiian people.\n   \nA     \n A\n \nHI\n   \nI\n \n \nJUNE , .\nSOLDIERS!

Your services were never needed more\nthan now. I know not where you are going. You may stay\nhere and take the places of those who will be sent to the\nfront, or you may go there yourselves. Wherever you go I\nknow you will do your best. Again I thank you. Good-by.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   .

A.\n.\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, Headquarters Army of\nthe Potomac:\nI HAVE JUST received your dispatch of  P.M. yesterday. I\nbegin to see it: you will succeed. God bless you all.\nA. LINCOLN.\n A\n     A  A  A\nI A    AI  I\n HI A\n   HIA\nJUNE , .\nI SUPPOSE THAT this toast is intended to open the way for\nme to say something. War at the best is terrible, and this of\nours in its magnitude and duration is one of the most\nterrible the world has ever known. It has deranged\nbusiness totally in many places, and perhaps in all. It has\ndestroyed property, destroyed life, and ruined homes. It has\nproduced a national debt and a degree of taxation\nunprecedented in the history of this country. It has caused\nmourning among us until the heavens may almost be said\nto be hung in black. And yet it continues. It has had\naccompaniments not before known in the history of the\nworld. I mean the Sanitary and Christian Commissions,\nwith their labors for the relief of the soldiers, and the\nVolunteer Refreshment Saloons, understood better by those\nwho hear me than by myself, and these fairs, \ufb01rst begun at\nChicago and next held in Boston, Cincinnati, and other\ncities. The motive and object that lie at the bottom of them\nare worthy of the most that we can do for the soldier who\ngoes to \ufb01ght the battles of his country. From the fair and\ntender hand of women is much, very much, done for the\nsoldier, continually reminding him of the care and thought\n for him at home. The knowledge that he is not forgotten is\ngrateful to his heart. Another view of these institutions is\nworthy of thought. They are voluntary contributions, giving\nproof that the national resources are not at all exhausted,\nand that the national patriotism will sustain us through all.\nIt is a pertinent question, When is this war to end? I do not\nwish to name the day when it will end, lest the end should\nnot come at the given time. We accepted this war, and did\nnot begin it. We accepted it for an object, and when that\nobject is accomplished the war will end, and I hope to God\nthat it will never end until that object is accomplished. We\nare going through with our task, so far as I am concerned,\nif it takes us three years longer. I have not been in the habit\nof making predictions, but I am almost tempted now to\nhazard one. I will. It is, that Grant is this evening in a\nposition, with Meade and Hancock, of Pennsylvania,\nwhence he can never be dislodged by the enemy until\nRichmond is taken. If I shall discover that General Grant\nmay be greatly facilitated in the capture of Richmond by\nrapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the\nbriefest notice, will you go? Will you march on with him?\n[Cries of \u201cYes, yes.\u201d] Then I shall call upon you when it is\nnecessary.\n  \n A  \n \n   \n \n  A   A   .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, Jun. , \nHONORABLE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\nSIR: \u2014 By authority of the Constitution, and moved\nthereto by the fourth section of the act of Congress,\nentitled \u201cAn act making appropriations for the support of\nthe army for the year ending the thirtieth of June, eighteen\nhundred and sixty-\ufb01ve, and for other purposes, approved\nJune is, ,\u201d I require your opinion in writing as to what\npay, bounty, and clothing are allowed by law to persons of\ncolor who were free on the nineteenth day of April, ,\nand who have been enlisted and mustered into the military\nservice of the United States between the month of\nDecember, , and the sixteenth of June, .\nPlease answer as you would do, on my requirement, if\nthe act of June , , had not been passed, and I will so\nuse your opinion as to satisfy that act.\nYour obedient servant, A.

SCRIPPS, ESQ.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 Complaint is made to me that you are using\nyour o\ufb00icial power to defeat Mr. Arnold\u2019s nomination to\nCongress. I am well satis\ufb01ed with Mr. Arnold as a member\nof Congress, and I do not know that the man who might\nsupplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct\nprinciple, I think, is that all our friends should have\nabsolute freedom of choice among our friends. My wish,\ntherefore, is that you will do just as you think \ufb01t with your\nown su\ufb00rage in the case, and not constrain any of your\nsubordinates to [do] other than [as] he thinks \ufb01t with his.\nThis is precisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my\npart, when a certain other nomination, now recently made,\nwas being canvassed for.\nYours very truly,\nA.

He therefore directs me to call on you\nfor a militia force of twelve thousand men from your State\nto serve not more than one hundred days, and to request\nthat you will with the utmost despatch forward the troops\nto Washington by rail or steamboat as may be most\nexpeditious.\nPlease favor me with an answer at your earliest\nconvenience.\nEDWIN M.

I do\ntherefore hereby require of the military o\ufb00icers of the said\nState that the privilege of the habeas corpus be e\ufb00ectually\nsuspended within the said State, according to the aforesaid\nproclamation, and that martial law be established therein\nto take e\ufb00ect from the date of this proclamation, the said\nsuspension and establishment of martial law to continue\n until this proclamation shall be revoked or modi\ufb01ed, but\nnot beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have\nbeen suppressed or come to an end. And I do hereby\nrequire and command, as well as military o\ufb00icers, all civil\no\ufb00icers and authorities existing or found within the said\nState of Kentucky, to take notice of this proclamation and to\ngive full e\ufb00ect to the same.

General\nHalleck says we have absolutely no force here \ufb01t to go to\nthe \ufb01eld. He thinks that with the hundred-day men and\ninvalids we have here we can defend Washington, and,\nscarcely, Baltimore. Besides these there are about eight\nthousand, not very reliable, under Howe, at Harper\u2019s Ferry\nwith Hunter approaching that point very slowly, with what\nnumber I suppose you know better than I. Wallace, with\nsome odds and ends, and part of what came up with\nRicketts, was so badly beaten yesterday at Monocacy, that\nwhat is left can attempt no more than to defend Baltimore.\nWhat we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New York will\nscarcely be worth counting, I fear. Now, what I think is, that\nyou should provide to retain your hold where you are,\ncertainly, and bring the rest with you personally, and make\na vigorous e\ufb00ort to destroy the enemy\u2019s forces in this\nvicinity. I think there is really a fair chance to do this, if the\nmovement is prompt. This is what I think upon your\nsuggestion, and is not an order.\nA.

The\norder you complain of was only nominally mine, and was\nframed by those who really made it with no thought of\nmaking you a scapegoat. It seemed to be General Grant\u2019s\nwish that the forces under General Wright and those under\nyou should join and drive at the enemy under General\nWright. Wright had the larger part of the force, but you had\nthe rank. It was thought that you would prefer Crook\u2019s\ncommanding your part to your serving in person under\nWright. That is all of it. General Grant wishes you to remain\nin command of the department, and I do not wish to order\notherwise.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  .

A.M.\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, CHATTAHOOCHEE River,\nGeorgia: I have seen your despatches objecting to agents of\nNorthern States opening recruiting stations near your\ncamps. An act of Congress authorizes this, giving the\nappointment of agents to the States, and not to the\nExecutive Government. It is not for the War Department, or\nmyself, to restrain or modify the law, in its execution,\nfurther than actual necessity may require. To be candid, I\nwas for the passage of the law, not apprehending at the\ntime that it would produce such inconvenience to the\narmies in the \ufb01eld as you now cause me to fear. Many of the\nStates were very anxious for it, and I hoped that, with their\nState bounties, and active exertions, they would get out\nsubstantial additions to our colored forces, which, unlike\nwhite recruits, help us where they come from, as well as\nwhere they go to. I still hope advantage from the law; and\nbeing a law, it must be treated as such by all of us. We here\nwill do what we consistently can to save you from\ndi\ufb00iculties arising out of it. May I ask, therefore, that you\nwill give your hearty co-operation.\nA.

He has read the letter, and says he\naccepts the resignation, as he will be glad to do with any\nother, which may be tendered, as this is, for the purpose of\ntaking an attitude of hostility against him.\nHe says he was not aware that he was so much indebted\nto Mr. Gibson for having accepted the o\ufb00ice at \ufb01rst, not\nremembering that he ever pressed him to do so, or that he\ngave it otherwise than as was usual, upon request made on\nbehalf of Mr. Gibson.\nHe thanks Mr. Gibson for his acknowledgment that he\nhas been treated with personal kindness and consideration,\nand says he knows of but two small drawbacks upon Mr.\nGibson\u2019s right to still receive such treatment, one of which\nis that he never could learn of his giving much attention to\nthe duties of his o\ufb00ice, and the other is this studied attempt\nof Mr. Gibson\u2019s to stab him.\nI am very truly, Your obedient servant, JOHN HAY.\n  \n  \n \n     I    \n.  .

P.M.\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, NEAR Atlanta: I have just\nseen yours complaining of the appointment of Hovey and\nOsterhaus. The point you make is unquestionably a good\none, and yet please hear a word from us. My recollection is\nthat both General Grant and yourself recommended both H\n[ovey] and O [sterhaus] for promotion, and these, with\nother strong recommendations, drew committals from us\nwhich we could neither honorably or safely disregard. We\nblamed H [ovey] for coming away in the manner in which\nhe did, but he knew he had apparent reason to feel\ndisappointed and morti\ufb01ed, and we felt it was not best to\ncrush one who certainly had been a good soldier. As to\n[Osterhaus], we did not know of his leaving at the time we\nmade the appointment, and do not now know the terms on\nwhich he left. Not to have appointed him, as the case\nappeared to us at the time, would have been almost, if not\nquite, a violation of our word. The word was given on what\nwe thought was high merit and somewhat on his\nnationality. I beg you to believe we do not act in a spirit of\ndisregarding merit. We expect to await your programme for\nfurther changes and promotions in your army. My\n profoundest thanks to you and your whole army for the\npresent campaign so far.\nA.

I\nappreciate him certainly, as highly as you do; but you can\nnever know until you have the trial, how di\ufb00icult it is to \ufb01nd\na place for an o\ufb00icer of so high rank when there is no place\nseeking him.\nA.

INDORSEMENT,\nAUGUST , .\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, August ,\n.\nMR. PRESIDENT: \u2014 This note will introduce to you Mr.\nSchley of Baltimore, who desires to appeal to you for the\nrevocation of an order of General Hunter, removing some\npersons, citizens of Frederick, beyond his lines, and\nimprisoning others. This Department has no information of\nthe reasons or proofs on which General Hunter acts, and I\ndo not therefore feel at liberty to suspend or interfere with\nhis action except under your direction.\nYours truly,\nEDWIN M.

Wherever the enemy goes, let our troops go also.\u201d\nThis, I think, is exactly right as to how our forces should\nmove; but please look over the despatches you may have\nreceived from here, ever since you made that order, and\ndiscover, if you can, that there is any idea in the head of\nany one here of \u201cputting our army south of the enemy,\u201d or\nof following him to the \u201cdeath,\u201d in any direction. I repeat to\nyou, it will neither be done nor attempted, unless you\nwatch it every day and hour, and force it.\nA. LINCOLN.\n[Here the President was mistaken in thinking that\nSherman, Sheridan, and Grant had the same inability of\nmost of his previous general o\ufb00icers. No one needed to\nwatch Grant or Sherman or Sheridan, they only needed to\nget out of their way. D.W.]\n     \n A\n  \n H\n A   \n      .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August , \nHON.

LINCOLN.\n I\n    I \n \nI H  \nH\n  . \nI   \nAUGUST , .\n\u201cMR. PRESIDENT,\u201d SAID Governor Randall, \u201cwhy can\u2019t you\nseek seclusion, and play hermit for a fortnight? It would\nreinvigorate you.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the President, \u201ctwo or three weeks would do\nme no good. I cannot \ufb02y from my thoughts \u2014 my solicitude\nfor this great country follows me wherever I go. I do not\nthink it is personal vanity or ambition, though I am not free\nfrom these in\ufb01rmities, but I cannot but feel that the weal or\nwoe of this great nation will be decided in November. There\nis no program o\ufb00ered by any wing of the Democratic party\nbut that must result in the permanent destruction of the\nUnion.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mr. President, General McClellan is in favor of\ncrushing out this rebellion by force. He will be the Chicago\ncandidate.\u201d\n\u201cSir, the slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to\nany man that the rebel armies cannot be destroyed by\nDemocratic strategy. It would sacri\ufb01ce all the white men of\nthe North to do it. There are now in the service of the\nUnited States nearly one hundred and \ufb01fty thousand able-\nbodied colored men, most of them under arms, defending\nand acquiring Union territory. The Democratic strategy\n demands that these forces be disbanded, and that the\nmasters be conciliated by restoring them to slavery. The\nblack men who now assist Union prisoners to escape are to\nbe converted into our enemies, in the vain hope of gaining\nthe good-will of their masters. We shall have to \ufb01ght two\nnations instead of one.\n\u201cYou cannot conciliate the South if you guarantee to\nthem ultimate success; and the experience of the present\nwar proves their success is inevitable if you \ufb02ing the\ncompulsory labor of millions of black men into their side of\nthe scale. Will you give our enemies such military\nadvantages as insure success, and then depend on coaxing,\n\ufb02attery, and concession to get them back into the Union?\nAbandon all the posts now garrisoned by black men, take\none hundred and \ufb01fty thousand men from our side and put\nthem in the battle-\ufb01eld or corn-\ufb01eld against us, and we\nwould be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks.\n\u201cWe have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places;\nwhere are the Democrats to do this? It was a free \ufb01ght, and\nthe \ufb01eld was open to the war Democrats to put down this\nrebellion by \ufb01ghting against both master and slave, long\nbefore the present policy was inaugurated.\n\u201cThere have been men base enough to propose to me to\nreturn to slavery the black warriors of Port Hudson and\nOlustee, and thus win the respect of the masters they\nfought. Should I do so, I should deserve to be damned in\ntime and eternity. Come what will, I will keep my faith with\nfriend and foe. My enemies pretend I am now carrying on\nthis war for the sole purpose of abolition. So long as I am\n President, it shall be carried on for the sole purpose of\nrestoring the Union. But no human power can subdue this\nrebellion without the use of the emancipation policy, and\nevery other policy calculated to weaken the moral and\nphysical forces of the rebellion.\n\u201cFreedom has given us one hundred and \ufb01fty thousand\nmen, raised on Southern soil. It will give us more yet. Just\nso much it has subtracted from the enemy, and, instead of\nalienating the South, there are now evidences of a fraternal\nfeeling growing up between our men and the rank and \ufb01le\nof the rebel soldiers. Let my enemies prove to the country\nthat the destruction of slavery is not necessary to a\nrestoration of the Union. I will abide the issue.\u201d\n  \n   \n \n  \n  A   I A I\n  \n \n  \n \n \n   A\n           .\nI AM ALWAYS for the man who wishes to work; and I shall\nbe glad for this man to get suitable employment at Cavalry\nDepot, or elsewhere.\nA.

He declines giving his consent\nto the publication of his letters unless these parts be\npublished with the rest. I have concluded that it is better\nfor me to submit, for the time, to the consequences of the\nfalse position in which I consider he has placed me, than to\nsubject the country to the consequences of publishing these\ndiscouraging and injurious parts.

I am greatly obliged to you, and to all who have\ncome forward at the call of their country. I wish it might be\nmore generally and universally understood what the\ncountry is now engaged in. We have, as all will agree, a free\ngovernment, where every man has a right to be equal with\nevery other man. In this great struggle, this form of\ngovernment and every form of human right is endangered if\nour enemies succeed. There is more involved in this contest\nthan is realized by every one. There is involved in this\nstruggle, the question whether your children and my\nchildren shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed. I say\nthis, in order to impress upon you, if you are not already so\nimpressed, that no small matter should divert us from our\ngreat purpose.\nThere may be some inequalities in the practical\napplication of our system. It is fair that each man shall pay\ntaxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if\nwe should wait, before collecting a tax, to adjust the taxes\nupon each man in exact proportion with every other man,\n we should never collect any tax at all. There may be\nmistakes made sometimes; and things may be done wrong,\nwhile the o\ufb00icers of the Government do all they can to\nprevent mistakes. But I beg of you, as citizens of this great\nRepublic, not to let your minds be carried o\ufb00 from the great\nwork we have before us. This struggle is too large for you\nto be diverted from it by any small matter. When you return\nto your homes, rise up to the height of a generation of men\nworthy of a free government, and we will carry out the\ngreat work we have commenced. I return to you my sincere\nthanks, soldiers, for the honor you have done me this\nafternoon.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   \n    .     \n I \nA\n I\n  \nA HI\n \n  \n.  .

For the services you have done in this\ngreat struggle in which we are engaged, I present you\nsincere thanks for myself and the country.\nI almost always feel inclined, when I say anything to\nsoldiers, to impress upon them, in a few brief remarks, the\nimportance of success in this contest. It is not merely for\nthe day, but for all time to come, that we should perpetuate\nfor our children\u2019s children that great and free government\nwhich we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember\nthis, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen,\ntemporarily, to occupy this big White House. I am a living\nwitness that any one of your children may look to come\nhere as my father\u2019s child has. It is in order that each one of\nyou may have, through this free government which we have\nenjoyed, an open \ufb01eld, and a fair chance for your industry,\nenterprise, and intelligence; that you may all have equal\nprivileges in the race of life with all its desirable human\naspirations \u2014 it is for this that the struggle should be\nmaintained, that we may not lose our birthrights \u2014 not only\nfor one, but for two or three years, if necessary. The nation\nis worth \ufb01ghting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel.\n  \n A\n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August , .\nTHIS \nMORNING, \nAS for some days past, it seems\nexceedingly probable that this administration will not be re-\nelected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the\nPresident-elect as to save the Union between the election\nand the inauguration; as he will have secured his election\non such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.\nA.

In all, it has been\nyour purpose to strengthen my reliance on God. I am much\nindebted to the good Christian people of the country for\ntheir constant prayer and consolations; and to no one of\nthem, more than to yourself. The purposes of the Almighty\nare perfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals\nmay fail to accurately perceive them in advance. We hoped\nfor a happy termination of this terrible war long before this;\nbut God knows best, and has ruled otherwise. We shall yet\nacknowledge His wisdom, and our own error therein. Mean\nwhile we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us,\ntrusting that so working still conduces to the great ends He\nordains. Surely He intends some great good to follow this\nmighty convulsion, which no mortal could make, and no\nmortal could stay.\n Your people \u2014 the Friends \u2014 have had, and are having, a\nvery great trial. On principle, and faith, opposed to both\nwar and oppression, they can only practically oppose\noppression by war. For those appealing to me on\nconscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I\ncould and can, in my own conscience, under my oath to the\nlaw. That you believe this I doubt not, and believing it, I\nshall still receive, for our country and myself your earnest\nprayers to our Father in Heaven.\nYour sincere friend, A.

I have,\nin letters sent forth from this o\ufb00ice, expressed myself\nbetter than I can now.\nIn regard to the great Book, I have only to say it is the\nbest gift which God has ever given to man. All the good\nfrom the Saviour of the world is communicated to us\nthrough this book. But for that Book, we could not know\nright from wrong. All those things desirable to man are\ncontained in it.

The bad e\ufb00ect upon the November\nelection, and especially the giving the State government to\nthose who will oppose the war in every possible way, are\ntoo much to risk if it can be avoided. The draft proceeds,\nnotwithstanding its strong tendency to lose us the State.\nIndiana is the only important State voting in October whose\nsoldiers cannot vote in the \ufb01eld. Anything you can safely do\nto let her soldiers or any part of them go home and vote at\nthe State election will be greatly in point. They need not\nremain for the Presidential election, but may return to you\nat once.

H\n  \nA\n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, October , .\nHON. HENRY W.

I presume the only feature of the instrument\nabout which there is serious controversy is that which\nprovides for the extinction of slavery. It needs not to be a\nsecret and I presume it is no secret, that I wish success to\nthis provision. I desire it on every consideration. I wish all\nmen to be free. I wish the material prosperity of the already\nfree, which I feel sure the extinction of slavery would bring.\nI wish to see in process of disappearing that only thing\nwhich ever could bring this nation to civil war. I attempt no\nargument. \nArgument \nupon \nthe \nquestion \nis \nalready\nexhausted by the abler, better informed, and more\nimmediately interested sons of Maryland herself. I only add\nthat I shall be grati\ufb01ed exceedingly if the good people of\nthe State shall, by their votes, ratify the new constitution.\nYours truly, A.

Pennsylvania very close, and still in doubt on\nhome vote. Ohio largely for us, with all the members of\nCongress but two or three. Indiana largely for us, \u2014\nGovernor, it is said, by \ufb01fteen thousand, and eight of the\neleven members of Congress. Send us what you may know\nof your army vote.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n    \n A     \nA\n \nOCTOBER , .\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 I am noti\ufb01ed\nthat this is a compliment paid me by the loyal Marylanders\nresident in this District. I infer that the adoption of the new\nconstitution for the State furnishes the occasion, and that\nin your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief\nmerit of the new constitution. Most heartily do I\ncongratulate you, and Maryland, and the nation, and the\nworld, upon this event. I regret that it did not occur two\nyears sooner, which, I am sure, would have saved the\nnation more money than would have met all the private loss\nincident to the measure; but it has come at last, and I\nsincerely hope its friends may fully realize all their\nanticipations of good from it, and that its opponents may by\nits e\ufb00ects be agreeably and pro\ufb01tably disappointed.\nA word upon another subject. Something said by the\nSecretary of State in his recent speech at Auburn, has been\nconstrued by some into a threat, that if I shall be beaten at\nthe election, I will, between then and the end of my\nconstitutional term, do what I may be able to ruin the\nGovernment.\nOthers regard the fact that the Chicago Convention\nadjourned, not sine die, but to meet again, if called to do so\n by a particular individual, as the intimation of a purpose\nthat if their nominee shall be elected he will at once seize\ncontrol of the Government. I hope the good people will\npermit themselves to su\ufb00er no uneasiness on either point. I\nam struggling to maintain the Government, not to\noverthrow it. I am struggling especially to prevent others\nfrom overthrowing it. I therefore say, that if I live, I shall\nremain President until the th of next March, and that\nwhoever shall be constitutionally elected, in November,\nshall be duly installed as President on the th of March,\nand in the interval I shall do my utmost that whoever is to\nhold the helm for the next voyage shall start with the best\npossible chance of saving the ship. This is due to the\npeople, both on principle and under the Constitution. Their\nwill, constitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all. If\nthey should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace,\neven at the loss of their country and their liberties, I know\nnot the power or the right to resist them. It is their own\nbusiness, and they must do as they please with their own. I\nbelieve, however, they are still resolved to preserve their\ncountry and their liberties; and in this, in o\ufb00ice or out of it,\nI am resolved to stand by them. I may add, that in this\npurpose to save the country and its liberties, no classes of\npeople seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers in the\n\ufb01eld and the sailors a\ufb02oat. Do they not have the hardest of\nit? Who should quail while they do not? God bless the\nsoldiers and seamen, with all their brave commanders.\n   \n  A\nA I\n \n   HA\n  \nI I\n  \n  \n  \n        .\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA:\nA PROCLAMATION.\nIt has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life\nanother year, defending us with his guardian care against\nunfriendly designs from abroad, and vouchsa\ufb01ng to us in\nHis mercy many and signal victories over the enemy, who is\nof our own household. It has also pleased our Heavenly\nFather to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our\nsoldiers in their camps, and our sailors on the rivers and\nseas, with unusual health. He has largely augmented our\nfree population by emancipation and by immigration, while\nhe has opened to us new: sources of wealth, and has\ncrowned the labor of our working-men in every department\nof industry with abundant rewards. Moreover, he has been\npleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with\nfortitude, courage, and resolution su\ufb00icient for the great\ntrial of civil war into which we have been brought by our\nadherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and\nhumanity, and to a\ufb00ord to us reasonable hopes of an\nultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and\na\ufb04ictions.\n Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\nUnited States, do hereby appoint and set apart the last\nThursday in November next as a day which I desire to be\nobserved by all my fellow-citizens, wherever they may be\nthen, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God,\nthe bene\ufb01cent Creator and Ruler of the Universe. And I do\nfurther recommend to my fellow-citizens aforesaid, that on\nthat occasion they do reverently humble themselves in the\ndust, and from thence o\ufb00er up penitent and fervent prayers\nand supplications to the great Disposer of events for a\nreturn of the inestimable blessings of peace, union, and\nharmony throughout the, land which it has pleased him to\nassign as a dwelling-place for ourselves and for our\nposterity throughout all generations.\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\nDone at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of\nOctober, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\nhundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the\nUnited States the eighty-ninth.\nA.

It\nis not proposed to force you into it. Do as you please, on\nyour own account, peaceably and loyally, and Governor\nJohnson will not molest you, but will protect you against\nviolence as far as in his power.\nI presume that the conducting of a presidential election\nin Tennessee in strict accordance with the old Code of the\nState, is not now a possibility.\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that if any election shall\nbe held and any votes shall be cast in the State of\nTennessee for President and Vice-President of the United\nStates, it will belong, not to the military agents, nor yet to\nthe Executive Department, but exclusively to another\ndepartment of the Government, to determine whether they\nare entitled to be counted in conformity with the\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\nExcept it be to give protection against violence, I decline\nto interfere in any way with any presidential election.\nA.

I\ndo not pretend to say that you, who think so, embrace all\nthe patriotism and loyalty of the country, but I do believe,\nand I trust without personal interest, that the welfare of the\ncountry does require that such support and indorsement\nshould be given.\nI earnestly believe that the consequences of this day\u2019s\nwork, if it be as you assume, and as now seems probable,\nwill be to the lasting advantage, if not to the very salvation,\nof the country. I cannot at this hour say what has been the\nresult of the election. But, whatever it may be, I have no\ndesire to modify this opinion: that all who have labored to-\nday in behalf of the Union have wrought for the best\ninterests of the country and the world; not only for the\npresent, but for all future ages.\nI am thankful to God for this approval of the people; but,\nwhile deeply grateful for this mark of their con\ufb01dence in\nme, if I know my heart, my gratitude is free from any taint\n of personal triumph. I do not impugn the motives of any\none opposed to me. It is no pleasure to me to triumph over\nany one, but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence\nof the people\u2019s resolution to stand by free government and\nthe rights of humanity.\n     \n A\n  \n H. \n.

HOFFMAN, Baltimore, Md.: The Maryland soldiers in\nthe Army of the Potomac cast a total vote of fourteen\nhundred and twenty-eight, out of which we get eleven\nhundred and sixty majority. This is directly from General\nMeade and General Grant.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n  A I  \n   \n \nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, NOVEMBER , .\nIT \nHAS \nLONG been a grave question whether any\ngovernment, not too strong for the liberties of its people,\ncan be strong enough to maintain its existence in great\nemergencies. On this point the present rebellion brought\nour government to a severe test, and a presidential election\noccurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not\na little to the strain.\nIf the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their\nstrength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided\nand \npartially \nparalyzed \nby \na \npolitical \nwar \namong\nthemselves? But the election was a necessity. We cannot\nhave free government without elections; and if the election\ncould force us to forego or postpone a national election, it\nmight fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us.\nThe strife of the election is but human nature practically\napplied to the facts of the case. What has occurred in this\ncase must ever recur in similar cases. Human nature will\nnot change. In any future great national trial, compared\nwith the men of this, we will have as weak and as strong, as\nsilly and as wise, as bad and as good. Let us, therefore,\nstudy the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom\nfrom, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.\n But \nthe \nelection, \nalong \nwith \nits \nincidental \nand\nundesirable strife, has done good, too. It has demonstrated\nthat a people\u2019s government can sustain a national election\nin the midst of a great civil war. Until now, it has not been\nknown to the world that this was a possibility. It shows,\nalso, how sound and strong we still are. It shows that even\namong the candidates of the same party, he who is most\ndevoted to the Union and most opposed to treason can\nreceive most of the people\u2019s votes. It shows, also, to the\nextent yet known, that we have more men now than we had\nwhen the war began. Gold is good in its place; but living,\nbrave, and patriotic men are better than gold.\nBut the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is\nover, may not all have a common interest to reunite in a\ncommon e\ufb00ort to save our common country? For my own\npart, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any\nobstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man\u2019s bosom. While I am\nduly sensible to the high compliment of a re-election, and\nduly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God, for having\ndirected my countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think,\nfor their good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any\nother man may be disappointed by the result.\nMay I ask those who have not di\ufb00ered with me to join\nwith me in this same spirit towards those who have? And\nnow, let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our\nbrave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and skillful\ncommanders.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   . \n.  \n   I\n .\nA HI\n \n  \n. .  \no em er         .\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURBRIDGE, Lexington, Ky.: \nI HAVE JUST received a telegram from Governor Bramlette\nsaying: \u201cGeneral John B. Houston, a loyal man and\nprominent citizen, was arrested, and yesterday, started o\ufb00\nby General Burbridge, to be sent beyond our lines by way\nof Catlettsburg, for no other o\ufb00ense than opposition to your\nre-election,\u201d and I have answered him as follows below, of\nwhich please take notice and report to me.\nA.

Houston has been arrested \u201cfor no other\no\ufb00ense than opposition to my re-election;\u201d for, if that had\nbeen deemed su\ufb00icient cause of arrest, I should have heard\nof more than one arrest in Kentucky on election day. If,\nhowever, General Houston has been arrested for no other\ncause than opposition to my re-election, General Burbridge\nwill discharge him at once, I sending him a copy of this as\nan order to that e\ufb00ect.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A   . A. H\n   \n .\n(Private.) \nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November\n, .\nMAJOR-GENERAL HURLBUT: Few things since I have\nbeen here have impressed me more painfully than what, for\nfour or \ufb01ve months past, has appeared a bitter military\nopposition to the new State government of Louisiana. I still\nindulged some hope that I was mistaken in the fact; but\ncopies of a correspondence on the subject between General\nCanby and yourself, and shown me to-day, dispel that hope.\nA very fair proportion of the people of Louisiana have\ninaugurated a new State government, making an excellent\nnew constitution \u2014 better for the poor black man than we\nhave in Illinois. This was done under military protection,\ndirected by me, in the belief, still sincerely entertained,\nthat with such a nucleus around which to build we could\nget the State into position again sooner than otherwise. In\nthis belief a general promise of protection and support,\napplicable alike to Louisiana and other States, was given in\nthe last annual message. During the formation of the new\ngovernment and constitution they were supported by nearly\nevery loyal person, and opposed by every secessionist. And\nthis support and this opposition, from the respective\nstandpoints of the parties, was perfectly consistent and\n logical. Every Unionist ought to wish the new government\nto succeed; and every disunionist must desire it to fail. Its\nfailure would gladden the heart of Slidell in Europe, and of\nevery enemy of the old \ufb02ag in the world. Every advocate of\nslavery naturally desires to see blasted and crushed the\nliberty promised the black man by the new constitution. But\nwhy General Canby and General Hurlbut should join on the\nsame side is to me incomprehensible.\nOf course, in the condition of things at New Orleans, the\nmilitary must not be thwarted by the civil authority; but\nwhen the Constitutional Convention, for what it deems a\nbreach of privilege, arrests an editor in no way connected\nwith the military, the military necessity for insulting the\nconvention and forcibly discharging the editor is di\ufb00icult to\nperceive. Neither is the military necessity for protecting\nthe people against paying large salaries \ufb01xed by a\nlegislature of their own choosing very apparent. Equally\ndi\ufb00icult to perceive is the military necessity for forcibly\ninterposing to prevent a bank from loaning its own money\nto the State. These things, if they have occurred, are, at the\nbest, no better than gratuitous hostility. I wish I could hope\nthat they may be shown not to have occurred. To make\nassurance against misunderstanding, I repeat that in the\nexisting condition of things in Louisiana, the military must\nnot be thwarted by the civil authority; and I add that on\npoints of di\ufb00erence the commanding general must be judge\nand master. But I also add that in the exercise of this\njudgment and control, a purpose, obvious, and scarcely\n unavowed, to transcend all military necessity, in order to\ncrush out the civil government, will not be overlooked.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n        \n \nA   A\n \nI\n  \nI    \n  \n            .\nTHE PRESIDENT, IN reply, said that he had to confess he\nhad been duly noti\ufb01ed of the intention to make this friendly\ncall some days ago, and in this he had had a fair\nopportunity a\ufb00orded to be ready with a set speech; but he\nhad not prepared one, being too busy for that purpose. He\nwould say, however, that he was grati\ufb01ed with the result of\nthe presidential election. He had kept as near as he could\nto the exercise of his best judgment for the interest of the\nwhole country, and to have the seal of approbation stamped\non the course he had pursued was exceedingly grateful to\nhis feelings. He thought he could say, in as large a sense as\nany other man, that his pleasure consisted in belief that the\npolicy he had pursued was the best, if not the only one, for\nthe safety of the country.\nHe had said before, and now repeated, that he indulged\nin no feeling of triumph over any man who thought or acted\ndi\ufb00erently from himself. He had no such feeling toward any\nliving man. When he thought of Maryland, in particular, he\nwas of the opinion that she had more than double her share\nin what had occurred in the recent elections. The adoption\nof a free-State constitution was a greater thing than the\npart taken by the people of the State in the presidential\nelection. He would any day have stipulated to lose\n Maryland in the presidential election to save it by the\nadoption \nof \na \nfree-State \nconstitution, \nbecause \nthe\npresidential election comes every four years, while that is a\nthing which, being done, cannot be undone. He therefore\nthought that in that they had a victory for the right worth a\ngreat deal more than their part in the presidential election,\nthough of the latter he thought highly. He had once before\nsaid, but would say again, that those who have di\ufb00ered\nwith us and opposed us will see that the result of the\npresidential election is better for their own good than if\nthey had been successful.\nThanking the committee for their compliment, he\nbrought his brief speech to a close.\n   \n  A\nA I\n  \n   \nI\n   \n  A\n \n  \n           \nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA:\nA PROCLAMATION.\nWhereas by my proclamation of the th of April, , it\nwas declared that the ports of certain States, including\nthose of Norfolk, in the State of Virginia, Fernandina and\nPensacola, in the State of Florida, were, for reasons therein\nset forth, intended to be placed under blockade; and:\nWhereas the said ports were subsequently blockaded\naccordingly, but having for some time past been in the\nmilitary possession of the United States, it is deeemd\nadvisable that they should be opened to domestic and\nforeign commerce:\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln,\nPresident of the United States, pursuant to the authority in\nme vested by the \ufb01fth section of the act of Congress\napproved on the th of July, , entitled \u201cAn act further\nto provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for\nother purposes,\u201d do hereby declare that the blockade of the\nsaid ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola shall so\nfar cease and determine, from and after the \ufb01rst day of\nDecember next, that commercial intercourse with those\n ports, except as to persons, things, and information\ncontraband of war, may, from that time, be carried on,\nsubject to the laws of the United States, to the limitations\nand in pursuance of the regulations which may be\nprescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and to such\nmilitary and naval regulations as are now in force, or may\nhereafter be found necessary.\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.

At each of the interviews one\nof the ladies urged that her husband was a religious man,\nand on Saturday the President ordered the release of the\nprisoners, when he said to this lady: \u201cYou say your husband\nis a religious man; tell him when you meet him, that I say I\nam not much of a judge of religion, but that, in my opinion,\nthe religion that sets men to rebel and \ufb01ght against their\nown government, because, as they think, that government\ndoes not su\ufb00iciently help some men to eat their bread in\nthe sweat of other men\u2019s faces, is not the sort of religion\nupon which people can get to heaven.\u201d\nA.

If,\nhowever, the Secretary of the Navy should ascertain that\nthe steamer is adapted to our service, he is authorized to\npurchase her, but the purchase money will be held in trust\ntoward satisfying any valid claims which may be presented\nby the Japanese on account of the construction of the\nsteamer and the failure to deliver the same, as above set\nforth.\nA.

LINCOLN,\n    A\n   \n  \n    .\nWASHINGTON CITY, December , .\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\nIn conformity to the law of July , , I most cordially\nrecommend that Lieutenant William B. Gushing, United\nStates Navy, receive a vote of thanks from Congress for his\nimportant, gallant, and perilous achievement in destroying\nthe rebel ironclad steamer Albemarle on the night of the\nth of October, ., at Plymouth, N. C.\nThe destruction of so formidable a vessel, which had\nresisted the continued attacks of a number of our vessels\non former occasions, is an important event touching our\nfuture naval and military operations, and would re\ufb02ect\nhonor on any o\ufb00icer, and redounds to the credit of this\nyoung o\ufb00icer and the few brave comrades who assisted in\nthis successful and daring undertaking.\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to\ncomply with the requirements of the ninth section of the\nAforesaid act, which is in the following words, namely:\nThat any line o\ufb00icer of the navy or marine corps may be\nadvanced one grade if upon recommendation of the\nPresident by name he receives the thanks of Congress for\nhighly distinguished conduct in con\ufb02ict with the enemy, or\nfor extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\n A. LINCOLN.\n A\n A  \n   A\n   \n  \n    \nDECEMBER , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES:\nAgain the blessings of health and abundant harvests\nclaim our profoundest gratitude to Almighty God.\nThe condition of our foreign a\ufb00airs is reasonably\nsatisfactory.\nMexico continues to be a theater of civil war. While our\npolitical relations with that country have undergone no\nchange, we have at the same time strictly maintained\nneutrality between the belligerents.\nAt the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua,\na competent engineer has been authorized to make a\nsurvey of the river San Juan and the port of San Juan. It is a\nsource of much satisfaction that the di\ufb00iculties which for a\nmoment excited some political apprehensions and caused a\nclosing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably\nadjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route\nwill soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and\nadaptation. We could not exaggerate either the commercial\nor the political importance of that great improvement.\nIt would be doing injustice to an important South\nAmerican State not to acknowledge the directness,\n frankness, and cordiality with which the United States of\nColombia have entered into intimate relations with this\ngovernment. A claims convention has been constituted to\ncomplete the un\ufb01nished work of the one which closed its\nsession in .\nThe new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone\ninto e\ufb00ect with the universal acquiescence of the people,\nthe government under it has been recognized and\ndiplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and\nfriendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has\nbeen satisfactorily paid and discharged.\nMutual payments have been made of the claims awarded\nby the late joint commission for the settlement of claims\nbetween the United States and Peru. An earnest and\ncordial friendship continues to exist between the two\ncountries, and such e\ufb00orts as were in my power have been\nused to remove misunderstanding, and avert a threatened\nwar between Peru and Spain.\nOur relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile,\nthe Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San\nSalvador, and Haiti.\nDuring the past year no di\ufb00erences of any kind have\narisen with any of these republics, and on the other hand,\ntheir sympathies with the United States are constantly\nexpressed with cordiality and earnestness.\nThe claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the\nbrig Macedonian in  has been paid in full by the\nGovernment of Chile.\n Civil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo,\napparently without prospect of an early close.\nO\ufb00icial correspondence has been freely opened with\nLiberia, and it gives us a pleasing view of social and\npolitical progress in that republic. It may be expected to\nderive new vigor from American in\ufb02uence improved by the\nrapid disappearance of slavery in the United States.\nI solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a\ngunboat, at moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United\nStates by instalments. Such a vessel is needed for the\nsafety of that state against the native African races, and in\nLiberian hands it would be more e\ufb00ective in arresting the\nAfrican slave-trade than a squadron in our own hands. The\npossession of the least organized naval force would\nstimulate a generous ambition in the republic, and the\ncon\ufb01dence which we should manifest by furnishing it would\nwin forbearance and favor toward the colony from all\ncivilized nations.\nThe proposed overland telegraph between America and\nEurope, by the way of Bering Straits and Asiatic Russia,\nwhich was sanctioned by Congress at the last session, has\nbeen undertaken, under very favorable circumstances, by\nan association of American citizens, with the cordial good-\nwill and support as well of this Government as of those of\nGreat Britain and Russia. Assurances have been received\nfrom most of the South American States of their high\nappreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to co-\noperate in constructing lines tributary to that world-\nencircling communication. I learn with much satisfaction\n that the noble design of a telegraphic communication\nbetween the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has\nbeen \nrenewed, \nwith \nfull \nexpectation \nof \nits \nearly\naccomplishment.\nThus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace\nthe country will be able to resume with energy and\nadvantage its former high career of commerce and\ncivilization.\nOur very popular and estimable representative in Egypt\ndied in April last. An unpleasant altercation which arose\nbetween the temporary incumbent of the o\ufb00ice and the\nGovernment of the Pasha resulted in a suspension of\nintercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival\nof the successor in the consulate, and our relations with\nEgypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers,\nare entirely satisfactory.\nThe rebellion which has so long been \ufb02agrant in China\nhas at last been suppressed, with the co-operating good\no\ufb00ices of this Government and of the other Western\ncommercial States. The judicial consular establishment\nthere has become very di\ufb00icult and onerous, and it will\nneed legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our\ncommerce and to the more intimate intercourse which has\nbeen instituted with the Government and people of that\nvast Empire. China seems to be accepting with hearty\ngood-will the conventional laws which regulate commercial\nand social intercourse among the Western nations.\nOwing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the\nanomalous form of its Government, the action of that\n empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and\ncapricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been e\ufb00ected\nby the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert.\nOur own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in\ncourse of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened\nto commerce. There is reason also to believe that these\nproceedings have increased rather than diminished the\nfriendship of Japan toward the United States.\nThe ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have\nbeen opened by proclamation. It is hoped that foreign\nmerchants will now consider whether it is not safer and\nmore pro\ufb01table to themselves, as well as just to the United\nStates, to resort to these and other open ports than it is to\npursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a\ncontraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not\nby actual military occupation, at least by a lawful and\ne\ufb00ective blockade.\nFor myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the\nExecutive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of\nthe human race from an asylum in the United States. If\nCongress should think that proceedings in such cases lack\nthe authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I\nrecommend \nthat \nprovision \nbe \nmade \nfor \ne\ufb00ectually\npreventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile\nand facilities for their criminal occupation in our country.\nIt is possible that if it were a new and open question the\nmaritime powers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not\nconcede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the\ninsurgents of the United States, destitute, as they are, and\n always have been, equally of ships of war and of ports and\nharbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous\nnor more successful during the last year than they were\nbefore that time in their e\ufb00orts, under favor of that\nprivilege, to embroil our country in foreign wars. The\ndesire and determination of the governments of the\nmaritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as\nsincere as and can not be more earnest than our own.\nNevertheless, unforeseen political di\ufb00iculties have arisen,\nespecially in Brazilian and British ports and on the northern\nboundary of the United States, which have required, and\nare likely to continue to require, the practice of constant\nvigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the\nUnited States, as well as of the nations concerned and their\ngovernments.\nCommissioners have been appointed under the treaty\nwith Great Britain on the adjustment of the claims of the\nHudson Bay and Puget Sound Agricultural Companies, in\nOregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the\ntrust assigned to them.\nIn view of the insecurity of life and property in the region\nadjacent to the Canadian border, by reason of recent\nassaults and depredations committed by inimical and\ndesperate persons who are harbored there, it has been\nthought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six\nmonths, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing\narrangement with Great Britain, the United States must\nhold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament\nupon the Lakes if they shall \ufb01nd that proceeding necessary.\n The condition of the border will necessarily come into\nconsideration in connection with the question of continuing\nor modifying the rights of transit from Canada through the\nUnited States, as well as the regulation of imposts, which\nwere temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of\nthe th June, .\nI desire, however, to be understood while making this\nstatement that the colonial authorities of Canada are not\ndeemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the\nUnited States, but, on the contrary, there is every reason to\nexpect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government,\nthey will take the necessary measures to prevent new\nincursions across the border.\nThe act passed at the last session for the encouragement\nof immigration has so far as was possible been put into\noperation. It seems to need amendment which will enable\nthe o\ufb00icers of the Government to prevent the practice of\nfrauds against the immigrants while on their way and on\ntheir arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free\nchoice of avocations and places of settlement. A liberal\ndisposition toward this great national policy is manifested\nby most of the European States, and ought to be\nreciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants e\ufb00ective\nnational protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the\nprincipal replenishing streams which are appointed by\nProvidence to repair the ravages of internal war and its\nwastes of national strength and health. All that is necessary\nis to secure the \ufb02ow of that stream in its present fullness,\nand to that end the Government must in every way make it\n manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose\ninvoluntary military service upon those who come from\nother lands to cast their lot in our country. The \ufb01nancial\na\ufb00airs \nof \nthe \nGovernment \nhave \nbeen \nsuccessfully\nadministered during the last year. The legislation of the last\nsession of Congress has bene\ufb01cially a\ufb00ected the revenues,\nalthough su\ufb00icient time has not yet elapsed to experience\nthe full e\ufb00ect of several of the provisions of the acts of\nCongress imposing increased taxation.\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, upon the\nbasis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury,\nincluding loans and the balance in the Treasury on the st\nday of July, , were  ,,,., and the\naggregate disbursements, upon the same basis, were\n ,,,., leaving a balance in the Treasury, as\nshown by warrants, of  ,,..\nDeduct from these amounts the amount of the principal\nof the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in\nsubstitution therefor, and the actual cash operations of the\nTreasury were: receipts,  ,,.; disbursements,\n ,,.; which leaves a cash balance in the\nTreasury of  ,,..\nOf the receipts there were derived from customs\n ,,., from lands  ,., from direct\ntaxes  ,., from internal revenue  ,,.,\nfrom miscellaneous sources  ,,., and from\nloans applied to actual expenditures, including former\nbalance,  ,,..\n There \nwere \ndisbursed \nfor \nthe \ncivil \nservice\n ,,., for pensions and Indians  ,,.,\nfor the War Department  ,,., for the Navy\nDepartment  ,,., for interest on the public debt\n ,,., making an aggregate of  ,,.,\nand leaving a balance in the Treasury of  ,,., as\nbefore stated.\nFor the actual receipts and disbursements for the \ufb01rst\nquarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for\nthe three remaining quarters of the current \ufb01scal year, and\nthe general operations of the Treasury in detail, I refer you\nto the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I concur with\nhim in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required\nto meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived\nfrom taxation should be still further increased; and I\nearnestly invite your attention to this subject to the end\nthat there be such additional legislation as shall be\nrequired to meet the just expectations of the Secretary.\nThe public debt on the \ufb01rst day of July last, as appears by\nthe books of the Treasury, amounted to  ,,,..\nProbably, should the war continue for another year, that\namount may be increased by not far from  ,,.\nHeld, as it is, for the most part by our own people, it has\nbecome a substantial branch of national, though private,\nproperty. For obvious reasons the more nearly this property\ncan be distributed among all the people the better. To favor\nsuch general distribution, greater inducements to become\nowners might, perhaps, with good e\ufb00ect and without injury\nbe presented to persons of limited means. With this view I\n suggest whether it might not be both competent and\nexpedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of\nsome future issue of public securities might be held by any\nbona \ufb01de purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure\nfor debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might\nbe necessary to guard against abuse of so important a\nprivilege. This would enable every prudent person to set\naside a small annuity against a possible day of want.\nPrivileges like these would render the possession of such\nsecurities to the amount limited most desirable to every\nperson of small means who might be able to save enough\nfor the purpose. The great advantage of citizens being\ncreditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt\nis obvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be much\noppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves.\nThe public debt on the \ufb01rst day of July last, although\nsomewhat exceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the\nTreasury made to Congress at the commencement of the\nlast session, falls short of the estimate of that o\ufb00icer made\nin the preceding December as to its probable amount at the\nbeginning of this year by the sum of  ,,.. This\nfact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the\noperations of the Treasury.\nThe national banking system is proving to be acceptable\nto capitalists and to the people. On the twenty-\ufb01fth day of\nNovember \ufb01ve hundred and eighty-four national banks had\nbeen organized, a considerable number of which were\nconversions from State banks. Changes from State systems\nto the national system are rapidly taking place, and it is\n hoped that very soon there will be in the United States no\nbanks of issue not authorized by Congress and no bank-\nnote circulation not secured by the Government. That the\nGovernment and the people will derive great bene\ufb01t from\nthis change in the banking systems of the country can\nhardly be questioned. The national system will create a\nreliable and permanent in\ufb02uence in support of the national\ncredit and protect the people against losses in the use of\npaper money. Whether or not any further legislation is\nadvisable for the suppression of State-bank issues, it will be\nfor Congress to determine. It seems quite clear that the\nTreasury can not be satisfactorily conducted unless the\nGovernment can exercise a restraining power over the\nbank-note circulation of the country.\nThe report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying\ndocuments will detail the campaigns of the armies in the\n\ufb01eld since the date of the last annual message, and also the\noperations of the several administrative bureaus of the War\nDepartment during the last year. It will also specify the\nmeasures deemed essential for the national defense and to\nkeep up and supply the requisite military force.\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a\ncomprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the a\ufb00airs of that\nDepartment and of the naval service. It is a subject of\ncongratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a\nNavy of such vast proportions has been organized in so\nbrief a period and conducted with so much e\ufb00iciency and\nsuccess.\n The general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under\nconstruction on the \ufb01rst of December, , shows a total\nof  vessels, carrying  guns, and of , tons,\nbeing an actual increase during the year, over and above all\nlosses by shipwreck or in battle, of  vessels,  guns,\nand , tons.\nThe total number of men at this time in the naval service,\nincluding o\ufb00icers, is about ,.\nThere have been captured by the Navy during the year\n vessels, and the whole number of naval captures since\nhostilities commenced is , of which  are steamers.\nThe gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned\nprize property thus far reported amount to  ,,..\nA large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication\nand yet to be reported.\nThe total expenditure of the Navy Department of every\ndescription, including the cost of the immense squadrons\nthat have been called into existence from the fourth of\nMarch, \n, \nto \nthe \n\ufb01rst \nof \nNovember, \n, \nis\n ,,..\nYour favorable consideration is invited to the various\nrecommendations of the Secretary of the Navy, especially in\nregard to a navy-yard and suitable establishment for the\nconstruction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery\nand armature for our ships, to which reference was made in\nmy last annual message.\nYour attention is also invited to the views expressed in\nthe report in relation to the legislation of Congress at its\nlast session in respect to prize on our inland waters.\n I cordially concur in the recommendation of the\nSecretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of\nvice-admiral in our naval service.\nYour attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-\nGeneral for a detailed account of the operations and\n\ufb01nancial condition of the Post-O\ufb00ice Department.\nThe postal revenues for the year ending June , ,\namounted to  ,,., and the expenditures to\n ,,., the excess of expenditures over receipts\nbeing  ,..\nThe views presented by the Postmaster-General on the\nsubject of special grants by the Government in aid of the\nestablishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and\nthe policy he recommends for the development of increased\ncommercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring\ncountries should receive the careful consideration of\nCongress.\nIt is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of\npopulation, improvement, and governmental institutions\nover the new and unoccupied portions of our country have\nscarcely been checked, much less impeded or destroyed, by\nour great civil war, which at \ufb01rst glance would seem to\nhave absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.\nThe organization and admission of the State of Nevada\nhas been completed in conformity with law, and thus our\nexcellent system is \ufb01rmly established in the mountains,\nwhich once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste\nbetween the Atlantic States and those which have grown up\non the coast of the Paci\ufb01c Ocean.\n The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition\nof prosperity and rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by\nreason of their great distance and the interruption of\ncommunication with them by Indian hostilities, have been\nonly partially organized; but it is understood that these\ndi\ufb00iculties are about to disappear, which will permit their\ngovernments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and\nfull operation.\nAs intimately connected with and promotive of this\nmaterial growth of the nation, I ask the attention of\nCongress to the valuable information and important\nrecommendations relating to the public lands, Indian\na\ufb00airs, the Paci\ufb01c Railroad, and mineral discoveries\ncontained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior\nwhich is herewith transmitted, and which report also\nembraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and other\ntopics of public interest pertaining to his Department.\nThe quantity of public land disposed of during the \ufb01ve\nquarters ending on the thirtieth of September last was\n,, acres, of which ,, acres were entered\nunder the homestead law. The remainder was located with\nmilitary land warrants, agricultural scrip certi\ufb01ed to States\nfor railroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from\nsales and location fees was  ,,.\nThe income from sales during the \ufb01scal year ending June\n, , was  ,., against  ,. received\nduring the preceding year. The aggregate number of acres\nsurveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity\n disposed of, and there is open to settlement about\n,, acres of surveyed land.\nThe great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the\nPaci\ufb01c States by railways and telegraph lines has been\nentered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success,\nnotwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the\nprevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of\nthe main line of the road has been de\ufb01nitely located for one\nhundred miles westward from the initial point at Omaha\nCity, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of the Paci\ufb01c\nRailroad of California has been made from Sacramento\neastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.\nNumerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines\nhave been added to the many heretofore known, and the\ncountry occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky\nmountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with\nenterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is\nbelieved that the produce of the mines of precious metals\nin that region has during the year reached, if not exceeded,\n ,, in value.\nIt was recommended in my last annual message that our\nIndian system be remodeled. Congress at its last session,\nacting \nupon \nthe \nrecommendation, \ndid \nprovide \nfor\nreorganizing the system in California, and it is believed that\nunder the present organization the management of the\nIndians there will be attended with reasonable success.\nMuch yet remains to be done to provide for the proper\ngovernment of the Indians in other parts of the country, to\nrender it secure for the advancing settler, and to provide\n for the welfare of the Indian. The Secretary reiterates his\nrecommendations, and to them the attention of Congress is\ninvited.\nThe liberal provisions made by Congress for paying\npensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the Republic and\nto the widows, orphans, and dependent mothers of those\nwho have fallen in battle or died of disease contracted or of\nwounds received in the service of their country have been\ndiligently administered. There have been added to the\npension rolls during the year ending the th day of June\nlast the names of , invalid soldiers and of \ndisabled seamen, making the present number of army\ninvalid pensioners , and of navy invalid pensioners\n.\nOf widows, orphans, and mothers , have been\nplaced on the army pension rolls and  on the navy rolls.\nThe present number of army pensioners of this class is\n, and of navy pensioners . At the beginning of the\nyear the number of Revolutionary pensioners was .\nOnly twelve of them were soldiers, of whom seven have\nsince died. The remainder are those who under the law\nreceive pensions because of relationship to Revolutionary\nsoldiers. During the year ending the thirtieth of June, ,\n ,,. have been paid to pensioners of all classes.\nI cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the\nbenevolent institutions of the District of Columbia which\nhave hitherto been established or fostered by Congress,\nand respectfully refer for information concerning them and\nin relation to the Washington Aqueduct, the Capitol, and\n other matters of local interest to the report of the\nSecretary.\nThe Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its\npresent energetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending\nitself to the great and vital interest it was created to\nadvance. It is peculiarly the people\u2019s department, in which\nthey feel more directly concerned than in any other. I\ncommend it to the continued attention and fostering care of\nCongress.\nThe war continues. Since the last annual message all the\nimportant lines and positions then occupied by our forces\nhave been maintained and our arms have steadily\nadvanced, thus liberating the regions left in rear, so that\nMissouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States\nhave again produced reasonably fair crops.\nThe most remarkable feature in the military operations of\nthe year is General Sherman\u2019s attempted march of three\nhundred miles directly through the insurgent region. It\ntends to show a great increase of our relative strength that\nour General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and hold\nin check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach\na well-appointed large army to move on such an expedition.\nThe result not yet being known, conjecture in regard to it is\nnot here indulged.\nImportant movements have also occurred during the year\nto the e\ufb00ect of molding society for durability in the Union.\nAlthough short of complete success, it is much in the right\ndirection that twelve thousand citizens in each of the States\nof Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State\n governments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly\nstruggling \nto \nmaintain \nand \nadminister \nthem. \nThe\nmovements in the same direction more extensive though\nless de\ufb01nite in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, should\nnot be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of\ncomplete success. Maryland is secure to liberty and union\nfor all the future. The genius of rebellion will no more claim\nMaryland. Like another foul spirit being driven out, it may\nseek to tear her, but it will woo her no more.\nAt the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of\nthe Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United\nStates passed the Senate, but failed for lack of the requisite\ntwo-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Although\nthe present is the same Congress and nearly the same\nmembers, \nand \nwithout \nquestioning \nthe \nwisdom \nor\npatriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to\nrecommend the reconsideration and passage of the\nmeasure at the present session. Of course the abstract\nquestion is not changed; but an intervening election shows\nalmost certainly that the next Congress will pass the\nmeasure if this does not. Hence there is only a question of\ntime as to when the proposed amendment will go to the\nStates for their action. And as it is to so go at all events,\nmay we not agree that the sooner the better? It is not\nclaimed that the election has imposed a duty on members\nto change their views or their votes any further than, as an\nadditional element to be considered, their judgment may be\na\ufb00ected by it. It is the voice of the people now for the \ufb01rst\ntime heard upon the question. In a great national crisis like\n ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common\nend is very desirable, almost indispensable. And yet no\napproach to such unanimity is attainable unless some\ndeference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply\nbecause it is the will of the majority. In this case the\ncommon end is the maintenance of the Union, and among\nthe means to secure that end such will, through the\nelection, is most clearly declared in favor of such\nConstitutional amendment.\nThe most reliable indication of public purpose in this\ncountry is derived through our popular elections. Judging\nby the recent canvass and its result, the purpose of the\npeople within the loyal States to maintain the integrity of\nthe Union was never more \ufb01rm nor more nearly unanimous\nthan now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with\nwhich the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls\ngive strong assurance of this. Not only all those who\nsupported the Union ticket, so called, but a great majority\nof the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to\nentertain and to be actuated by the same purpose. It is an\nunanswerable argument to this e\ufb00ect that no candidate for\nany o\ufb00ice whatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes\non the avowal that he was for giving up the Union. There\nhave been much impugning of motives and much heated\ncontroversy as to the proper means and best mode of\nadvancing the Union cause, but on the distinct issue of\nUnion or no Union the politicians have shown their\ninstinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the\npeople. In a\ufb00ording the people the fair opportunity of\n showing one to another and to the world this \ufb01rmness and\nunanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast value to\nthe national cause.\nThe election has exhibited another fact not less valuable\nto be known \u2014 the fact that we do not approach exhaustion\nin the most important branch of national resources, that of\nliving men. While it is melancholy to re\ufb02ect that the war\nhas \ufb01lled so many graves and carried mourning to so many\nhearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the\nsurviving, the fallen have been so few. While corps and\ndivisions and brigades and regiments have formed and\nfought and dwindled and gone out of existence, a great\nmajority of the men who composed them are still living. The\nsame is true of the naval service. The election returns\nprove this. So many voters could not else be found. The\nStates regularly holding elections, both now and four years\nago, to wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,\nMichigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New\nJersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode\nIsland, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast\n,, votes now, against ,, cast then, showing\nan aggregate now of ,,. To this is to be added\n, cast now in the new States of Kansas and Nevada,\nwhich States did not vote in , thus swelling the\naggregate to ,, and the net increase during the\nthree years and a half of war to ,. A table is\nappended showing particulars. To this again should be\nadded the number of all soldiers in the \ufb01eld from\n Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,\nIndiana, Illinois, and California, who by the laws of those\nStates could not vote away from their homes, and which\nnumber can not be less than ,. Nor yet is this all. The\nnumber in organized Territories is triple now what it was\nfour years ago \u2014 while thousands, white and black, join us\nas the national arms press back the insurgent lines. So\nmuch is shown, a\ufb00irmatively and negatively, by the\nelection. It is not material to inquire how the increase has\nbeen produced or to show that it would have been greater\nbut for the war, which is probably true. The important fact\nremains demonstrated that we have more men now than we\nhad when the war began; that we are not exhausted nor in\nprocess of exhaustion; that we are gaining strength and\nmay if need be maintain the contest inde\ufb01nitely. [This\nsentence recognizes the concern of a guerilla war after the\nmain war \ufb01nished.]This as to men. Material resources are\nnow more complete and abundant than ever.\nThe national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as\nwe believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to re-\nestablish and maintain the national authority is unchanged,\nand, as we believe, unchangeable. The manner of\ncontinuing the e\ufb00ort remains to choose. On careful\nconsideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me\nthat no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader\ncould result in any good. He would accept nothing short of\nseverance of the Union, precisely what we will not and can\nnot give. His declarations to this e\ufb00ect are explicit and oft\nrepeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He a\ufb00ords us\n no excuse to deceive ourselves. He can not voluntarily\nreaccept the Union; we can not voluntarily yield it. Between\nhim and us the issue is distinct, simple, and in\ufb02exible. It is\nan issue which can only be tried by war and decided by\nvictory. If we yield, we are beaten; if the Southern people\nfail him, he is beaten. Either way it would be the victory\nand defeat following war. What is true, however, of him who\nheads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those\nwho follow. Although he can not reaccept the Union, they\ncan. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and\nreunion. The number of such may increase. They can at any\nmoment have peace simply by laying down their arms and\nsubmitting to the national authority under the Constitution.\nAfter so much the Government could not, if it would,\nmaintain war against them. The loyal people would not\nsustain or allow it. If questions should remain, we would\nadjust \nthem \nby \nthe \npeaceful \nmeans \nof \nlegislation,\nconference, \ncourts, \nand \nvotes, \noperating \nonly \nin\nConstitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and other\npossible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive\npower to adjust; as, for instance, the admission of members\ninto \nCongress \nand \nwhatever \nmight \nrequire \nthe\nappropriation of money. The Executive power itself would\nbe greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war.\nPardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still\nbe within Executive control. In what spirit and temper this\ncontrol would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the\npast.\n A year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon speci\ufb01ed\nterms, were o\ufb00ered to all except certain designated\nclasses, and it was at the same time made known that the\nexcepted classes were still within contemplation of special\nclemency. During the year many availed themselves of the\ngeneral provision, and many more would, only that the\nsigns of bad faith in some led to such precautionary\nmeasures as rendered the practical process less easy and\ncertain. During the same time also special pardons have\nbeen granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no\nvoluntary application has been denied. Thus practically the\ndoor has been for a full year open to all except such as\nwere not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as\nwere in custody or under constraint. It is still so open to all.\nBut the time may come, probably will come, when public\nduty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more\nrigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted.\nIn presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to\nthe national authority on the part of the insurgents as the\nonly indispensable condition to ending the war on the part\nof the Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to\nslavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that\n\u201cwhile I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to\nretract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall\nI return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of\nthat proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress.\u201d If the\npeople should, by whatever mode or means, make it an\nExecutive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not\nI, must be their instrument to perform it.\n In stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to\nsay that the war will cease on the part of the Government\nwhenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who\nbegan it.\nA.

Now, the\nundertaking being a success, the honor is all yours; for I\nbelieve none of us went further than to acquiesce.\nAnd taking the work of General Thomas into the count,\nas it should be taken, it is indeed a great success. Not only\ndoes it a\ufb00ord the obvious and immediate military\nadvantages; but in showing to the world that your army\ncould be divided, putting the stronger part to an important\nnew service, and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old\nopposing force of the whole, \u2014 Hood\u2019s army, \u2014 it brings\nthose who sat in darkness to see a great light.

I am very anxious that, in case of\nGeneral Buell\u2019s moving toward Nashville, the enemy shall\nnot be greatly reinforced, and I think there is danger he\nwill be from Columbus. It seems to me that a real or\nfeigned attack upon Columbus from up the river at the\nsame time would either prevent this or compensate for it by\nthrowing Columbus into our hands. I wrote General Buell a\nletter similar to this, meaning that he and you shall\ncommunicate and act in concert, unless it be your judgment\nand his that there is no necessity for it. You and he will\nunderstand much better than I how to do it. Please do not\nlose time in this matter.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  H    \n    \n  \nA   A\nIN VIEW OF the recent declaration of the people of\nMaryland of their adhesion to the Union, so distinctly made\nin their recent election, the President directs that all the\nprisoners who having heretofore been arrested in that\nState are now detained in military custody by the\nPresident\u2019s authority, be released from their imprisonment\non the following conditions, namely: that if they were\nholding any civil or military o\ufb00ices when arrested, the\nterms of which have expired, they shall not resume or\nreclaim such o\ufb00ice; and secondly, all persons availing\nthemselves of this proclamation shall engage by oath or\nparole of honor to maintain the Union and the Constitution\nof the United States, and in no way to aid or abet by arms,\ncounsel, conversation, or information of any kind the\nexisting insurrection against the Government of the United\nStates.\nTo guard against misapprehension it is proper to state\nthat this proclamation does not apply to prisoners of war.\n    A\n   \n  \n    .\nWASHINGTON, January , \nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a letter to the Secretary\nof State from James R.

LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  .  \n   .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, \nJANUARY , .\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your despatch of yesterday has been\nreceived, and it disappoints and distresses me. I have\nshown it to General McClellan, who says he will write you\nto-day. I am not competent to criticize your views, and\ntherefore what I o\ufb00er is in justi\ufb01cation of myself. Of the\ntwo, I would rather have a point on the railroad south of\nCumberland Gap than Nashville. First, because it cuts a\ngreat \nartery \nof \nthe \nenemy\u2019s \ncommunication, \nwhich\nNashville does not; and secondly, because it is in the midst\nof loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is\nnot. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East\nTennessee would not be a diversion in your favor rather\nthan a disadvantage, assuming that a movement toward\nNashville is the main object. But my distress is that our\nfriends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to\ndespair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel\narms for the sake of personal protection. In this we lose the\nmost valuable stake we have in the South. My despatch, to\nwhich yours is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of\nSenator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East\nTennessee, and they will be upon me to know the answer,\n which I cannot safely show them. They would despair,\npossibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or\ndie with them. I do not intend this to be an order in any\nsense, but merely, as intimated before, to show you the\ngrounds of my anxiety.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   \n   .\nWASHINGTON, January , .\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL D.C. BUELL, Louisville: Please\nname as early a day as you safely can on or before which\nyou can be ready to move southward in concert with Major-\nGeneral Halleck. Delay is ruining us, and it is indispensable\nfor me to have something de\ufb01nite. I send a like despatch to\nMajor-General Halleck.\nA. LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  \n    .\nWASHINGTON, January , \nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\nI transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the\nminister of his Majesty the Emperor of Austria accredited\nto this government, and a copy of a note to that minister\nfrom the Secretary of State relative to the questions\ninvolved in the taking from the British steamer Trent of\ncertain citizens of the United States by order of Captain\nWilkes of the United States Navy. This correspondence may\nbe considered as a sequel to that previously communicated\nto Congress relating to the same subject.\nA. LINCOLN.\n I\n   \n \n  \n          \n \n \n  A\nHA     \nJANUARY , .\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI\nST. Louis, January , .\nTo His E CELLENCY THE PRESIDENT: In reply to your\nExcellency\u2019s letter of the st instant, I have to state that on\nreceiving your telegram I immediately communicated with\nGeneral Buell and have since sent him all the information I\ncould obtain of the enemy\u2019s movements about Columbus\nand Camp Beauregard. No considerable force has been\nsent from those places to Bowling Green. They have about\n, men at Columbus, and the place is strongly forti\ufb01ed.\nI have at Cairo, Port Holt, and Paducah only about ,,\nwhich, after leaving guards at these places, would give me\nbut little over , men with which to assist General\nBuell. It would be madness to attempt anything serious\nwith such a force, and I cannot at the present time\nwithdraw any from Missouri without risking the loss of this\nState. The troops recently raised in other States of this\ndepartment have, without my knowledge, been sent to\nKentucky and Kansas.\nI am satis\ufb01ed that the authorities at Washington do not\nappreciate the di\ufb00iculties with which we have to contend\n here. The operations of Lane, Jennison, and others have so\nenraged the people of Missouri that it is estimated that\nthere is a majority of , against the government. We\nare virtually in an enemy\u2019s country. Price and others have a\nconsiderable army in the southwest, against which I am\noperating with all my available force.\nThis city and most of the middle and northern counties\nare \ninsurrectionary, \n\u2014 \nburning \nbridges, \ndestroying\ntelegraph lines, etc., \u2014 and can be kept down only by the\npresence of troops. A large portion of the foreign troops\norganized by General Fremont are unreliable; indeed, many\nof them are already mutinous. They have been tampered\nwith by politicians, and made to believe that if they get up a\nmutiny and demand Fremont\u2019s return the government will\nbe forced to restore him to duty here. It is believed that\nsome high o\ufb00icers are in the plot I have already been\nobliged to disarm several of these organizations, and I am\ndaily expecting more serious outbreaks. Another grave\ndi\ufb00iculty is the want of proper general o\ufb00icers to command\nthe troops and enforce order and discipline, and especially\nto protect public property from robbery and plunder. Some\nof the brigadier-generals assigned to this department are\nentirely ignorant of their duties and un\ufb01t for any command.\nI assure you, Mr. President, it is very di\ufb00icult to accomplish\nmuch with such means. I am in the condition of a carpenter\nwho is required to build a bridge with a dull axe, a broken\nsaw, and rotten timber. It is true that I have some very good\ngreen timber, which will answer the purpose as soon as I\ncan get it into shape and season it a little.\n I know nothing of General Buell\u2019s intended operations,\nnever having received any information in regard to the\ngeneral plan of campaign. If it be intended that his column\nshall move on Bowling Green while another moves from\nCairo or Paducah on Columbus or Camp Beauregard, it will\nbe a repetition of the same strategic error which produced\nthe disaster of Bull Run. To operate on exterior lines\nagainst an enemy occupying a central position will fail, as it\nalways has failed, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. It\nis condemned by every military authority I have ever read.\nGeneral Buell\u2019s army and the forces at Paducah occupy\nprecisely the same position in relation to each other and to\nthe enemy as did the armies of McDowell and Patterson\nbefore the battle of Bull Run.\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant, H. W. HALLECK,\nMajor-General [Indorsement]\nThe within is a copy of a letter just received from General\nHalleck. It is exceedingly discouraging. As everywhere else,\nnothing can be done.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n   \n  A\n  \n.\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January , \nGOVERNOR JOHN A. ANDREW, Boston:\nI will be greatly obliged if you will arrange; somehow\nwith General Butler to o\ufb00icer his two un-o\ufb00icered\nregiments.\nA. LINCOLN\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  .  \n   .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January , \nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL.\nMY DEAR SIR \u2014 Your despatch of yesterday is received,\nin which you say, \u201cI received your letter and General\nMcClellan\u2019s, and will at once devote my e\ufb00orts to your\nviews and his.\u201d In the midst of my many cares I have not\nseen, nor asked to see, General McClellan\u2019s letter to you.\nFor my own views, I have not o\ufb00ered and do not now o\ufb00er\nthem as orders; and while I am glad to have them\nrespectfully considered, I would blame you to follow them\ncontrary to your own clear judgment, unless I should put\nthem in the form of orders. As to General McClellan\u2019s\nviews, you understand your duty in regard to them better\nthan I do.\nWith this preliminary I state my general idea of this war\nto be, that we have the greater numbers and the enemy has\nthe greater facility of concentrating forces upon points of\ncollision; that we must fail unless we can \ufb01nd some way of\nmaking our advantage an overmatch for his; and that this\ncan only be done by menacing him with superior forces at\ndi\ufb00erent points at the same time, so that we can safely\nattack one or both if he makes no change; and if he\nweakens one to strengthen the other, forbear to attack the\n strengthened one, but seize and hold the weakened one,\ngaining so much.\nTo illustrate: Suppose last summer, when Winchester ran\naway to reinforce Manassas, we had forborne to attack\nManassas, but had seized and held Winchester. I mention\nthis to illustrate and not to criticise. I did not lose\ncon\ufb01dence in McDowell, and I think less harshly of\nPatterson than some others seem to.... Applying the\nprinciple to your case, my idea is that Halleck shall menace\nColumbus and \u201cdown river\u201d generally, while you menace\nBowling Green and East Tennessee. If the enemy shall\nconcentrate at Bowling Green, do not retire from his front,\nyet do not \ufb01ght him there either, but seize Columbus and\nEast Tennessee, one or both, left exposed by the\nconcentration at Bowling Green. It is a matter of no small\nanxiety to me, and which I am sure you will not overlook,\nthat the East Tennessee line is so long and over so bad a\nroad.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n(Indorsement.) Having to-day written General Buell a\nletter, it occurs to me to send General Halleck a copy of it.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A  H. \n.

He is an educated and talented German gentleman,\nas true a man as lives. With his assistance you can set\neverything right with the Germans.... My clear judgment is\nthat, with reference to the German element in your\ncommand, you should have Governor Koerner with you; and\nif agreeable to you and him, I will make him a brigadier-\ngeneral, so that he can a\ufb00ord to give his time. He does not\nwish to command in the \ufb01eld, though he has more military\nknowledge than some who do. If he goes into the place, he\nwill simply be an e\ufb00icient, zealous, and unsel\ufb01sh assistant\nto you.

In view of this, might it\nnot be safest for us to cross the Occoquan at Coichester,\nrather than at the village of Occoquan? This would cost the\nenemy two miles of travel to meet us, but would, on the\ncontrary, leave us two miles farther from our ultimate\ndestination.\nThird.

General Hunter is the senior\no\ufb00icer, and must command when they serve together;\nthough in so far as he can consistently with the public\nservice and his own honor oblige General Lane, he will also\noblige \nme. \nIf \nthey \ncannot \ncome \nto \nan \namicable\nunderstanding, General Lane must report to General\nHunter for duty, according to the rules, or decline the\nservice.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n I   \n \n   \n.       A I\n  \n \n I I A    I \n   .\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February ,.\nTHE BREAKING OUT of a formidable insurrection based on a\ncon\ufb02ict of political ideas, being an event without precedent\nin the United States, was necessarily attended by great\nconfusion and perplexity of the public mind. Disloyalty\nbefore unsuspected suddenly became bold, and treason\nastonished the world by bringing at once into the \ufb01eld\nmilitary forces superior in number to the standing army of\nthe United States.\nEvery department of the government was paralyzed by\ntreason. Defection appeared in the Senate, in the House of\nRepresentatives, in the Cabinet, in the Federal courts;\nministers and consuls returned from foreign countries to\nenter the insurrectionary councils of land or naval forces;\ncommanding and other o\ufb00icers of the army and in the navy\nbetrayed our councils or deserted their posts for commands\nin the insurgent forces. Treason was \ufb02agrant in the\nrevenue and in the post-o\ufb00ice service, as well as in the\nTerritorial governments and in the Indian reserves.\nNot only governors, judges, legislators, and ministerial\no\ufb00icers in the States, but even whole States rushed one\nafter another with apparent unanimity into rebellion. The\n capital was besieged and its connection with all the States\ncut o\ufb00. Even in the portions of the country which were most\nloyal, political combinations and secret societies were\nformed furthering the work of disunion, while, from\nmotives of disloyalty or cupidity or from excited passions or\nperverted sympathies, individuals were found furnishing\nmen, money, and materials of war and supplies to the\ninsurgents\u2019 military and naval forces. Armies, ships,\nforti\ufb01cations, navy yards, arsenals, military posts, and\ngarrisons one after another were betrayed or abandoned to\nthe insurgents.\nCongress had not anticipated, and so had not provided\nfor, the emergency. The municipal authorities were\npowerless and inactive. The judicial machinery seemed as if\nit had been designed, not to sustain the government, but to\nembarrass and betray it.\nForeign intervention, openly invited and industriously\ninstigated by the abettors of the insurrection, became\nimminent, and has only been prevented by the practice of\nstrict and impartial justice, with the most perfect\nmoderation, in our intercourse with nations.\nThe public mind was alarmed and apprehensive, though\nfortunately not distracted or disheartened. It seemed to be\ndoubtful whether the Federal Government, which one year\nbefore had been thought a model worthy of universal\nacceptance, had indeed the ability to defend and maintain\nitself.\nSome reverses, which, perhaps, were unavoidable,\nsu\ufb00ered by newly levied and ine\ufb00icient forces, discouraged\n the loyal and gave new hopes to the insurgents. Voluntary\nenlistments \nseemed \nabout \nto \ncease \nand \ndesertions\ncommenced. Parties speculated upon the question whether\nconscription had not become necessary to \ufb01ll up the armies\nof the United States.\nIn this emergency the President felt it his duty to employ\nwith \nenergy \nthe \nextraordinary \npowers \nwhich \nthe\nConstitution con\ufb01des to him in cases of insurrection. He\ncalled into the \ufb01eld such military and naval forces,\nunauthorized by the existing laws, as seemed necessary. He\ndirected measures to prevent the use of the post-o\ufb00ice for\ntreasonable correspondence. He subjected passengers to\nand from foreign countries to new passport regulations,\nand he instituted a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas\ncorpus in various places, and caused persons who were\nrepresented to him as being or about to engage in disloyal\nand treasonable practices to be arrested by special civil as\nwell as military agencies and detained in military custody\nwhen necessary to prevent them and deter others from\nsuch practices. Examinations of such cases were instituted,\nand some of the persons so arrested have been discharged\nfrom time to time under circumstances or upon conditions\ncompatible, as was thought, with the public safety.\nMeantime a favorable change of public opinion has\noccurred. The line between loyalty and disloyalty is plainly\nde\ufb01ned. The whole structure of the government is \ufb01rm and\nstable. Apprehension of public danger and facilities for\ntreasonable practices have diminished with the passions\nwhich prompted heedless persons to adopt them. The\n insurrection is believed to have culminated and to be\ndeclining.\nThe President, in view of these facts, and anxious to\nfavor a return to the normal course of the administration as\nfar as regard for the public welfare will allow, directs that\nall political prisoners or state prisoners now held in military\ncustody be released on their subscribing to a parole\nengaging them to render no aid or comfort to the enemies\nin hostility to the United States.\nThe Secretary of War will, however, in his discretion,\nexcept from the e\ufb00ect of this order any persons detained as\nspies in the service of the insurgents, or others whose\nrelease \nat \nthe \npresent \nmoment \nmay \nbe \ndeemed\nincompatible with the public safety.\nTo all persons who shall be so released, and who shall\nkeep their parole, the President grants an amnesty for any\npast o\ufb00ences of treason or disloyalty which they may have\ncomminuted.\nExtraordinary arrests will hereafter be made under the\ndirection of the military authorities alone.\nBy order of the President EDWIN M. STANTON,\nSecretary of War.\n    A\n   \n  \n    . \nA HI\n \n  I  \n e ruar         \nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF\nTHE UNITED STATES:\nTHE THIRD SECTION of the \u201cAct further to promote the\ne\ufb00iciency of the Navy,\u201d approved December , ,\nprovides\n\u201cThat the President of the United States, by and with the\nadvice and consent of the Senate, shall have the authority\nto detail from the retired list of the navy for the command\nof squadrons and single ships such o\ufb00icers as he may\nbelieve that the good of the service requires to be thus\nplaced in command; and such o\ufb00icers may, if upon the\nrecommendation of the President of the United States they\nshall receive a vote of thanks of Congress for their services\nand gallantry in action against an enemy, be restored to the\nactive list, and not otherwise.\u201d\nIn \nconformity \nwith \nthis \nlaw, \nCaptain \nLouis \nM.\nGoldsborough, of the navy, was nominated to the Senate for\ncontinuance as the \ufb02ag-o\ufb00icer in command of the North\nAtlantic Blockading Squadron, which recently rendered\nsuch important service to the Union in the expedition to the\ncoast of North Carolina.\n Believing that no occasion could arise which would more\nfully correspond with the intention of the law or be more\npregnant with happy in\ufb02uence as an example, I cordially\nrecommend that Captain Louis M. Goldsborough receive a\nvote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry\ndisplayed in the combined attack of the forces commanded\nby him and Brigadier-General Burnside in the capture of\nRoanoke Island and the destruction of rebel gunboats On\nthe th, th, and th of February, .\nA.

Columbus will not get\nat Grant, but the force from Bowling Green will. They hold\nthe railroad from Bowling Green to within a few miles of\nFort Donelson, with the bridge at Clarksville undisturbed. It\nis unsafe to rely that they will not dare to expose Nashville\nto Buell. A small part of their force can retire slowly toward\nNashville, breaking up the railroad as they go, and keep\nBuell out of that city twenty days. Meanwhile Nashville will\nbe abundantly defended by forces from all South and\nperhaps from hers at Manassas. Could not a cavalry force\nfrom General Thomas on the upper Cumberland dash\nacross, almost unresisted, and cut the railroad at or near\nKnoxville, Tennessee? In the midst of a bombardment at\nFort Donelson, why could not a gunboat run up and destroy\nthe bridge at Clarksville? Our success or failure at Fort\n Donelson is vastly important, and I beg you to put your soul\nin the e\ufb00ort. I send a copy of this to Buell.\nA.

LINCOLN.\n      H  \n  H     \n IA\n \nI\nI    \nWASHINGTON, D. C., MARCH , \nTHE UNITED STATES have no enmities, animosities, or\nrivalries, and no interests which con\ufb02ict with the welfare,\nsafety, and rights or interests of any other nation. Their\nown prosperity, happiness, and aggrandizement are sought\nmost safely and advantageously through the preservation\nnot only of peace on their own part, but peace among all\nother nations. But while the United States are thus a friend\nto all other nations, they do not seek to conceal the fact\nthat they cherish especial sentiments of friendship for, and\nsympathies with, those who, like themselves, have founded\ntheir institutions on the principle of the equal rights of\nmen; and such nations being more prominently neighbors\nof the United States, the latter are co-operating with them\nin establishing civilization and culture on the American\ncontinent. Such being the general principles which govern\nthe United States in their foreign relations, you may be\nassured, sir, that in all things this government will deal\njustly, frankly, and, if it be possible, even liberally with\nPeru, whose liberal sentiments toward us you have so\nkindly expressed.\n    A\n   \n  \n        \n \nI\n \n  \n A  \n  \nA\n I A I\n.\nMarch , \nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: \u2014 I recommend the adoption of a\njoint resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be\nsubstantially as follows:\n\u201cResolved, That the United States ought to co-operate\nwith any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of\nslavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by\nsuch State, in its discretion, to compensate for the\ninconveniences, public and private, produced by such\nchange of system.\u201d\nIf the proposition contained in the resolution does not\nmeet the approval of Congress and the country, there is the\nend; but if it does command such approval, I deem it of\nimportance that the States and people immediately\ninterested should be at once distinctly noti\ufb01ed of the fact,\nso that they may begin to consider whether to accept or\nreject it. The Federal Government would \ufb01nd its highest\ninterest in such a measure, as one of the most e\ufb00icient\nmeans of self-preservation. The leaders of the existing\ninsurrection entertain the hope that this government will\nultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of\n some part of the disa\ufb00ected region, and that all the slave\nStates north of such part will then say, \u201cThe Union for\nwhich we have struggled being already gone, we now\nchoose to go with the Southern section.\u201d To deprive them of\nthis hope substantially ends the rebellion, and the initiation\nof emancipation completely deprives them of it as to all the\nStates initiating it. The point is not that all the States\ntolerating slavery would very soon, if at all, initiate\nemancipation; but that, while the o\ufb00er is equally made to\nall, the more northern shall by such initiation make it\ncertain to the more southern that in no event will the\nformer ever join the latter in their proposed confederacy. I\nsay \u201cinitiation\u201d because, in my judgment, gradual and not\nsudden emancipation is better for all. In the mere \ufb01nancial\nor pecuniary view, any member of Congress with the\ncensus tables and treasury reports before him can readily\nsee for himself how very soon the current expenditures of\nthis war would purchase, at fair valuation, all the slaves in\nany named State. Such a proposition on the part of the\nGeneral Government sets up no claim of a right by Federal\nauthority to interfere with slavery within State limits,\nreferring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject in\neach case to the State and its people immediately\ninterested. It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free\nchoice with them.\nIn the annual message last December, I thought \ufb01t to say,\n\u201cThe Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable\nmeans must be employed.\u201d I said this not hastily, but\ndeliberately. War has been made and continues to be an\n indispensable \nmeans \nto \nthis \nend. \nA \npractical\nreacknowledgment of the national authority would render\nthe war unnecessary, and it would at once cease. If,\nhowever, resistance continues, the war must also continue;\nand it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may\nattend and all the ruin which may follow it. Such as may\nseem indispensable or may obviously promise great\ne\ufb00iciency toward ending the struggle must and will come.\nThe proposition now made (though an o\ufb00er only), I hope\nit may be esteemed no o\ufb00ense to ask whether the\npecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more\nvalue to the States and private persons concerned than are\nthe institution and property in it in the present aspect of\na\ufb00airs.\nWhile it is true that the adoption of the proposed\nresolution would be merely initiatory, and not within itself a\npractical measure, it is recommended in the hope that it\nwould soon lead to important practical results. In full view\nof my great responsibility to my God and to my country, I\nearnestly beg the attention of Congress and the people to\nthe subject.\nA.

Mr. Leary and myself were the only members\nfrom Maryland present, and, I think, were the only\nmembers of the delegation at that time in the city. I know\n that Mr. Pearoe, of the Senate, and Messrs. Webster and\nCalvert, of the House, were absent.\nAfter the usual salutations, and we were seated, the\nPresident said, in substance, that he had invited us to meet\nhim to have some conversation with us in explanation of his\nmessage of the th; that since he had sent it in several of\nthe gentlemen then present had visited him, but had\navoided any allusion to the message, and he therefore\ninferred that the import of the message had been\nmisunderstood, and was regarded as inimical to the\ninterests we represented; and he had resolved he would\ntalk with us, and disabuse our minds of that erroneous\nopinion.\nThe President then disclaimed any intent to injure the\ninterests or wound the sensibilities of the slave States. On\nthe contrary, his purpose was to protect the one and\nrespect the other; that we were engaged in a terrible,\nwasting, and tedious war; immense armies were in the\n\ufb01eld, and must continue in the \ufb01eld as long as the war\nlasts; that these armies must, of necessity, be brought into\ncontact with slaves in the States we represented and in\nother States as they advanced; that slaves would come to\nthe camps, and continual irritation was kept up; that he\nwas constantly annoyed by con\ufb02icting and antagonistic\ncomplaints: on the one side a certain class complained if\nthe slave was not protected by the army; persons were\nfrequently found who, participating in these views, acted in\na way unfriendly to the slaveholder; on the other hand,\nslaveholders complained that their rights were interfered\n with, their slaves induced to abscond and protected within\nthe lines; these complaints were numerous, loud and deep;\nwere a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the\nprogress of the war; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the\ngovernment in the States we represented; strengthened the\nhopes of the Confederates that at some day the border\nStates would unite with them, and thus tend to prolong the\nwar; and he was of opinion, if this resolution should be\nadopted by Congress and accepted by our States, these\ncauses of irritation and these hopes would be removed, and\nmore would be accomplished toward shortening the war\nthan could be hoped from the greatest victory achieved by\nUnion armies; that he made this proposition in good faith,\nand desired it to be accepted, if at all, voluntarily, and in\nthe same patriotic spirit in which it was made; that\nemancipation was a subject exclusively under the control of\nthe States, and must be adopted or rejected by each for\nitself; that he did not claim nor had this government any\nright to coerce them for that purpose; that such was no\npart of his purpose in making this proposition, and he\nwished it to be clearly understood; that he did not expect\nus there to be prepared to give him an answer, but he\nhoped we would take the subject into serious consideration,\nconfer with one another, and then take such course as we\nfelt our duty and the interests of our constituents required\nof us.\nMr. Noell, of Missouri, said that in his State slavery was\nnot considered a permanent institution; that natural causes\nwere there in operation which would at no distant day\n extinguish it, and he did not think that this proposition was\nnecessary for that; and, besides that, he and his friends felt\nsolicitous as to the message on account of the di\ufb00erent\nconstructions which the resolution and message had\nreceived. The New York Tribune was for it, and understood\nit to mean that we must accept gradual emancipation\naccording to the plan suggested, or get something worse.\nThe President replied that he must not be expected to\nquarrel with the New York Tribune before the right time;\nhe hoped never to have to do it; he would not anticipate\nevents. In respect to emancipation in Missouri, he said that\nwhat had been observed by Mr. Noell was probably true,\nbut the operation of these natural causes had not prevented\nthe irritating conduct to which he had referred, or\ndestroyed the hopes of the Confederates that Missouri\nwould at some time merge herself alongside of them,\nwhich, in his judgment, the passage of this resolution by\nCongress and its acceptance by Missouri would accomplish.\nMr. Cris\ufb01eld, of Maryland, asked what would be the\ne\ufb00ect of the refusal of the State to accept this proposal,\nand he desired to know if the President looked to any policy\nbeyond the acceptance or rejection of this scheme.\nThe President replied that he had no designs beyond the\nactions of the States on this particular subject. He should\nlament their refusal to accept it, but he had no designs\nbeyond their refusal of it.\nMr. Menzies, of Kentucky, inquired if the President\nthought there was any power except in the States\nthemselves to carry out his scheme of emancipation.\n The President replied that he thought there could not be.\nHe then went o\ufb00 into a course of remarks not qualifying the\nforegoing declaration nor material to be repeated to a just\nunderstanding of his meaning.\nMr. Cris\ufb01eld said he did not think the people of Maryland\nlooked upon slavery as a permanent institution; and he did\nnot know that they would be very reluctant to give it up if\nprovision was made to meet the loss and they could be rid\nof the race; but they did not like to be coerced into\nemancipation, either by the direct action of the government\nor by indirection, as through the emancipation of slaves in\nthis District, or the con\ufb01scation of Southern property as\nnow threatened; and he thought before they would consent\nto consider this proposition they would require to be\ninformed on these points. The President replied that, unless\nhe was expelled by the act of God or the Confederate\narmies he should occupy that house for three years; and as\nlong as he remained there Maryland had nothing to fear\neither for her institutions or her interests on the points\nreferred to.\nMr. Cris\ufb01eld immediately added: \u201cMr. President, if what\nyou now say could be heard by the people of Maryland,\nthey would consider your proposition with a much better\nfeeling than I fear without it they will be inclined to do.\u201d\nThe President: \u201cThat [meaning a publication of what he\nsaid] will not do; it would force me into a quarrel before the\nproper time \u201c; and, again intimating, as he had before\ndone, that a quarrel with the \u201cGreeley faction\u201d was\n impending, he said he did not wish to encounter it before\nthe proper time, nor at all if it could be avoided.\n[The Greely faction wanted an immediate Emancipation\nProclamation. D.W.]\nGovernor \nWickli\ufb00e, \nof \nKentucky, \nthen \nasked \nhim\nrespecting the constitutionality of his scheme.\nThe President replied: \u201cAs you may suppose, I have\nconsidered that; and the proposition now submitted does\nnot encounter any constitutional di\ufb00iculty. It proposes\nsimply to co-operate with any State by giving such State\npecuniary aid\u201d; and he thought that the resolution, as\nproposed by him, would be considered rather as the\nexpression \nof \na \nsentiment \nthan \nas \ninvolving \nany\nconstitutional question.\nMr. Hall, of Missouri, thought that if this proposition was\nadopted at all it should be by the votes of the free States,\nand come as a proposition from them to the slave States,\na\ufb00ording them an inducement to put aside this subject of\ndiscord; that it ought not to be expected that members\nrepresenting slaveholding constituencies should declare at\nonce, and in advance of any proposition to them, for the\nemancipation of slavery.\nThe President said he saw and felt the force of the\nobjection; it was a fearful responsibility, and every\ngentleman must do as he thought best; that he did not\nknow how this scheme was received by the members from\nthe free States; some of them had spoken to him and\nreceived it kindly; but for the most part they were as\nreserved and chary as we had been, and he could not tell\n how they would vote. And in reply to some expression of\nMr. Hall as to his own opinion regarding slavery, he said he\ndid not pretend to disguise his anti-slavery feeling; that he\nthought it was wrong, and should continue to think so; but\nthat was not the question we had to deal with now. Slavery\nexisted, and that, too, as well by the act of the North as of\nthe South; and in any scheme to get rid of it the North as\nwell as the South was morally bound to do its full and equal\nshare. He thought the institution wrong and ought never to\nhave existed; but yet he recognized the rights of property\nwhich had grown out of it, and would respect those rights\nas fully as similar rights in any other property; that\nproperty can exist and does legally exist. He thought such a\nlaw wrong, but the rights of property resulting must be\nrespected; he would get rid of the odious law, not by\nviolating the rights, but by encouraging the proposition and\no\ufb00ering inducements to give it up.\nHere the interview, so far as this subject is concerned,\nterminated by Mr. Crittenden\u2019s assuring the President that,\nwhatever might be our \ufb01nal action, we all thought him\nsolely moved by a high patriotism and sincere devotion to\nthe happiness and glory of his country; and with that\nconviction we should consider respectfully the important\nsuggestions he had made.\nAfter some conversation on the current war news, we\nretired, and I immediately proceeded to my room and wrote\nout this paper.

CRISFIELD.\nWe were present at the interview described in the\nforegoing paper of Mr. Cris\ufb01eld, and we certify that the\n substance of what passed on the occasion is in this paper\nfaithfully and fully given.\nJ.

LINCOLN, President\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  . \nc     A\n.\nWASHINGTON, April , \nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN.\nMY DEAR SIR\n \u2014 Your despatches, complaining that you\nare not properly sustained, while they do not o\ufb00end me, do\npain me very much.\nBlenker\u2019s division was withdrawn from you before you\nleft here, and you knew the pressure under which I did it,\nand, as I thought, acquiesced in it certainly not without\nreluctance.\nAfter you left I ascertained that less than ,\nunorganized men, without a single \ufb01eld battery, were all\nyou designed to be left for the defense of Washington and\nManassas Junction, and part of this even to go to General\nHooker\u2019s old position; General Banks\u2019s corps, once\ndesigned for Manassas Junction, was divided and tied up on\nthe line of Winchester and Strasburg, and could not leave it\nwithout again exposing the upper Potomac and the\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad. This presented (or would\npresent when McDowell and Sumner should be gone) a\ngreat temptation to the enemy to turn back from the\nRappahannock and sack Washington. My explicit order that\nWashington should, by the judgment of all the Commanders\n of corps, be left entirely secure, had been neglected. It was\nprecisely this that drove me to detain McDowell.\nI do not forget that I was satis\ufb01ed with your arrangement\nto leave Banks at Manassas Junction; but when that\narrangement was broken up and nothing substituted for it,\nof course I was not satis\ufb01ed. I was constrained to substitute\nsomething for it myself.\nAnd now allow me to ask, do you really think I should\npermit the line from Richmond via Manaasas Junction to\nthis city to be entirely open, except what resistance could\nbe presented by less than , unorganized troops? This\nis a question which the country will not allow me to evade.\nThere is a curious mystery about the number of the\ntroops now with you. When I telegraphed you on the th,\nsaying you had over , with you, I had just obtained\nfrom the Secretary of War a statement, taken as he said\nfrom your own returns, making , then with you and\nen route to you. You now say you will have but , when\nall enroute to you shall have reached you. How can this\ndiscrepancy of , be accounted for?\nAs to General Wool\u2019s command, I understand it is doing\nfor you precisely what a like number of your own would\nhave to do if that command was away. I suppose the whole\nforce which has gone forward to you is with you by this\ntime; and if so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike\na blow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you \u2014\nthat \nis, \nhe \nwill \ngain \nfaster \nby \nforti\ufb01cations \nand\nreinforcements than you can by reinforcements alone.\n And once more let me tell you it is indispensable to you\nthat you strike a blow. I am powerless to help this. You will\ndo me the justice to remember I always insisted that going\ndown the bay in search of a \ufb01eld, instead of \ufb01ghting at or\nnear Manassas, was only shifting and not surmounting a\ndi\ufb00iculty; that we would \ufb01nd the same enemy and the same\nor equal entrenchments at either place. The country will\nnot fail to note \u2014 is noting now \u2014 that the present\nhesitation to move upon an entrenched enemy is but the\nstory of Manassas repeated.\nI beg to assure you that I have never written you or\nspoken to you in greater kindness of feeling than now, nor\nwith a fuller purpose to sustain you, so far as in my most\nanxious judgment I consistently can; but you must act.\nYours very truly,\nA.

You well know, gentlemen, and the world knows, how\nreluctantly I accepted this issue of battle forced upon me\non my advent to this place by the internal enemies of our\ncountry. You all know, the world knows, the forces and the\nresources the public agents have brought into employment\nto sustain a government against which there has been\nbrought not one complaint of real injury committed against\nsociety at home or abroad. You all may recollect that in\ntaking up the sword thus forced into our hands this\ngovernment appealed to the prayers of the pious and the\ngood, and declared that it placed its whole dependence on\nthe favor of God. I now humbly and reverently, in your\npresence, \nreiterate \nthe \nacknowledgment \nof \nthat\ndependence, not doubting that, if it shall please the Divine\nBeing who determines the destinies of nations, this shall\n remain a united people, and that they will, humbly seeking\nthe divine guidance, make their prolonged national\nexistence a source of new bene\ufb01ts to themselves and their\nsuccessors, and to all classes and conditions of mankind.\n     \n A\n  \n   A\n \n  I     . \n.\n \n  \n \nH.\nFORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, MAY , \nFLAG-OFFICER GOLDSBOROUGH.\nSIR: \u2014 Major-General McClellan telegraphs that he has\nascertained by a reconnaissance that the battery at\nJamestown has been abandoned, and he again requests\nthat gunboats may be sent up the James River.\nIf you have tolerable con\ufb01dence that you can successfully\ncontend with the Merrimac without the help of the Galena\nand two accompanying gunboats, send the Galena and two\ngunboats up the James River at once.

I wish to\nsay a few words to you privately on this subject. I ordered\nthe army corps organization not only on the unanimous\nopinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and\nassigned as generals of divisions, but also on the\nunanimous opinion of every military man I could get an\nopinion from, and every modern military book, yourself only\nexcepted. Of course, I did not on my own judgment pretend\nto understand the subject. I now think it indispensable for\nyou to know how your struggle against it is received in\nquarters which we cannot entirely disregard. It is looked\nupon as merely an e\ufb00ort to pamper one or two pets, and to\npersecute and degrade their supposed rivals. I have had no\nword from Sumner, Heintzleman, or Keyes the commanders\nof these corps are, of course, the three highest o\ufb00icers with\nyou; but I am constantly told that you have no consultation\nor communication with them; that you consult and\ncommunicate with nobody but General Fitz John Porter, and\n perhaps General Franklin. I do not say these complaints are\ntrue or just; but at all events, it is proper you should know\nof their existence. Do the commanders of corps disobey\nyour orders in anything?\nWhen you relieved General Hamilton of his command the\nother day, you thereby lost the con\ufb01dence of at least one of\nyour best friends in the Senate. And here let me say, not as\napplicable \nto \nyou \npersonally, \nthat \nSenators \nand\nRepresentatives speak of me in their places without\nquestion, and that o\ufb00icers of the army must cease\naddressing insulting letters to them for taking no greater\nliberty with them.\nBut to return. Are you strong enough \u2014 are you strong\nenough even with my help \u2014 to set your foot upon the\nnecks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes all at once? This\nis a practical and very serious question to you?\nThe success of your army and the cause of the country\nare the same, and, of course, I only desire the good of the\ncause.\nYours truly,\nA.

Hoped that the opening of James River and\nputting Wool and Burnside in communication, with an open\nroad to Richmond, or to you, had e\ufb00ected something in that\ndirection.

It occurs too frequently for me to have\nspeeches ready on all occasions. As you have paid such a\nmark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I\nshould say a word or two in reply. Your colonel has thought\n\ufb01t, on his own account and in your name, to say that you\nare satis\ufb01ed with the manner in which I have performed my\npart in the di\ufb00iculties which have surrounded the nation.\nFor your kind expressions I am extremely grateful, but on\nthe other hand I assure you that the nation is more\nindebted to you, and such as you, than to me. It is upon the\nbrave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country\nthat our reliance has been placed in support of free\ngovernment and free institutions.\nFor the part which you and the brave army of which you\nare a part have, under Providence, performed in this great\nstruggle, I tender more thanks especially to this regiment,\nwhich has been the subject of good report. The thanks of\nthe nation will follow you, and may God\u2019s blessing rest\nupon you now and forever.

In order,\ntherefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon\nRichmond at the earliest moment, General McDowell has\nbeen ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route.\nHe is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save\nthe capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put\nhis left wing in communication with your right wing, and\nyou are instructed to co-operate so as to establish this\ncommunication as soon as possible by extending your right-\nwing to the north of Richmond.\nIt is believed that this communication can be safely\nestablished either north or south of the Pamunkey River.\nIn any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of\nthe enemy\u2019s forces from leaving Richmond and falling in\n overwhelming force upon General McDowell. He will move\nwith between thirty-\ufb01ve and forty thousand men.\nA copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with\nthis. The speci\ufb01c task assigned to his command has been to\nprovide against any danger to the capital of the nation.\nAt your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent\nforward to co-operate in the reduction of Richmond, but\ncharged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of\nWashington; and you will give no order, either before or\nafter your junction, which can put him out of position to\ncover this city. You and he will communicate with each\nother by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be\nnecessary \nfor \ne\ufb00icient \ncooperation. \nWhen \nGeneral\nMcDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be\ndrawn from West Point, and you will instruct your sta\ufb00-\no\ufb00icers to be prepared to supply him by that route.\nThe President desires that General McDowell retain the\ncommand of the Department of the Rappahannock and of\nthe forces with which he moves forward.\nBy order of the President: EDWIN M. STANTON,\nSecretary of War.\nMAJOR-GENERAL \nGEORGE \nB. \nMcCLELLAN,\nCommanding Army of the Potomac, before Richmond.\n   \n  A\nA I\n    \n I\n \n \n  A  H\n    \n \n   \n  \nI I A    \nA\n I A I\nMAY , .\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA:\nA Proclamation\nWhereas there appears in the public prints what purports\nto be a proclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words\nand \ufb01gures following, to wit:\n(General \nOrders \nNo. \n) \nHEADQUARTERS\nDEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, HILTON HEAD, PORT\nROYAL, S. C., May , .\n\u201cThe three States of Georgia, Florida, and South\nCarolina, comprising the military department of the South,\nhaving deliberately declared themselves no longer under\nthe protection of the United States of America, and having\ntaken up arms against the said United States, it became a\nmilitary necessity to declare martial law. This was\naccordingly done on the th day of April, . Slavery\nand martial law in a free country are altogether\nincompatible. The persons in these three States: Georgia\nFlorida, and South Carolina \u2014 heretofore held as slaves are\ntherefore declared forever free.\n \u201cBy command of Major-General D. Hunter: \u201c(O\ufb00icial.)ED.\nW. SMITH, \u201cActing Assistant Adjutant-General.\u201d\nAnd whereas the same is producing some excitement and\nmisunderstanding: therefore,\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,\nproclaim and declare that the Government of the United\nStates, had no knowledge, information, or belief of an\nintention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a\nproclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that\nthe document is genuine. And further, that neither General\nHunter nor any other commander or person has been\nauthorized by the Government of the United States to make\na proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and\nthat the supposed proclamation now in question, whether\ngenuine or false, is altogether void so far as respects such a\ndeclaration.\nI further make known that whether it be competent for\nme, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare\nthe slaves of any State or States free, and whether, at any\ntime, in any case, it shall have become a necessity\nindispensable to the maintenance of the government to\nexercise such supposed power, are questions which under\nmy responsibility I reserve to myself, and which I cannot\nfeel justi\ufb01ed in leaving to the decision of commanders in\nthe \ufb01eld.\nThese are totally di\ufb00erent questions from those of police\nregulations in armies and camps.\nOn the sixth day of March last, by special message, I\nrecommended to Congress the adoption of a joint\n resolution, to be substantially as follows:\nResolved, That the United States ought to co-operate\nwith any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of\nslavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by\nsuch State, in its discretion, to compensate for the\ninconvenience, public and private, produced by such\nchange of system.\nThe resolution in the language above quoted was\nadopted by large majorities in both branches of Congress,\nand now stands an authentic, de\ufb01nite, and solemn proposal\nof the nation to the States and people most immediately\ninterested in the subject-matter. To the people of those\nStates I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue \u2014 I beseech\nyou to make arguments for yourselves. You cannot, if you\nwould, be blind to the signs of the times. I beg of you a\ncalm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may\nbe, far above personal and partisan politics. This proposal\nmakes common cause for a common object, casting no\nreproaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change\nit contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven,\nnot rending or wrecking anything. Will you not embrace it?\nSo much good has not been done, by one e\ufb00ort, in all past\ntime, as in the providence of God it is now your high\nprivilege to do. May the vast future not have to lament that\nyou have neglected it.\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\nDone at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of\nMay, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred\n and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United States\nthe eighty-sixth.\nA.

By land he can reach you in \ufb01ve days after\nstarting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two\nweeks, judging by past experience.

We have so thinned our\nline to get troops for other places that it was broken\nyesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one\nregiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General\nBanks in some peril.\nThe enemy\u2019s forces under General Anderson now\nopposing General McDowell\u2019s advance have as their line of\nsupply and retreat the road to Richmond.\nIf, in conjunction with McDowell\u2019s movement against\nAnderson, you could send a force from your right to cut o\ufb00\nthe enemy\u2019s supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad\nbridges across the two forks of the Pamunkey, and intercept\nthe enemy\u2019s retreat, you will prevent the army now\nopposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of\nnearly , men; and if you succeed in saving the\nbridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in\naddition to the one you now have. Can you not do this\nalmost as well as not while you are building the\nChickahominy bridges? McDowell and Shields both say\n they can, and positively will, move Monday morning.

You are\n instructed, laying aside for the present the movement on\nRichmond, to put , men in motion at once for the\nShenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of\nthe Manassas Gap railroad. Your object will be to capture\nthe forces of Jackson and Ewell, either in co-operation with\nGeneral Fremont, or, in case want of supplies or of\ntransportation, interferes with his movements, it is believed\nthat the force which you move will be su\ufb00icient to\naccomplish this object alone. The information thus far\nreceived here makes it probable that if the enemy operate\nactively against General Banks, you will not be able to\ncount upon much assistance from him, but may even have\nto release him.

P.M.\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN: Your despatch received.\nGeneral Banks was at Strasburg, with about , men,\nShields having been taken from him to swell a column for\nMcDowell to aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force\nscattered at various places. On the d a rebel force of\n to , fell upon one regiment and two companies\nguarding the bridge at Front Royal, destroying it entirely;\ncrossed the Shenandoah, and on the th (yesterday)\npushed to get north of Banks, on the road to Winchester.\nBanks ran a race with them, beating them into Winchester\nyesterday evening. This morning a battle ensued between\nthe two forces, in which Banks was beaten back into full\nretreat toward Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into\na total rout. Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, just now\nreports that Jackson is now near Front Royal, With ,,\nfollowing up and supporting, as I understand, the forces\nnow pursuing Banks, also that another force of , is\nnear Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped\nhere, as we are here, it will be all we can do to prevent\nthem crossing the Potomac at Harper\u2019s Ferry or above. We\n have about , of McDowell\u2019s force moving back to the\nvicinity of Front Royal, and General Fremont, who was at\nFranklin, is moving to Harrisonburg; both these movements\nintended to get in the enemy\u2019s rear.\nOne more of McDowell\u2019s brigades is ordered through\nhere to Harper\u2019s Ferry; the rest of his force remains for the\npresent at Fredericksburg. We are sending such regiments\nand dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare to\nHarper\u2019s Ferry, supplying their places in some sort by\ncalling in militia from the adjacent States. We also have\neighteen cannon on the road to Harper\u2019s Ferry, of which\narm there is not a single one yet at that point. This is now\nour situation.\nIf McDowell\u2019s force was now beyond our reach, we\nshould be utterly helpless. Apprehension of something like\nthis, and no unwillingness to sustain you, has always been\nmy reason for withholding McDowell\u2019s force from you.\nPlease understand this, and do the best you can with the\nforce you have.\nA. LINCOLN.\n HI  \n   \n   \n  I A   \n        I\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\nMAY ,  TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES:\nThe insurrection which is yet existing in the United\nStates and aims at the overthrow of the Federal\nConstitution and the Union, was clandestinely prepared\nduring the Winter of  and , and assumed an open\norganization in the form of a treasonable provisional\ngovernment at Montgomery, in Alabama on the th day of\nFebruary, . On the th day of April, , the\ninsurgents committed the \ufb02agrant act of civil war by the\nbombardment and the capture of Fort Sumter, Which cut\no\ufb00 the hope of immediate conciliation. Immediately\nafterward all the roads and avenues to this city were\nobstructed, and the capital was put into the condition of a\nsiege. The mails in every direction were stopped and the\nlines of telegraph cut o\ufb00 by the insurgents, and military\nand naval forces which had been called out by the\ngovernment for the defense of Washington were prevented\nfrom reaching the city by organized and combined\ntreasonable resistance in the State of Maryland. There was\nno adequate and e\ufb00ective organization for the public\ndefense. Congress had inde\ufb01nitely adjourned. There was no\n time to convene them. It became necessary for me to\nchoose whether, using only the existing means, agencies,\nand processes which Congress had provided, I should let\nthe government fall at once into ruin or whether, availing\nmyself of the broader powers conferred by the Constitution\nin cases of insurrection, I would make an e\ufb00ort to save it,\nwith all its blessings, for the present age and for posterity.\nI thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the\nheads of all the departments, to meet on Sunday, the th\nday of April, , at the o\ufb00ice of the Navy Department,\nand then and there, with their unanimous concurrence, I\ndirected that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to\nsea to a\ufb00ord protection to the commercial marine, and\nespecially the California treasure ships then on their way to\nthis coast. I also directed the commandant of the navy-yard\nat Boston to purchase or charter and arm as quickly as\npossible \ufb01ve steamships for purposes of public defense. I\ndirected the commandant of the navy-yard at Philadelphia\nto purchase or charter and arm an equal number for the\nsame purpose. I directed the commandant at New York to\npurchase or charter and arm an equal number. I directed\nCommander Gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put\nto sea two other vessels. Similar directions were given to\nCommodore Dupont, with a view to the opening of passages\nby water to and from the capital. I directed the several\no\ufb00icers to take the advice and obtain the aid and e\ufb00icient\nservices, in the matter, of his Excellency Edwin D. Morgan,\nthe Governor of New York, or in his absence George D.\nMorgan, William M. Evarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H.\n Grinnell, who were by my directions especially empowered\nby the Secretary of the Navy to act for his department in\nthat crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops\nand supplies for the public defense.\nThe several departments of the government at that time\ncontained so large a number of disloyal persons that it\nwould have been impossible to provide safely through\no\ufb00icial agents only for the performance of the duties thus\ncon\ufb01ded to citizens favorably known for their ability,\nloyalty, and patriotism.\nThe several orders issued upon these occurrences were\ntransmitted by private messengers, who pursued a\ncircuitous way to the seaboard cities, inland across the\nStates of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern lakes. I\nbelieve by these and other similar measures taken in that\ncrisis, some of which were without any authority of law, the\ngovernment was saved from overthrow. I am not aware that\na dollar of the public funds thus con\ufb01ded without authority\nof law to uno\ufb00icial persons was either lost or wasted,\nalthough apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to\nme as objections to those extraordinary proceedings, and\nwere necessarily overruled.\nI recall these transactions now because my attention has\nbeen directed to a resolution which was passed by the\nHouse of Representatives on the th day of last month,\nwhich is in these words:\n\u201cResolved, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War\nby investing Alexander Cummings with the control of large\nsums of the public money and authority to purchase\n military supplies without restriction, without requiring\nfrom him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his\nduties, when the services of competent public o\ufb00icers were\navailable, and by involving the government in a vast\nnumber of contracts with persons not legitimately engaged\nin the business pertaining to the subject-matter of such\ncontracts, especially in the purchase of arms for future\ndelivery, has adopted a policy highly injurious to the public\nservice, and deserves the censure of the House.\u201d\nCongress will see that I should be wanting equally in\ncandor and in justice if I should leave the censure\nexpressed in this resolution to rest exclusively or chie\ufb02y\nupon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is unanimously\nentertained by the heads of department who participated in\nthe proceedings which the House of Representatives have\ncensured. It is due to Mr. Cameron to say that although he\nfully approved the proceedings they were not moved nor\nsuggested by himself, and that not only the President, but\nall the other heads of departments, were at least equally\nresponsible with him for whatever error, wrong, or fault\nwas committed in the premises.\nA.

Two hours later he\ntelegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six\ncars on the Virginia Central, which he at once sent to\ncommunicate with Porter.

P.M.\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN: I am very glad of\nGeneral F. J. Porter\u2019s victory. Still, if it was a total rout of\nthe enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and\nFredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say\nyou have all the railroads but the Richmond and\nFredericksburg. I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you\ncan have any, except the scrap from Richmond to West\nPoint. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to\nHanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing. That the\nwhole of the enemy is concentrating on Richmond, I think\ncannot be certainly known to you or me. Saxton, at\nHarper\u2019s Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be\nJackson\u2019s and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown\ntoday. General King telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that\ncontrabands give certain information that , left\nHanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce Jackson.

You fought\nJackson alone and worsted him. He can have no substantial\nreinforcements so long as a battle is pending at Richmond.\nSurely you and Banks in supporting distance are capable of\nkeeping him from returning to Winchester. But if Sigel be\nsent forward to you, and McDowell (as he must) be put to\nother work, Jackson will break through at Front Royal\nagain. He is already on the right side of the Shenandoah to\ndo it, and on the wrong side of it to attack you. The orders\nalready sent you and Banks place you and him in the\nproper positions for the work assigned you. Jackson cannot\nmove his whole force on either of you before the other can\nlearn of it and go to his assistance. He cannot divide his\nforce, sending part against each of you, because he will be\ntoo weak for either. Please do as I directed in the order of\nthe th and my despatch of yesterday, the th, and neither\nyou nor Banks will be overwhelmed by Jackson.

I know not as to you, but by some this has been\ntoo much neglected.\nA. LINCOLN. TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., June ,\n.\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your letter of the th by Colonel\nZagonyi is just received. In answer to the principal part of\nit, I repeat the substance of an order of the th and one or\ntwo telegraphic despatches sent you since.\nWe have no de\ufb01nite power of sending reinforcements; so\nthat we are compelled rather to consider the proper\ndisposal of the forces we have than of those we could wish\nto have. We may be able to send you some dribs by\ndegrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you alone\nbeat Jackson last Sunday, I argue that you are stronger\nthan he is to-day, unless he has been reinforced; and that\nhe cannot have been materially reinforced, because such\nreinforcement could only have come from Richmond, and\nhe is much more likely to go to Richmond than Richmond is\nto come to him. Neither is very likely. I think Jackson\u2019s\ngame \u2014 his assigned work \u2014 now is to magnify the\naccounts of his numbers and reports of his movements, and\nthus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many\nof our troops away from Richmond as his own force\namounts to. Thus he helps his friends at Richmond three or\nfour times as much as if he were there. Our game is not to\nallow this. Accordingly, by the order of the th, I directed\nyou to halt at Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well\n in hand, the objects being to guard against Jackson\u2019s\nreturning by the same route to the upper Potomac over\nwhich you have just driven him out, and at the same time\ngive some protection against a raid into West Virginia.\nAlready I have given you discretion to occupy Mount\nJackson instead, if, on full consideration, you think best. I\ndo not believe Jackson will attack you, but certainly he\ncannot attack you by surprise; and if he comes upon you in\nsuperior force, you have but to notify us, fall back\ncautiously, and Banks will join you in due time. But while\nwe know not whether Jackson will move at all, or by what\nroute, we cannot safely put you and Banks both on the\nStrasburg line, and leave no force on the Front Royal line\n\u2014 the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid. The\ntrue policy is to place one of you on one line and the other\non the other in such positions that you can unite once you\nactually \ufb01nd Jackson moving upon it. And this is precisely\nwhat we are doing. This protects that part of our frontier,\nso to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the assistance\nof McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling\nto have it deranged. While you have only asked for Sigel, I\nhave spoken only of Banks, and this because Sigel\u2019s force is\nnow the principal part of Bank\u2019s force.\nAbout transferring General Schenck\u2019s commands, the\npurchase of supplies, and the promotion and appointment\nof o\ufb00icers, mentioned in your letter, I will consult with the\nSecretary of War to-morrow.\nYours truly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A   .  .    \n .\nWASHINGTON, June , \nMAJOR-GENERAL \nFREMONT, \nMOUNT \nJackson,\nVirginia: Your despatch of yesterday, reminding me of a\nsupposed understanding that I would furnish you a corps of\n, men, and asking of me the \u201cful\ufb01lment of this\nunderstanding,\u201d is received. I am ready to come to a fair\nsettlement of accounts with you on the ful\ufb01lment of\nunderstandings.\nEarly in March last, when I assigned you to the command\nof the Mountain Department, I did tell you I would give you\nall the force I could, and that I hoped to make it reach\n,. You at the same time told me that within a\nreasonable time you would seize the railroad at or east of\nKnoxville, Tenn., if you could. There was then in the\ndepartment a force supposed to be ,, the exact\nnumber as well known to you as to me. After looking about\ntwo or three days, you called and distinctly told me that if I\nwould add the Blenker division to the force already in the\ndepartment, you would undertake the job. The Blenker\ndivision contained ,, and at the expense of great\ndissatisfaction to General McClellan I took it from his army\nand gave it to you. My promise was literally ful\ufb01lled. I have\n given you all I could, and I have given you very nearly, if\nnot quite, ,.\nNow for yours. On the d of May, largely over two\nmonths afterward, you were at Franklin, Va., not within \nmiles of Knoxville, nor within  miles of any part of the\nrailroad \neast \nof \nit, \nand \nnot \nmoving \nforward, \nbut\ntelegraphing here that you could not move for lack of\neverything. Now, do not misunderstand me. I do not say\nyou have not done all you could. I presume you met\nunexpected di\ufb00iculties; and I beg you to believe that as\nsurely as you have done your best, so have I. I have not the\npower now to \ufb01ll up your Corps to ,. I am not\ndemanding of you to do the work of ,. I am only\nasking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive, get your\nforce in order, and give such protection as you can to the\nvalley of the Shenandoah and to western Virginia.\nHave you received the orders, and will you act upon\nthem?\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A   .   H\n  .\nWASHINGTON, June , \nBRIGADIER-GENERAL \nSCHURZ, \nMOUNT \nJackson,\nVirginia: Your long letter is received. The information you\ngive is valuable. You say it is fortunate that Fremont did not\nintercept Jackson; that Jackson had the superior force, and\nwould have overwhelmed him. If this is so, how happened it\nthat Fremont fairly fought and routed him on the th? Or is\nthe account that he did \ufb01ght and rout him false and\nfabricated? Both General Fremont and you speak of\nJackson having beaten Shields. By our accounts he did not\nbeat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He did\nmeet and drive back with disaster about  of Shields\u2019s\nadvance till they were met by an additional brigade of\nShields\u2019s, when Jackson himself turned and retreated.\nShields himself and more than half his force were not\nnearer than twenty miles to any of it.\nA.

I would rather it should be by letter\nthan by telegraph, because of the better chance of secrecy.\nAs to the numbers and positions of the troops not under\nyour command in Virginia and elsewhere, even if I could do\nit with accuracy, which I cannot, I would rather not\ntransmit either by telegraph or by letter, because of the\nchances of its reaching the enemy.

LINCOLN.\n    A   \nI H \n  I \nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\nWASHINGTON, JUNE , .\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES: On the th\nday of December, , I submitted to the Senate the\nproject of a treaty between the United States and Mexico\nwhich had been proposed to me by Mr. Corwin, our\nminister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the advice\nof the Senate thereupon.\nOn the th day of February last a resolution was\nadopted by the Senate to the e\ufb00ect: \u201cThat it is not\nadvisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the United\nStates to assume any portion of the principal or interest of\nthe debt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of\nEuropean powers.\u201d\nThis resolution having been duly communicated to me,\nnotice thereof was immediately given by the Secretary of\nState to Mr. Corwin, and he was informed that he was to\nconsider his instructions upon the subject referred to\nmodi\ufb01ed by this resolution and would govern his course\naccordingly. That despatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by\nreason of the disturbed condition of Mexico, until a very\nrecent date, Mr. Corwin being without instructions, or thus\n practically left without instructions, to negotiate further\nwith Mexico.\nIn view of the very important events Occurring there, he\nhas thought that the interests of the United States would\nbe promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should\nprovide for a loan to that republic. He has therefore signed\nsuch treaties, and they having been duly rati\ufb01ed by the\nGovernment of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for\nmy consideration. The action of the Senate is of course\nconclusive against an acceptance of the treaties On my\npart. I have, nevertheless, thought it just to our excellent\nminister in Mexico and respectful to the Government of\nthat republic to lay the treaties before the Senate, together\nwith the correspondence which has occurred in relation to\nthem. In performing this duty I have only to add that the\nimportance of the subject thus submitted to the Senate, can\nnot be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive and\nconsider with the highest respect any further advice the\nSenate may think proper to give upon the subject.\nA. LINCOLN.\n    \n \n  A  \n   \n    I \nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE, JUNE , .\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES: The bill\nwhich has passed the House of Representatives and the\nSenate, entitled \u201cAn act to repeal that part of an act of\nCongress which prohibits the circulation of bank-notes of a\nless denomination than \ufb01ve dollars in the District of\nColumbia,\u201d has received my attentive consideration, and I\nnow return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the\nfollowing objections: . The bill proposes to repeal the\nexisting legislation prohibiting the circulation of bank-notes\nof a less denomination than \ufb01ve dollars within the District\nof Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by\nbanks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my\njudgment, it will be found impracticable, in the present\ncondition of the currency, to make such a discrimination.\nThe banks have generally suspended specie payments, and\na legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable\nnotes of one class of them will almost certainly be so\nextended, in practical operation, as to include those of all\nclasses, whether authorized or unauthorized. If this view be\ncorrect, the currency of the District, should this act become\na law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to the serious\ninjury of honest trade and honest labor.\n . This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be\notherwise more certainly and bene\ufb01cially attained. During\nthe existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the National\nGovernment to secure to the people a sound circulating\nmedium. This duty has been, under existing circumstances,\nsatisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing the\nissue of United States notes, receivable for all government\ndues except customs, and made a legal tender for all debts,\npublic and private, except interest on public debt. The\nobject of the bill submitted to me \u2014 namely, that of\nproviding a small note currency during the present\nsuspension \u2014 can be fully accomplished by authorizing the\nissue, as part of any new emission of United States notes\nmade necessary by the circumstances of the country, of\nnotes of a similar character, but of less denomination than\n\ufb01ve dollars. Such an issue would answer all the bene\ufb01cial\npurposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to\nthe treasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments\nto soldiers and other creditors of small sums, and would\nfurnish; to the people a currency as safe as their own\ngovernment.\nEntertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself\nconstrained to withhold from it my approval and return it\nfor the further consideration and action of Congress.\nA. LINCOLN\n      H A          I     \n          .\nWHEN BIRDS AND animals are looked at through a fog, they\nare seen to disadvantage, and so it might be with you if I\nwere to attempt to tell you why I went to see General Scott.\nI can only say that my visit to West Point did not have the\nimportance which has been attached to it; but it concerned\nmatters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell\nyou all about them. Now, I can only remark that it had\nnothing whatever to do with making or unmaking any\ngeneral in the country. The Secretary of War, you know,\nholds a pretty tight rein on the press, so that they shall not\ntell more than they ought to; and I \u2018m afraid that if I blab\ntoo much, he might draw a tight rein on me.\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  . \nc     A\n.\nWASHINGTON, June , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN:\nYour three despatches of yesterday in relation to the\na\ufb00air, ending with the statement that you completely\nsucceeded in making your point, are very gratifying.\nThe later one of .

I give you all I can, and act on the presumption\nthat you will do the best you can with what you have, while\nyou continue, ungenerously I think, to assume that I could\ngive you more if I would.

It is believed that\nthe quickest route would be by way of Columbus, Ky., and\nup the Ohio River. But in detaching your force the\nPresident directs that it be done in such a way as to enable\nyou to hold your ground and not interfere with the\nmovement against Chattanooga and East Tennessee. This\ncondition being observed, the forces to be detached and the\nroutes they are to be sent are left to your own judgment.\nThe direction to send these forces immediately is\nrendered imperative by a serious reverse su\ufb00ered by\nGeneral McClellan before Richmond yesterday, the full\nextent of which is not yet known.\nYou will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, stating\nthe day and hour it is received, and inform me what your\naction will be, so that we may take measures to aid in river\nand railroad transportation.\n EDWIN M.

If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse,\nit is the price we pay for the enemy not being in\nWashington. We protected Washington, and the enemy\nconcentrated on you.

SEWARD.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 My view of the present condition of the\nwar is about as follows: The evacuation of Corinth and our\ndelay by the \ufb02ood in the Chickahominy have enabled the\nenemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond for\nMcClellan to successfully attack. In fact there soon will be\nno substantial rebel force anywhere else. But if we send all\nthe force from here to McClellan, the enemy will, before we\ncan know of it, send a force from Richmond and take\nWashington. Or if a large part of the western army be\nbrought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond,\nand retake Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc. What should\nbe done is to hold what we have in the West, open the\nMississippi, and take Chattanooga and East Tennessee\nwithout more. A reasonable force should in every event be\nkept about Washington for its protection. Then let the\ncountry give us a hundred thousand new troops in the\nshortest possible time, which, added to McClellan directly\nor indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering any\nother place which we now hold, and will substantially end\nthe war. I expect to maintain this contest until successful,\nor till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, or\n Congress or the country forsake me; and I would publicly\nappeal to the country for this new force were it not that I\nfear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it\nis to have a thing understood as it really is. I think the new\nforce should be all, or nearly all, infantry, principally\nbecause such can be raised most cheaply and quickly.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   .

Fulton of Baltimore\nAmerican is now with us. He left White House at  A.M.\nyesterday. He conversed fully with a paymaster who was\nwith Porter\u2019s force during the \ufb01ght of Friday and fell back\nto nearer McClellan\u2019s quarters just a little sooner than\nPorter did, seeing the whole of it; stayed on the Richmond\nside of the Chickahominy over night, and left for White\nHouse at  A.M. Saturday. He says Porter retired in perfect\norder under protection of the guns arranged for the\npurpose, under orders and not from necessity; and with all\nother of our forces, except what was left on purpose to go\nto White House, was safely in pontoons over the\nChickahominy before morning, and that there was heavy\n\ufb01ring on the Richmond side, begun at  and ceased at \nA.M. Saturday. On the whole, I think we have had the\nbetter of it up to that point of time. What has happened\nsince we still know not, as we have no communication with\nGeneral McClellan. A despatch from Colonel Ingalls shows\nthat he thinks McClellan is \ufb01ghting with the enemy at\nRichmond to-day, and will be to-morrow. We have no means\nof knowing upon what Colonel Ingalls founds his opinion.\n Con\ufb01rmed about saving all property. Not a single\nunwounded straggler came back to White House from the\n\ufb01eld, and the number of wounded reaching there up to \nA.M. Saturday was not large.\nA. LINCOLN.\nTo what the President has above stated I will only add\none or two points that may be satisfactory for you to know.\nFirst. All the sick and wounded were safely removed\nSecond. A despatch from Burnside shows that he is from\nWhite House; not a man left behind in condition to a\ufb00ord\ne\ufb00icient support, and is probably doing so.\nThird. The despatch from Colonel Ingalls impresses me\nwith the conviction that the movement was made by\nGeneral McClellan to concentrate on Richmond, and was\nsuccessful to the latest point of which we have any\ninformation.\nFourth. Mr. Fulton says that on Friday night, between\ntwelve and one o\u2019clock, General McClellan telegraphed\nCommodore Goldsborough that the result of the movement\nwas satisfactory to him.\nFifth. From these and the facts stated by the President,\nmy inference is that General McClellan will probably be in\nRichmond within two days.\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\n[Unfortunately McClellan did not do any of the things he\nwas ordered, and that it was very likely possible to do. It is\nstill some mystery what he was doing all these days other\nthan hiding in the woods and staying out of communication\nso he would not receive any more uncomfortable orders.\n This was another place where the North was close to\nwining the war and did not.

SEWARD, New York: \nWE \nARE \nYET \nwithout \ncommunication \nwith \nGeneral\nMcClellan, and this absence of news is our point of anxiety.\nUp to the latest point to which we are posted he e\ufb00ected\neverything in such exact accordance with his plan,\ncontingently announced to us before the battle began, that\nwe feel justi\ufb01ed to hope that he has not failed since. He had\na severe engagement in getting the part of his army on this\nside of the Chickahominy over to the other side, in which\nthe enemy lost certainly as much as we did. We are not\ndissatis\ufb01ed with this, only that the loss of enemies does not\ncompensate for the loss of friends. The enemy cannot come\nbelow White House; certainly is not there now, and\nprobably has abandoned the whole line. Dix\u2019s pickets are at\nNew Kent Court-House.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  A    \n    \n  . \n \n  \n     une         .\nTO THE GOVERNORS OF THE SEVERAL STATES: \nTHE CAPTURE OF New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by the\nnational forces has enabled the insurgents to concentrate a\nlarge force at and about Richmond, which place we must\ntake with the least possible delay; in fact, there will soon be\nno formidable insurgent force except at Richmond. With so\nlarge an army there, the enemy can threaten us on the\nPotomac and elsewhere. Until we have re-established the\nnational authority, all these places must be held, and we\nmust keep a respectable force in front of WASHINGTON.\nBut this, from the diminished strength of our army by\nsickness and casualties, renders an addition to it necessary\nin order to close the struggle which has been prosecuted\nfor the last three months with energy and success. Rather\nthan hazard the misapprehension of our military condition\nand of groundless alarm by a call for troops by\nproclamation, I have deemed it best to address you in this\nform. To accomplish the object stated we require without\ndelay , men, including those recently called for by\nthe Secretary of War. Thus reinforced our gallant army will\nbe enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of the\ngovernment and the people.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   .

The President regards that\nand the movement against East Tennessee as one of the\nmost important movements of the war, and its occupation\nnearly as important as the capture of Richmond. He is not\npleased with the tardiness of the movement toward\nChattanooga, and directs that no force be sent here if you\ncannot do it without breaking up the operations against\nthat point and East Tennessee. Infantry only are needed;\nour cavalry and artillery are strong enough. The \ufb01rst\nreports from Richmond were more discouraging than the\ntruth warranted. If the advantage is not on our side, it is\nbalanced. General McClellan has moved his whole force on\nthe line of the James River, and is supported there by our\ngunboats; but he must be largely strengthened before\nadvancing, and hence the call on you, which I am glad you\nanswered so promptly. Let me know to what point on the\nriver you will send your forces, so as to provide\nimmediately for transportation.\nEDWIN M.

Believing that you of the border States\nhold more power for good than any other equal number of\nmembers, I feel it a duty which I cannot justi\ufb01ably waive to\nmake this appeal to you. I intend no reproach or complaint\nwhen I assure you that, in my opinion, if you all had voted\nfor the resolution in the gradual-emancipation message of\nlast March, the war would now be substantially ended. And\nthe plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and\nswift means of ending it. Let the States which are in\nrebellion see de\ufb01nitely and certainly that in no event will\nthe States you represent ever join their proposed\nconfederacy, and they cannot much longer maintain the\ncontest. But you cannot divest them of their hope to\nultimately have you with them so long as you show a\ndetermination to perpetuate the institution within your own\nStates. Beat them at elections, as you have overwhelmingly\ndone, and, nothing daunted, they still claim you as their\nown. You and I know what the lever of their power is. Break\nthat lever before their faces, and they can shake you no\n more forever. Most of you have treated me with kindness\nand consideration and I trust you will not now think I\nimproperly touch what is exclusively your own, when, for\nthe sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your\nStates, do better than to take the course I urge? Discarding\npunctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times,\nand looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our\ncase, can you do better in any possible event? You prefer\nthat the constitutional relation of the States to the nation\nshall be practically restored without disturbance of the\ninstitution; and if this were done, my whole duty in this\nrespect, under the Constitution and my oath of o\ufb00ice,\nwould be performed. But it is not done, and we are trying\nto accomplish it by war. The incidents of the war cannot be\navoided. If the war continues long, as it must if the object\nbe not sooner attained, the institution in your States will be\nextinguished by mere friction and abrasion \u2014 by the mere\nincidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have\nnothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is gone\nalready. How much better for you and for your people to\ntake the step which at once shortens the war and secures\nsubstantial compensation for that which is sure to be\nwholly lost in any other event! How much better to thus\nsave the money which else we sink forever in war! How\nmuch better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long\nrender us pecuniarily unable to do it! How much better for\nyou as seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell out and buy\nout that without which the war could never have been, than\nto sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in\n cutting \none \nanother\u2019s \nthroats! \nI \ndo \nnot \nspeak \nof\nemancipation at once, but of a decision at once to\nemancipate \ngradually. \nRoom \nin \nSouth \nAmerica \nfor\ncolonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance,\nand when numbers shall be large enough to be company\nand encouragement for one another, the freed people will\nnot be so reluctant to go.\nI am pressed with a di\ufb00iculty not yet mentioned \u2014 one\nwhich threatens division among those who, united, are\nnone too strong. An instance of it is known to you. General\nHunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope still is, my\nfriend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me\nin the general wish that all men everywhere could be free.\nHe proclaimed all men free within certain States, and I\nrepudiated the proclamation. He expected more good and\nless harm from the measure than I could believe would\nfollow. Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not\no\ufb00ence, to many whose support the country cannot a\ufb00ord\nto lose. And this is not the end of it. The pressure in this\ndirection is still upon me, and is increasing. By conceding\nwhat I now ask you can relieve me, and, much more, can\nrelieve the country in this important point.\nUpon these considerations, I have again begged your\nattention to the message of March last. Before leaving the\nCapital, consider and discuss it among yourselves. You are\npatriots and statesmen, and as such I pray you consider\nthis proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the\nconsideration of your States and people. As you would\nperpetuate popular government for the best people in the\n world, I beseech you that you do in nowise omit this. Our\ncommon country is in great peril, demanding the loftiest\nviews and boldest action to bring a speedy relief. Once\nrelieved, its form of government is saved to the world; its\nbeloved history and cherished memories are vindicated,\nand \nits \nhappy \nfuture \nfully \nassured \nand \nrendered\ninconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the\nprivilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that\ngrandeur, and to link your own names therewith forever.\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  . \nc     A\n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN: MY DEAR SIR: \u2014 I am\ntold that over , men have gone into your army on\nthe Peninsula.

She has ever since been and still is doing\nvaluable service to the government. For the patriotic act of\nmaking this magni\ufb01cent and valuable present to the\ncountry I recommend that some suitable acknowledgment\nbe made.\nA. LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  \n    .  u           .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: \nCONSIDERING THE BILL for \u201cAn act to suppress insurrection,\nto punish treason and rebellion, to seize and con\ufb01scate the\nproperty of rebels, and for other purposes,\u201d and the joint\nresolution explanatory of said act as being substantially\none, I have approved and signed both.\nBefore I was informed of the passage of the resolution I\nhad prepared the draft of a message stating objections to\nthe bill becoming a law, a copy of which draft is herewith\ntransmitted.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n  I I  \n  \n   H  H\n   \n       \n A I   \nI HEREWITH RETURN to your honorable body, in which it\noriginated, the bill for an act entitled \u201cAn act to suppress\ntreason and rebellion, to seize and con\ufb01scate the property\nof rebels, and for other purposes,\u201d together with my\nobjections to its becoming a law.\nThere is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection.\nIt is wholly prospective, and touches neither person nor\nproperty of any loyal citizen, in which particulars it is just\nand proper. The \ufb01rst and second sections provide for the\nconviction and punishment of persons Who shall be guilty\nof treason and persons who shall \u201cincite, set on foot, assist,\nor engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the\nauthority of the United States or the laws thereof, or shall\ngive aid and comfort thereto, or shall engage in or give aid\nand comfort to any such existing rebellion or insurrection.\u201d\nBy fair construction persons within these sections are not\nto be punished without regular trials in duly constituted\ncourts, under the forms and all the substantial provisions of\nlaw and of the Constitution applicable to their several\ncases. To this I perceive no objection, especially as such\npersons would be within the general pardoning power and\nalso the special provision for pardon and amnesty\ncontained in this act.\n It is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted\nunder these sections shall be free. I think there is an\nunfortunate form of expression rather than a substantial\nobjection in this. It is startling to say that Congress can\nfree a slave within a State, and yet if it were said the\nownership of the slave had \ufb01rst been transferred to the\nnation and that Congress had then liberated him the\ndi\ufb00iculty would at once vanish. And this is the real case.\nThe traitor against the General Government forfeits his\nslave at least as justly as he does any other property, and\nhe forfeits both to the government against which be\no\ufb00ends. The government, so far as there can be ownership,\nthus owns the forfeited slaves, and the question for\nCongress in regard to them is, \u201cShall they be made free or\nbe sold to new masters?\u201d I perceive no objection to\nCongress deciding in advance that they shall be free. To the\nhigh honor of Kentucky, as I am informed, she is the owner\nof some slaves by escheat, and has sold none, but liberated\nall. I hope the same is true of some other States. Indeed, I\ndo not believe it will be physically possible for the General\nGovernment to return persons so circumstanced to actual\nslavery. I believe there would be physical resistance to it\nwhich could neither be turned aside by argument nor\ndriven away by force. In this view I have no objection to\nthis feature of the bill. Another matter involved in these\ntwo sections, and running through other parts of the act,\nwill be noticed hereafter.\nI perceive no objection to the third or fourth sections.\n So far as I wish to notice the \ufb01fth and sixth sections, they\nmay be considered together. That the enforcement of these\nsections would do no injustice to the persons embraced\nwithin them, is clear. That those who make a causeless war\nshould be compelled to pay the cost of it, is too obviously\njust to be called in question. To give governmental\nprotection to the property of persons who have abandoned\nit, and gone on a crusade to overthrow the same\ngovernment, is absurd, if considered in the mere light of\njustice. The severest justice may not always be the best\npolicy. The principle of seizing and appropriating the\nproperty of the persons embraced within these sections is\ncertainly not very objectionable, but a justly discriminating\napplication of it would be very di\ufb00icult and, to a great\nextent, impossible. And would it not be wise to place a\npower of remission somewhere, so that these persons may\nknow they have something to lose by persisting and\nsomething to gain by desisting?\n[A man without hope is a most dangerous man \u2014 he has\nnothing to lose!]\nI am not sure whether such power of remission is or is\nnot in section thirteen. Without any special act of Congress,\nI think our military commanders, when \u2014 in military\nphrase, \u201cthey are within the enemy\u2019s country,\u201d should, in an\norderly manner, seize and use whatever of real or personal\nproperty may be necessary or convenient for their\ncommands; at the same time preserving, in some way, the\nevidence of what they do.\n What I have said in regard to slaves, while commenting\non the \ufb01rst and second sections, is applicable to the ninth,\nwith the di\ufb00erence that no provision is made in the whole\nact for determining whether a particular individual slave\ndoes or does not fall within the classes de\ufb01ned in that\nsection. He is to be free upon certain conditions but\nwhether those conditions do or do not pertain to him no\nmode of ascertaining is provided. This could be easily\nsupplied.\nTo the tenth section I make no objection. The oath\ntherein required seems to be proper, and the remainder of\nthe section is substantially identical with a law already\nexisting.\nThe \neleventh \nsection \nsimply \nassumes \nto \nconfer\ndiscretionary power upon the executive. Without the law, I\nhave no hesitation to go as far in the direction indicated as\nI may at any time deem expedient. And I am ready to say\nnow \u2014 I think it is proper for our military commanders to\nemploy, as laborers, as many persons of African descent as\ncan be used to advantage.\nThe twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better\nthan unobjectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper,\nif all other parts of the act shall stand.\nThat to which I chie\ufb02y object pervades most parts of the\nact, but more distinctly appears in the \ufb01rst, second,\nseventh, and eighth sections. It is the sum of those\nprovisions which results in the divesting of title forever.\nFor the causes of treason and ingredients of treason, not\namounting to the full crime, it declares forfeiture extending\n beyond the lives of the guilty parties; whereas the\nConstitution of the United States declares that \u201cno\nattainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or\nforfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.\u201d\nTrue, there is to be no formal attainder in this case; still, I\nthink the greater punishment cannot be constitutionally\nin\ufb02icted, in a di\ufb00erent form, for the same o\ufb00ence.\nWith great respect I am constrained to say I think this\nfeature of the act is unconstitutional. It would not be\ndi\ufb00icult to modify it.\nI may remark that the provision of the Constitution, put\nin language borrowed from Great Britain, applies only in\nthis country, as I understand, to real or landed estate.\nAgain, this act in rem forfeits property for the\ningredients of treason without a conviction of the supposed\ncriminal, or a personal hearing given him in any\nproceeding. That we may not touch property lying within\nour reach, because we cannot give personal notice to an\nowner \nwho \nis \nabsent \nendeavoring \nto \ndestroy \nthe\ngovernment, is certainly not satisfactory. Still, the owner\nmay not be thus engaged; and I think a reasonable time\nshould be provided for such parties to appear and have\npersonal hearings. Similar provisions are not uncommon in\nconnection with proceedings in rem.\nFor the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House in\nwhich it originated.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  . \nc     A\n.\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July ,\n.\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN:\nThis is Monday.

I distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends\nwho would hold my hands while my enemies stab me. This\nappeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this\nstruggle than any other one thing.

LINCOLN.\n  \n  \n H      \n  I  .\n(Private.)\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July , .\nCUTHBERT BULLITT, Esq., New Orleans, Louisiana.\nSIR: \u2014 The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr.\nThomas J. Durant has been shown to me. The writer\nappears to be an able, a dispassionate, and an entirely\nsincere man. The \ufb01rst part of the letter is devoted to an\ne\ufb00ort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana\nwas adopted against the will of a majority of the people.\nThis is probably true, and in that fact may be found some\ninstruction. Why did they allow the ordinance to go into\ne\ufb00ect? Why did they not assert themselves? Why stand\npassive and allow themselves to be trodden down by\nminority? Why did they not hold popular meetings and have\na convention of their own to express and enforce the true\nsentiment of the State? If preorganization was against them\nthen, why not do this now that the United States army is\npresent to protect them? The paralysis \u2014 the dead palsy \u2014\nof the government in this whole struggle is that this class of\nmen will do nothing for the government, nothing for\nthemselves, except demanding that the government shall\nnot strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!\n Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of\nmaster and slave is disturbed by the presence of our army,\nand he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part,\nis done under cover of an act of Congress, while\nconstitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of\nmilitary necessity. The truth is, that what is done and\nomitted about slaves is done and omitted on the same\nmilitary necessity. It is a military necessity to have men and\nmoney; and we can get neither in su\ufb00icient numbers or\namounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves\ncoming to them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the\npressure in this direction, nor of my e\ufb00orts to hold it within\nbounds till he and such as he shall have time to help\nthemselves.\nI am not posted to speak understandingly on all the\npolice regulations of which Mr. Durant complains. If\nexperience shows any one of them to be wrong, let them be\nset right. I think I can perceive in the freedom of trade\nwhich Mr. Durant urges that he would relieve both friends\nand enemies from the pressure of the blockade. By this he\nwould serve the enemy more e\ufb00ectively than the enemy is\nable to serve himself. I do not say or believe that to serve\nthe enemy is the purpose, of Mr. Durant, or that he is\nconscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic\nones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no\nchoice of sides in the contest, were anxious only to have\nquiet and comfort for themselves while it rages, and to fall\nin with the victorious side at the end of it without loss to\nthemselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting the\n contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no\nduty \u2014 apparently thinks of none \u2014 resting upon Union\nmen. He even thinks it injurious to the Union cause that\nthey should be restrained in trade and passage without\ntaking sides. They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump,\nbut to be merely passengers \u2014 deadheads at that \u2014 to be\ncarried snug and dry throughout the storm, and safely\nlanded right side up. Nay, more: even a mutineer is to go\nuntouched, lest these sacred passengers receive an\naccidental wound. Of course the rebellion will never be\nsuppressed in Louisiana if the professed Union men there\nwill neither help to do it nor permit the government to do it\nwithout their help. Now, I think the true remedy is very\ndi\ufb00erent from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does not\nlie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing\nthe necessity for the war. The people of Louisiana who wish\nprotection to person and property have but to reach forth\ntheir hands and take it. Let them in good faith reinaugurate\nthe national authority, and set up a State government\nconforming thereto under the Constitution. They know how\nto do it and can have the protection of the army while doing\nit. The army will be withdrawn so soon as such State\ngovernment can dispense with its presence; and the people\nof the State can then, upon the old constitutional terms,\ngovern themselves to their own liking. This is very simple\nand easy.\nIf they will not do this \u2014 if they prefer to hazard all for\nthe sake of destroying the government \u2014 it is for them to\nconsider whether it is probable I will surrender the\n government to save them from losing all. If they decline\nwhat I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do.\nWhat would you do in my position? Would you drop the war\nwhere it is? Or would you prosecute it in future with elder-\nstalk squirts charged with rose water? Would you deal\nlighter blows rather than heavier ones? Would you give up\nthe contest, leaving any available means unapplied? I am in\nno boastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and I shall\ndo all I can, to save the government, which is my sworn\nduty as well as my personal inclination. I shall do nothing in\nmalice. What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \n A  \n   \n  .\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., \nJULY , .\nGOVERNORS OF ALL LOYAL STATES: It would be of\ngreat service here for us to know, as fully as you can tell,\nwhat progress is made and making in recruiting for old\nregiments in your State. Also about what day the \ufb01rst\nregiments can move with you, what the second, what the\nthird, and so on. This information is important to us in\nmaking calculations.

The sooner she does\nso, the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past\nmending. This government cannot much longer play a game\nin which it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those\nenemies must understand that they cannot experiment for\nten years trying to destroy the government, and if they fail,\nstill come back into the Union unhurt. If they expect in any\ncontingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join with the\nwriter in saying, \u201cNow is the time.\u201d\nHow much better it would have been for the writer to\nhave gone at this, under the protection of the army at New\nOrleans, than to have sat down in a closet writing\ncomplaining letters northward!\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  \n  \nA  A I\n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\nAUGUST , .\nTO COUNT A. DE GASPARIN.\nDEAR SIR \u2014 Your very acceptable letter, dated Orbe,\nCanton de Vaud, Switzerland, th of July, , is\nreceived. The moral e\ufb00ect was the worst of the a\ufb00air\nbefore Richmond, and that has run its course downward.\nWe are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as\nwe hope. I believe it is true that, in men and material, the\nenemy su\ufb00ered more than we in that series of con\ufb02icts,\nwhile it is certain that he is less able to bear it.\nWith us every soldier is a man of character, and must be\ntreated with more consideration than is customary in\nEurope. Hence our great army, for slighter causes than\ncould have prevailed there, has dwindled rapidly, bringing\nthe necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated.\nWe shall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not\nalarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a\ndraft for part of this. It seems strange even to me, but it is\ntrue, that the government is now pressed to this course by\na popular demand. Thousands who wish not to personally\nenter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send\nsubstitutes, provided they can have assurance that\n unwilling persons, similarly situated, will be compelled to\ndo likewise. Besides this, volunteers mostly choose to enter\nnewly forming regiments, while drafted men can be sent to\n\ufb01ll up the old ones, wherein man for man they are quite\ndoubly as valuable.\nYou ask, \u201cWhy is it that the North with her great armies\nso often is found with inferiority of numbers face to face\nwith the armies of the South?\u201d While I painfully know the\nfact, a military man, which I am not, would better answer\nthe question. The fact I know has not been overlooked, and\nI suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the\nother facts that the enemy holds the interior and we the\nexterior lines, and that we operate where the people\nconvey information to the enemy, while he operates where\nthey convey none to us.\nI have received the volume and letter which you did me\nthe honor of addressing to me, and for which please accept\nmy sincere thanks. You are much admired in America for\nthe ability of your writings, and much loved for your\ngenerosity to us and your devotion to liberal principles\ngenerally.\nYou are quite right as to the importance to us, for its\nbearing upon Europe, that we should achieve military\nsuccesses, and the same is true for us at home as well as\nabroad. Yet it seems unreasonable that a series of\nsuccesses, extending through half a year, and clearing\nmore than , square miles of country, should help us\nso little, while a single half-defeat should hurt us so much.\nBut let us be patient.\n I am very happy to know that my course has not\ncon\ufb02icted with your judgment of propriety and policy I can\nonly say that I have acted upon my best convictions,\nwithout sel\ufb01shness or malice, and that by the help of God I\nshall continue to do so.\nPlease be assured of my highest respect and esteem.\nA. LINCOLN.\n      H A  A \nA  \n   I\n  \nA HI\n \nA\n         \nFELLOW CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for\nmy appearing before you on this occasion, but it is also true\nthat there is no precedent for your being here yourselves,\nand I o\ufb00er in justi\ufb01cation of myself and of you that, upon\nexamination, I have found nothing in the Constitution\nagainst it. I, however, have an impression that; there are\nyounger gentlemen who will entertain you better and\nbetter address your understanding than I will or could, and\ntherefore I propose but to detain you a moment longer. I am\nvery little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless I\nhope to produce some good by it. The only thing I think of\njust now not likely to be better said by some one else is a\nmatter in which we have heard some other persons blamed\nfor what I did myself There has been a very widespread\nattempt to have a quarrel between General McClellan and\nthe Secretary of War Now, I occupy a position that enables\nme to believe that these two gentlemen are not nearly so\ndeep in the quarrel as some presuming to be their friends.\nGeneral McClellan\u2019s attitude is such that in the very\nsel\ufb01shness of his nature he cannot but wish to be\nsuccessful \u2014 and I hope he will \u2014 and the Secretary of War\nis precisely in the same situation. If the military\ncommanders in the \ufb01eld cannot be successful, not only the\n Secretary of War, but myself, for the time being the master\nof both, cannot but be failures. I know General McClellan\nwishes to be successful, and I know he does not wish it any\nmore than the Secretary of War for him, and both of them\ntogether no more than I wish it. Sometimes we have a\ndispute about how many men General McClellan has had,\nand those who would disparage him say he has had a very\nlarge number, and those who would disparage the\nSecretary of War insist that General McClellan has had a\nvery small number. The basis for this is, there is always a\nwide di\ufb00erence, and on this occasion perhaps a wider one,\nbetween the grand total on McClellan\u2019s rolls and the men\nactually \ufb01t for duty; and those who would disparage him\ntalk of the grand total on paper, and those who would\ndisparage the Secretary of War talk of those at present \ufb01t\nfor duty. General McClellan has sometimes asked for things\nthat the Secretary of War did not give him. General\nMcClellan is not to blame for asking for what he wanted\nand needed, and the Secretary of War is not to blame for\nnot giving when he had none to give. And I say here, so far\nas I know, the Secretary of War has withheld no one thing\nat any time in my power to give him. I have no accusation\nagainst him. I believe he is a brave and able man, and I\nstand here, as justice requires me to do, to take upon\nmyself what has been charged on the Secretary of War as\nwithholding from him. I have talked longer than I expected\nto do, and now I avail myself of my privilege of saying no\nmore.\n     \n A\n  \n \n   \n  A\n  \n. Au ust   \n    .\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C.\nGOVERNOR ANDREW, BOSTON, Mass.: Your despatch\nsaying \u201cI can\u2019t get those regiments o\ufb00 because I can\u2019t get\nquick work out of the V.

LINCOLN.\n A\n     \n  \n \nI A I\n  \n A \n  \n A I\n   \n \n  \n \n \n.\nWASHINGTON, Thursday, August , .\nTHIS AFTERNOON THE President of the United States gave\nan audience to a committee of colored men at the White\nHouse. \nThey \nwere \nintroduced \nby \nRev. \nJ. \nMitchell,\nCommissioner of Emigration, E. M. Thomas, the chairman,\nremarked that they were there by invitation to hear what\nthe Executive had to say to them.\nHaving all been seated, the President, after a few\npreliminary observations, informed them that a sum of\nmoney had been appropriated by Congress, and placed at\nhis disposition, for the purpose of aiding the colonization, in\nsome country, of the people, or a portion of them, of African\ndescent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long\ntime been his inclination, to favor that cause. And why, he\nasked, should the people of your race be colonized, and\nwhere? Why should they leave this country? This is,\nperhaps, the \ufb01rst question for proper consideration. You\nand we are di\ufb00erent races. We have between us a broader\ndi\ufb00erence than exists between almost any other two races.\nWhether it is right or wrong I need not discuss; but this\nphysical di\ufb00erence is a great disadvantage to us both, as I\nthink. Your race su\ufb00er very greatly, many of them, by living\n among us, while ours su\ufb00er from your presence. In a word,\nwe su\ufb00er on each side. If this is admitted, it a\ufb00ords a\nreason, at least, why we should be separated. You here are\nfree men, I suppose.\n[A voice\u2014 \u201cYes, sir!\u201d]\nPerhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your\nrace are su\ufb00ering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong\nin\ufb02icted on any people. But even when you cease to be\nslaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an\nequality with the white race. You are cut o\ufb00 from many of\nthe advantages which the other race enjoys. The aspiration\nof men is to enjoy equality with the best when free, but on\nthis broad continent not a single man of your race is made\nthe equal of a single man of ours. Go where you are treated\nthe best, and the ban is still upon you. I do not propose to\ndiscuss this, but to present it as a fact, with which we have\nto deal. I cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact about which\nwe all think and feel alike, I and you. We look to our\ncondition. Owing to the existence of the two races on this\ncontinent, I need not recount to you the e\ufb00ects upon white\nmen, growing out of the institution of slavery.\nI believe in its general evil e\ufb00ects on the white race. See\nour present condition \u2014 the country engaged in war \u2014\nwhite men cutting one another\u2019s throats \u2014 none knowing\nhow far it will extend \u2014 and then consider what we know to\nbe the truth: But for your race among us there could not be\nwar, although many men engaged on either side do not care\nfor you one way or the other. Nevertheless I repeat, without\nthe institution of slavery and the colored race as a basis,\n the war could not have an existence. It is better for us both,\ntherefore, to be separated. I know that there are free men\namong you, who, even if they could better their condition,\nare not as much inclined to go out of the country as those\nwho, being slaves, could obtain their freedom on this\ncondition. I suppose one of the principal di\ufb00iculties in the\nway of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see\nthat his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe\nthat you can live in WASHINGTON, or elsewhere in the\nUnited States, the remainder of your life, as easily, perhaps\nmore so, than you can in any foreign Country; and hence\nyou may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to\ndo with the idea of going to a foreign country.\nThis is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely sel\ufb01sh\nview of the case. You ought to do something to help those\nwho are not so fortunate as yourselves. There is an\nunwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be,\nfor you free colored people to remain with us. Now, if you\ncould give a start to the white people, you would open a\nwide door for many to be made free. If we deal with those\nwho are not free at the beginning, and whose intellects are\nclouded by slavery, we have very poor material to start\nwith. If intelligent colored men, such as are before me,\nwould move in this matter, much might be accomplished.\nIt is exceedingly important that we have men at the\nbeginning capable of thinking as white men, and not those\nwho have been systematically oppressed. There is much to\nencourage you. For the sake of your race you should\nsacri\ufb01ce something of your present comfort for the purpose\n of being as grand in that respect as the white people. It is a\ncheering thought throughout life that something can be\ndone to ameliorate the condition of those who have been\nsubject to the hard usages of the world. It is di\ufb00icult to\nmake a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of\nhimself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.\nIn the American Revolutionary war sacri\ufb01ces were made by\nmen engaged in it, but they were cheered by the future.\nGeneral WASHINGTON himself endured greater physical\nhardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he\nwas a happy man because he had engaged in bene\ufb01ting his\nrace, in doing something for the children of his neighbors,\nhaving none of his own.\nThe colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time.\nIn a certain sense it is a success. The old President of\nLiberia, Roberts, has just been with me \u2014 the \ufb01rst time I\never saw him. He says they have within the bounds of that\ncolony between three and four hundred thousand people,\nor more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode\nIsland or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and\nless than in some of our larger ones. They are not all\nAmerican colonists or their descendants. Something less\nthan , have been sent thither from this country. Many\nof the original settlers have died; yet, like people else-\nwhere, their o\ufb00spring outnumber those deceased. The\nquestion is, if the colored people are persuaded to go\nanywhere, why not there?\nOne reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you\nwould rather remain within reach of the country of your\n nativity. I do not know how much attachment you may have\ntoward our race. It does not strike me that you have the\ngreatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to\nthem, at all events.\nThe place I am thinking about for a colony is in Central\nAmerica. It is nearer to us than Liberia not much more than\none fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days\u2019 run by\nsteamers. Unlike Liberia, it is a great line of travel \u2014 it is a\nhighway. The country is a very excellent one for any people,\nand with great natural resources and advantages, and\nespecially because of the similarity of climate with your\nnative soil, thus being suited to your physical condition.\nThe particular place I have in view is to be a great highway\nfrom the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Paci\ufb01c Ocean,\nand this particular place has all the advantages for a\ncolony. On both sides there are harbors \u2014 among the \ufb01nest\nin the world. Again, there is evidence of very rich coal-\nmines. A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country.\nWhy I attach so much importance to coal is, it will a\ufb00ord an\nopportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment\ntill they get ready to settle permanently in their homes. If\nyou take colonists where there is no good landing, there is\na bad show; and so where there is nothing to cultivate and\nof which to make a farm. But if something is started so that\nyou can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there, it\nis a great advantage. Coal land is the best thing I know of\nwith which to commence an enterprise. To return \u2014 you\nhave been talked to upon this subject, and told that a\nspeculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest\n in the country, including the coal-mines. We have been\nmistaken all our lives if we do not know whites, as well as\nblacks, look to their self-interest. Unless among those\nde\ufb01cient of intellect, everybody you trade with makes\nsomething. \nYou \nmeet \nwith \nthese \nthings \nhere \nand\neverywhere. If such persons have what will be an\nadvantage to them, the question is whether it cannot be\nmade of advantage to you. You are intelligent, and know\nthat success does not so much depend on external help as\non self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves.\nAs to the coal-mines, I think I see the means available for\nyour self-reliance. I shall, if I get a su\ufb00icient number of you\nengaged, have provision made that you shall not be\nwronged. If you will engage in the enterprise, I will spend\nsome of the money intrusted to me. I am not sure you will\nsucceed. The government may lose the money; but we\ncannot succeed unless we try, and we think with care we\ncan succeed. The political a\ufb00airs in Central America are\nnot in quite as satisfactory a condition as I wish. There are\ncontending factions in that quarter, but it is true all the\nfactions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and\nwant it, and are more generous than we are here.\nTo your colored race they have no objection I would\nendeavor to have you made the equals, and have the best\nassurance that you should be the equals, of the best.\nThe practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can\nget a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and\nchildren, who are willing to go when I present evidence of\nencouragement and protection. Could I get a hundred\n tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and\nable to \u201ccut their own fodder,\u201d so to speak? Can I have\n\ufb01fty? If I could \ufb01nd twenty-\ufb01ve able-bodied men, with a\nmixture of women and children \u2014 good things in the family\nrelation, \nI \nthink, \n\u2014 \nI \ncould \nmake \na \nsuccessful\ncommencement. I want you to let me know whether this\ncan be done or not. This is the practical part of my wish to\nsee you. These are subjects of very great importance,\nworthy of a month\u2019s study, instead of a speech delivered in\nan hour. I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not\npertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours\nfor the present time, but as one of the things, if successfully\nmanaged, the good of mankind \u2014 not con\ufb01ned to the\npresent generation, but as\n\u201cFrom age to age descends the lay\nTo millions yet to be,\nTill far its echoes roll away\nInto eternity.\u201d\nThe above is merely given as the substance of the\nPresident\u2019s remarks.\nThe chairman of the delegation brie\ufb02y replied that they\nwould hold a consultation, and in a short time give an\nanswer.\nThe President said: Take your full time-no hurry at all.\nThe delegation then withdrew.\n     \n A\n  \n \n  I    A   A\n   HA    \nHI\n.\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

If there\nbe in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may\nknow to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert\nthem. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to\nbe falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against\nthem. If there be perceptible in it an impatient and\ndictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend,\nwhose heart I have always supposed to be right.\nAs to the policy I \u201cseem to be pursuing,\u201d as you say, I\nhave not meant to leave any one in doubt.\nI would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way\nunder the Constitution. The sooner the national authority\ncan be restored, the nearer the Union will be, \u201cthe Union as\nit was.\u201d If there be those who would not save the Union\nunless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not\nagree with them. If there be those who would not save the\nUnion unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I\ndo not agree with them. My paramount object in this\nstruggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or\ndestroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing\n any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all\nthe slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some\nand leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do\nabout slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it\nhelps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear\nbecause I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I\nshall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts\nthe cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe\ndoing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors\nwhen shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so\nfast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here\nstated my purpose according to my view of o\ufb00icial duty, and\nI intend no modi\ufb01cation of my oft expressed personal wish\nthat all men, everywhere, could be free.\nYours,\nA.

CURTIN, Governor of\nPennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\nSIR: \u2014 The application made to me by your adjutant\ngeneral for authority to call out the militia of the State of\nPennsylvania has received careful consideration. It is my\nanxious desire to a\ufb00ord, as far as possible, the means and\npower of the Federal Government to protect the State of\nPennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces; and since,\nin your judgment, the militia of the State are required, and\nhave been called upon by you, to organize for home defense\nand protection, I sanction the call that you have made, and\nwill receive them into the service and pay of the United\nStates to the extent they can be armed, equipped, and\nusefully \nemployed. \nThe \narms \nand \nequipments \nnow\nbelonging to the General Government will be needed for\nthe troops called out for the national armies, so that arms\ncan only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by\nthe draft of nine months\u2019 men, heretofore ordered. But as\narms may be supplied by the militia under your call, these,\nwith the , in your arsenal, will probably be su\ufb00icient\nfor the purpose contemplated by your call. You will be\nauthorized to provide such equipments as may be required,\naccording to the regulations of the United States service,\n which, upon being turned over to the United States\nQuartermaster\u2019s Department, will be paid for at regulation\nprices, or the rates allowed by the department for such\narticles. Railroad transportation will also be paid for, as in\nother cases. Such general o\ufb00icers will be supplied as the\nexigencies of the service will permit.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n   \n   \n  I\n.\nWASHINGTON, September ,  M\nHON. ANDREW G.

If\nPorter, Heintzelman, and Sigel were sent you, it would\nsweep everything from the other side of the river, because\nthe new troops have been distributed among them, as I\nunderstand. Porter reports himself , strong, which\ncan only be by the addition of new troops. He is ordered\ntonight to join you as quickly as possible.

CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:\nYour despatch asking for , disciplined troops to be\nsent to Pennsylvania is received. Please consider we have\nnot to exceed , disciplined troops, properly so called,\nthis side of the mountains; and most of them, with many of\nthe new regiments, are now close in the rear of the enemy\nsupposed to be invading Pennsylvania. Start half of them to\nHarrisburg, and the enemy will turn upon and beat the\nremaining half, and then reach Harrisburg before the part\ngoing there, and beat it too when it comes. The best\npossible security for Pennsylvania is putting the strongest\nforce possible in rear of the enemy.\nA.

Where is the enemy\nwhich you dread in Louisville? How near to you? What is\nGeneral Gilbert\u2019s opinion? With all possible respect for you,\nI must think General Wright\u2019s military opinion is the better.\nHe is as much responsible for Louisville as for Cincinnati.\nGeneral Halleck telegraphed him on this very subject\nyesterday, and I telegraph him now; but for us here to\ncontrol him there on the ground would be a babel of\nconfusion which would be utterly ruinous.

Please do not be\no\ufb00ended when I assure you that in my con\ufb01dent belief\nPhiladelphia is in no danger. Governor Curtin has just\ntelegraphed me: \u201cI have advices that Jackson is crossing\nthe Potomac at Williamsport, and probably the whole rebel\narmy will be drawn from Maryland.\u201d At all events,\nPhiladelphia is more than  miles from Hagerstown, and\ncould not be reached by the rebel army in ten days, if no\nhindrance was interposed.\nA.

Please do not let him get o\ufb00 without being hurt.\nA. LINCOLN.\n[But he did! D.W.]\n        \n   \n     H      I\n \n  I  \n  A\n  \n  A\nA I\n \n   \nA\n I A I\n.\nA COMMITTEE FROM THE RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS\nOF CHICAGO,\nSEPTEMBER ,.\nThe subject presented in the memorial is one upon which\nI have thought much for weeks past, and I may even say for\nmonths. I am approached with the most opposite opinions\nand advice, and that by religious men, who are equally\ncertain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that\neither the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief,\nand perhaps in some respects both. I hope it will not be\nirreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God\nwould reveal his will to others, on a point so connected\nwith my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it\ndirectly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself\nthan I often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of\nProvidence in this matter. And if I can learn what it is I will\ndo it! These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I\nsuppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a direct\nrevelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case,\nascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be\nwise and right.\n The subject is di\ufb00icult, and good men do not agree. For\ninstance, the other day, four gentlemen of standing and\nintelligence from New York called as a delegation on\nbusiness connected with the war; but before leaving two of\nthem \nearnestly \nbesought \nme \nto \nproclaim \ngeneral\nemancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked\nthem. You know also that the last session of Congress had a\ndecided majority of antislavery men, yet they could not\nunite on this policy. And the same is true of the religious\npeople. Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a great\ndeal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and\nexpecting God to favor their side: for one of our soldiers\nwho had been taken prisoner told Senator Wilson a few\ndays since that he met nothing so discouraging as the\nevident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers.\nBut we will talk over the merits of the case.\nWhat good would a proclamation of emancipation from\nme do, especially as we are now situated? I do not want to\nissue a document that the whole world will see must\nnecessarily be inoperative, like the Pope\u2019s bull against the\ncomet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even\nenforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a\nsingle court, or magistrate or individual that would be\nin\ufb02uenced by it there? And what reason is there to think it\nwould have any greater e\ufb00ect upon the slaves than the late\nlaw of Congress, which I approved, and which o\ufb00ers\nprotection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who\ncome within our lines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has\ncaused a single slave to come over to us. And suppose they\n could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to\nthrow themselves upon us, what should we do with them?\nHow can we feed and care for such a multitude? General\nButler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more\nrations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the\nwhite troops under his command. They eat, and that is all;\nthough it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also\nby the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If,\nnow, the pressure of the war should call o\ufb00 our forces from\nNew Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent\nthe masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again? for I\nam told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners,\nfree or slave, they immediately auction them o\ufb00. They did\nso with those they took from a boat that was aground in the\nTennessee River a few days ago. And then I am very\nungenerously attacked for it! For instance, when, after the\nlate battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out\nfrom Washington under a \ufb02ag of truce to bury the dead and\nbring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who\nwent along to help, and sent them into slavery, Horace\nGreeley said in his paper that the government would\nprobably do nothing about it. What could I do?\nNow, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of\ngood would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as\nyou desire? Understand, I raise no objections against it on\nlegal or constitutional grounds; for, as commander-in-chief\nof the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have a\nright to take any measure which may best subdue the\nenemy; nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view\n of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at\nthe South. I view this matter as a practical war measure, to\nbe \ndecided \non \naccording \nto \nthe \nadvantages \nor\ndisadvantages it may o\ufb00er to the suppression of the\nrebellion.\nI admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least\nits sine qua non. The ambition of politicians may have\ninstigated them to act, but they would have been impotent\nwithout slavery as their instrument. I will also concede that\nemancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them\nthat we are incited by something more than ambition. I\ngrant, further, that it would help somewhat at the North,\nthough not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent\nimagine. Still, some additional strength would be added in\nthat way to the war, and then, unquestionably, it would\nweaken the rebels by drawing o\ufb00 their laborers, which is of\ngreat importance; but I am not so sure we could do much\nwith the blacks. If we were to arm them, I fear that in a few\nweeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels; and,\nindeed, thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our\nwhite troops. I will mention another thing, though it meet\nonly your scorn and contempt. There are \ufb01fty thousand\nbayonets in the Union armies from the border slave States.\nIt would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a\nproclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the\nrebels. I do not think they all would \u2014 not so many, indeed,\nas a year ago, or as six months ago \u2014 not so many to-day as\nyesterday. Every day increases their Union feeling. They\nare also getting their pride enlisted, and want to beat the\n rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit\nthat we already have an important principle to rally and\nunite the people, in the fact that constitutional government\nis at stake. This is a fundamental idea going down about as\ndeep as anything.\nDo not misunderstand me because I have mentioned\nthese objections. They indicate the di\ufb00iculties that have\nthus far prevented my action in some such way as you\ndesire. I have not decided against a proclamation of liberty\nto the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement; and I\ncan assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and\nnight, more than any other. Whatever shall appear to be\nGod\u2019s will, I will do. I trust that in the freedom with which I\nhave canvassed your views I have not in any respect injured\nyour feelings.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  H. \n. \n I\nH .\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

The object is, that neither army shall get much\nadvantage of the other; that both shall be kept in the \ufb01eld\ntill they are exhausted, when we will make a compromise\nand save slavery.\u201d\nI shall be very happy if you will, within twenty-four hours\nfrom the receipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner that\nyou did not, either literally or in substance, make the\nanswer stated.\n[Above delivered to Major Key at . a.m. September\nth.]\nAt about  o\u2019clock A.M., September , , Major Key\nand Major Turner appeared before me. Major Turner says:\n\u201cAs I remember it, the conversation was: \u2018Why did we not\nbag them after the battle of Sharpsburg?\u2019 Major Key\u2019s reply\n was: \u2018That was not the game; that we should tire the rebels\nout and ourselves; that that was the only way the Union\ncould be preserved, we come together fraternally, and\nslavery be saved.\u2019\u201d\nOn cross-examination, Major Turner says he has\nfrequently heard Major Key converse in regard to the\npresent troubles, and never heard him utter a sentiment\nunfavorable to the maintenance of the Union. He has never\nuttered anything which he, Major T., would call disloyalty.\nThe particular conversation detailed was a private one.\n[Indorsement on the above.]\nIn my view, it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman\nholding a military commission from the United States to\nutter such sentiments as Major Key is within proved to\nhave done. Therefore, let Major John J. Key be forthwith\ndismissed from the military service of the United States.\nA.

It is known to some that, while I hope something\nfrom the proclamation, my expectations are not as\nsanguine as are those of some friends. The time for its\ne\ufb00ect southward has not come; but northward the e\ufb00ect\nshould be instantaneous. It is six days old, and, while\ncommendation \nin \nnewspapers \nand \nby \ndistinguished\nindividuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks\nhave declined, and troops come forward more slowly than\never. This, looked soberly in the face, is not very\nsatisfactory. We have fewer troops in the \ufb01eld at the end of\nthe six days than we had at the beginning \u2014 the attrition\namong the old outnumbering the addition by the new. The\nNorth responds to the proclamation su\ufb00iciently in breath;\nbut breath alone kills no rebels.\nI wish I could write more cheerfully; nor do I thank you\nthe less for the kindness of your letter.\nYours very truly, A.

My inclination is to send the\nprisoners back with a de\ufb01nite notice that we will recognize\nno paroles given to our prisoners by the rebels as extending\nbeyond a prohibition against \ufb01ghting them, though I wish\nyour opinion upon it, based both upon the general law and\nour cartel.

I return thanks to\nour soldiers for the good services they have rendered, the\nenergy they have shown, the hardships they have endured,\nand the blood they have shed for this Union of ours; and I\nalso return thanks, not only to the soldiers, but to the good\ncitizens of Frederick, and to the good men, women, and\nchildren in this land of ours, for their devotion to this\nglorious cause; and I say this with no malice in my heart\ntowards those who have done otherwise. May our children\nand children\u2019s children, for a thousand generations,\ncontinue to enjoy the bene\ufb01ts conferred upon us by a\nunited country, and have cause yet to rejoice under these\nglorious institutions, bequeathed to us by WASHINGTON\nand his compeers. Now, my friends, soldiers and citizens, I\ncan only say once more-farewell.\n     \n A\n   \n \n \n  A  HA    \nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN., WASHINGTON, D. C.,\nOctober , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN: I am instructed to\ntelegraph you as follows: The President directs that you\ncross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy, or drive\nhim south. Your army must move now, while the roads are\ngood. If you cross the river between the enemy and\nWashington, and cover the latter by your operation, you can\nbe reinforced by thirty thousand men. If you move up the\nvalley of the Shenandoah, not more than twelve or \ufb01fteen\nthousand can be sent you. The President advises the\ninterior line between Washington and the enemy, but does\nnot order it. He is very desirous that your army move as\nsoon as possible. You will immediately report what line you\nadopt, and when you intend to cross the river; also to what\npoint the reinforcements are to be sent. It is necessary that\nthe plan of your operations be positively determined on,\nbefore orders are given for building bridges and repairing\nrailroads. I am directed to add that the Secretary of War\nand the General-in-chief fully concur with the President in\nthese directions.\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \nc     A\n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN, HDQS. Army of the\nPotomac: You wish to see your family and I wish to oblige\nyou. It might be left to your own discretion; certainly so, if\nMrs. M. could meet you here at Washington.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n  . H.   A .\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October , .\nTHOMAS H. CLAY, Cincinnati, Ohio: You cannot have\nre\ufb02ected seriously when you ask that I shall order General\nMorgan\u2019s command to Kentucky as a favor because they\nhave marched from Cumberland Gap. The precedent\nestablished by it would evidently break up the whole army.\nBuell\u2019s old troops, now in pursuit of Bragg, have done more\nhard marching recently; and, in fact, if you include\nmarching and \ufb01ghting, there are scarcely any old troops\neast or west of the mountains that have not done as hard\nservice. I sincerely wish war was an easier and pleasanter\nbusiness than it is; but it does not admit of holidays. On\nMorgan\u2019s command, where it is now sent, as I understand,\ndepends the question whether the enemy will get to the\nOhio River in another place.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  . \n A\n .\nWASHINGTON, D.C., October , \nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT: I congratulate you and all\nconcerned in your recent battles and victories.

We\nhave heard nothing since day before yesterday. Have you\nanything?\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   \n  I .\nWASHINGTON, D. C., October , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, SAINT Louis, Missouri:\nWould the completion of the railroad some distance\nfurther in the direction of Spring\ufb01eld, Mo., be of any\nmilitary advantage to you? Please answer.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  . \nc     A\n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October , .\nMY DEAR SIR \u2014 You remember my speaking to you of\nwhat I called your over-cautiousness. Are you not over-\ncautious when you assume that you cannot do what the\nenemy is constantly doing? Should you not claim to be at\nleast his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?\nAs I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that\nyou cannot subsist your army at Winchester unless the\nrailroad from Harper\u2019s Ferry to that point be put in working\norder. But the enemy does now subsist his army at\nWinchester, at a distance nearly twice as great from\nrailroad transportation as you would have to do, without\nthe railroad last named. He now wagons from Culpepper\nCourt-House, which is just about twice as far as you would\nhave to do from Harper\u2019s Ferry. He is certainly not more\nthan half as well provided with wagons as you are. I\ncertainly should be pleased for you to have the advantage\nof the railroad from Harper\u2019s Perry to Winchester; but it\nwastes an the remainder of autumn to give it to you, and, in\nfact, ignores the question of time, which cannot and must\nnot be ignored.\nAgain, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is\n\u201cto operate upon the enemy\u2019s communications as much as\n possible, without exposing your own.\u201d You seem to act as if\nthis applies against you, but cannot apply in your favor.\nChange positions with the enemy, and think you not he\nwould break your communication with Richmond within the\nnext \ntwenty-four \nhours? \nYou \ndread \nhis \ngoing \ninto\nPennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he gives up his\ncommunications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to\ndo but to follow and ruin him; if he does so with less than\nfull force, fall upon and beat what is left behind all the\neasier.\nExclusive of the water line, you are now nearer to\nRichmond than the enemy is, by the route that you can and\nhe must take. Why can you not reach there before him,\nunless you admit that he is more than your equal on a\nmarch? His route is the arc of a circle, while yours is the\nchord. The roads are as good on yours as on his.\nYou know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the\nPotomac below instead of above the Shenandoah and Blue\nRidge. My idea was, that this would at once menace the\nenemy\u2019s communications, which I would seize if he would\npermit. If he should move northward, I would follow him\nclosely, holding his communications. If he should prevent\nour \nseizing \nhis \ncommunications, \nand \nmove \ntoward\nRichmond, I would press closely to him, \ufb01ght him if a\nfavorable opportunity should present, and at least try to\nbeat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say \u201ctry;\u201d if we\nnever try, we shall never succeed. If he makes a stand at\nWinchester, moving neither north or south, I would \ufb01ght\nhim there, on the idea that if we cannot beat him when he\n bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we\nbear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a\nsimple truth, and is too important to be lost sight of for a\nmoment. In coming to us he tenders us an advantage which\nwe should not waive. We should not so operate as to merely\ndrive him away. As we must beat him somewhere or fail\n\ufb01nally, we can do it, if at all, easier near to us than far\naway. If we cannot beat the enemy where he now is, we\nnever can, he again being within the entrenchments of\nRichmond.\n[And, indeed, the enemy was let back into Richmond and\nit took another two years and thousands of dead for\nMcClelland cowardice \u2014 if that was all that it was. I still\nsuspect, and I think the evidence is overwhelming that he\nwas, either secretly a supporter of the South, or, what is\nmore likely, a politician readying for a di\ufb00erent campaign:\nthat of the Presidency of the United States.]\nRecurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside\ntrack, the facility of supplying from the side away from the\nenemy is remarkable, as it were, by the di\ufb00erent spokes of\na wheel extending from the hub toward the rim, and this\nwhether you move directly by the chord or on the inside\narc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The chord line,\nas you see, carries you by Aldie, Hay Market, and\nFredericksburg; and you see how turnpikes, railroads, and\n\ufb01nally the Potomac, by Aquia Creek, meet you at all points\nfrom WASHINGTON; the same, only the lines lengthened a\nlittle, if you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way.\n The gaps through the Blue Ridge I understand to be\nabout the following distances from Harper\u2019s Ferry, to wit:\nVestal\u2019s,  miles; Gregory\u2019s, ; Snicker\u2019s, ; Ashby\u2019s, ;\nManassas, ; Chester, ; and Thornton\u2019s, . I should\nthink it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy,\ndisabling him to make an important move without your\nknowledge, and compelling him to keep his forces together\nfor dread of you. The gaps would enable you to attack if you\nshould wish. For a great part of the way you would be\npractically between the enemy and both WASHINGTON\nand Richmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest\nnumber of troops from here. When at length running for\nRichmond ahead of him enables him to move this way, if he\ndoes so, turn and attack him in rear. But I think he should\nbe engaged long before such a point is reached. It is all\neasy if our troops march as well as the enemy, and it is\nunmanly to say they cannot do it. This letter is in no sense\nan order.\nYours truly,\nA.

And I do hereby authorize and empower the\n said judge to make and establish such rules and regulations\nas may be necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction, and\nempower the said judge to appoint a prosecuting attorney,\nmarshal, and clerk of the said court, who shall perform the\nfunctions of attorney, marshal, and clerk according to such\nproceedings and practice as before mentioned and such\nrules and regulations as may be made and established by\nsaid judge. These appointments are to continue during the\npleasure of the President, not extending beyond the\nmilitary occupation of the city of New Orleans or the\nrestoration of the civil authority in that city and in the State\nof Louisiana. These o\ufb00icers shall be paid, out of the\ncontingent fund of the War Department, compensation as\nfollows: The judge at the rate of   per annum; the\nprosecuting attorney, including the fees, at the rate of\n  per annum; the marshal, including the fees, at the\nrate of   per annum; and the clerk, including the fees,\nat the rate of   per annum; such compensations to be\ncerti\ufb01ed by the Secretary of War.

In all\navailable ways give the people a show to express their\nwishes at these elections.\nFollow law, and forms of law, as far as convenient, but at\nall events get the expression of the largest number of the\npeople possible.

To send a parcel of Northern men\nhere as representatives, elected, as would be understood\n(and perhaps really so), at the point of the bayonet, would\nbe disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of\nCongress here, I would vote against admitting any such\nman to a seat.\nYours very truly, A.

LINCOLN.\n   A I\n  A  I   \n  \n \n  A \nTO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November\n, .\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS: \u2014 Early last week you left\nme in high hope with your assurance that you would be o\ufb00\nwith your expedition at the end of that week, or early in\nthis. It is now the end of this, and I have just been\noverwhelmed \nand \nconfounded \nwith \nthe \nsight \nof \na\nrequisition made by you which, I am assured, cannot be\n\ufb01lled and got o\ufb00 within an hour short of two months. I\nenclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that it is\nnot genuine \u2014 that you have never seen it. My dear\nGeneral, this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has\nbeen, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our \ufb01nal ruin if it\nis not abandoned. If you had the articles of this requisition\nupon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make them\nof any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get\nvessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say\nnothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the\nvessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks\nmore. And, after all, where you are going you have no use\nfor them. When you parted with me you had no such ideas\nin your mind. I know you had not, or you could not have\n expected to be o\ufb00 so soon as you said. You must get back to\nsomething like the plan you had then, or your expedition is\na failure before you start. You must be o\ufb00 before Congress\nmeets. You would be better o\ufb00 anywhere, and especially\nwhere you are going, for not having a thousand wagons\ndoing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that\ndraw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care\nfor the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two\nthousand good soldiers. Now, dear General, do not think\nthis is an ill-natured letter; it is the very reverse. The\nsimple publication of this requisition would ruin you.\nVery truly your friend, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n  A     H\n  .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November ,\n.\nGENERAL CARL SCHURZ.\nMY DEAR SIR \u2014 I have just received and read your letter\nof the th. The purport of it is that we lost the late\nelections and the administration is failing because the war\nis unsuccessful, and that I must not \ufb02atter myself that I am\nnot justly to blame for it. I certainly know that if the war\nfails the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for\nit, whether I deserve it or not. And I ought to be blamed if I\ncould do better. You think I could do better; therefore you\nblame me already. I think I could not do better; therefore I\nblame you for blaming me. I understand you now to be\nwilling to accept the help of men who are not Republicans,\nprovided they have \u201cheart in it.\u201d Agreed. I want no others.\nBut who is to be the judge of hearts, or of \u201cheart in it\u201d? If I\nmust discard my own judgment and take yours, I must also\ntake that of others and by the time I should reject all I\nshould be advised to reject, I should have none left,\nRepublicans or others not even yourself. For be assured, my\ndear sir, there are men who have \u201cheart in it\u201d that think\nyou are performing your part as poorly as you think I am\nperforming mine. I certainly have been dissatis\ufb01ed with the\n slowness of Buell and McClellan; but before I relieved them\nI had great fears I should not \ufb01nd successors to them who\nwould do better; and I am sorry to add that I have seen\nlittle since to relieve those fears.\nI do not see clearly the prospect of any more rapid\nmovements. I fear we shall at last \ufb01nd out that the di\ufb00iculty\nis in our case rather than in particular generals. I wish to\ndisparage no one certainly not those who sympathize with\nme; but I must say I need success more than I need\nsympathy, and that I have not seen the so much greater\nevidence of getting success from my sympathizers than\nfrom those who are denounced as the contrary. It does\nseem to me that in the \ufb01eld the two classes have been very\nmuch alike in what they have done and what they have\nfailed to do. In sealing their faith with their blood, Baker\nand Lyon and Bohien and Richardson, Republicans, did all\nthat men could do; but did they any more than Kearny and\nStevens and Reno and Mans\ufb01eld, none of whom were\nRepublicans, and some at least of whom have been bitterly\nand \nrepeatedly \ndenounced \nto \nme \nas \nsecession\nsympathizers? I will not perform the ungrateful task of\ncomparing cases of failure.\nIn answer to your question, \u201cHas it not been publicly\nstated in the newspapers, and apparently proved as a fact,\nthat from the commencement of the war the enemy was\ncontinually supplied with information by some of the\ncon\ufb01dential subordinates of as important an o\ufb00icer as\nAdjutant-General Thomas?\u201d I must say \u201cNo,\u201d as far as my\nknowledge extends. And I add that if you can give any\n tangible evidence upon the subject, I will thank you to\ncome to this city and do so.\nVery truly your friend, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  A.  .  \n \n I\n .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November ,\n.\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, FALMOUTH, Virginia:\nIf I should be in boat o\ufb00 Aquia Creek at dark tomorrow\n(Wednesday) evening, could you, without inconvenience,\nmeet me and pass an hour or two with me?\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n A  \n \n   \n \n  A   A   .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, \nNOVEMBER , .\nHON. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Few things perplex me more than this\nquestion \nbetween \nGovernor \nGamble \nand \nthe \nWar\nDepartment, as to whether the peculiar force organized by\nthe former in Missouri are State troops or United States\ntroops. Now, this is either an immaterial or a mischievous\nquestion. First, if no more is desired than to have it settled\nwhat name the force is to be called by, it is immaterial.\nSecondly, if it is desired for more than the \ufb01xing a name, it\ncan only be to get a position from which to draw practical\ninferences; then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one\ndispute by deciding the question, I should merely furnish a\nnest-full of eggs for hatching new disputes. I believe the\nforce is not strictly either \u201cState troops\u201d or \u201cUnited States\ntroops.\u201d It is of mixed character. I therefore think it is safer,\nwhen a practical question arises, to decide that question\ndirectly, \nand \nnot \nindirectly \nby \ndeciding \na \ngeneral\nabstraction supposed to include it, and also including a\ngreat deal more. Without dispute Governor Gamble\nappoints the o\ufb00icers of this force, and \ufb01lls vacancies when\nthey occur. The question now practically in dispute is: Can\nGovernor Gamble make a vacancy by removing an o\ufb00icer or\n accepting a resignation? Now, while it is proper that this\nquestion shall be settled, I do not perceive why either\nGovernor Gamble or the government here should care\nwhich way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only because\nthere seems to be pertinacity about it. It seems to me that\nit might be either way without injury to the service; or that\nthe o\ufb00er of the Secretary of War to let Governor Gamble\nmake vacancies, and he (the Secretary) to ratify the making\nof them, ought to be satisfactory.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   \n  I .\n[Cipher.]\nWASHINGTON, NOVEMBER , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Missouri: Frank\nBlair \nwants \nManter\u2019s \nThirty-second, \nCurly\u2019s \nTwenty\nseventh, Boyd\u2019s Twenty-fourth and the Ninth and Tenth\nCavalry to go with him down the river. I understand it is\nwith you to decide whether he shall have them and if so,\nand if also it is consistent with the public service, you will\noblige me a good deal by letting him have them.\nA. LINCOLN.\n      \n I\n     I\nIA\nLETTER TO JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December ,\n.\nJUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\nSIR: \u2014 Three hundred Indians have been sentenced to\ndeath in Minnesota by a military commission, and execution\nonly awaits my action. I wish your legal opinion whether if I\nshould conclude to execute only a part of them, I must\nmyself designate which, or could I leave the designation to\nsome o\ufb00icer on the ground?\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n A\n A  \n   A\n   \n  \n      \n   \n     \n    .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES \u2014 Since your last annual assembling\nanother year of health and bountiful harvests has passed;\nand while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a\nreturn of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best\nlight he gives us, trusting that in his own good time and\nwise way all will yet be well.\nThe correspondence touching foreign a\ufb00airs which has\ntaken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in\nvirtual compliance with a request to that e\ufb00ect, made by\nthe House of Representatives near the close of the last\nsession of Congress.\nIf the condition of our relations with other nations is less\ngratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is\ncertainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily\ndistracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended.\nIn the month of June last there were some grounds to\nexpect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of\nour domestic di\ufb00iculties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as\nwe think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would\nsoon recede from that position, which has proved only less\ninjurious to themselves than to our own country. But the\ntemporary reverses which afterward befell the national\n arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal\ncitizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple\njustice.\nThe civil war, which has so radically changed, for the\nmoment, the occupations and habits of the American\npeople, has necessarily disturbed the social condition, and\na\ufb00ected very deeply the prosperity, of the nations with\nwhich we have carried on a commerce that has been\nsteadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It\nhas, at the same time, excited political ambitions and\napprehensions which have produced a profound agitation\nthroughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we\nhave forborne from taking part in any controversy between\nforeign states, and between parties or factions in such\nstates. \nWe \nhave \nattempted \nno \npropagandism \nand\nacknowledged no revolution, but we have left to every\nnation the exclusive conduct and management of its own\na\ufb00airs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by\nforeign nations with reference less to its own merits than to\nits \nsupposed \nand \noften \nexaggerated \ne\ufb00ects \nand\nconsequences resulting to those nations themselves,\nnevertheless, complaint on the part of this government,\neven if it were just, would certainly be unwise.\nThe treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the\nslave trade has been put into operation with a good\nprospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special\npleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part\nof her Majesty\u2019s government has been marked with a\n jealous respect for the authority of the United States and\nthe rights of their moral and loyal citizens.\nThe convention with Hanover for the abolition of the\nstate dues has been carried into full e\ufb00ect under the act of\nCongress for that purpose.\nA blockade of  miles of seacoast could not be\nestablished and vigorously enforced in a season of great\ncommercial activity like the present without committing\noccasional mistakes and in\ufb02icting unintentional injuries\nupon foreign nations and their subjects.\nA civil war occurring in a country where foreigners\nreside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations is\nnecessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral\nrights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions,\nand possibly to produce mutual reclamations between\nnations which have a common interest in preserving peace\nand friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have so far as\npossible heard and redressed complaints which have been\npresented by friendly powers. There is still, however, a\nlarge and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon\nwhich the government is unable to agree with the\ngovernments whose protection is demanded by the\nclaimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the\nUnited States or their citizens su\ufb00er wrongs from the naval\nor military authorities of foreign nations which the\ngovernments of those states are not at once prepared to\nredress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states thus\ninterested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such\ncomplaints. This proposition has been made especially to\n Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each\ncase it has been kindly received, but has not yet been\nformally adopted.\nI deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in\nbehalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark Admiral P.\nTordenskiold, which vessel was in May, , prevented by\nthe commander of the blockading force o\ufb00 Charleston from\nleaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar\nprivilege had shortly before been granted to an English\nvessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the\npapers in the case to be communicated to the proper\ncommittees.\nApplications have been made to me by many free\nAmericans of African descent to favor their emigration,\nwith a view to such colonization as was contemplated in\nrecent acts of Congress, Other parties, at home and abroad\n\u2014 some from interested motives, others upon patriotic\nconsiderations, and still others in\ufb02uenced by philanthropic\nsentiments \u2014 have suggested similar measures, while, on\nthe other hand, several of the Spanish American republics\nhave protested against the sending of such colonies to their\nrespective territories. Under these circumstances I have\ndeclined to move any such colony to any state without \ufb01rst\nobtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement\non its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the\nrights of freemen; and I have at the same time o\ufb00ered to\nthe several states situated within the Tropics, or having\ncolonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice\nand consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary\n emigration of persons of that class to their respective\nterritories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and\nhumane. Liberia and Haiti are as yet the only countries to\nwhich colonists of African descent from here could go with\ncertainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I\nregret to say such persons contemplating colonization do\nnot seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to\nsome others, nor so willing as I think their interest\ndemands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this\nrespect is improving, and that ere long there will be an\naugmented and considerable migration to both these\ncountries from the United States.\nThe new commercial treaty between the United States\nand the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution.\nA commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated,\nsubject to the Senate\u2019s consent, with Liberia, and a similar\nnegotiation is now pending with the Republic of Haiti. A\nconsiderable improvement of the national commerce is\nexpected to result from these measures.\nOur relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal,\nRussia, \nPrussia, \nDenmark, \nSweden, \nAustria, \nthe\nNetherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European states\nremain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue\nto be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.\nDuring the last year there has not only been no change of\nour previous relations with the independent states of our\nown continent, but more friendly sentiments than have\nheretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these\nneighbors, whose safety and progress are so intimately\n connected with our own. This statement especially applies\nto Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and\nChile.\nThe commission under the convention with the Republic\nof New Granada closed its session without having audited\nand passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it.\nA proposition is pending to revive the convention, that it\nmay be able to do more complete justice. The joint\ncommission between the United States and the Republic of\nCosta Rica has completed its labors and submitted its\nreport.\nI have favored the project for connecting the United\nStates with Europe by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar\nproject to extend the telegraph from San Francisco to\nconnect by a Paci\ufb01c telegraph with the line which is being\nextended across the Russian Empire.\nThe Territories of the United States, with unimportant\nexceptions, have remained undisturbed by the civil war;\nand they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as\njusti\ufb01es an expectation that some of them will soon be in a\ncondition to be organized as States and be constitutionally\nadmitted into the Federal Union.\nThe immense mineral resources of some of those\nTerritories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible.\nEvery step in that direction would have a tendency to\nimprove the revenues of the government and diminish the\nburdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious\nconsideration whether some extraordinary measures to\npromote that end cannot be adopted. The means which\n suggests itself as most likely to be e\ufb00ective is a scienti\ufb01c\nexploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with\na view to the publication of its results at home and in\nforeign countries \u2014 results which cannot fail to be\nauspicious.\nThe condition of the \ufb01nances win claim your most\ndiligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to\nthe military and naval operations required for the\nsuppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a\npromptitude \nand \ncertainty \nunusual \nin \nsimilar\ncircumstances, and the public credit has been fully\nmaintained. The continuance of the war, however, and the\nincreased \ndisbursements \nmade \nnecessary \nby \nthe\naugmented forces now in the \ufb01eld demand your best\nre\ufb02ections as to the best modes of providing the necessary\nrevenue without injury to business and with the least\npossible burdens upon labor.\nThe suspension of specie payments by the banks soon\nafter the commencement of your last session made large\nissues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way\ncould the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other\njust demands be so economically or so well provided for.\nThe \njudicious \nlegislation \nof \nCongress, \nsecuring \nthe\nreceivability of these notes for loans and internal duties\nand making them a legal tender for other debts, has made\nthem an universal currency, and has satis\ufb01ed, partially at\nleast, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform\ncirculating medium, saving thereby to the people immense\nsums in discounts and exchanges.\n A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest\nperiod compatible with due regard to all interests\nconcerned should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the\nvalue of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these\n\ufb02uctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a\nleading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt\nand \ncertain \nconvertibility, \ninto \ncoin \nis \ngenerally\nacknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against\nthem; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of\nUnited States notes payable in coin and su\ufb00iciently large\nfor the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully,\nand safely maintained.\nIs there, then, any other mode in which the necessary\nprovision for the public wants can be made and the great\nadvantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?\nI know of none which promises so certain results and is\nat the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of\nbanking associations, under a general act of Congress, well\nguarded in its provisions. To such associations the\ngovernment might furnish circulating notes, on the security\nof United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These\nnotes, prepared under the supervision of proper o\ufb00icers,\nbeing uniform in appearance and security and convertible\nalways into coin, would at once protect labor against the\nevils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by\ncheap and safe exchanges.\nA moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds\nwould compensate the United States for the preparation\nand distribution of the notes and a general supervision of\n the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the\npublic debt employed as securities. The public credit,\nmoreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of\nnew loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand\nfor government bonds which the adoption of the proposed\nsystem would create.\nIt is an additional recommendation of the measure, of\nconsiderable weight, in my judgment, that it would\nreconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the\nopportunity o\ufb00ered to existing institutions to reorganize\nunder the act, substituting only the secured uniform\nnational circulation for the local and various circulation,\nsecured and unsecured, now issued by them.\nThe receipts into the treasury from all sources, including\nloans and balance from the preceding year, for the \ufb01scal\nyear ending on the th June, , were  ,,.,\nof which sum  ,,. were derived from customs;\n ,,. from the direct tax; from public lands,\n ,.; from miscellaneous sources,  ,.;\nfrom loans in all forms,  ,,.. The remainder,\n ,,., was the balance from last year.\nThe disbursements during the same period were: For\ncongressional, \nexecutive, \nand \njudicial \npurposes,\n ,,.; for foreign intercourse,  ,,.; for\nmiscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans, post-\no\ufb00ice de\ufb01ciencies, collection of revenue, and other like\ncharges,  ,,.; for expenses under the Interior\nDepartment,  ,,.; under the War Department,\n ,,.; \nunder \nthe \nNavy \nDepartment,\n  ,,.; \nfor \ninterest \non \npublic \ndebt,\n ,,.; and for payment of public debt, including\nreimbursement \nof \ntemporary \nloan \nand \nredemptions,\n ,,.; making an aggregate of  ,,.,\nand leaving a balance in the treasury on the st day of July,\n, of  ,,..\nIt should be observed that the sum of  ,,.,\nexpended for reimbursements and redemption of public\ndebt, being included also in the loans made, may be\nproperly deducted both from receipts and expenditures,\nleaving the actual receipts for the year  ,,.,\nand the expenditures  ,,..\nOther information on the subject of the \ufb01nances will be\nfound in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to\nwhose statements and views I invite your most candid and\nconsiderate attention.\nThe reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are\nherewith transmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are\nscarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous\nand extensive transactions and operations conducted\nthrough those departments. Nor could I give a summary of\nthem here upon any principle which would admit of its\nbeing much shorter than the reports themselves. I\ntherefore content myself with laying the reports before you\nand asking your attention to them.\nIt gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in\nthe \ufb01nancial condition of the Post-O\ufb00ice Department as\ncompared with several preceding years. The receipts for\nthe \ufb01scal year  amounted to  ,,., which\n embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for\nthree quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation\nof revenue from the so-called seceded States during the\nlast \ufb01scal year, the increase of the correspondence of the\nloyal States has been su\ufb00icient to produce a revenue\nduring the same year of  ,,., being only  ,\nless than was derived from all the States of the Union\nduring the previous year. The expenditures show a still\nmore favorable result. The amount expended in  was\n ,,.. For the last year the amount has been\nreduced to  ,,., showing a decrease of about\n ,, in the expenditures as compared with the\npreceding year, and about  ,, as compared with\nthe \ufb01scal year . The de\ufb01ciency in the department for\nthe previous year was  ,,.. For the last \ufb01scal\nyear it was reduced to  ,,.. These favorable\nresults are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in\nthe insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of\nall expenditures in that department in the interest of\neconomy. The e\ufb00iciency of the postal service, it is believed,\nhas also been much improved. The Postmaster-General has\nalso opened a correspondence through the Department of\nState with foreign governments proposing a convention of\npostal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the\nrates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails.\nThis proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens\nand to the commercial interests of this country, has been\nfavorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments\nfrom whom replies have been received.\n I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the\nPostmaster-General in his report respecting the further\nlegislation required, in his opinion, for the bene\ufb01t of the\npostal service.\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard\nto the public lands:\n\u201cThe public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue.\nFrom the st July, , to the th September, , the\nentire cash receipts from the sale of lands were  ,.\n\u2014 a sum much less than the expenses of our land system\nduring the same period. The homestead law, which will take\ne\ufb00ect on the st of January next, o\ufb00ers such inducements\nto settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an\nextent su\ufb00icient to meet the expenses of the General Land\nO\ufb00ice and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into\nmarket.\u201d\nThe discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising\nfrom the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from\nthe same source as reported from the Treasury Department\narises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods of\ntime, though apparently were not really coincident at the\nbeginning \npoint, \nthe \nTreasury \nreport \nincluding \na\nconsiderable sum now which had previously been reported\nfrom the Interior, su\ufb00iciently large to greatly overreach the\nsum derived from the three months now reported upon by\nthe Interior and not by the Treasury.\nThe Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past\nyear manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several\npoints have engaged in open hostilities against the white\n settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the\nIndian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance\nto the United States and entered into treaties with the\ninsurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States\nwere driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees\nhas visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former\nrelations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges\nthat they were constrained by superior force to enter into\ntreaties with the insurgents, and that the United States\nneglected to furnish the protection which their treaty\nstipulations required.\nIn the month of August last the Sioux Indians in\nMinnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with\nextreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women, and\nchildren. This attack was wholly unexpected, and therefore\nno means of defense had been provided. It is estimated that\nnot less than  persons were killed by the Indians, and a\nlarge amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak\nwas induced is not de\ufb01nitely known, and suspicions, which\nmay be unjust, need not to be stated. Information was\nreceived by the Indian Bureau from di\ufb00erent sources about\nthe time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous\nattack was to be made upon white settlements by all the\ntribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky\nMountains. The State of Minnesota has su\ufb00ered great\ninjury from this Indian war. A large portion of her territory\nhas been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained\nby the destruction of property. The people of that State\nmanifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond\n the limits of the State as a guaranty against future\nhostilities. The Commissioner of Indian A\ufb00airs will furnish\nfull details. I submit for your especial consideration\nwhether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many\nwise and good men have impressed me with the belief that\nthis can be pro\ufb01tably done.\nI \nsubmit \na \nstatement \nof \nthe \nproceedings \nof\ncommissioners, which shows the progress that has been\nmade in the enterprise of constructing the Paci\ufb01c Railroad.\nAnd this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and\nalso the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now\npending before them for enlarging the capacities of the\ngreat canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital and\nrapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and\nespecially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be\nnoticed at some greater length. I purpose having prepared\nand laid before you at an early day some interesting and\nvaluable statistical information upon this subject. The\nmilitary and commercial importance of enlarging the\nIllinois and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River\nis presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the\nSecretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I\nrespectfully ask attention to it.\nTo carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the\nth of May last, I have caused the Department of\nAgriculture of the United States to be organized.\nThe Commissioner informs me that within the period of a\nfew months this department has established an extensive\nsystem of correspondence and exchanges, both at home\n and abroad, which promises to e\ufb00ect highly bene\ufb01cial\nresults in the development of a correct knowledge of recent\nimprovements in agriculture, in the introduction of new\nproducts, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics\nof the di\ufb00erent States.\nAlso, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely\nseeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already\npublished and liberally di\ufb00used much valuable information\nin anticipation of a more elaborate report, which will in due\ntime be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in\nchemical science now in progress in the laboratory.\nThe creation of this department was for the more\nimmediate bene\ufb01t of a large class of our most valuable\ncitizens, and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has\nbeen organized will not only meet your approbation, but\nthat it will realize at no distant day all the fondest\nanticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the\nfruitful source of advantage to all our people.\nOn the d day of September last a proclamation was\nissued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith\nsubmitted.\nIn accordance with the purpose expressed in the second\nparagraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your\nattention \nto \nwhat \nmay \nbe \ncalled \n\u201ccompensated\nemancipation.\u201d\nA nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people,\nand its laws. The territory is the only part which is of\ncertain durability. \u201cOne generation passeth away and\nanother generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever.\u201d\n It is of the \ufb01rst importance to duly consider and estimate\nthis ever enduring part. That portion of the earth\u2019s surface\nwhich is owned and inhabited by the people of the United\nStates is well adapted to be the home of one national\nfamily, and it is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast\nextent and its variety of climate and productions are of\nadvantage in this age for one people, whatever they might\nhave been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and\nintelligence have brought these to be an advantageous\ncombination for one united people.\nIn the inaugural address I brie\ufb02y pointed out the total\ninadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the di\ufb00erences\nbetween the people of the two sections. I did so in language\nwhich I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to\nrepeat:\n\u201cOne section of our country believes slavery is right and\nought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong\nand ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial\ndispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and\nthe laws for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are\neach as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a\ncommunity \nwhere \nthe \nmoral \nSense \nof \nthe \npeople\nimperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the\npeople abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and\na few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly\ncured, and it would be worse in both cases after the\nseparation of the sections than before. The foreign slave\ntrade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately\nrevived without restriction in one section, while fugitive\n slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be\nsurrendered at all by the other.\n\u201cPhysically speaking, we can not separate. We can not\nremove our respective sections from each other nor build\nan impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may\nbe divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the\nreach of each other, but the di\ufb00erent parts of our country\ncannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue\nbetween them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse\nmore advantageous or more satisfactory after separation\nthan before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends\ncan make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\nbetween aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you\ngo to war, you cannot \ufb01ght always; and when, after much\nloss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease \ufb01ghting,\nthe identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are\nagain upon you.\u201d\nThere is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a\nnational boundary upon which to divide. Trace through,\nfrom east to west, upon the line between the free and slave\ncountry, and we shall \ufb01nd a little more than one third of its\nlength are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or\nsoon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly\nall its remaining length are merely surveyors\u2019 lines, over\nwhich people may walk back and forth without any\nconsciousness of their presence. No part of this line can be\nmade any more di\ufb00icult to pass by writing it down on paper\nor parchment as a national boundary. The fact of\n separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding\nsection the fugitive-slave clause along with all other\nconstitutional obligations upon the section seceded from,\nwhile I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be\nmade to take its place.\nBut there is another di\ufb00iculty. The great interior region\nbounded east by the Alleghenies, north by the British\ndominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the\nline along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and\nwhich includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of\nKentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois,\nMissouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of\nDakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above\n,, people, and will have ,, within \ufb01fty\nyears if not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It\ncontains more than one third of the country owned by the\nUnited States \u2014 certainly more than ,, square\nmiles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it\nwould have more than ,, people. A glance at the\nmap shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great body\nof the Republic. The other parts are but marginal borders\nto it, the magni\ufb01cent region sloping west from the Rocky\nMountains to the Paci\ufb01c being the deepest and also the\nrichest in undeveloped resources. In the production of\nprovisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from\nthem this great interior region is naturally one of the most\nimportant in the world. Ascertain from statistics the small\nproportion of the region which has yet been brought into\ncultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing\n amount of products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the\nmagnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region\nhas no seacoast \u2014 touches no ocean anywhere. As part of\none nation, its people now \ufb01nd, and may forever \ufb01nd, their\nway to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa\nby New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco; but separate\nour common country into two nations, as designed by the\npresent rebellion, and every man of this great interior\nregion is thereby cut o\ufb00 from some one or more of these\noutlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier, but by\nembarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\nAnd this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line\nmay be \ufb01xed. Place it between the now free and slave\ncountry, or place it south of Kentucky or north of Ohio, and\nstill the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any\nport or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to\nany port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by\na government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west,\nand south, are indispensable to the well-being of the people\ninhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region. Which of\nthe three may be the best is no proper question. All are\nbetter than either, and all of right belong to that people and\nto their successors forever. True to themselves, they will\nnot ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow\nrather that there shall be no such line.\nNor are the marginal regions less interested in these\ncommunications to and through them to the great outside\nworld. They, too, and each of them, must have access to this\n Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any\nnational boundary.\nOur national strife springs not from our permanent part;\nnot from the land we inhabit; not from our national\nhomestead. There is no possible severing of this but would\nmultiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its\nadaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors\nseparation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion,\nhowever much of blood and treasure the separation might\nhave cost.\nOur strife pertains to ourselves \u2014 to the passing\ngenerations of men \u2014 and it can without convulsion be\nhushed forever with the passing of one generation.\nIn this view I recommend the adoption of the following\nresolution and articles amendatory to the Constitution of\nthe United States:\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of\nthe United States of America, in Congress assembled, (two\nthirds of both Houses concurring), That the following\narticles be proposed to the Legislatures (or conventions) of\nthe several States as amendments to the Constitution of the\nUnited States, all or any of which articles, when rati\ufb01ed by\nthree fourths of the said Legislatures (or conventions), to\nbe valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, viz.\nART. \u2014 Every State wherein slavery now exists which\nshall abolish the same therein at any time or times before\nthe \nst \nday \nof \nJanuary, \nA.D. \n, \nshall \nreceive\ncompensation from the United States as follows, to wit:\n The President of the United States shall deliver to every\nsuch State bonds of the United States bearing interest at\nthe rate of \u2014 per cent. per annum to an amount equal to\nthe aggregate sum of \u2014\u2014 \u2014 for each slave shown to have\nbeen therein by the Eighth Census of the United States,\nsaid bonds to be delivered to such State by instalments or\nin one parcel at the completion of the abolishment,\naccordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one\ntime within such State; and interest shall begin to run upon\nany such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as\naforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid\nand afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein\nshall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or\nthe value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.\nART. \u2014 All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom\nby the chances of the war at any time before the end of the\nrebellion shall be forever free; but all owners of such who\nshall not have been disloyal shall be compensated for them\nat the same rates as is provided for States adopting\nabolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall\nbe twice accounted for.\nART. \u2014 Congress may appropriate money and otherwise\nprovide for colonizing free colored persons with their own\nconsent at any place or places without the United States.\nI beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at\nsome length. Without slavery the rebellion could never\nhave existed; without slavery it could not continue.\nAmong the friends of the Union there is great diversity of\nsentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the African\n race amongst us. Some would perpetuate slavery; some\nwould abolish it suddenly and without compensation; some\nwould abolish it gradually and with compensation; some\nwould remove the freed people from us, and some would\nretain them with us; and there are yet other minor\ndiversities. Because of these diversities we waste much\nstrength \nin \nstruggles \namong \nourselves. \nBy \nmutual\nconcession we should harmonize and act together. This\nwould be compromise, but it would be compromise among\nthe friends and not with the enemies of the Union. These\narticles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual\nconcessions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that\nemancipation will follow, at least in several of the States.\nAs to the \ufb01rst article, the main points are, \ufb01rst, the\nemancipation; \nsecondly, \nthe \nlength \nof \ntime \nfor\nconsummating it (thirty-seven years); and, thirdly, the\ncompensation.\nThe emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates\nof perpetual slavery, but the length of time should greatly\nmitigate their dissatisfaction. The time spares both races\nfrom the evils of sudden derangement \u2014 in fact, from the\nnecessity of any derangement \u2014 while most of those whose\nhabitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure\nwill have passed away before its consummation. They will\nnever see it. Another class will hail the prospect of\nemancipation, but will deprecate the length of time. They\nwill feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves. But\nit really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant\ndestitution \nwhich \nmust \nlargely \nattend \nimmediate\n emancipation in localities where their numbers are very\ngreat, and it gives the inspiring assurance that their\nposterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each\nState choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at\nthe end of the century, or at any intermediate tune, or by\ndegrees extending over the whole or any part of the period,\nand it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also\nprovides for compensation, and generally the mode of\nmaking it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the\ndissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and\nespecially of those who are to receive the compensation.\nDoubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive\nwill object. Yet the measure is both just and economical. In\na certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of\nproperty \u2014 property acquired by descent or by purchase,\nthe same as any other property. It is no less true for having\nbeen often said that the people of the South are not more\nresponsible for the original introduction of this property\nthan are the people of the North; and when it is\nremembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and\nsugar and share the pro\ufb01ts of dealing in them, it may not\nbe quite safe to say that the South has been more\nresponsible than the North for its continuance. If, then, for\na common object this property is to be sacri\ufb01ced, is it not\njust that it be done at a common charge?\nAnd if with less money, or money more easily paid, we\ncan preserve the bene\ufb01ts of the Union by this means than\nwe can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it?\nLet us consider it, then. Let us ascertain the sum we have\n expended in the war Since compensated emancipation was\nproposed last March, and consider whether if that measure\nhad been promptly accepted by even some of the slave\nStates the same sum would not have done more to close the\nwar than has been otherwise done. If so, the measure\nwould save money, and in that view would be a prudent and\neconomical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay\nsomething as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a\nlarge sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to\npay any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we\nare able. The war requires large sums, and requires them\nat once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated\nemancipation of course would be large. But it would\nrequire no ready cash, nor the bonds even any faster than\nthe emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably\nwould not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At\nthat time we shall probably have a hundred millions of\npeople to share the burden, instead of thirty-one millions as\nnow. And not only so, but the increase of our population\nmay be expected to continue for a long time after that\nperiod as rapidly as before, because our territory will not\nhave become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the\nsame ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an\naverage, from our \ufb01rst national census, in , until that\nof , we should in  have a population of\n,,. And why may we not continue that ratio far\nbeyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad\nnational homestead, is our ample resource. Were our\nterritory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly\n our population could not expand as stated. Instead of\nreceiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled\nto send part of the native born away. But such is not our\ncondition. We have ,, square miles. Europe has\n,,, with a population averaging  persons to the\nsquare mile. Why may not our country at some time\naverage as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste\nsurface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other\ncauses? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage?\nIf, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe,\nhow soon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the\npast and the present; as to when it will be, if ever, depends\nmuch on whether we maintain the Union...............\n[a page of tables of projected statistics]\nThese \ufb01gures show that our country may be as populous\nas Europe now is at some point between  and ,\nsay about  \u2014 our territory, at  persons to the square\nmile, being of capacity to contain ,,.\nAnd we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves\nrelinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or\nby long and exhausting war springing from the only great\nelement of national discord among us. While it cannot be\nforeseen exactly how much one huge example of secession,\nbreeding lesser ones inde\ufb01nitely, would retard population,\ncivilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the\nextent of it would be very great and injurious.\nThe proposed emancipation would shorten the war,\nperpetuate peace, insure this increase of population, and\nproportionately the wealth of the country. With these we\n should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with\nour other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\nwithout it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at\nsix per cent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of\nour revolutionary struggle until to-day, without paying\nanything on either principal or interest, each man of us\nwould owe less upon that debt now than each man owed\nupon it then; and this because our increase of men through\nthe whole period has been greater than six per cent. \u2014 has\nrun faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus time alone\nrelieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases\nfaster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt.\nThis fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of\nwhat is justly due, but it shows the great importance of\ntime in this connection \u2014 the great advantage of a policy\nby which we shall not have to pay until we number\n,, what by a di\ufb00erent policy we would have to\npay now, when we number but ,,. In a word, it\nshows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war\nthan will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan.\nAnd then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It\nwill be a saving of both.\nAs to the second article, I think it would be impracticable\nto return to bondage the class of persons therein\ncontemplated. Some of them, doubtless, in the property\nsense belong to loyal owners, and hence Provision is made\nin this article for compensating such.\nThe third article relates to the future of the freed people.\nIt does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in\n colonizing such as may consent. This ought nut to be\nregarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other,\ninsomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual\nconsent of the people to be deported and the American\nvoters through their representatives in Congress.\nI cannot make it better known than it already is that I\nstrongly favor colonization; and yet I wish to say there is an\nobjection urged against free colored persons remaining in\nthe country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes\nmalicious.\nIt is insisted that their presence would injure and\ndisplace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could\nbe a proper time for mere catch arguments that time surely\nis not now. In times like the present men should utter\nnothing for which they would not willingly be responsible\nthrough time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored\npeople can displace any more white labor by being free\nthan by remaining slaves? If they stay in their old places,\nthey jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places,\nthey leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is\nneither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without\ndeportation, would probably enhance the wages of white\nlabor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the\ncustomary amount of labor would still have to be\nperformed. The freed people would surely not do more than\ntheir old proportion of it, and very probably for a time\nwould do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers,\nbringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently\nenhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a\n limited \nextent, \nenhanced \nwages \nto \nwhite \nlabor \nis\nmathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity\nin the market-increase the demand for it and you increase\nthe price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor by\ncolonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by\nprecisely so much you increase the demand for and wages\nof white labor.\nBut it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth\nand cover the whole land. Are they not already in the land?\nWill liberation make them any more numerous? Equally\ndistributed among the whites of the whole country, and\nthere would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the\none in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many\ncommunities now having more than one free colored\nperson to seven whites, and this without any apparent\nconsciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia and\nthe States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this\ncondition. The District has more than one free colored to\nsix whites, and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I\nbelieve it has never presented the presence of free colored\npersons as one of its grievances. But why should\nemancipation South send the free people North? People of\nany color seldom run unless there be something to run\nfrom. Heretofore colored people to some extent have \ufb02ed\nNorth from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage\nand \ndestitution. \nBut \nif \ngradual \nemancipation \nand\ndeportation be adopted, they will have neither to \ufb02ee from.\nTheir old masters will give them wages at least until new\nlaborers can be procured, and the freedmen in turn will\n gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be\nfound for them in congenial climes and with people of their\nown blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the\nmutual interests involved. And in any event, cannot the\nNorth decide for itself whether to receive them?\nAgain, as practice proves more than theory in any case,\nhas there been any irruption of colored people northward\nbecause of the abolishment of slavery in this District last\nspring?\nWhat I have said of the proportion of free colored\npersons to the whites in the District is from the census of\n, having no reference to persons called contrabands\nnor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing\nslavery here.\nThe plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not\nbut that a restoration of the national authority would be\naccepted without its adoption.\nNor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation\nof September , , be stayed because of the\nrecommendation of this plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt\nnot, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.\nAnd notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that\nCongress provide by law for compensating any State which\nmay adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been\nacted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be\nonly an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments\napply to both.\nThis plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion\nof, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving\n the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is\npresented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan\nwould, I am con\ufb01dent, secure peace more speedily and\nmaintain it more permanently than can be done by force\nalone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and\nmanner of payment and times of payment, would be easier\npaid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely\nsolely upon force. It is much, very much, that it would cost\nno blood at all.\nThe plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It\ncannot become such without the concurrence of, \ufb01rst, two\nthirds of Congress, and afterwards three fourths of the\nStates. The requisite three fourths of the States will\nnecessarily include seven of the slave States. Their\nconcurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their\nseverally adopting emancipation at no very distant day\nupon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would\nend the struggle now and save the Union forever.\nI do not forget the gravity which should characterize a\npaper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the chief\nmagistrate of the nation, nor do I forget that some of you\nare my seniors, nor that many of you have more experience\nthan I in the conduct of public a\ufb00airs. Yet I trust that in\nview of the great responsibility resting upon me you will\nperceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue\nearnestness I may seem to display.\nIs it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted,\nwould shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of\nmoney and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the\n national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate\nboth inde\ufb01nitely? Is it doubted that we here \u2014 Congress\nand executive \u2014 can secure its adoption? Will not the good\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?\nCan we, can they, by any other means so certainly or so\nspeedily assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by\nconcert. It is not \u201cCan any of us imagine better?\u201d but \u201cCan\nwe all do better?\u201d Object whatsoever is possible, still the\nquestion recurs, \u201cCan we do better?\u201d The dogmas of the\nquiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The\noccasion is piled high with di\ufb00iculty, and we must rise with\nthe occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew\nand act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we\nshall save our country.\nFellow-citizens, we can not escape history. We of this\nCongress and this administration will be remembered in\nspite \nof \nourselves. \nNo \npersonal \nsigni\ufb01cance \nor\ninsigni\ufb01cance can spare one or another of us. The \ufb01ery trial\nthrough which we pass will light us down in honor or\ndishonor to the latest generation. We say we are for the\nUnion. The world will not forget that we say this. We know\nhow to save the Union. The world knows we do know how\nto save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the\nresponsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we assure\nfreedom to the free \u2014 honorable alike in what we give and\nwhat we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the\nlast, best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this\ncould not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just \u2014 a\n way which if followed the world will forever applaud and\nGod must forever bless.\nA. LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  \n    .\nWASHINGTON, December , .\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\nOn the d of November, , a collision took place o\ufb00\nthe coast of Cuba between the United States war steamer\nSan Jacinto and the French brig Jules et Marie, resulting in\nserious damage to the latter. The obligation of this\nGovernment to make amends therefor could not be\nquestioned if the injury resulted from any fault On the part\nof the San Jacinto. With a view to ascertain this, the subject\nwas referred to a commission of the United States and\nFrench naval o\ufb00icers at New York, with a naval o\ufb00icer of\nItaly as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived at was that the\ncollision was occasioned by the failure of the San Jacinto\nseasonably to reverse her engine. It then became necessary\nto ascertain the amount of indemni\ufb01cation due to the\ninjured party. The United States consul-general at Havana\nwas consequently instructed to confer with the consul of\nFrance on this point, and they have determined that the\nsum of  , is an equitable allowance under the\ncircumstances.\nI recommend an appropriation of this sum for the bene\ufb01t\nof the owners of the Jules et Marie.\n A copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of\nthe United States at Havana, to the Secretary of State on\nthe subject is herewith transmitted.\nA.

I do not now\nremember, nor have I time to recall, exactly what the\nconditions were, nor whether they were completely\nperformed; but there can be in no case any harm [in] his\nhaving a full and fair hearing, and I sincerely wish it may\nbe given him.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  H    \nA  .\nDecember , .\nTO \nTHE \nSENATE \nOF THE UNITED STATES: In\ncompliance with your resolution of December , ,\nrequesting the President \u201cto furnish the Senate with all\ninformation in his possession touching the late Indian\nbarbarities in the State of Minnesota, and also the evidence\nin his possession upon which some of the principal actors\nand head men were tried and condemned to death,\u201d I have\nthe honor to state that on receipt of said resolution, I\ntransmitted the same to the Secretary of the Interior,\naccompanied by a note, a copy of which is herewith\ninclosed, marked A, and in response to which I received,\nthrough that department, a letter of the Commissioner of\nIndian A\ufb00airs, a copy of which is herewith inclosed, marked\nB.\nI further state that on the eighth day of November last I\nreceived a long telegraphic despatch from Major-General\nPope, at St. Paul, Minnesota, simply announcing the names\nof the persons sentenced to be hanged. I immediately\ntelegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all cases\nforwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach\nme until two or three days before the present meeting of\nCongress. Meantime I received, through telegraphic\n despatches and otherwise, appeals in behalf of the\ncondemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions of\nopinion as to the proper policy in regard to them and to the\nIndians generally in that vicinity, none of which, as I\nunderstand, falls within the scope of your inquiry. After the\narrival of the transcripts of records, but before I had\nsu\ufb00icient opportunity to examine them, I received a joint\nletter \nfrom \none \nof \nthe \nsenators \nand \ntwo \nof \nthe\nrepresentatives from Minnesota, which contains some\nstatements of fact not found in the records of the trials, and\nfor which reason I herewith transmit a copy, marked C. I\nalso, for the same reason, inclose a printed memorial of the\ncitizens of St. Paul, addressed to me, and forwarded with\nthe letter aforesaid.\nAnxious to not act with so much clemency as to\nencourage another outbreak on the one hand, nor with so\nmuch severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I caused a\ncareful examination of the records of trials to be made, in\nview of \ufb01rst ordering the execution of such as had been\nproved guilty of violating females. Contrary to my\nexpectation, only two of this class were found. I then\ndirected a further examination and a classi\ufb01cation of all\nwho were proven to have participated in massacres, as\ndistinguished from participation in battles. This class\nnumbered forty, and included the two convicted of female\nviolation. One of the number is strongly recommended, by\nthe commission which tried them, for commutation to ten\nyears imprisonment I have ordered the other thirty-nine to\nbe executed on Friday the th instant. The order was\n despatched from here on Monday, the th instant, by a\nmessenger to General Sibley, and a copy of which order is\nherewith transmitted, marked D.\nAn abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith\ninclosed, marked E.\nTo avoid the immense amount of copying, I lay before the\nSenate the original transcripts of the records of trials, as\nreceived by me.\nThis is as full and complete a response to the resolution\nas it is in my power to make.\nA. LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  \n    .\nDecember , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: I have in my possession three\nvaluable swords, formerly the property of General David E.\nTwiggs, which I now place at the disposal of Congress.\nThey are forwarded to me from New Orleans by Major-\nGeneral Benjamin F. Butler. If they or any of them shall be\nby Congress disposed of in reward or compliment of\nmilitary service, I think General Butler is entitled to the\n\ufb01rst consideration. A copy of the General\u2019s letter to me\naccompanying the swords is herewith transmitted.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n    \nA\n \n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON DECEMBER ,\n.\nHON. FERNANDO WOOD.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your letter of the th, with the\naccompanying note of same date, was received yesterday.\nThe most important paragraph in the letter, as I consider, is\nin these words:\n\u201cOn the th of November last I was advised by an\nauthority which I deemed likely to be well informed, as well\nas reliable and truthful, that the Southern States would\nsend representatives to the next Congress, provided that a\nfull and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No\nguarantee or terms were asked for other than the amnesty\nreferred to.\u201d\nI strongly suspect your information will prove to be\ngroundless; nevertheless, I thank you for communicating it\nto me. Understanding the phrase in the paragraph just\nquoted\u2014 \u201cthe Southern States would send representatives\nto the next Congress\u201d \u2014 to be substantially the same as\nthat \u201cthe people of the Southern States would cease\nresistance, and would reinaugurate, submit to, and\nmaintain the national authority within the limits of such\nStates, under the Constitution of the United States,\u201d I say\n that in such case the war would cease on the part of the\nUnited States; and that if within a reasonable time \u201ca full\nand general amnesty\u201d were necessary to such end, it would\nnot be withheld.\nI do not think it would be proper now to communicate\nthis, formally or informally, to the people of the Southern\nStates. My belief is that they already know it; and when\nthey choose, if ever, they can communicate with me\nunequivocally. Nor do I think it proper now to suspend\nmilitary operations to try any experiment of negotiation.\nI should nevertheless receive with great pleasure the\nexact information you now have, and also such other as you\nmay in any way obtain. Such information might be more\nvaluable before the st of January than afterwards.\nWhile there is nothing in this letter which I shall dread to\nsee in history, it is, perhaps, better for the present that its\nexistence should not become public. I therefore have to\nrequest that you will regard it as con\ufb01dential.\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

The day I telegraphed you\nsuspending the order in relation to Dr. McPheeters, he,\nwith Mr. Bates, the Attorney-General, appeared before me\nand left with me a copy of the order mentioned. The doctor\nalso showed me the Copy of an oath which he said he had\ntaken, which is indeed very strong and speci\ufb01c. He also\nverbally assured me that he had constantly prayed in\nchurch for the President and government, as he had always\ndone before the present war. In looking over the recitals in\nyour order, I do not see that this matter of the prayer, as he\nstates it, is negatived, nor that any violation of his oath is\ncharged nor, in fact, that anything speci\ufb01c is alleged\nagainst him. The charges are all general: that he has a\nrebel wife and rebel relations, that he sympathies with\nrebels, and that he exercises rebel in\ufb02uence. Now, after\ntalking with him, I tell you frankly I believe he does\nsympathize with the rebels, but the question remains\nwhether such a man, of unquestioned good moral\ncharacter, who has taken such an oath as he has, and\ncannot even be charged with violating it, and who can be\n charged with no other speci\ufb01c act or omission, can, with\nsafety to the government, be exiled upon the suspicion of\nhis secret sympathies. But I agree that this must be left to\nyou, who are on the spot; and if, after all, you think the\npublic good requires his removal, my suspension of the\norder is withdrawn, only with this quali\ufb01cation, that the\ntime during the suspension is not to be counted against\nhim. I have promised him this. But I must add that the\nUnited States Government must not, as by this order,\nundertake to run the churches. When an individual in a\nchurch or out of it becomes dangerous to the public\ninterest, he must be checked; but let the churches, as such,\ntake care of themselves. It will not do for the United States\nto appoint trustees, supervisors, or other agents for the\nchurches.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\nP. S. \u2014 The committee composed of Messrs. Yeatman and\nFilley (Mr. Broadhead not attending) has presented your\nletter and the memorial of sundry citizens. On the whole\nsubject embraced exercise your best judgment, with a sole\nview to the public interest, and I will not interfere without\nhearing you.\nA. LINCOLN., January , .\n  \n       A   \n     .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January , .\nHON. GIDEON WELLES, Secretary of the Navy.\nDEAR SIR: \u2014 As many persons who come well\nrecommended for loyalty and service to the Union cause,\nand who are refugees from rebel oppression in the State of\nVirginia, make application to me for authority and\npermission to remove their families and property to\nprotection within the Union lines, by means of our armed\ngunboats on the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay, you\nare hereby requested to hear and consider all such\napplications, and to grant such assistance to this class of\npersons as in your judgment their merits may render\nproper, and as may in each case be consistent with the\nperfect and complete e\ufb00iciency of the naval service and\nwith military expediency.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A   .    \n  I .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January , \nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 I am having a good deal of trouble with\nMissouri matters, and I now sit down to write you\nparticularly about it. One class of friends believe in greater\nseverity and another in greater leniency in regard to\narrests, banishments, and assessments. As usual in such\ncases, each questions the other\u2019s motives. On the one hand,\nit is insisted that Governor Gamble\u2019s unionism, at most, is\nnot better than a secondary spring of action; that\nhunkerism and a wish for political in\ufb02uence stand before\nUnionism with him. On the other hand, it is urged that\narrests, banishments, and assessments are made more for\nprivate malice, revenge, and pecuniary interest than for the\npublic good. This morning I was told, by a gentleman who I\nhave no doubt believes what he says, that in one case of\nassessments for  , the di\ufb00erent persons who paid\ncompared receipts, and found they had paid  ,. If this\nbe true, the inference is that the collecting agents pocketed\nthe odd  ,. And true or not in the instance, nothing\nbut the sternest necessity can justify the making and\nmaintaining of a system so liable to such abuses. Doubtless\nthe necessity for the making of the system in Missouri did\n exist, and whether it continues for the maintenance of it is\nnow a practical and very important question. Some days\nago Governor Gamble telegraphed me, asking that the\nassessments outside of St. Louis County might be\nsuspended, as they already have been within it, and this\nmorning all the members of Congress here from Missouri\nbut one laid a paper before me asking the same thing. Now,\nmy belief is that Governor Gamble is an honest and true\nman, not less so than yourself; that you and he could confer\ntogether on this and other Missouri questions with great\nadvantage to the public; that each knows something which\nthe other does not; and that acting together you could\nabout double your stock of pertinent information. May I not\nhope that you and he will attempt this? I could at once\nsafely do (or you could safely do without me) whatever you\nand he agree upon. There is absolutely no reason why you\nshould not agree.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\nP. S. \u2014 I forgot to say that Hon. James S. Rollins, member\nof Congress from one of the Missouri districts, wishes that,\nupon his personal responsibility, Rev. John M. Robinson, of\nColumbia, Missouri; James L. Matthews, of Boone County,\nMissouri; and James L. Stephens, also of Boone County,\nMissouri, may be allowed to return to their respective\nhomes. Major Rollins leaves with me very strong papers\nfrom the neighbors of these men, whom he says he knows\nto be true men.

There is much\nhazard in it, as there always is in the majority of military\nmovements, and I cannot begin the movement without\ngiving you notice of it, particularly as I know so little of the\ne\ufb00ect that it may have upon other movements of distant\narmies.\nThe in\ufb02uence of your telegram the other day is still upon\nme, and has impressed me with the idea that there are\nmany parts of the problem which in\ufb02uence you that are not\nknown to me.\nIn order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my\ncase, I inclose with this my resignation of my commission\nas major-general of volunteers, which you can have\n accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the\nviews of yourself and your military advisers.\nI have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon\nthis subject, because it was necessary, as I learned from\nGeneral Halleck, for you to approve of my general plan,\nwritten at Warrenton, before I could commence the\nmovement; and I think it quite as necessary that you should\nknow of the important movement I am about to make,\nparticularly as it will have to be made in opposition to the\nviews of nearly all my general o\ufb00icers, and after the receipt\nof a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of some\nof them who had visited you.\nIn conversation with you on New Year\u2019s morning I was\nled to express some opinions which I afterward felt it my\nduty to place on paper, and to express them verbally to the\ngentleman of whom we were speaking, which I did in your\npresence, after handing you the letter. You were not\ndisposed then, as I saw, to retain the letter, and I took it\nback, but I now return it to you for record if you wish it.\nI beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in\nany spirit of insubordination, but, as I before said, simply to\nrelieve \nyou \nfrom \nany \nembarrassment \nin \nchanging\ncommanders where lack of con\ufb01dence may have rendered\nit necessary.\nThe bearer of this will bring me any answer, or I should\nbe glad to hear from you by telegraph in cipher.\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient\nservant,\nA. E. BURNSIDE,\n Major-General, Commanding Army of the Potomac.\n H A\n A      \n   H  A \n   \nA HI\n \n anuar         .\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Commanding, etc.,\nFalmouth: \nGENERAL: \u2014 YOUR communication of the th was\ndelivered to me by your aide-de-camp at  M. to-day.\nIn all my communications and interviews with you since\nyou took command of the Army of the Potomac I have\nadvised a forward movement across the Rappahannock. At\nour interview at Warrenton I urged that you should cross by\nthe fords above Fredericksburg rather than to fall down to\nthat place; and when I left you at Warrenton it was\nunderstood that at least a considerable part of your army\nwould cross by the fords, and I so represented to the\nPresident. It was this modi\ufb01cation of the plan proposed by\nyou that I telegraphed you had received his approval. When\nthe attempt at Fredericksburg was abandoned, I advised\nyou to renew the attempt at some other point, either in\nwhole or in part, to turn the enemy\u2019s works, or to threaten\ntheir wings or communications; in other words, to keep the\nenemy occupied till a favorable opportunity o\ufb00ered to\nstrike a decisive blow. I particularly advised you to use your\ncavalry and light artillery upon his communications, and\nattempt to cut o\ufb00 his supplies and engage him at an\nadvantage.\n In all our interviews I have urged that our \ufb01rst object\nwas, not Richmond, but the defeat or scattering of Lee\u2019s\narmy, which threatened Washington and the line of the\nupper Potomac. I now recur to these things simply to\nremind you of the general views which I have expressed,\nand which I still hold.\nThe circumstances of the case, however, have somewhat\nchanged since the early part of November. The chances of\nan extended line of operations are now, on account of the\nadvanced season, much less than then. But the chances are\nstill in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the\nRappahannock, if we can e\ufb00ect a crossing in a position\nwhere we can meet the enemy on favorable or even equal\nterms. I therefore still advise a movement against him. The\ncharacter of that movement, however, must depend upon\ncircumstances which may change any day and almost any\nhour. If the enemy should concentrate his forces at the\nplace you have selected for a crossing, make it a feint and\ntry another place. Again, the circumstances at the time may\nbe such as to render an attempt to cross the entire army\nnot advisable. In that case, theory suggests that, while the\nenemy concentrates at that point, advantages can be\ngained by crossing smaller forces at other points to cut o\ufb00\nhis lines, destroy his communication, and capture his rear-\nguards, outposts, etc. The great object is to occupy the\nenemy to prevent his making large detachments or distant\nraids, and to injure him all you can with the least injury to\nyourself. If this can be best accomplished by feints of a\ngeneral crossing and detached real crossings, take that\n course; if by an actual general crossing, with feints on\nother points, adopt that course. There seem to me to be\nmany reasons why a crossing at some point should be\nattempted. It will not do to keep your large army inactive.\nAs you yourself admit, it devolves on you to decide upon the\ntime, place, and character of the crossing which you may\nattempt. I can only advise that an attempt be made, and as\nearly as possible.\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant, H. W. HALLECK,\nGeneral-in-Chief.\n[Indorsement.]\nJanuary , .\nGENERAL BURNSIDE: I understand General Halleck has\nsent you a letter of which this is a copy. I approve this\nletter. I deplore the want of concurrence with you in\nopinion by your general o\ufb00icers, but I do not see the\nremedy. Be cautious, and do not understand that the\ngovernment or country is driving you. I do not yet see how I\ncould pro\ufb01t by changing the command of the Army of the\nPotomac; and if I did, I should not wish to do it by\naccepting the resignation of your commission.\nA.

On the th day of December, , General\nPedro Alcantara Herran, who had been duly accredited,\nwas received here as the envoy extraordinary and minister\nplenipotentiary of that, republic. On the th day of August,\n, Senor Don Rafael Rivas was received by this\n government as charge d\u2019a\ufb00aires of the same republic. On\nthe th day of December, , a consular convention was\nconcluded between that republic and the United States,\nwhich treaty was signed on behalf of the Republic of\nGranada by the same Senor Rivas. This treaty is still in\nforce. On the th of April, , Senor Don Victoriano de\nDiego Paredes was received as charge d\u2019a\ufb00aires of the\nRepublic of New Granada. On the th of June, ,\nGeneral Pedro Alcantara Herran was again received as\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, duly\naccredited by the Republic of New Granada, and he has\never since remained, under the same credentials, as the\nrepresentative of that republic near the Government of the\nUnited States. On the th of September, , a claims\nconvention was concluded between the United States and\nthe Republic of Granada. This convention is still in force,\nand has in part been executed. In May, , the\nconstitution of the republic was remodelled; and the nation\nassumed the political title of \u201cThe Granadian Confederacy.\u201d\nThis fact was formally announced to this Government, but\nwithout any change in their representative here. Previously\nto the th day of March, , a revolutionary war against\nthe Republic of New Granada, which had thus been\nrecognized and treated with by the United States, broke\nout in New Granada, assuming to set up a new government\nunder the name of \u201cUnited States of Colombia.\u201d This war\nhas \nhad \nvarious \nvicissitudes, \nsometimes \nfavorable,\nsometimes adverse, to the revolutionary movements. The\nrevolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a\n military provisionary power, and no de\ufb01nitive constitution\nof government has yet been established in New Granada in\nplace of that organized by the constitution of . The\nminister of the United States to the Granadian Confederacy,\nwho was appointed on the th day of May, , was\ndirected, in view of the occupation of the capital by the\nrevolutionary party and of the uncertainty of the civil war,\nnot to present his credentials to either the government of\nthe Granadian Confederacy or to the provisional military\ngovernment, but to conduct his a\ufb00airs informally, as is\ncustomary in such cases, and to report the progress of\nevents and await the instructions of this Government. The\nadvices which have been received from him have not\nhitherto, been su\ufb00iciently conclusive to determine me to\nrecognize the revolutionary government. General Herran\nbeing here, with full authority from the Government of New\nCanada, which has been so long recognized by the United\nStates, I have not received any representative from the\nrevolutionary \ngovernment, \nwhich \nhas \nnot \nyet \nbeen\nrecognized, because such a proceeding would be in itself\nan act of recognition.\nO\ufb00icial communications have been had on various\nincidental and occasional questions with General Herran as\nthe minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary of the\nGranadian Confederacy, but in no other character. No\nde\ufb01nitive measure or proceeding has resulted from these\ncommunications, and a communication of them at present\nwould not, in my judgment, be compatible with the public\ninterest.\n A. LINCOLN.\n  \n       A   \n  \nA .\nWASHINGTON, January , .\nSECRETARY OF WAR:\nPlease see Mr. Sta\ufb00ord, who wants to assist in raising\ncolored troops in Missouri.\nA. LINCOLN.\n   I\n I\n \n \nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\nJANUARY , .\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\nI have signed the joint resolution to provide for the\nimmediate payment of the army and navy of the United\nStates, passed by the House of Representatives on the th\nand by the Senate on the th instant.\nThe joint resolution is a simple authority, amounting,\nhowever, under existing circumstances, to a direction, to\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to make an additional issue of\n ,, in United States notes, if so much money is\nneeded, for the payment of the army and navy.\nMy approval is given in order that every possible facility\nmay be a\ufb00orded for the prompt discharge of all arrears of\npay due to our soldiers and our sailors.\nWhile giving this approval, however, I think it my duty to\nexpress my sincere regret that it has been found necessary\nto authorize so large an additional issue of United States\nnotes, when this circulation and that of the suspended\nbanks together have become already so redundant as to\nincrease prices beyond real values, thereby augmenting the\ncost of living to the injury of labor, and the cost of supplies\nto the injury of the whole country.\n It seems very plain that continued issues of United States\nnotes without any check to the issues of suspended banks,\nand without adequate provision for the raising of money by\nloans and for funding the issues so as to keep them within\ndue limits, must soon produce disastrous consequences;\nand this matter appears to me so important that I feel\nbound to avail myself of this occasion to ask the special\nattention of Congress to it.\nThat Congress has power to regulate the currency of the\ncountry can hardly admit of doubt, and that a judicious\nmeasure to prevent the deterioration of this currency, by a\nseasonable taxation of bank circulation or otherwise, is\nneeded seems equally clear. Independently of this general\nconsideration, it would be unjust to the people at large to\nexempt banks enjoying the special privilege of circulation\nfrom their just proportion of the public burdens.\nIn order to raise money by way of loans most easily and\ncheaply, it is clearly necessary to give every possible\nsupport to the public credit. To that end a uniform\ncurrency, in which taxes, subscriptions to loans, and all\nother ordinary public dues as well as all private dues may\nbe paid, is almost if not quite indispensable. Such a\ncurrency can be furnished by banking associations\norganized under a general act of Congress, as suggested in\nmy message at the beginning of the present session. The\nsecuring of this circulation by the pledge of United States\nbonds, as therein suggested, would still further facilitate\nloans, by increasing the present and causing a future\ndemand for such bonds.\n In view of the actual \ufb01nancial embarrassments of the\ngovernment, and of the greater embarrassment sure to\ncome if the necessary means of relief be not a\ufb00orded, I feel\nthat \nI \nshould \nnot \nperform \nmy \nduty \nby \na \nsimple\nannouncement of my approval of the joint resolution, which\nproposes relief only by increased circulation, without\nexpressing my earnest desire that measures such in\nsubstance as those I have just referred to may receive the\nearly sanction of Congress. By such measures, in my\nopinion, will payment be most certainly secured, not only to\nthe army and navy, but to all honest creditors of the\ngovernment, and satisfactory provision made for future\ndemands on the treasury.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n  H  \n  I\n \n \n \n  \nA\n H     \n \n A\n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January, .\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF MANCHESTER: I have the\nhonor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and\nresolutions which you sent me on the eve of the new year.\nWhen I came, on the th of March, , through a free\nand constitutional election to \ufb01reside in the Government of\nthe United States, the country was found at the verge of\ncivil war. Whatever might have been the cause, or\nwhosesoever the fault, one duty, paramount to all others,\nwas before me, namely, to maintain and preserve at once\nthe Constitution and the integrity of the Federal Republic.\nA conscientious purpose to perform this duty is the key to\nall the measures of administration which have been and to\nall which will hereafter be pursued. Under our frame of\ngovernment and my o\ufb00icial oath, I could not depart from\nthis purpose if I would. It is not always in the power of\ngovernments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral\nresults which follow the policies that they may deem it\nnecessary for the public safety from time to time to adopt.\nI have understood well that the duty of self-preservation\nrests solely with the American people; but I have at the\nsame time been aware that favor or disfavor of foreign\n nations might have a material in\ufb02uence in enlarging or\nprolonging the struggle with disloyal men in which the\ncountry is engaged. A fair examination of history has\nserved to authorize a belief that the past actions and\nin\ufb02uences of the United States were generally regarded as\nhaving been bene\ufb01cial toward mankind. I have, therefore,\nreckoned upon the forbearance of nations. Circumstances\n\u2014 to some of which you kindly allude \u2014 induce me\nespecially to expect that if justice and good faith should be\npractised by the United States, they would encounter no\nhostile in\ufb02uence on the part of Great Britain. It is now a\npleasant duty to acknowledge the demonstration you have\ngiven of your desire that a spirit of amity and peace toward\nthis country may prevail in the councils of your Queen, who\nis respected and esteemed in your own country only more\nthan she is by the kindred nation which has its home on\nthis side of the Atlantic.\nI know and deeply deplore the su\ufb00erings which the\nworkingmen at Manchester, and in all Europe, are called to\nendure in this crisis. It has been often and studiously\nrepresented \nthat \nthe \nattempt \nto \noverthrow \nthis\ngovernment, which was built upon the foundation of human\nrights, and to substitute for it one which should rest\nexclusively on the basis of human slavery, was likely to\nobtain the favor of Europe. Through the action of our\ndisloyal citizens, the working-men of Europe have been\nsubjected to severe trials, for the purpose of forcing their\nsanction to that attempt. Under the circumstance, I cannot\nbut regard your decisive utterances upon the question as\n an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not\nbeen surpassed in any age or in any country. It is indeed an\nenergetic and inspiring assurance of the inherent power of\ntruth and of the ultimate and universal triumph of justice,\nhumanity, and freedom. I do not doubt that the sentiments,\nyou have expressed will be sustained by your great nation;\nand, on the other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring you\nthat they will excite admiration, esteem, and the most\nreciprocal feelings of friendship among the American\npeople.\nI hail this interchange of sentiment, therefore, as an\naugury \nthat \nwhatever \nelse \nmay \nhappen, \nwhatever\nmisfortune may befall your country or my own, the peace\nand friendship which now exist between the two nations\nwill be, as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual.\nA.

They, however,\nwill do everything in their power to form a junction with\nyou at Vicksburg. If they should not be able to e\ufb00ect this,\nthey will at least occupy a portion of the enemy\u2019s forces,\nand prevent them from reinforcing Vicksburg. I hope,\nhowever, that they will do still better and be able to join\nyou.\nIt may be proper to give you some explanation of the\nrevocation of your order expelling all Jews from your\ndepartment. The President has no objection to your\nexpelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which, I suppose, was\nthe object of your order; but as it in terms proscribed an\n entire religious class, some of whom are \ufb01ghting in our\nranks, the President deemed it necessary to revoke it.\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant, H.

Of course I have done this upon what\nappear to me to be su\ufb00icient reasons, and yet I think it best\nfor you to know that there are some things in regard to\nwhich I am not quite satis\ufb01ed with you. I believe you to be\na brave and skillful soldier, which of course I like. I also\nbelieve you do not mix politics with your profession, in\nwhich you are right. You have con\ufb01dence in yourself, which\nis a valuable if not an indispensable quality. You are\nambitious, which within reasonable bounds does good\nrather than harm; but I think that during General\nBurnside\u2019s command of the army you have taken counsel of\nyour ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in\nwhich you did a great wrong to the country and to a most\nmeritorious and honorable brother o\ufb00icer. I have heard, in\nsuch a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that\nboth the army and the government needed a dictator. Of\ncourse it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given\nyou the command. Only those generals who gain successes\ncan set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military\n success, and I will risk the dictatorship. The government\nwill support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither\nmore nor less than it has done and will do for all\ncommanders. I much fear that the spirit that you have\naided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their\ncommander and withholding con\ufb01dence from him, will now\nturn upon you. I shall assist you as far as I can to put it\ndown. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again,\ncould get any good out of an army while such a spirit\nprevails in it. And now beware of rashness. Beware of\nrashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go\nforward and give us victories.\nYours very truly, A.

C., February , .\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES: On the th\nof September, , Commander George Henry Preble,\nUnited States Navy, then senior o\ufb00icer in command of the\nnaval force o\ufb00 the harbor of Mobile, was guilty of\ninexcusable neglect in permitting the armed steamer Oreto\nin open daylight to run the blockade. For his omission to\nperform his whole duty on that occasion, and the injury\nthereby in\ufb02icted on the service and the country, his name\nwas stricken from the list of naval o\ufb00icers and he was\ndismissed [from] the service.\nSince his dismissal earnest application has been made\nfor his restoration to his former position by senators and\nnaval o\ufb00icers, on the ground that his fault was an error of\njudgment, and that the example in his case has already had\nits e\ufb00ect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect.\nI therefore on this application and representation, and in\nconsideration of his previous fair record, do hereby\nnominate George Henry Preble to be a commander in the\nnavy from the th July, , to take rank on the active list\nnext after Commander Edward Donaldson, and to \ufb01ll a\nvacancy occasioned by the death of Commander J.

After his dismissal, and\nupon his assurance that the oath failed to reach him and his\nreadiness to execute it, he was recommissioned to his\noriginal position on the th September following. On the\nsame day, th September, he was ordered to command the\nsloop of war Vandalia; on the d this order was revoked\nand he was ordered to duty in the Mississippi Squadron,\nand on the d January, , was detached sick, and has\nsince remained unemployed. The advisory board under the\nact of th July, , did not recommend him for further\npromotion.\nThis last commission, having been issued during the\nrecess of the Senate, expired at the end of the succeeding\nsession, th July, , from which date, not having been\nnominated to the Senate, he ceased to be a commander in\nthe navy.\n To correct the omission to nominate this o\ufb00icer to the\nSenate at its last session, I now nominate Commander\nRoger Perry to be a commander in the navy from the th\nSeptember, , to take his relative position on the list of\ncommanders not recommended for further promotion.\nA.

In my opinion the country\nnow needs no speci\ufb01c thing so much as some man of your\nability and position to go to this work. When I speak of your\nposition, I mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave State\nand himself a slaveholder. The colored population is the\ngreat available and yet unavailed of force for restoring the\nUnion. The bare sight of \ufb01fty thousand armed and drilled\nblack soldiers upon the banks of the Mississippi would end\nthe rebellion at once; and who doubts that we can present\nthat sight if we but take hold in earnest? If you have been\nthinking of it, please do not dismiss the thought.\nYours very truly, A.

We have been the\nrecipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have\nbeen preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity.\nWe have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other\nnation has ever grown; but we have forgotten God. We have\nforgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace,\nand multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we\nhave vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts,\nthat all these blessings were produced by some superior\nwisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken\nsuccess, we have become too self-su\ufb00icient to feel the\nnecessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to\npray to the God that made us:\nIt behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the\no\ufb00ended Power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for\nclemency and forgiveness:\nNow, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully\nconcurring in the views, of the Senate, I do by this my\nproclamation designate and set apart Thursday, the th\nday of April, , as a day of national humiliation, fasting,\nand prayer. And I do hereby request all the people to\nabstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits,\nand to unite at their several places of public worship and\ntheir respective homes in keeping the day holy to the Lord,\nand devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties\nproper to that solemn occasion. All this being done in\nsincerity and truth, let us then rest humbly in the hope,\nauthorized by the divine teachings, that the united cry of\nthe nation will be heard on high, and answered with\n blessings no less than the pardon of our national sins, and\nthe restoration of our now divided and su\ufb00ering country to\nits former happy condition of unity and peace.\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\nDone at the city of Washington, this thirtieth day of\nMarch, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred\nand sixty-three, and of the independence of the United\nStates the eighty-seventh.\nA.

O\ufb00icial intelligence was made public\nearly yesterday morning that the enemy\u2019s iron-clad \ufb02eet\nhad attempted to cross the bar and failed, but later in the\nday it was announced that the gunboats and transports had\nsucceeded in crossing and were at anchor. Our iron-clads\nlay between the forts quietly awaiting the attack. Further\nintelligence is looked for with eager anxiety. The Yankees\nhave made no secret of this vast preparation for an attack\non Charleston, and we may well anticipate a desperate\ncon\ufb02ict. At last the hour of trial has come for Charleston,\nthe hour of deliverance or destruction, for no one believes\nthe other alternative, surrender, possible. The heart of the\nwhole country yearns toward the beleaguered city with\nintense solicitude, yet with hopes amounting to con\ufb01dence.\nCharleston knows what is expected of her, and which is due\nto her fame, and to the relation she sustains to the cause.\nThe devoted, the heroic, the great-hearted Beauregard is\nthere, and he, too, knows what is expected of him and will\nnot disappoint that expectation. We predict a Saragossa\n defense, and that if Charleston is taken it will be only a\nheap of ruins.\u201d\nThe rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our\npickets today that we had taken some rebel fort. This is not\nvery intelligible, and I think is entirely unreliable.\nA.

The rain and mud of\ncourse were to be calculated upon. General S. is not\nmoving rapidly enough to make the expedition come to\nanything. He has now been out three days, two of which\nwere unusually fair weather, and all three without\nhindrance from the enemy, and yet he is not twenty-\ufb01ve\nmiles from where he started. To reach his point he still has\nsixty to go, another river (the Rapidan) to cross, and will be\nhindered by the enemy. By arithmetic, how many days will\nit take him to do it? I do not know that any better can be\ndone, but I greatly fear it is another failure already. Write\nme often. I am very anxious.\nYours truly, A.

I therefore shall not complain if\nyou do no more for a time than to keep the enemy at bay\nand out of other mischief by menaces and occasional\ncavalry raids, if practicable, and to put your own army in\ngood condition again. Still, if in your own clear judgment\nyou can renew the attack successfully, I do not mean to\nrestrain you. Bearing upon this last point, I must tell you\nthat I have some painful intimations that some of your\ncorps and division commanders are not giving you their\nentire con\ufb01dence.

SCHOFIELD.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Having relieved General Curtis and\nassigned you to the command of the Department of the\nMissouri, I think it may be of some advantage for me to\nstate why I did it. I did not relieve General Curtis because\nof any full conviction that he had done wrong by\ncommission or omission. I did it because of a conviction in\nmy mind that the Union men of Missouri, constituting,\nwhen united, a vast majority of the whole people, have\nentered into a pestilent factional quarrel among themselves\n\u2014 General Curtis, perhaps not of choice, being the head of\none faction and Governor Gamble that of the other. After\nmonths of labor to reconcile the di\ufb00iculty, it seemed to\ngrow worse and worse, until I felt it my duty to break it up\nsomehow; and as I could not remove Governor Gamble, I\nhad to remove General Curtis. Now that you are in the\nposition, I wish you to undo nothing merely because\nGeneral Curtis or Governor Gamble did it, but to exercise\nyour own judgment, and do right for the public interest. Let\nyour military measures be strong enough to repel the\ninvader and keep the peace, and not so strong as to\nunnecessarily harass and persecute the people. It is a\n di\ufb00icult role, and so much greater will be the honor if you\nperform it well. If both factions, or neither, shall abuse you,\nyou will probably be about right. Beware of being assailed\nby one and praised by the other.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  H\n   .\nWASHINGTON, May , .

I have but one idea which I think worth suggesting to\nyou, and that is, in case you \ufb01nd Lee coming to the north of\nthe Rappahannock, I would by no means cross to the south\nof it. If he should leave a rear force at Fredericksburg,\ntempting you to fall upon it, it would \ufb01ght in entrenchments\nand have you at advantage, and so, man for man, worst you\nat that point, While his main force would in some way be\ngetting an advantage of you northward. In one word, I\nwould not take any risk of being entangled up on the river\nlike an ox jumped half over a fence and liable to be torn by\ndogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way\nor to kick the other.\nIf Lee would come to my side of the river I would keep on\nthe same side and \ufb01ght him, or act on the defensive,\naccording as might be my estimate of his strength\nrelatively to my own.

ERASTUS CORNING AND OTHERS.\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 Your letter of May , inclosing the\nresolutions of a public meeting held at Albany, New York,\non the th of the same month, was received several days\nago.\nThe resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable\ninto two propositions \u2014 \ufb01rst, the expression of a purpose to\nsustain the cause of the Union, to secure peace through\nvictory, and to support the administration in every\nconstitutional \nand \nlawful \nmeasure \nto \nsuppress \nthe\nrebellion; and, secondly, a declaration of censure upon the\nadministration for supposed unconstitutional action, such\nas the making of military arrests. And from the two\npropositions a third is deduced, which is that the\ngentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing\ntheir part to maintain our common government and\ncountry, despite the folly or wickedness, as they may\nconceive, of any administration. This position is eminently\npatriotic, \nand \nas \nsuch \nI \nthank \nthe \nmeeting, \nand\ncongratulate the nation for it. My own purpose is the same;\nso that the meeting and myself have a common object, and\n can have no di\ufb00erence, except in the choice of means or\nmeasures for e\ufb00ecting that object.\nAnd here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if\nthere \nwere \nno \napprehension \nthat \nmore \ninjurious\nconsequences than any merely personal to myself might\nfollow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing\nwhat, in my view of duty, I could not forbear. The\nresolutions promise to support me in every constitutional\nand lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and I have\nnot knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly employ, any\nother. But the meeting, by their resolutions, assert and\nargue that certain military arrests, and proceedings\nfollowing them, for which I am ultimately responsible, are\nunconstitutional. I think they are not. The resolutions quote\nfrom the Constitution the de\ufb01nition of treason, and also the\nlimiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the\ncitizen on trial for treason, and on his being held to answer\nfor capital or otherwise infamous crimes, and in criminal\nprosecutions his right to a speedy and public trial by an\nimpartial jury. They proceed to resolve \u201cthat these\nsafeguards of the rights of the citizen against the\npretensions of arbitrary power were intended more\nespecially for his protection in times of civil commotion.\u201d\nAnd, apparently to demonstrate the proposition, the\nresolutions proceed: \u201cThey were secured substantially to\nthe English people after years of protracted civil war, and\nwere adopted into our Constitution at the close of the\nRevolution.\u201d Would not the demonstration have been better\nif it could have been truly said that these safeguards had\n been adopted and applied during the civil wars and during\nour Revolution, instead of after the one and at the close of\nthe other? I too am devotedly for them after civil war, and\nbefore Civil war, and at all times, \u201cexcept when, in cases of\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require\u201d their\nsuspension. The resolutions proceed to tell us that these\nsafeguards \u201chave stood the test of seventy-six years of trial\nunder our republican system, under circumstances which\nshow that, while they constitute the foundation of all free\ngovernment, they are the elements of the enduring stability\nof the republic.\u201d No one denies that they have so stood the\ntest up to the beginning of the present rebellion, if we\nexcept a certain occurrence at New Orleans hereafter to be\nmentioned; nor does any one question that they will stand\nthe same test much longer after the rebellion closes. But\nthese provisions of the Constitution have no application to\nthe case we have in hand, because the arrests complained\nof were not made for treason \u2014 that is, not for the treason\nde\ufb01ned in the Constitution, and upon the conviction of\nwhich the punishment is death \u2014 nor yet were they made\nto hold persons to answer for any capital or otherwise\ninfamous crimes; nor were the proceedings following, in\nany constitutional or legal sense, \u201ccriminal prosecutions.\u201d\nThe arrests were made on totally di\ufb00erent grounds, and the\nproceedings following accorded with the grounds of the\narrests. Let us consider the real case with which we are\ndealing, and apply to it the parts of the Constitution plainly\nmade for such cases.\n Prior to my installation here it had been inculcated that\nany State had a lawful right to secede from the national\nUnion, and that it would be expedient to exercise the right\nwhenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a\npresident to their own liking. I was elected contrary to their\nliking; and accordingly, so far as it was legally possible,\nthey had taken seven States out of the Union, had seized\nmany of the United States forts, and had \ufb01red upon the\nUnited States \ufb02ag, all before I was inaugurated, and, of\ncourse, before I had done any o\ufb00icial act whatever. The\nrebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil war;\nand, in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms\nbetween the parties. The insurgents had been preparing for\nit more than thirty years, while the government had taken\nno steps to resist them. The former had carefully\nconsidered all the means which could be turned to their\naccount. It undoubtedly was a well-pondered reliance with\nthem that in their own unrestricted e\ufb00ort to destroy Union,\nConstitution and law, all together, the government would, in\ngreat degree, be restrained by the same Constitution and\nlaw from arresting their progress. Their sympathizers\ninvaded all departments of the government and nearly all\ncommunities of the people. From this material, under cover\nof \u201cliberty of speech,\u201d \u201cliberty of the press,\u201d and \u201chabeas\ncorpus,\u201d they hoped to keep on foot amongst us a most\ne\ufb00icient corps of spies, informers, suppliers, and aiders and\nabettors of their cause in a thousand ways. They knew that\nin times such as they were inaugurating, by the\nConstitution \nitself \nthe \n\u201chabeas \ncorpus\u201d \nmight \nbe\n suspended; but they also knew they had friends who would\nmake a question as to who was to suspend it; meanwhile\ntheir spies and others might remain at large to help on\ntheir cause. Or if, as has happened, the Executive should\nsuspend the writ without ruinous waste of time, instances\nof arresting innocent persons might occur, as are always\nlikely to occur in such cases; and then a clamor could be\nraised in regard to this, which might be at least of some\nservice to the insurgent cause. It needed no very keen\nperception to discover this part of the enemies program, so\nsoon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly put in\nmotion. Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the\nguaranteed rights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the\nstrong measures which by degrees I have been forced to\nregard as being within the exceptions of the Constitution,\nand as indispensable to the public safety. Nothing is better\nknown to history than that courts of justice are utterly\nincompetent to such cases. Civil courts are organized\nchie\ufb02y for trials of individuals \u2014 or, at most, a few\nindividuals acting in concert, and this in quiet times, and on\ncharges of crimes well de\ufb01ned in the law. Even in times of\npeace bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow\ntoo numerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of\njustice. But what comparison, in numbers have such bands\never borne to the insurgent sympathizers even in many of\nthe loyal States? Again, a jury too frequently has at least\none member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the\ntraitor. And yet again, he who dissuades one man from\nvolunteering, or induces one soldier to desert, weakens the\n Union cause as much as he who kills a Union soldier in\nbattle. Yet this dissuasion or inducement may be so\nconducted as to be no de\ufb01ned crime of which any civil\ncourt would take cognizance.\nOurs is a case of rebellion \u2014 so called by the resolutions\nbefore me \u2014 in fact, a clear, \ufb02agrant, and gigantic case of\nrebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that \u201cthe\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be\nsuspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion,\nthe public safety may require it,\u201d is the provision which\nspecially applies to our present case. This provision plainly\nattests \nthe \nunderstanding \nof \nthose \nwho \nmade \nthe\nConstitution that ordinary courts of justice are inadequate\nto \u201ccases of rebellion\u201d \u2014 attests their purpose that, in such\ncases, men may be held in custody whom the courts, acting\non ordinary rules, would discharge. Habeas corpus does\nnot discharge men who are proved to be guilty of de\ufb01ned\ncrime, and its suspension is allowed by the Constitution on\npurpose that men may be arrested and held who can not be\nproved to be guilty of de\ufb01ned crime, \u201cwhen, in cases of\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.\u201d\nThis is precisely our present case \u2014 a case of rebellion\nwherein the public safety does require the suspension \u2014\nIndeed, arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of\nrebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis.\nThe former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary\nand continuous perpetration of crime, while the latter is\ndirected at sudden and extensive uprisings against the\ngovernment, which, at most, will succeed or fail in no great\n length of time. In the latter case arrests are made not so\nmuch for what has been done as for what probably would\nbe done. The latter is more for the preventive and less for\nthe vindictive than the former. In such cases the purposes\nof men are much more easily understood than in cases of\nordinary crime. The man who stands by and says nothing\nwhen the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be\nmisunderstood. If not hindered, he is sure to help the\nenemy; much more if he talks ambiguously \u2014 talks for his\ncountry with \u201cbuts,\u201d and \u201cifs,\u201d and \u201cands.\u201d Of how little\nvalue the constitutional provision I have quoted will be\nrendered if arrests shall never be made until de\ufb01ned\ncrimes shall have been committed, may be illustrated by a\nfew notable examples: General John C. Breckinridge,\nGeneral Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston, General\nJohn B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General\nSimon B. Buckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan,\nnow occupying the very highest places in the rebel war\nservice, were all within the power of the government since\nthe rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be\ntraitors then as now. Unquestionably if we had seized and\nhad them the insurgent cause would be much weaker. But\nno one of them had then committed any crime de\ufb01ned in\nthe law. Every one of them, if arrested, would have been\ndischarged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to\noperate. In view of these and similar cases, I think the time\nnot unlikely to come when I shall be blamed for having\nmade too few arrests rather than too many.\n By the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion\nthat military arrests may be constitutional in localities\nwhere rebellion actually exists, but that such arrests are\nunconstitutional \nin \nlocalities \nwhere \nrebellion \nor\ninsurrection does not actually exist. They insist that such\narrests shall not be made \u201coutside of the lines of necessary\nmilitary occupation and the scenes of insurrection.\u201d\nInasmuch, however, as the Constitution itself makes no\nsuch distinction, I am unable to believe that there is any\nsuch constitutional distinction. I concede that the class of\narrests complained of can be constitutional only when, in\ncases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require\nthem; and I insist that in such cases \u2014 they are\nconstitutional wherever the public safety does require\nthem, as well in places to which they may prevent the\nrebellion extending, as in those where it may be already\nprevailing; as well where they may restrain mischievous\ninterference with the raising and supplying of armies to\nsuppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may actually\nbe; as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of\nthe army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army;\nequally constitutional at all places where they will conduce\nto the public safety as against the dangers of rebellion or\ninvasion. Take the particular case mentioned by the\nmeeting. It is asserted in substance that Mr. Vallandigham\nwas, by a military commander, seized and tried \u201cfor no\nother reason than words addressed to a public meeting in\ncriticism of the course of the administration, and in\ncondemnation of the military orders of the general.\u201d Now, if\n there be no mistake about this, if this assertion is the truth,\nand the whole truth, if there were no other reason for the\narrest, then I concede that the arrest was wrong. But the\narrest, as I understand, was made for a very di\ufb00erent\nreason. Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on\nthe part of the Union; and his arrest was made because he\nwas laboring, with some e\ufb00ect, to prevent the raising of\ntroops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave\nthe rebellion without an adequate military force to\nsuppress it. He was not arrested because he was damaging\nthe political prospects of the administration or the personal\ninterests of the commanding general, but because he was\ndamaging the army, upon the existence and vigor of which\nthe life of the nation depends. He was warring upon the\nmilitary, \nand \nthus \ngave \nthe \nmilitary \nconstitutional\njurisdiction to lay hands upon him. If Mr. Vallandigham was\nnot damaging the military power of the country, then his\narrest was made on mistake of fact, which I would be glad\nto correct on reasonably satisfactory evidence.\nI understand the meeting whose resolutions I am\nconsidering to be in favor of suppressing the rebellion by\nmilitary force \u2014 by armies. Long experience has shown\nthat armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be\npunished by the severe penalty of death. The case requires,\nand the law and the Constitution sanction, this punishment.\nMust I shoot a simple-minded boy and not touch a hair of a\nwily agitator who induced him to desert. This is none the\nless injurious when e\ufb00ected by getting a father, or brother,\nor friend into a public meeting, and there working upon his\n feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he\nis \ufb01ghting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a\ncontemptible government, too weak to arrest and punish\nhim if he shall desert. I think that, in such a case, to silence\nthe agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional, but\nwithal a great mercy.\nIf I be wrong on this question of constitutional power, my\nerror lies in believing that certain proceedings are\nconstitutional when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the\npublic \nsafety \nrequires \nthem, \nwhich \nwould \nnot \nbe\nconstitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the\npublic safety does not require them: in other words, that\nthe Constitution is not in its application in all respects the\nsame in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public\nsafety as it is in times of profound peace and public\nsecurity. The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I\ncan no more be persuaded that the government can\nconstitutionally take no strong measures in time of\nrebellion, because it can be shown that the same could not\nbe lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be\npersuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a\nsick man because it can be shown to not be good food for a\nwell one. Nor am I able to appreciate the danger\napprehended by the meeting, that the American people will\nby means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the\nright of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the\npress, the law of evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus\nthroughout the inde\ufb01nite peaceful future which I trust lies\nbefore them, any more than I am able to believe that a man\n could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during\ntemporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during\nthe remainder of his healthful life.\nIn giving the resolutions that earnest consideration\nwhich you request of me, I cannot overlook the fact that the\nmeeting speak as \u201cDemocrats.\u201d Nor can I, with full respect\nfor their known intelligence, and the fairly presumed\ndeliberation with which they prepared their resolutions, be\npermitted to suppose that this occurred by accident, or in\nany way other than that they preferred to designate\nthemselves \u201cDemocrats\u201d rather than \u201cAmerican citizens.\u201d\nIn this time of national peril I would have preferred to meet\nyou upon a level one step higher than any party platform,\nbecause I am sure that from such more elevated position\nwe could do better battle for the country we all love than\nwe possibly can from those lower ones where, from the\nforce of habit, the prejudices of the past, and sel\ufb01sh hopes\nof the future, we are sure to expend much of our ingenuity\nand strength in \ufb01nding fault with and aiming blows at each\nother. But since you have denied me this I will yet be\nthankful for the country\u2019s sake that not all Democrats have\ndone so. He on whose discretionary judgment Mr.\nVallandigham was arrested and tried is a Democrat, having\nno old party a\ufb00inity with me, and the judge who rejected\nthe constitutional view expressed in these resolutions, by\nrefusing to discharge Mr. Vallandigham on habeas corpus is\na Democrat of better days than these, having received his\njudicial mantle at the hands of President Jackson. And still\nmore: of all those Democrats who are nobly exposing their\n lives and shedding their blood on the battle-\ufb01eld, I have\nlearned that many approve the course taken with Mr.\nVallandigham, while I have not heard of a single one\ncondemning it. I cannot assert that there are none such.\nAnd the name of President Jackson recalls an instance of\npertinent history. After the battle of New Orleans, and\nwhile the fact that the treaty of peace had been concluded\nwas well known in the city, but before o\ufb00icial knowledge of\nit had arrived, General Jackson still maintained martial or\nmilitary law. Now that it could be said that the war was\nover, the clamor against martial law, which had existed\nfrom the \ufb01rst, grew more furious. Among other things, a\nMr. Louaillier published a denunciatory newspaper article.\nGeneral Jackson arrested him. A lawyer by the name of\nMorel procured the United States Judge Hall to order a\nwrit of habeas corpus to release Mr. Louaillier. General\nJackson arrested both the lawyer and the judge. A Mr.\nHollander ventured to say of some part of the matter that\n\u201cit was a dirty trick.\u201d General Jackson arrested him. When\nthe o\ufb00icer undertook to serve the writ of habeas corpus,\nGeneral Jackson took it from him, and sent him away with a\ncopy. Holding the judge in custody a few days, the general\nsent him beyond the limits of his encampment, and set him\nat liberty with an order to remain till the rati\ufb01cation of\npeace should be regularly announced, or until the British\nshould have left the southern coast. A day or two more\nelapsed, the rati\ufb01cation of the treaty of peace was regularly\nannounced, and the judge and others were fully liberated. A\nfew days more, and the judge called General Jackson into\n court and \ufb01ned him   for having arrested him and the\nothers named. The General paid the \ufb01ne, and then the\nmatter rested for nearly thirty years, when Congress\nrefunded principal and interest. The late Senator Douglas,\nthen in the House of Representatives, took a leading part in\nthe debates, in which the constitutional question was much\ndiscussed. I am not prepared to say whom the journals\nwould show to have voted for the measure.\nIt may be remarked \u2014 \ufb01rst, that we had the same\nConstitution then as now; secondly, that we then had a case\nof invasion, and now we have a case of rebellion; and,\nthirdly, that the permanent right of the people to public\ndiscussion, the liberty of speech and of the press, the trial\nby jury, the law of evidence, and the habeas corpus su\ufb00ered\nno detriment whatever by that conduct of General Jackson,\nor its subsequent approval by the American Congress.\nAnd yet, let me say that, in my own discretion, I do not\nknow whether I would have ordered the arrest of Mr.\nVallandigham. While I cannot shift the responsibility from\nmyself, I hold that, as a general rule, the commander in the\n\ufb01eld is the better judge of the necessity in any particular\ncase. Of course I must practice a general directory and\nrevisory power in the matter.\nOne of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the\nmeeting that arbitrary arrests will have the e\ufb00ect to divide\nand distract those who should be united in suppressing the\nrebellion, and I am speci\ufb01cally called on to discharge Mr.\nVallandigham. I regard this as, at least, a fair appeal to me\non the expediency of exercising a constitutional power\n which I think exists. In response to such appeal I have to\nsay, it gave me pain when I learned that Mr. Vallandigham\nhad been arrested (that is, I was pained that there should\nhave seemed to be a necessity for arresting him), and that\nit will a\ufb00ord me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as\nI can by any means believe the public safety will not su\ufb00er\nby it.\nI further say that, as the war progresses, it appears to\nme, opinion and action, which were in great confusion at\n\ufb01rst, take shape and fall into more regular channels, so that\nthe necessity for strong dealing with them gradually\ndecreases. I have every reason to desire that it should\ncease altogether, and far from the least is my regard for the\nopinions and wishes of those who, like the meeting at\nAlbany, declare their purpose to sustain the government in\nevery constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the\nrebellion. Still, I must continue to do so much as may seem\nto be required by the public safety.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n  H        A   \n   H     A \n  .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, June , .\nHON.

MALHIOT, BRADISH JOHNSON, AND\nTHOMAS COTTMAN.\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 Your letter, which follows, has been\nreceived and Considered.\n\u201cThe undersigned, a committee appointed by the planters\nof the State of Louisiana, respectfully represent that they\nhave been delegated to seek of the General Government a\nfull recognition of all the rights of the State as they existed\nprevious to the passage of an act of secession, upon the\nprinciple of the existence of the State constitution\nunimpaired, and no legal act having transpired that could\nin any way deprive them of the advantages conferred by\nthat constitution. Under this constitution the State wishes\nto return to its full allegiance, in the enjoyment of all rights\nand privileges exercised by the other States under the\nFederal Constitution. With the view of accomplishing the\ndesired object, we further request that your Excellency\nwill, as commander-in-chief of the army of the United\nStates, direct the Military Governor of Louisiana to order\nan election, in conformity with the constitution and laws of\nthe State, on the \ufb01rst Monday of November next, for all\nState and Federal o\ufb00icers.\n \u201cWith high consideration and resect, we have the honor\nto subscribe ourselves, \u201cYour obedient servants, \u201cE. E.\nMALHIOT.\n\u201cBRADISH JOHNSON.\n\u201cTHOMAS COTTMAN.\u201d\nSince receiving the letter, reliable information has\nreached me that a respectable portion of the Louisiana\npeople desire to amend their State constitution, and\ncontemplate holding a State convention for that object.\nThis fact alone, as it seems to me, is a su\ufb00icient reason why\nthe General Government should not give the committal you\nseek to the existing State constitution. I may add that,\nwhile I do not perceive how such committal could facilitate\nour military operations in Louisiana, I really apprehend it\nmight be so used as to embarrass them.\nAs to an election to be held next November, there is\nabundant time without any order or proclamation from me\njust now. The people of Louisiana shall not lack an\nopportunity for a fair election for both Federal and State\no\ufb00icers by want of anything within my power to give them.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A   . \n.   H\n I  \n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\nJUNE , .\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD. MY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your\ndespatch, asking in substance whether, in case Missouri\nshall adopt gradual emancipation, the General Government\nwill protect slave owners in that species of property during\nthe short time it shall be permitted by the State to exist\nwithin it, has been received. Desirous as I am that\nemancipation shall be adopted by Missouri, and believing\nas I do that gradual can be made better than immediate for\nboth black and white, except when military necessity\nchanges the case, my impulse is to say that such protection\nwould be given. I cannot know exactly what shape an act of\nemancipation may take. If the period from the initiation to\nthe \ufb01nal end should be comparatively short, and the act\nshould prevent persons being sold during that period into\nmore lasting slavery, the whole would be easier. I do not\nwish to pledge the General Government to the a\ufb00irmative\nsupport of even temporary slavery beyond what can be\nfairly claimed under the Constitution. I suppose, however,\nthis is not desired, but that it is desired for the military\nforce of the United States, while in Missouri, to not be used\nin subverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves\n during the progress of emancipation. This I would desire\nalso. I have very earnestly urged the slave States to adopt\nemancipation; and it ought to be, and is, an object with me\nnot to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good\nfaith do to that end. You are therefore authorized to act in\nthe spirit of this letter in conjunction with what may appear\nto be the military necessities of your department. Although\nthis letter will become public at some time, it is not\nintended to be made so now.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   .

HOUK, et al:\nGENTLEMEN: \u2014 The resolutions of the Ohio Democratic\nState convention, which you present me, together with your\nintroductory and closing remarks, being in position and\nargument mainly the same as the resolutions of the\nDemocratic meeting at Albany, New York, I refer you to my\nresponse to the latter as meeting most of the points in the\nformer.\nThis response you evidently used in preparing your\nremarks, and I desire no more than that it be used with\naccuracy. In a single reading of your remarks, I only\ndiscovered one inaccuracy in matter, which I suppose you\ntook from that paper. It is where you say: \u201cThe undersigned\nare unable to agree with you in the opinion you have\nexpressed that the Constitution is di\ufb00erent in time of\ninsurrection or invasion from what it is in time of peace and\npublic security.\u201d\nA recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not\nexpressed the opinion you suppose. I expressed the opinion\nthat the Constitution is di\ufb00erent in its application in cases\nof rebellion or invasion, involving the public safety, from\n what it is in times of profound peace and public security;\nand this opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the\nConstitution itself, things may be done in the one case\nwhich may not be done in the other.\nI dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point, but\nI must respectfully assure you that you will \ufb01nd yourselves\nat fault should you ever seek for evidence to prove your\nassumption that I \u201copposed in discussions before the\npeople the policy of the Mexican war.\u201d\nYou say: \u201cExpunge from the Constitution this limitation\nupon the power of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas\ncorpus, and yet the other guarantees of personal liberty\nwould remain unchanged.\u201d Doubtless, if this clause of the\nConstitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation upon\nthe power of Congress, were expunged, the other\nguarantees would remain the same; but the question is not\nhow those guarantees would stand with that clause out of\nthe Constitution, but how they stand with that clause\nremaining in it, in case of rebellion or invasion involving\nthe public safety. If the liberty could be indulged of\nexpunging that clause, letter and spirit, I really think the\nconstitutional argument would be with you.\nMy general view on this question was stated in the\nAlbany response, and hence I do not state it now. I only add\nthat, as seems to me, the bene\ufb01t of the writ of habeas\ncorpus is the great means through which the guarantees of\npersonal liberty are conserved and made available in the\nlast resort; and corroborative of this view is the fact that\nMr. Vallandigham, in the very case in question, under the\n advice of able lawyers, saw not where else to go but to the\nhabeas corpus. But by the Constitution the bene\ufb01t of the\nwrit of habeas corpus itself may be suspended when, in\ncase of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require\nit.\nYou ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may\noverride all the guaranteed rights of individuals, on the\nplea of conserving the public safety when I may choose to\nsay the public safety requires it. This question, divested of\nthe phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling\nfor an arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a\nquestion who shall decide, or an a\ufb00irmation that nobody\nshall decide, what the public safety does require in cases of\nrebellion or invasion.\nThe Constitution contemplates the question as likely to\noccur for decision, but it does not expressly declare who is\nto decide it. By necessary implication, when rebellion or\ninvasion comes, the decision is to be made from time to\ntime; and I think the man whom, for the time, the people\nhave, under the Constitution, made the commander-in-chief\nof their army and navy, is the man who holds the power and\nbears the responsibility of making it. If he uses the power\njustly, the same people will probably justify him; if he\nabuses it, he is in their hands to be dealt with by all the\nmodes \nthey \nhave \nreserved \nto \nthemselves \nin \nthe\nConstitution.\nThe earnestness with which you insist that persons can\nonly, in times of rebellion, be lawfully dealt with in\naccordance \nwith \nthe \nrules \nfor \ncriminal \ntrials \nand\n punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a word to\nwhat I said on that point in the Albany response.\nYou claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those\nwhose duty it is to combat a giant rebellion, and then be\ndealt with in turn only as if there were no rebellion. The\nConstitution itself rejects this view. The military arrests and\ndetentions which have been made, including those of Mr.\nVallandigham, which are not di\ufb00erent in principle from the\nothers, have been for prevention, and not for punishment \u2014\nas injunctions to stay injury, as proceedings to keep the\npeace; and hence, like proceedings in such cases and for\nlike reasons, they have not been accompanied with\nindictments, or trials by juries, nor in a single case by any\npunishment whatever, beyond what is purely incidental to\nthe prevention. The original sentence of imprisonment in\nMr. Vallandigham\u2019s case was to prevent injury to the\nmilitary service only, and the modi\ufb01cation of it was made as\na less disagreeable mode to him of securing the same\nprevention.\nI am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of\nMr. Vallandigham. Quite surely nothing of the sort was or is\nintended. I was wholly unaware that Mr. Vallandigham was,\nat the time of his arrest, a candidate for the Democratic\nnomination for governor until so informed by your reading\nto me the resolutions of the convention. I am grateful to the\nState of Ohio for many things, especially for the brave\nsoldiers and o\ufb00icers she has given in the present national\ntrial to the armies of the Union.\n You claim, as I understand, that according to my own\nposition in the Albany response, Mr. Vallandigham should\nbe released; and this because, as you claim, he has not\ndamaged the military service by discouraging enlistments,\nencouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had, he\nshould have been turned over to the civil authorities under\nthe recent acts of Congress. I certainly do not know that\nMr. Vallandigham has speci\ufb01cally and by direct language\nadvised against enlistments and in favor of desertion and\nresistance to drafting.\nWe all know that combinations, armed in some instances,\nto resist the arrest of deserters began several months ago;\nthat more recently the like has appeared in resistance to\nthe enrolment preparatory to a draft; and that quite a\nnumber of assassinations have occurred from the same\nanimus. These had to be met by military force, and this\nagain has led to bloodshed and death. And now, under a\nsense of responsibility more weighty and enduring than any\nwhich is merely o\ufb00icial, I solemnly declare my belief that\nthis hindrance of the military, including maiming and\nmurder, is due to the course in which Mr. Vallandigham has\nbeen engaged in a greater degree than to any other cause;\nand it is due to him personally in a greater degree than to\nany other one man.\nThese things have been notorious, known to all, and of\ncourse known to Mr. Vallandigham. Perhaps I would not be\nwrong to say they originated with his special friends and\nadherents. With perfect knowledge of them, he has\nfrequently if not constantly made speeches in Congress and\n before popular assemblies; and if it can be shown that, with\nthese things staring him in the face he has ever uttered a\nword of rebuke or counsel against them, it will be a fact\ngreatly in his favor with me, and one of which as yet I am\ntotally ignorant. When it is known that the whole burden of\nhis speeches has been to stir up men against the\nprosecution of the war, and that in the midst of resistance\nto it he has not been known in any instance to counsel\nagainst such resistance, it is next to impossible to repel the\ninference that he has counseled directly in favor of it.\nWith all this before their eyes, the convention you\nrepresent have nominated Mr. Vallandigham for governor\nof Ohio, and both they and you have declared the purpose\nto sustain the national Union by all constitutional means.\nBut of course they and you in common reserve to\nyourselves to decide what are constitutional means; and,\nunlike the Albany meeting, you omit to state or intimate\nthat in your opinion an army is a constitutional means of\nsaving the Union against a rebellion, or even to intimate\nthat you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in\nprogress with the avowed object of destroying that very\nUnion. At the same time your nominee for governor, in\nwhose behalf you appeal, is known to you and to the world\nto declare against the use of an army to suppress the\nrebellion. \nYour \nown \nattitude, \ntherefore, \nencourages\ndesertion, resistance to the draft, and the like, because it\nteaches those who incline to desert and to escape the draft\nto believe it is your purpose to protect them, and to hope\nthat you will become strong enough to do so.\n After a short personal intercourse with you, gentlemen of\nthe committee, I cannot say I think you desire this e\ufb00ect to\nfollow your attitude; but I assure your that both friends and\nenemies of the Union look upon it in this light. It is a\nsubstantial hope, and by consequence a real strength to the\nenemy. If it is a false hope, and one which you would\nwillingly dispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy.\nI send you duplicates of this letter in order that you, or a\nmajority of you, may, if you choose, indorse your names\nupon one of them and return it thus indorsed to me with\nthe \nunderstanding \nthat \nthose \nsigning \nare \nthereby\ncommitted to the following propositions and to nothing\nelse:\n. That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the\nobject and tendency of which is to destroy the National\nUnion; and that, in your opinion, an army and navy are\nconstitutional means for suppressing that rebellion;\n. That no one of you will do anything which, in his own\njudgment, will tend to hinder the increase, or favor the\ndecrease, or lessen the e\ufb00iciency of the army or navy while\nengaged in the e\ufb00ort to suppress that rebellion; and\n. That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to\nhave the o\ufb00icers, soldiers, and seamen of the army and\nnavy, while engaged in the e\ufb00ort to suppress the rebellion,\npaid, fed, clad, and otherwise well provided for and\nsupported.\nAnd with the further understanding that upon receiving\nthe letter and names thus indorsed, I will cause them to be\npublished, which publication shall be, within itself, a\n revocation of the order in relation to Mr. Vallandigham. It\nwill not escape observation that I consent to the release of\nMr. Vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge\nfrom him or from others as to what he will or will not do. I\ndo this because he is not present to speak for himself, or to\nauthorize others to speak for him; and because I should\nexpect that on his returning he would not put himself\npractically in antagonism with the position of his friends.\nBut I do it chie\ufb02y because I thereby prevail on other\nin\ufb02uential gentlemen of Ohio to so de\ufb01ne their position as\nto be of immense value to the army \u2014 thus more than\ncompensating for the consequences of any mistake in\nallowing Mr. Vallandigham to return; so that, on the whole,\nthe public safety will not have su\ufb00ered by it. Still, in regard\nto Mr. Vallandigham and all others, I must hereafter, as\nheretofore, do so much as the public safety may seem to\nrequire.\nI have the honor to be respectfully yours, etc.,\nA.

HALLECK.\nSOLDIERS\u2019 HOME, WASHINGTON, JULY  .\nP.M., MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK: I left the telegraph\no\ufb00ice a good deal dissatis\ufb01ed. You know I did not like the\nphrase \u2014 in Orders, No. , I believe\u2014 \u201cDrive the invaders\nfrom our soil.\u201d Since that, I see a despatch from General\nFrench, saying the enemy is crossing his wounded over the\nriver in \ufb02ats, without saying why he does not stop it, or\neven intimating a thought that it ought to be stopped. Still\nlater, another despatch from General Pleasonton, by\ndirection of General Meade, to General French, stating that\nthe main army is halted because it is believed the rebels\nare concentrating \u201con the road towards Hagerstown,\nbeyond Fair\ufb01eld,\u201d and is not to move until it is ascertained\nthat the rebels intend to evacuate Cumberland Valley.\nThese things appear to me to be connected with a\npurpose to cover Baltimore and Washington and to get the\nenemy across the river again without a further collision,\nand they do not appear connected with a purpose to\nprevent his crossing and to destroy him. I do fear the\nformer purpose is acted upon and the latter rejected.\nIf you are satis\ufb01ed the latter purpose is entertained, and\nis judiciously pursued, I am content. If you are not so\n satis\ufb01ed, please look to it.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n    \n A     \nA\n \nJULY , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 I am very glad indeed to see you\nto-night, and yet I will not say I thank you for this call; but I\ndo most sincerely thank Almighty God for the occasion on\nwhich you have called. How long ago is it Eighty-odd years\nsince, on the Fourth of July, for the \ufb01rst time in the history\nof the world, a nation, by its representatives, assembled\nand declared as a self-evident truth \u201cthat all men are\ncreated equal.\u201d That was the birthday of the United States\nof America. Since then the Fourth of July has had several\nvery peculiar recognitions. The two men most distinguished\nin the framing and support of the Declaration were Thomas\nJe\ufb00erson and John Adams, the one having penned it, and\nthe other sustained it the most forcibly in debate \u2014 the\nonly two of the \ufb01fty-\ufb01ve who signed it and were elected\nPresidents of the United States. Precisely \ufb01fty years after\nthey put their hands to the paper, it pleased Almighty God\nto take both from this stage of action. This was indeed an\nextraordinary and remarkable event in our history. Another\nPresident, \ufb01ve years after, was called from this stage of\nexistence on the same day and month of the year; and now\non this last Fourth of July just passed, when we have a\ngigantic rebellion, at the bottom of which is an e\ufb00ort to\n overthrow the principle that all men were created equal,\nwe have the surrender of a most powerful position and\narmy on that very day. And not only so, but in the\nsuccession of battles in Pennsylvania, near to us, through\nthree days, so rapidly fought that they might be called one\ngreat battle, on the \ufb01rst, second, and third of the month of\nJuly; and on the fourth the cohorts of those who opposed\nthe Declaration that all men are created equal, \u201cturned\ntail\u201d and run.\nGentlemen, this is a glorious theme, and the occasion for\na speech, but I am not prepared to make one worthy of the\noccasion. I would like to speak in terms of praise due to the\nmany brave o\ufb00icers and soldiers who have fought in the\ncause of the Union and liberties of their country from the\nbeginning of the war. These are trying occasions, not only\nin success, but for the want of success. I dislike to mention\nthe name of one single o\ufb00icer, lest I might do wrong to\nthose I might forget. Recent events bring up glorious\nnames, and particularly prominent ones; but these I will not\nmention. Having said this much, I will now take the music.\n  \n   \n   \n   I    \n \n  \n \n \n  A\n A\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL G.\nC.

Forces now beyond\nCarlisle to be joined by regiments still at Harrisburg, and\nthe united force again to join Pierce somewhere, and the\nwhole to move down the Cumberland Valley, will in my\nunprofessional opinion be quite as likely to capture the\n\u201cman in the moon\u201d as any part of Lee\u2019s army.\nA.

I was\npained to be informed this morning by the Provost-Marshal-\nGeneral that New Jersey is now behind twelve thousand,\nirrespective of the draft. I did not have time to ascertain by\nwhat rules this was made out; and I shall be very glad if it\nshall, by any means, prove to be incorrect. He also tells me\nthat eight thousand will be about the quota of New Jersey\non the \ufb01rst draft; and the Secretary of War says the \ufb01rst\ndraft in that State would not be made for some time in any\nevent. As every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so\nmuch, and this may supersede it altogether, I hope you will\npush forward your volunteer regiments as fast as possible.\nIt is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one\nState, because of the argument it furnishes others to have\npostponement also. If we could have a reason in one case\nwhich would be good if presented in all cases, we could act\nupon it.\n I will thank you, therefore, to inform me, if you can, by\nwhat day, at the earliest, you can promise to have ready to\nbe mustered into the United States service the eight\nthousand men.\nIf you can make a reliable promise (I mean one which\nyou can rely on yourself) of this sort, it will be of great\nvalue, if the day is not too remote.\nI beg you to be assured I wish to avoid the di\ufb00iculties you\ndread as much as yourself.\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

POSTMASTER-GENERAL\nSIR:-Yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in\ntwo cases of postmasterships sought for widows whose\nhusbands have fallen in the battles of this war. These cases\noccurring on the same day brought me to re\ufb02ect more\nattentively than I had before done, as to what is fairly due\nfrom us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men\nwho, by \ufb01ghting our battles, bear the chief burden of\nserving our country. My conclusion is that, other claims and\nquali\ufb01cations being equal, they have the better right and\nthis is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier,\ndeceased soldier\u2019s family.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN\n  \n       A   \n   H  \nA  .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July , .\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\nSIR: \u2014 Certain matters have come to my notice, and\nconsidered by me, which induce me to believe that it will\nconduce to the public interest for you to add to the general\ninstructions given to our naval commanders in relation to\ncontraband trade propositions substantially as follows, to\nwit:\nFirst. You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible the\nappearance, of using any neutral port to watch neutral\nvessels and then to dart out and seize them on their\ndeparture.\nNOTE. \u2014 Complaint is made that this has been practiced\nat the port of St Thomas, which practice, if it exists, is\ndisapproved and must cease.\nSecond. You will not in any case detain the crew of a\ncaptured neutral vessel or any other subject of a neutral\npower on board such vessel, as prisoners of war or\notherwise, except the small number necessary as witnesses\nin the prize court.\nNOTE.-The practice here forbidden is also charged to\nexist, which, if true, is disapproved and must cease.\n My dear sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you\nhave been remiss in the performance of the arduous and\nresponsible duties of your department, which, I take\npleasure in a\ufb00irming, has in your hands been conducted\nwith admirable success. Yet, while your subordinates are\nalmost of necessity brought into angry collision with the\nsubjects of foreign states, the representatives of those\nstates and yourself do not come into immediate contact for\nthe purpose of keeping the peace, in spite of such\ncollisions. At that point there is an ultimate and heavy\nresponsibility upon me.\nWhat I propose is in strict accordance with international\nlaw, and is therefore unobjectionable; whilst, if it does no\nother good, it will contribute to sustain a considerable\nportion of the present British ministry in their places, who,\nif displaced, are sure to be replaced by others more\nunfavorable to us.\nYour obedient servant,\nA. LINCOLN\n         \n \n   \n   A    .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, \nJULY , .\nHIS E CELLENCY GOVERNOR JOEL PARKER.\nSIR: \u2014 Yours of the st is received, and I have taken\ntime and considered and discussed the subject with the\nSecretary of War and Provost-Marshal General, in order, if\npossible, to make you a more favorable answer than I\n\ufb01nally \ufb01nd myself able to do.\nIt is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation\nwith the governor of any one State, because it would breed\ntrouble in many, if not all, other States; and my idea was\nwhen I wrote you, as it still is, to get a point of time to\nwhich we could wait, on the reason that we were not ready\nourselves to proceed, and which might enable you to raise\nthe quota of your State, in whole, or in large part, without\nthe draft. The points of time you \ufb01x are much farther o\ufb00\nthan I had hoped. We might have got along in the way I\nhave indicated for twenty, or possibly thirty, days. As it\nstands, the best I can say is that every volunteer you will\npresent us within thirty days from this date, \ufb01t and ready to\nbe mustered into the United States service, on the usual\nterms, shall be pro tanto an abatement of your quota of the\ndraft. That quota I can now state at eight thousand seven\nhundred and eighty-three (). No draft from New\n Jersey, other than for the above quota, will be made before\nan additional draft, common to [all] the States, shall be\nrequired; and I may add that if we get well through with\nthis draft, I entertain a strong hope that any further one\nmay never be needed. This expression of hope, however,\nmust not be construed into a promise.\nAs to conducting the draft by townships, I \ufb01nd it would\nrequire such a waste of labor already done, and such an\nadditional amount of it, and such a loss of time, as to make\nit, I fear, inadmissible.\nYour obedient servant,\nA. LINCOLN.\nP. S. \u2014 Since writing the above, getting additional\ninformation, I am enabled to say that the draft may be\nmade in subdistricts, as the enrolment has been made, or is\nin process of making. This will amount practically to\ndrafting by townships, as the enrollment subdistricts are\ngenerally about the extent of townships.

In General Grant\u2019s \ufb01rst despatch after the fall of\nVicksburg, he said, among other things, he would send the\nNinth Corps to you. Thinking it would be pleasant to you, I\nasked the Secretary of War to telegraph you the news. For\nsome reasons never mentioned to us by General Grant, they\nhave not been sent, though we have seen outside\nintimations that they took part in the expedition against\nJackson. General Grant is a copious worker and \ufb01ghter, but\na very meager writer or telegrapher. No doubt he changed\nhis purpose in regard to the Ninth Corps for some su\ufb00icient\nreason, but has forgotten to notify us of it.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A  H. \n.

I am claiming no such thing of him. In fact, my\njudgment is against it; which judgment, of course, I will\nyield if yours and his are the contrary. If he could not safely\nengage Lee at Williamsport, it seems absurd to suppose he\ncan safely engage him now, when he has scarcely more\nthan two thirds of the force he had at Williamsport, while it\nmust be that Lee has been reinforced. True, I desired\nGeneral Meade to pursue Lee across the Potomac, hoping,\nas has proved true, that he would thereby clear the\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, and get some advantages by\nharassing him on his retreat. These being past, I am\nunwilling he should now get into a general engagement on\nthe impression that we here are pressing him, and I shall\nbe glad for you to so inform him, unless your own judgment\nis against it.\nYours truly, A.

The law of nations and the usages and\ncustoms of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit no\ndistinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war\nas public enemies. To sell or enslave any captured person,\non account of his color and for no o\ufb00ense against the laws\nof war, is a relapse into barbarism, and a crime against the\ncivilization of the age.\nThe Government of the United States will give the same\nprotection to all its soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or\nenslave any one because of his color, the o\ufb00ense shall be\npunished by retaliation upon the enemy\u2019s prisoners in our\npossession.\nIt is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the\nUnited States killed in violation of the laws of war, a rebel\nsoldier shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the\nenemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall be placed at\nhard labor on the public works, and continued at such labor\nuntil the other shall be released and receive the treatment\ndue to a prisoner of war.\n A.

I now learn that your resignation has\nreached the War Department. I also learn that an active\ncommand has been assigned you by General Grant. The\nSecretary of War and General Halleck are very partial to\nyou, as you know I also am. We all wish you to reconsider\nthe question of resigning; not that we would wish to retain\nyou greatly against your wish and interest, but that your\ndecision may be at least a very well-considered one.\nI understand that Senator [William K.] Sebastian, of\nArkansas, thinks of o\ufb00ering to resume his place in the\nSenate. Of course the Senate, and not I, would decide\nwhether to admit or reject him. Still I should feel great\ninterest in the question. It may be so presented as to be\none of the very greatest national importance; and it may be\notherwise so presented as to be of no more than temporary\npersonal consequence to him.\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applies to Arkansas. I\nthink it is valid in law, and will be so held by the courts. I\nthink I shall not retract or repudiate it. Those who shall\nhave tasted actual freedom I believe can never be slaves or\nquasi-slaves again. For the rest, I believe some plan\n substantially being gradual emancipation would be better\nfor both white and black. The Missouri plan recently\nadopted, I do not object to on account of the time for\nending the institution; but I am sorry the beginning should\nhave been postponed for seven years, leaving all that time\nto agitate for the repeal of the whole thing. It should begin\nat once, giving at least the new-born a vested interest in\nfreedom which could not be taken away. If Senator\nSebastian could come with something of this sort from\nArkansas, I, at least, should take great interest in his case;\nand I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the\nworld so great a service. See him if you can, and read this\nto him; but charge him not to make it public for the\npresent. Write me again.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n   \n \n   \n     \n .\nALBANY, August , .

LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  .  A\n  .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August ,.\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS: While I very well know\nwhat I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is quite a\ndi\ufb00erent thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I\nwould be glad for her to make a new constitution,\nrecognizing the emancipation proclamation, and adopting\nemancipation in those parts of the State to which the\nproclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it\nwould not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical\nsystem by which the two races could gradually live\nthemselves out of their old relation to each other, and both\ncome out better prepared for the new. Education for young\nblacks should be included in the plan. After all, the power\nor element of \u201ccontract\u201d may be su\ufb00icient for this\nprobationary period, and by its simplicity and \ufb02exibility\nmay be the better.\nAs an antislavery man, I have a motive to desire\nemancipation which proslavery men do not have but even\nthey have strong enough reason to thus place themselves\nagain under the shield of the Union, and to thus perpetually\nhedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which\nwe are now passing.\n Governor Shepley has informed me that Mr. Durant is\nnow taking a registry, with a view to the election of a\nconstitutional convention in Louisiana. This, to me, appears\nproper. If such convention were to ask my views, I could\npresent little else than what I now say to you. I think the\nthing should be pushed forward, so that, if possible, its\nmature work may reach here by the meeting of Congress.\nFor my own part, I think I shall not, in any event, retract\nthe emancipation proclamation: nor, as executive, ever\nreturn to slavery any person who is free by the terms of\nthat proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.\nIf Louisiana shall send members to Congress, their\nadmission to seats will depend, as you know, upon the\nrespective Houses, and not upon the President.\nYours very truly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n   \n     \n .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August , .\nHIS E CELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of\nNew York: Your communication of the rd instant has been\nreceived and attentively considered.\nI cannot consent to suspend the draft in New York, as\nyou request, because, among other reasons, time is too\nimportant.\nBy the \ufb01gures you send, which I presume are correct, the\ntwelve districts represented fall into two classes of eight\nand four respectively. The disparity of the quotas for the\ndraft in these two classes is certainly very striking, being\nthe di\ufb00erence between an average of  in one class and\n in the other. Assuming that the districts are equal one\nto another in entire population, as required by the plan on\nwhich they were made, this disparity is such as to require\nattention. Much of it, however, I suppose will be accounted\nfor by the fact that so many more persons \ufb01t for soldiers\nare in the city than are in the country who have too\nrecently arrived from other parts of the United States and\nfrom Europe to be either included in the census of , or\nto have voted in . Still, making due allowance for this,\nI am yet unwilling to stand upon it as an entirely su\ufb00icient\nexplanation of the great disparity.\n I shall direct the draft to proceed in all the districts,\ndrawing, however, at \ufb01rst from each of the four districts \u2014\nto wit, the Second, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth \u2014 only, \nbeing the average quota of the other class. After this\ndrawing, these four districts, and also the Seventeenth and\nTwenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled; and, if you\nplease, agents of yours may witness every step of the\nprocess. Any de\ufb01ciency which may appear by the new\nenrolment will be supplied by a special draft for that object,\nallowing due credit for volunteers who may be obtained\nfrom these districts respectively during the interval; and at\nall points, so far as consistent with practical convenience,\ndue credits shall be given for volunteers, and your\nExcellency shall be noti\ufb01ed of the time \ufb01xed for\ncommencing the draft in each district.\nI do not object to abide a decision of the United States\nSupreme Court, or of the judges thereof, on the\nconstitutionality of the draft law. In fact, I should be willing\nto facilitate the obtaining of it. But I cannot consent to lose\nthe time while it is being obtained. We are contending with\nan enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-bodied\nman he can reach into his ranks, very much as a butcher\ndrives bullocks into the slaughter-pen. No time is wasted,\nno argument is used. This produces an army which will\nsoon turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the\n\ufb01eld, if they shall not be sustained by recruits as they\nshould be. It produces an army with a rapidity not to be\nmatched on our side if we \ufb01rst waste time to re-experiment\nwith the volunteer system, already deemed by Congress,\n and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted as to be inadequate;\nand then more time to obtain a court decision as to whether\na law is constitutional, which requires a part of those not\nnow in the service to go to the aid of those who are already\nin it; and still more time to determine with absolute\ncertainty that we get those who are to go in the precisely\nlegal proportion to those who are not to go. My purpose is\nto be in my action just and constitutional, and yet practical,\nin performing the important duty with which I am charged,\nof maintaining the unity and the free principles of our\ncommon country.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A  \n. . \n A\n .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August , .\nMY DEAR GENERAL GRANT: I see by a despatch of\nyours that you incline quite strongly toward an expedition\nagainst Mobile. This would appear tempting to me also,\nwere it not that in view of recent events in Mexico I am\ngreatly impressed with the importance of re-establishing\nthe national authority in western Texas as soon as possible.\nI am not making an order, however; that I leave, for the\npresent at least, to the general-in-chief.\nA word upon another subject: General Thomas has gone\nagain to the Mississippi Valley, with the view of raising\ncolored troops. I have no reason to doubt that you are\ndoing what you reasonably can upon the same subject. I\nbelieve it is a resource which if vigorously applied now will\nsoon close the contest. It works doubly, weakening the\nenemy and strengthening us. We were not fully ripe for it\nuntil the river was opened. Now, I think at least one\nhundred thousand can and ought to be rapidly organized\nalong its shores, relieving all white troops to serve\nelsewhere. Mr. Dana understands you as believing that the\nEmancipation Proclamation has helped some in your\nmilitary operations. I am very glad if this is so.\n Did you receive a short letter from me dated the th of\nJuly?\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  .  \n    A\n .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August , .\nMY DEAR GENERAL ROSECRANS: Yours of the st was\nreceived two days ago. I think you must have inferred more\nthan General Halleck has intended, as to any dissatisfaction\nof mine with you. I am sure you, as a reasonable man,\nwould not have been wounded could you have heard all my\nwords and seen all my thoughts in regard to you. I have not\nabated in my kind feeling for and con\ufb01dence in you. I have\nseen most of your despatches to General Halleck \u2014\nprobably all of them. After Grant invested Vicksburg I was\nvery anxious lest Johnston should overwhelm him from the\noutside, and when it appeared certain that part of Bragg\u2019s\nforce had gone and was going to Johnston, it did seem to\nme it was exactly the proper time for you to attack Bragg\nwith what force he had left. In all kindness let me say it so\nseems to me yet. Finding from your despatches to General\nHalleck that your judgment was di\ufb00erent, and being very\nanxious for Grant, I, on one occasion, told General Halleck I\nthought he should direct you to decide at once to\nimmediately attack Bragg or to stand on the defensive and\nsend part of your force to Grant. He replied he had already\nso directed in substance. Soon after, despatches from Grant\nabated my anxiety for him, and in proportion abated my\n anxiety about any movement of yours. When afterward,\nhowever, I saw a despatch of yours arguing that the right\ntime for you to attack Bragg was not before, but would be\nafter, the fall of Vicksburg, it impressed me very strangely,\nand I think I so stated to the Secretary of War and General\nHalleck. It seemed no other than the proposition that you\ncould better \ufb01ght Bragg when Johnston should be at liberty\nto return and assist him than you could before he could so\nreturn to his assistance.\nSince Grant has been entirely relieved by the fall of\nVicksburg, by which Johnston is also relieved, it has\nseemed to me that your chance for a stroke has been\nconsiderably diminished, and I have not been pressing you\ndirectly or indirectly. True, I am very anxious for East\nTennessee to be occupied by us; but I see and appreciate\nthe di\ufb00iculties you mention. The question occurs, Can the\nthing be done at all? Does preparation advance at all? Do\nyou not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?\nHave you more animals to-day than you had at the battle of\nStone\u2019s River? And yet have not more been furnished you\nsince then than your entire present stock? I ask the same\nquestions as to your mounted force.\nDo not misunderstand: I am not casting blame upon you;\nI rather think by great exertion you can get to East\nTennessee; but a very important question is, Can you stay\nthere? I make no order in the case \u2014 that I leave to General\nHalleck and yourself.\nAnd now be assured once more that I think of you in all\nkindness and con\ufb01dence, and that I am not watching you\n with an evil eye.\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n   \n     \n .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August ..\nHIS E CELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of\nNew York: Yours of the th, with Judge-Advocate-General\nWaterbury\u2019s report, was received to-day.\nAsking you to remember that I consider time as being\nvery important, both to the general cause of the country\nand to the soldiers in the \ufb01eld, I beg to remind you that I\nwaited, at your request, from the st until the th inst., to\nreceive your communication dated the d. In view of its\ngreat length, and the known time and apparent care taken\nin its preparation, I did not doubt that it contained your full\ncase as you desired to present it. It contained the \ufb01gures\nfor twelve districts, omitting the other nineteen, as I\nsuppose, because you found nothing to complain of as to\nthem. I answered accordingly. In doing so I laid down the\nprinciple to which I purpose adhering, which is to proceed\nwith the draft, at the same time employing infallible means\nto avoid any great wrong. With the communication received\nto-day you send \ufb01gures for twenty-eight districts, including\nthe twelve sent before, and still omitting three, for which I\nsuppose the enrolments are not yet received. In looking\nover the fuller list of twenty-eight districts, I \ufb01nd that the\nquotas for sixteen of them are above  and below ,\n while, of the rest, six are above  and six are below\n. Applying the principle to these new facts, the Fifth\nand Seventh districts must be added to the four in which\nthe quotas have already been reduced to  for the \ufb01rst\ndraft; and with these four others just be added to those to\nbe re-enrolled. The correct case will then stand: the quotas\nof the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth\ndistricts \ufb01xed at  for the \ufb01rst draft. The Provost-\nMarshal-General informs me that the drawing is already\ncompleted in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth,\nTwenty-second, \nTwenty-fourth, \nTwenty-sixth, \nTwenty-\nseventh, \nTwenty-eighth, \nTwenty-ninth, \nand \nThirtieth\ndistricts. In the others, except the three outstanding, the\ndrawing will be made upon the quotas as now \ufb01xed. After\nthe \ufb01rst draft, the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh,\nEighth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Twenty-\ufb01rst, Twenty-\ufb01fth,\nTwenty-ninth, and Thirty-\ufb01rst will be enrolled for the\npurpose and in the manner stated in my letter of the th\ninst. The same principle will be applied to the now\noutstanding districts when they shall come in. No part of\nmy former letter is repudiated by reason of not being\nrestated in this, or for any other cause.\nYour obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A   .

Greene has just\npresented a kind letter in regard to yourself, addressed to\nme by our other friends Yates, Hatch, and Dubois.\nI doubt whether your present position is more painful to\nyou than to myself. Grateful for the patriotic stand so early\ntaken by you in this life-and-death struggle of the nation, I\nhave done whatever has appeared practicable to advance\nyou and the public interest together. No charges, with a\nview to a trial, have been preferred against you by any one;\nnor do I suppose any will be. All there is, so far as I have\nheard, is General Grant\u2019s statement of his reasons for\nrelieving you. And even this I have not seen or sought to\nsee; because it is a case, as appears to me, in which I could\ndo nothing without doing harm. General Grant and yourself\nhave been conspicuous in our most important successes;\nand for me to interfere and thus magnify a breach between\nyou could not but be of evil e\ufb00ect. Better leave it where the\nlaw of the case has placed it. For me to force you back upon\nGeneral Grant would be forcing him to resign. I cannot give\nyou a new command, because we have no forces except\nsuch as already have commanders.\n I am constantly pressed by those who scold before they\nthink, or without thinking at all, to give commands\nrespectively to Fremont, McClellan, Butler, Sigel, Curtis,\nHunter, Hooker, and perhaps others, when, all else out of\nthe way, I have no commands to give them. This is now your\ncase; which, as I have said, pains me not less than it does\nyou. My belief is that the permanent estimate of what a\ngeneral does in the \ufb01eld is \ufb01xed by the \u201ccloud of witnesses\u201d\nwho have been with him in the \ufb01eld, and that, relying on\nthese, he who has the right needs not to fear.\nYour friend as ever, A.

The only\ndi\ufb00iculty is in applying the principle properly. Looking to\ntime, as heretofore, I am unwilling to give up a drafted man\nnow, even for the certainty, much less for the mere chance,\nof getting a volunteer hereafter. Again, after the draft in\nany district, would it not make trouble to take any drafted\nman out and put a volunteer in \u2014 for how shall it be\ndetermined which drafted man is to have the privilege of\nthus going out, to the exclusion of all the others? And even\nbefore the draft in any district the quota must be \ufb01xed; and\nthe draft must be postponed inde\ufb01nitely if every time a\nvolunteer is o\ufb00ered the o\ufb00icers must stop and reconstruct\nthe quota. At least I fear there might be this di\ufb00iculty; but,\nat all events, let credits for volunteers be given up to the\nlast moment which will not produce confusion or delay.\nThat the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be\napplied by districts seems fair and proper, though I do not\nknow how far by present statistics it is practicable. When\n for any cause a fair credit is not given at one time, it should\nbe given as soon thereafter as practicable. My purpose is to\nbe just and fair, and yet to not lose time.\nA. LINCOLN\n  o  .

Perhaps the best compliment I can\npay is to say, as I truly can, I am very anxious to see it\nagain. Some of Shakespeare\u2019s plays I have never read,\nwhile others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any\nun-professional reader. Among the latter are Lear, Richard\nIII., Henry VIII., Hamlet, and especially Macbeth. I think\nnothing equals Macbeth. It is wonderful.\nUnlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the\nsoliloquy in Hamlet commencing \u201cOh, my o\ufb00ense is rank,\u201d\nsurpasses that commencing \u201cTo be or not to be.\u201d But\npardon this small attempt at criticism.

LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\nThere seems to be considerable misunderstanding about\nthe recent movement to take possession of the \u201cNew\nAlmaden\u201d mine. It has no reference to any other mine or\nmines.\nIn regard to mines and miners generally, no change of\npolicy by the Government has been decided on, or even\nthought of, so far as I know.\nThe \u201cNew Almaden\u201d mine was peculiar in this: that its\noccupants claimed to be the legal owners of it on a Mexican\ngrant, and went into court on that claim. The case found its\nway into the Supreme Court of the United States, and last\nterm, in and by that court, the claim of the occupants was\ndecided to be utterly fraudulent. Thereupon it was\nconsidered the duty of the Government by the Secretary of\nthe Interior, the Attorney-General, and myself to take\npossession of the premises; and the Attorney-General\ncarefully made out the writ and I signed it. It was not\nobtained surreptitiously, although I suppose General\nHalleck thought it had been, when he telegraphed, simply\nbecause he thought possession was about being taken by a\n military order, while he knew no such order had passed\nthrough his hands as general-in-chief.\nThe writ was suspended, upon urgent representations\nfrom California, simply to keep the peace. It never had any\ndirect or indirect reference to any mine, place, or person,\nexcept the \u201cNew Almaden\u201d mine and the persons\nconnected with it.\nA.

CONKLING.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August ,\n.\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Your letter inviting me to attend a mass\nmeeting of unconditional Union men, to be held at the\ncapital of Illinois, on the d day of September, has been\nreceived. It would be very agreeable for me thus to meet\nmy old friends at my own home, but I cannot just now be\nabsent from here so long as a visit there would require.\nThe meeting is to be of all those who maintain\nunconditional devotion to the Union, and I am sure that my\nold political friends will thank me for tendering, as I do, the\nnation\u2019s gratitude to those other noble men whom no\npartisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the\nnation\u2019s life.\nThere are those who are dissatis\ufb01ed with me. To such I\nwould say: You desire peace, and you blame me that we do\nnot have it. But how can we obtain it? There are but three\nconceivable ways:\nFirst \u2014 to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I\nam trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are\nagreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the\n Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If you are you\nshould say so plainly. If you are not for force nor yet for\ndissolution, \nthere \nonly \nremains \nsome \nimaginable\ncompromise.\nI do not believe that any compromise embracing the\nmaintenance of the Union is now possible. All that I learn\nleads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the\nrebellion is its military, its army. That army dominates all\nthe country and all the people within its range. Any o\ufb00er of\nterms made by any man or men within that range, in\nopposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present;\nbecause such man or men have no power whatever to\nenforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with\nthem.\nTo illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace\nmen of the North get together in convention, and frame\nand proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the\nUnion. In what way can that compromise be used to keep\nLee\u2019s army out of Pennsylvania? Meade\u2019s army can keep\nLee\u2019s army out of Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately\ndrive it out of existence. But no paper compromise to which\nthe controllers of Lee\u2019s army are not agreed can at all\na\ufb00ect that army. In an e\ufb00ort at such compromise we would\nwaste time, which the enemy would improve to our\ndisadvantage; and that would be all.\nA compromise, to be e\ufb00ective, must be made either with\nthose who control the rebel army, or with the people, \ufb01rst\nliberated from the domination of that army by the success\nof our own army. Now allow me to assure you that no word\n or intimation from that rebel army, or from any of the men\ncontrolling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has\never come to my knowledge or belief. All charges and\ninsinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless.\nAnd I promise you that if any such proposition shall\nhereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret\nfrom you. I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of\nthe people, according to the bond of service, the United\nStates Constitution, and that, as such, I am responsible to\nthem.\nBut, to be plain: You are dissatis\ufb01ed with me about the\nnegro. Quite likely there is a di\ufb00erence of opinion between\nyou and myself upon that subject. I certainly wish that all\nmen could be free, while you, I suppose, do not. Yet, I have\nneither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not\nconsistent with even your view, provided you are for the\nUnion. I suggested compensated emancipation; to which\nyou replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes. But\nI had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes, except in\nsuch way as to save you from greater taxation to save the\nUnion exclusively by other means.\nYou dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps\nwould have it retracted. You say it is unconstitutional. I\nthink di\ufb00erently. I think the Constitution invests its\ncommander-in-chief with the law of war in time of war. The\nmost that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are\nproperty. Is there, has there ever been, any question that\nby the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends,\nmay be taken when needed? And is it not needed whenever\n it helps us and hurts the enemy? Armies, the world over,\ndestroy enemies\u2019 property when they cannot use it, and\neven destroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized\nbelligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt\nthe enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or\ncruel. \nAmong \nthe \nexceptions \nare \nthe \nmassacre \nof\nvanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female.\nBut the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not\nvalid. If it is not valid it needs no retraction. If it is valid it\ncannot be retracted, any more than the dead can be\nbrought to life. Some of you profess to think its retraction\nwould operate favorably for the Union, why better after the\nretraction than before the issue? There was more than a\nyear and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the\nproclamation was issued, the last one hundred days of\nwhich passed under an explicit notice that it was coming,\nunless averted by those in revolt returning to their\nallegiance. The war has certainly progressed as favorably\nfor us since the issue of the proclamation as before.\nI know, as fully as one can know the opinions of others,\nthat some of the commanders of our armies in the \ufb01eld,\nwho have given us our most important victories, believe the\nemancipation policy and the use of colored troops\nconstitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion, and\nthat at least one of those important successes could not\nhave been achieved when it was but for the aid of black\nsoldiers.\nAmong the commanders who hold these views are some\nwho have never had any a\ufb00inity with what is called\n \u201cAbolitionism,\u201d or with \u201cRepublican Party politics,\u201d but who\nhold them purely as military opinions. I submit their\nopinions are entitled to some weight against the objections\noften urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are\nunwise as military measures, and were not adopted as such\nin good faith.\nYou say that you will not \ufb01ght to free negroes. Some of\nthem seem willing to \ufb01ght for you; but no matter. Fight you,\nthen, exclusively, to save the Union. I issued the\nproclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union.\nWhenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the\nUnion, if I shall urge you to continue \ufb01ghting, it will be an\napt time then for you to declare you will not \ufb01ght to free\nnegroes. I thought that in your struggle for the Union, to\nwhatever extent the negroes should cease helping the\nenemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his\nresistance to you. Do you think di\ufb00erently? I thought that\nwhatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just\nso much less for white soldiers to do in saving the Union.\nDoes it appear otherwise to you? But negroes, like other\npeople, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for\nus if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives\nfor us they must be prompted by the strongest motive, even\nthe promise of freedom. And the promise, being made,\nmust be kept.\nThe signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes\nunvexed to the sea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it;\nnor yet wholly to them. Three hundred miles up they met\nNew England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their\n way right and left. The sunny South, too, in more colors\nthan one, also lent a helping hand. On the spot, their part\nof the history was jotted down in black and white. The job\nwas a great national one, and let none be slighted who bore\nan honorable part in it And while those who have cleared\nthe great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is\nhard to say that anything has been more bravely and well\ndone than at Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on\nmany \ufb01elds of less note. Nor must Uncle Sam\u2019s web-feet be\nforgotten. At all the watery margins they have been\npresent; not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the\nrapid river, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and\nwherever the ground was a little damp, they have been and\nmade their tracks. Thanks to all. For the great Republic \u2014\nfor the principle it lives by and keeps alive \u2014 for man\u2019s vast\nfuture \u2014 thanks to all.\nPeace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will\ncome soon, and come to stay, and so come as to be worth\nthe keeping in all future time. It will then have been proved\nthat among freemen there can be no successful appeal from\nthe ballot to the bullet, and that they who take such appeal\nare sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And there will\nbe some black men who can remember that with silent\ntongue, and clinched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised\nbayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great\nconsummation; while I fear there will be some white ones\nunable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful\nspeech they have striven to hinder it.\n Still, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy, \ufb01nal\ntriumph. Let us be quite sober. Let us diligently apply the\nmeans, never doubting that a just God, in His own good\ntime, will give us the rightful result.\nYours very truly,\nA.

In order to do this, let our mustering o\ufb00icers in New\nYork and elsewhere be at, once instructed that whenever\nthey muster into our service any number of volunteers, to\nat once make return to the War Department, both by\ntelegraph and mail, the date of the muster, the number\nmustered, and the Congressional or enrolment district or\ndistricts, of their residences, giving the numbers separately\nfor each district.

You need not to be reminded that it is the\nnick of time for reinaugurating a loyal State government.\nNot a moment should be lost. You and the co-operating\nfriends there can better judge of the ways and means than\ncan be judged by any here. I only o\ufb00er a few suggestions.\nThe reinauguration must not be such as to give control of\nthe State and its representation in Congress to the enemies\nof the Union, driving its friends there into political exile.\nThe whole struggle for Tennessee will have been pro\ufb01tless\nto both State and nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson\nis put down and Governor Harris put up. It must not be so.\nYou must have it otherwise. Let the reconstruction be the\nwork of such men only as can be trusted for the Union.\nExclude all others, and trust that your government so\norganized will be recognized here as being the one of\nrepublican form to be guaranteed to the State, and to be\nprotected against invasion and domestic violence. It is\nsomething on the question of time to remember that it\ncannot be known who is next to occupy the position I now\n hold, nor what he will do. I see that you have declared in\nfavor of emancipation in Tennessee, for which may God\nbless \nyou. \nGet \nemancipation \ninto \nyour \nnew \nState\ngovernment constitution and there will be no such word as\nfail for your cause. The raising of colored troops, I think,\nwill greatly help every way.\nYours very truly, A.

LINCOLN\n I I A      A   \nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK\nE ECUTIVE \nMANSION, \nWASHINGTON \nD.C.\nSeptember , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\nBy General Meade\u2019s despatch to you of yesterday it\nappears that he desires your views and those of the\ngovernment as to whether he shall advance upon the\nenemy. I am not prepared to order, or even advise, an\nadvance in this case, wherein I know so little of particulars,\nand wherein he, in the \ufb01eld, thinks the risk is so great and\nthe promise of advantage so small.\nAnd yet the case presents matter for very serious\nconsideration in another aspect. These two armies confront\neach other across a small river, substantially midway\nbetween the two capitals, each defending its own capital,\nand menacing the other. General Meade estimates the\nenemy\u2019s infantry in front of him at not less than ,.\nSuppose we add \ufb01fty per cent. to this for cavalry, artillery,\nand extra-duty men stretching as far as Richmond, making\nthe whole force of the enemy ,.\nGeneral Meade, as shown by the returns, has with him,\nand between him and Washington, of the same classes, of\nwell men, over ,. Neither can bring the whole of his\n men into a battle; but each can bring as large a percentage\nin as the other. For a battle, then, General Meade has three\nmen to General Lee\u2019s two. Yet, it having been determined\nthat choosing ground and standing on the defensive gives\nso great advantage that the three cannot safely attack the\ntwo, the three are left simply standing on the defensive\nalso.\nIf the enemy\u2019s , are su\ufb00icient to keep our ,\naway from Richmond, why, by the same rule, may not\n, of ours keep their , away from Washington,\nleaving us , to put to some other use? Having\npractically come to the mere defensive, it seems to be no\neconomy at all to employ twice as many men for that object\nas are needed. With no object, certainly, to mislead myself,\nI can perceive no fault in this statement, unless we admit\nwe are not the equal of the enemy, man for man. I hope you\nwill consider it.\nTo avoid misunderstanding, let me say that to attempt to\n\ufb01ght the enemy slowly back into his entrenchments at\nRichmond, and then to capture him, is an idea I have been\ntrying to repudiate for quite a year.\nMy judgment is so clear against it that I would scarcely\nallow the attempt to be made if the general in command\nshould desire to make it. My last attempt upon Richmond\nwas to get McClellan, when he was nearer there than the\nenemy was, to run in ahead of him. Since then I have\nconstantly desired the Army of the Potomac to make Lee\u2019s\narmy, and not Richmond, its objective point. If our army\ncannot fall upon the enemy and hurt him where he is, it is\n plain to me it can gain nothing by attempting to follow him\nover a succession of intrenched lines into a forti\ufb01ed city.\nYours truly,\nA.

C., September\n, .\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK: I think it very important\nfor General Rosecrans to hold his position at or about\nChattanooga, because if held from that place to Cleveland,\nboth inclusive, it keeps all Tennessee clear of the enemy,\nand also breaks one of his most important railroad lines. To\nprevent these consequences is so vital to his cause that he\ncannot give up the e\ufb00ort to dislodge us from the position,\nthus bringing him to us and saving us the labor, expense,\nand hazard of going farther to \ufb01nd him, and also giving us\nthe advantage of choosing our own ground and preparing it\nto \ufb01ght him upon. The details must, of course, be left to\nGeneral Rosecrans, while we must furnish him the means\nto the utmost of our ability. If you concur, I think he would\nbetter be informed that we are not pushing him beyond this\nposition; and that, in fact, our judgment is rather against\nhis going beyond it. If he can only maintain this position,\nwithout more, this rebellion can only eke out a short and\nfeeble existence, as an animal sometimes may with a thorn\nin its vitals.\nYours truly, A.

SCHOFIELD:\nThere is no organized military force in avowed opposition\nto the General Government now in Missouri, and if any\nshall reappear, your duty in regard to it will be too plain to\nrequire any special instruction. Still, the condition of\nthings, both there and elsewhere, is such as to render it\nindispensable to maintain, for a time, the United States\nmilitary establishment in that State, as well as to rely upon\nit for a fair contribution of support to that establishment\ngenerally. Your immediate duty in regard to Missouri now is\nto advance the e\ufb00iciency of that establishment, and to so\nuse it, as far as practicable, to compel the excited people\nthere to let one another alone.\nUnder your recent order, which I have approved, you will\nonly arrest individuals, and suppress assemblies or\nnewspapers, when they may be working palpable injury to\nthe military in your charge; and in no other case will you\ninterfere with the expression of opinion in any form, or\nallow it to be interfered with violently by others. In this you\nhave a discretion to exercise with great caution, calmness,\nand forbearance.\n With the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain\ncounties en masse, and of removing certain individuals\nfrom time to time, who are supposed to be mischievous, I\nam not now interfering, but am leaving to your own\ndiscretion.\nNor am I interfering with what may still seem to you to\nbe necessary restrictions upon trade and intercourse. I\nthink proper, however, to enjoin upon you the following:\nAllow no part of the military under your command to be\nengaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or\nenticing slaves from their homes; and, so far as practicable,\nenforce the same forbearance upon the people.\nReport to me your opinion upon the availability for good\nof the enrolled militia of the State. Allow no one to enlist\ncolored troops, except upon orders from you, or from here\nthrough you.\nAllow no one to assume the functions of con\ufb01scating\nproperty, under the law of Congress, or otherwise, except\nupon orders from here.\nAt elections see that those, and only those, are allowed to\nvote who are entitled to do so by the laws of Missouri,\nincluding as of those laws the restrictions laid by the\nMissouri convention upon those who may have participated\nin the rebellion.\nSo far as practicable, you will, by means of your military\nforce, expel guerrillas, marauders, and murderers, and all\nwho are known to harbor, aid, or abet them. But in like\nmanner you will repress assumptions of unauthorized\nindividuals to perform the same service, because under\n pretense of doing this they become marauders and\nmurderers themselves.\nTo now restore peace, let the military obey orders, and\nthose not of the military leave each other alone, thus not\nbreaking the peace themselves.\nIn giving the above directions, it is not intended to\nrestrain you in other expedient and necessary matters not\nfalling within their range.\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

To\nthese bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are\nprone to forget the source from which they come, others\nhave been added which are of so extraordinary a nature\nthat they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart\nwhich \nis \nhabitually \ninsensible \nto \nthe \never-watchful\nprovidence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of\nunequalled magnitude and severity which has sometimes\nseemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign\nstates; peace has been preserved with all nations, order has\nbeen maintained, the laws have been respected and\nobeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in\nthe theatre of military con\ufb02ict; while that theatre has been\ngreatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of\nthe Union. The needful diversion of wealth and strength\nfrom the \ufb01elds of peaceful industry, to the national defense\nhas not arrested the plough, the shuttle, or the ship: The\naxe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the\nmines, as well of, iron and coal as of the precious metals,\n have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore.\nPopulation has steadily increased, notwithstanding the\nwaste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the\nbattle-\ufb01eld; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness\nof augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a\ncontinuance of years, with large increase of freedom.\nNo human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal\nhand worked out these great things. They are the gracious\ngifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in\nanger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.\nIt has seemed to me \ufb01t and proper that they should be\nreverently, solemnly, and gratefully acknowledged, as with\none heart and voice, by the whole American people. I do,\ntherefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the\nUnited States, and also those who are at sea, and those\nwho are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and\nobserve the last Thursday of November next as a day of\nthanksgiving and prayer to our bene\ufb01cent Father who\ndwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that,\nwhile o\ufb00ering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such\nsingular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with\nhumble penitence for our national perverseness and\ndisobedience, commend to His tender care all those who\nhave become widows, orphans, mourners, or su\ufb00erers in\nthe lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably\nengaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the\nAlmighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to\nrestore it, as soon as may be consistent with divine\n purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony,\ntranquillity, and union.\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\nDone at the city of Washington, this third day of October,\nin the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\nsixty-three, and of the independence of the United States\nthe eighty-eighth.\nA.

I think you and Burnside can do this, and hence doing\nso is your main object. Of course to greatly damage or\ndestroy the enemy in your front would be a greater object,\nbecause it would include the former and more, but it is not\nso certainly within your power. I understand the main body\nof the enemy is very near you, so near that you could\n\u201cboard at home,\u201d so to speak, and menace or attack him\nany day. Would not the doing of this be your best mode of\ncounteracting his raid on your communications? But this is\nnot an order. I intend doing something like what you\nsuggest whenever the case shall appear ripe enough to\nhave it accepted in the true understanding rather than as a\nconfession of weakness and fear.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n  . \n. \n A   A\n \n H   .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October , .\nHON. CHARLES D. DRAKE AND OTHERS, Committee.\nGENTLEMEN:-Your original address, presented on the\nth ult., and the four supplementary ones presented on\nthe d inst., have been carefully considered. I hope you will\nregard the other duties claiming my attention, together\nwith the great length and importance of these documents,\nas constituting a su\ufb00icient apology for not having\nresponded sooner.\nThese papers, framed for a common object, consist of the\nthings demanded and the reasons for demanding them.\nThe things demanded are\nFirst. That General Scho\ufb01eld shall be relieved, and\nGeneral Butler be appointed as Commander of the Military\nDepartment of Missouri.\nSecond. That the system of enrolled militia in Missouri\nmay be broken up, and national forces he substituted for it;\nand\nThird. That at elections persons may not be allowed to\nvote who are not entitled by law to do so.\nAmong the reasons given, enough of su\ufb00ering and wrong\nto Union men is certainly, and I suppose truly, stated. Yet\nthe whole case, as presented, fails to convince me that\n General Scho\ufb01eld, or the enrolled militia, is responsible for\nthat su\ufb00ering and wrong. The whole can be explained on a\nmore charitable, and, as I think, a more rational hypothesis.\nWe are in a civil war. In such cases there always is a\nmain question, but in this case that question is a perplexing\ncompound \u2014 Union and slavery. It thus becomes a question\nnot of two sides merely, but of at least four sides, even\namong those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those\nwho are against it. Thus, those who are for the Union with,\nbut not without slavery; those for it without, but not with;\nthose for it with or without, but prefer it with; and those for\nit with or without, but prefer it without.\nAmong these, again, is a subdivision of those who are for\ngradual, but not for immediate, and those who are for\nimmediate, but not for gradual extinction of slavery.\nIt is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion, and\neven more, may be sincerely entertained by honest and\ntruthful men. Yet, all being for the Union, by reason of\nthese di\ufb00erences each will prefer a di\ufb00erent way of\nsustaining the Union. At once, sincerity is questioned, and\nmotives are assailed. Actual war comming, blood grows hot\nand blood is spilled. Thought is forced from old channels\ninto confusion. Deception breeds and thrives. Con\ufb01dence\ndies, and universal suspicion reigns. Each man feels an\nimpulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be killed by him.\nRevenge and retaliation follow. And all this, as before said,\nmay be among honest men only. But this is not all. Every\nfoul bird comes abroad, and every dirty reptile rises up.\nThese add crime to confusion. Strong measures deemed\n indispensable, but harsh at best, such men make worse by\nmaladministration. Murders for old grudges, and murders\nfor self, proceed under any cloak that will best serve for the\noccasion.\nThese causes amply account for what has occurred in\nMissouri, \nwithout \nascribing \nit \nto \nthe \nweakness \nor\nwickedness of any general. The newspaper \ufb01les, those\nchroniclers of current events, will show that the evils now\ncomplained of were quite as prevalent under Fremont,\nHunter, Halleck, and Curtis, as under Scho\ufb01eld. If the\nformer had greater force opposed to them, they also had\ngreater force with which to meet it. When the organized\nrebel army left the State, the main Federal force had to go\nalso, leaving the department commander at home relatively\nno stronger than before. Without disparaging any, I a\ufb00irm\nwith con\ufb01dence that no commander of that department\nhas, in proportion to his means, done better than General\nScho\ufb01eld.\nThe \ufb01rst speci\ufb01c charge against General Scho\ufb01eld is,\nthat the enrolled militia was placed under his command,\nwhereas it had not been placed under the command of\nGeneral Curtis. The fact is, I believe, true; but you do not\npoint out, nor can I conceive, how that did, or could, injure\nloyal men or the Union cause.\nYou charge that, General Curtis being superseded by\nGeneral Scho\ufb01eld, Franklin A. Dick was superseded by\nJames O. Broadhead as Provost-Marshal General. No very\nspeci\ufb01c showing is made as to how this did or could injure\nthe Union cause. It recalls, however, the condition of\n things, as presented to me, which led to a change of\ncommander of that department.\nTo restrain contraband intelligence and trade, a system\nof searches, seizures, permits, and passes, had been\nintroduced, I think, by General Fremont. When General\nHalleck came, he found and continued the system, and\nadded an order, applicable to some parts of the State, to\nlevy and collect contributions from noted rebels, to\ncompensate losses and relieve destitution caused by the\nrebellion. The action of General Fremont and General\nHalleck, as stated, constituted a sort of system which\nGeneral Curtis found in full operation when he took\ncommand of the department. That there was a necessity for\nsomething of the sort was clear; but that it could only be\njusti\ufb01ed by stern necessity, and that it was liable to great\nabuse in administration, was equally clear. Agents to\nexecute it, contrary to the great prayer, were led into\ntemptation. Some might, while others would not, resist that\ntemptation. It was not possible to hold any to a very strict\naccountability; and those yielding to the temptation would\nsell permits and passes to those who would pay most and\nmost readily for them, and would seize property and collect\nlevies in the aptest way to \ufb01ll their own pockets. Money\nbeing the object, the man having money, whether loyal or\ndisloyal, would be a victim. This practice doubtless existed\nto some extent, and it was, a real additional evil that it\ncould be, and was, plausibly charged to exist in greater\nextent than it did.\n When General Curtis took command of the department,\nMr. Dick, against whom I never knew anything to allege,\nhad general charge of this system. A controversy in regard\nto it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable proportions.\nOne side ignored the necessity and magni\ufb01ed the evils of\nthe system, while the other ignored the evils and magni\ufb01ed\nthe necessity; and each bitterly assailed the other. I could\nnot fail to see that the controversy enlarged in the same\nproportion as the professed Union men there distinctly took\nsides in two opposing political parties. I exhausted my wits,\nand very nearly my patience also, in e\ufb00orts to convince\nboth that the evils they charged on each other were\ninherent in the case, and could not be cured by giving\neither party a victory over the other.\nPlainly, the irritating system was not to be perpetual; and\nit was plausibly urged that it could be modi\ufb01ed at once with\nadvantage. The case could scarcely be worse, and whether\nit could be made better could only be determined by a trial.\nIn this view, and not to ban or brand General Curtis, or to\ngive a victory to any party, I made the change of\ncommander for the department. I now learn that soon after\nthis change Mr. Dick was removed, and that Mr.\nBroadhead, a gentleman of no less good character, was put\nin the place. The mere fact of this change is more distinctly\ncomplained of than is any conduct of the new o\ufb00icer, or\nother consequence of the change.\nI gave the new commander no instructions as to the\nadministration of the system mentioned, beyond what is\ncontained in the private letter afterwards surreptitiously\n published, in which I directed him to act solely for the\npublic good, and independently of both parties. Neither any\nthing you have presented me, nor anything I have\notherwise learned, has convinced me that he has been\nunfaithful to this charge.\nImbecility is urged as one cause for removing General\nScho\ufb01eld; and the late massacre at Lawrence, Kansas, is\npressed as evidence of that imbecility. To my mind that fact\nscarcely tends to prove the proposition. That massacre is\nonly an example of what Grierson, John Morgan, and many\nothers might have repeatedly done on their respective\nraids, had they chosen to incur the personal hazard, and\npossessed the \ufb01endish hearts to do it.\nThe charge is made that General Scho\ufb01eld, on purpose to\nprotect the Lawrence murderers, would not allow them to\nbe pursued into Missouri. While no punishment could be\ntoo sudden or too severe for those murderers, I am well\nsatis\ufb01ed that the preventing of the threatened remedial\nraid into Missouri was the only way to avoid an\nindiscriminate massacre there, including probably more\ninnocent than guilty. Instead of condemning, I therefore\napprove what I understand General Scho\ufb01eld did in that\nrespect.\nThe charges that General Scho\ufb01eld has purposely\nwithheld protection from loyal people and purposely\nfacilitated the objects of the disloyal are altogether beyond\nmy power of belief. I do not arraign the veracity of\ngentlemen as to the facts complained of, but I do more than\nquestion the judgment which would infer that those facts\n occurred in accordance with the purposes of General\nScho\ufb01eld.\nWith my present views, I must decline to remove General\nScho\ufb01eld. In this I decide nothing against General Butler. I\nsincerely wish it were convenient to assign him a suitable\ncommand. In order to meet some existing evils I have\naddressed a letter of instructions to General Scho\ufb01eld, a\ncopy of which I enclose to you.\nAs to the enrolled militia, I shall endeavor to ascertain\nbetter than I now know what is its exact value. Let me say\nnow, however, that your proposal to substitute national\nforces for the enrolled militia implies that in your judgment\nthe latter is doing something which needs to be done; and if\nso, the proposition to throw that force away and to supply\nits place by bringing other forces from the \ufb01eld where they\nare urgently needed seems to me very extraordinary.\nWhence shall they come? Shall they be withdrawn from\nBanks, or Grant, or Steele, or Rosecrans? Few things have\nbeen so grateful to my anxious feelings as when, in June\nlast, the local force in Missouri aided General Scho\ufb01eld to\nso promptly send a large general force to the relief of\nGeneral Grant, then investing Vicksburg and menaced from\nwithout by General Johnston. Was this all wrong? Should\nthe enrolled militia then have been broken up and General\nHerron kept from Grant to police Missouri? So far from\n\ufb01nding cause to object, I confess to a sympathy for\nwhatever relieves our general force in Missouri and allows\nit to serve elsewhere. I therefore, as at present advised,\ncannot attempt the destruction of the enrolled militia of\n Missouri. I may add that, the force being under the national\nmilitary control, it is also within the proclamation in regard\nto the habeas corpus.\nI concur in the propriety of your request in regard to\nelections, and have, as you see, directed General Scho\ufb01eld\naccordingly. I do not feel justi\ufb01ed to enter upon the broad\n\ufb01eld you present in regard to the political di\ufb00erences\nbetween Radicals and Conservatives. From time to time I\nhave done and said what appeared to me proper to do and\nsay. The public knows it all. It obliges nobody to follow me,\nand I trust it obliges me to follow nobody. The Radicals and\nConservatives each agree with me in some things and\ndisagree in others. I could wish both to agree with me in all\nthings, for then they would agree with each other, and\nwould be too strong for any foe from any quarter. They,\nhowever, choose to do otherwise; and I do not question\ntheir right. I too shall do what seems to be my duty. I hold\nwhoever commands in Missouri or elsewhere responsible to\nme and not to either Radicals or Conservatives. It is my\nduty to hear all, but at last I must, within my sphere, judge\nwhat to do and what to forbear.\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

HA     .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\nTaking all our information together, I think it probable\nthat Ewell\u2019s corps has started for East Tennessee by way of\nAbingdon, marching last Monday, say from Meade\u2019s front\ndirectly to the railroad at Charlottesville.\nFirst, the object of Lee\u2019s recent movement against\nMeade; his destruction of the Alexandria and Orange\nRailroad, and subsequent withdrawal without more motive,\nnot otherwise apparent, would be explained by this\nhypothesis.\nSecondly, the direct statement of Sharpe\u2019s men that\nEwell has gone to Tennessee.\nThirdly, the Irishman\u2019s [Northern Spy in Richmond]\nstatement that he has not gone through Richmond, and his\nfurther statement of an appeal made to the people at\nRichmond to go and protect their salt, which could only\nrefer to the works near Abingdon.\nFourthly, Graham\u2019s statement from Martinsburg that\nImboden is in retreat for Harrisonburg. This last matches\nwith the idea that Lee has retained his cavalry, sending\nImboden and perhaps other scraps to join Ewell. Upon this\nprobability what is to be done?\n If you have a plan matured, I have nothing to say. If you\nhave not, then I suggest that, with all possible expedition,\nthe Army of the Potomac get ready to attack Lee, and that\nin the meantime a raid shall, at all hazards, break the\nrailroad at or near Lynchburg.\nYours truly,\nA.

At the time, it was under General Milroy as\nimmediate commander in the \ufb01eld, General Schenck as\ndepartment commander at Baltimore, and General Halleck\nas general-in-chief at Washington.\nGeneral Milroy, as immediate commander, was put in\narrest, and subsequently a court of inquiry examined\nchie\ufb02y with reference to disobedience of orders, and\nreported the evidence.\nThe foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence,\ntogether with the judge-advocate-general\u2019s conclusions.\nThe disaster, when it came, was a surprise to all. It was\nvery well known to Generals Shenck and Milroy for some\ntime before, that General Halleck thought the division was\nin great danger of a surprise at Winchester; that it was of\nno service commensurate with the risk it incurred, and that\nit ought to be withdrawn; but, although he more than once\nadvised its withdrawal, he never positively ordered it.\nGeneral Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of\nthe force at Winchester was worth the hazard, and so did\nnot positively order its withdrawal until it was so late that\n the enemy cut the wire and prevented the order reaching\nGeneral Milroy.\nGeneral Milroy seems to have concurred with General\nSchenck in the opinion that the force should be kept at\nWinchester at least until the approach of danger, but he\ndisobeyed no order upon the subject.\nSome question can be made whether some of General\nHalleck\u2019s dispatches to General Schenk should not have\nbeen construed to be orders to withdraw the force, and\nobeyed accordingly; but no such question can be made\nagainst General Milroy. In fact, the last order he received\nwas to be prepared to withdraw, but not to actually\nwithdraw until further order, which further order never\nreached him.\nSerious blame is not necessarily due to any serious\ndisaster, and I cannot say that in this case any of the\no\ufb00icers are deserving of serious blame. No court-martial is\ndeemed necessary or proper in the case.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n \n  A    H\n I  \n.\nPrivate and con\ufb01dential \nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October ,\n.\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD: There have recently\nreached the War Department, and thence been laid before\nme, from Missouri, three communications, all similar in\nimport and identical in object. One of them, addressed to\nnobody, and without place or date, but having the signature\nof (apparently) the writer, is a letter of eight closely written\nfoolscap pages. The other two are written by a di\ufb00erent\nperson, at St. Joseph, Mo., and of the dates, respectively,\nOctober  and , , and each inclosing a large\nnumber of a\ufb00idavits. The general statements of the whole\nare that the Federal and State authorities are arming the\ndisloyal and disarming the loyal, and that the latter will all\nbe killed or driven out of the State unless there shall be a\nchange. In particular, no loyal man who has been disarmed\nis named, but the a\ufb00idavits show by name forty-two\npersons as disloyal who have been armed. They are as\nfollows: [The names are omitted.]\nA majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel\nservice. I believe it could be shown that the government\nhere has deliberately armed more than ten times as many\ncaptured at Gettysburg, to say nothing of similar operations\n in East Tennessee. These papers contain altogether thirty\n\u2014 one manuscript pages, and one newspaper in extenso,\nand yet I do not \ufb01nd it anywhere charged in them that any\nloyal man has been harmed by reason of being disarmed, or\nthat any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of\nbeing armed by the Federal or State Government. Of\ncourse, I have not had time to carefully examine all; but I\nhave had most of them examined and briefed by others, and\nthe result is as stated. The remarkable fact that the actual\nevil is yet only anticipated \u2014 inferred \u2014 induces me to\nsuppose I understand the case; but I do not state my\nimpression, because I might be mistaken, and because your\nduty and mine is plain in any event.

My wish, then, is\ncompounded of what I believe will be best for the country;\nand it is that he will come here, put his military commission\nin my hands, take his seat, go into caucus with our friends,\nabide the nominations, help elect the nominees, and thus\naid to organize a House of Representatives which will really\nsupport the Government in the war. If the result shall be\nthe election of himself as Speaker, let him serve in that\nposition. If not, let him retake his commission and return to\nthe army for the bene\ufb01t of the country.\nThis will heal a dangerous schism for him. It will relieve\nhim from a dangerous position or a misunderstanding, as I\nthink he is in danger of being permanently separated from\nthose with whom only he can ever have a real sympathy \u2014\nthe sincere opponents of slavery.\nIt will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations\no\ufb00ered him by insincere time-servers to drive him from the\n house of his own building. He is young yet. He has\nabundant talents \u2014 quite enough to occupy all his time\nwithout devoting any to temper.\nHe is rising in military skill and usefulness. His recent\nappointment to the command of a corps, by one so\ncompetent to judge as General Sherman, proves this. In\nthat line he can serve both the country and himself more\npro\ufb01tably than he could as a member of Congress upon the\n\ufb02oor.\nThe foregoing is what I would say if Frank Blair was my\nbrother instead of yours.\nYours truly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n   \n    A\n \n \n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November ,\n.\nHIS E CELLENCY A. W. BRADFORD, Governor of\nMaryland.\nSIR: \u2014 Yours of the st ult. was received yesterday\nabout noon, and since then I have been giving most earnest\nattention to the subject-matter of it. At my call General\nSchenck has attended, and he assures me it is almost\ncertain that violence will be used at some of the voting\nplaces on election day unless prevented by his provost-\nguards. He says that at some of those places Union voters\nwill not attend at all, or run a ticket, unless they have some\nassurance of protection. This makes the Missouri case, of\nmy action in regard to which you express your approval.\nThe remaining point of your letter is a protest against\nany person o\ufb00ering to vote being put to any test not found\nin the laws of Maryland. This brings us to a di\ufb00erence\nbetween Missouri and Maryland. With the same reason in\nboth States, Missouri has, by law, provided a test for the\nvoter with reference to the present rebellion, while\nMaryland has not. For example, General Trimble, captured\n\ufb01ghting us at Gettysburg, is, without recanting his treason,\na legal voter by the laws of Maryland. Even General\n Schenck\u2019s order admits him to vote, if he recants upon\noath. I think that is cheap enough. My order in Missouri,\nwhich you approve, and General Scherick\u2019s order here,\nreach precisely the same end. Bach assures the right of\nvoting to all loyal men, and whether a man is loyal, each\nallows that man to \ufb01x by his own oath. Your suggestion that\nnearly all the candidates are loyal, I do not think quite\nmeets the case. In this struggle for the nation\u2019s life, I\ncannot so con\ufb01dently rely on those whose elections may\nhave depended upon disloyal votes. Such men, when\nelected, may prove true; but such votes are given them in\nthe expectation that they will prove false.\nNor do I think that to keep the peace at the polls, and to\nprevent the persistently disloyal from voting, constitutes\njust cause of o\ufb00ense to Maryland. I think she has her own\nexample for it. If I mistake not, it is precisely what General\nDix did when your Excellency was elected Governor.\nI revoke the \ufb01rst of the three propositions in General\nSchenek\u2019s General Order No. ; not that it is wrong in\nprinciple, but because the military, being of necessity\nexclusive judges as to who shall be arrested, the provision\nis too liable to abuse. For the revoked part I substitute the\nfollowing:\nThat, all provost-marshals and other military o\ufb00icers do\nprevent all disturbance and violence at or about the polls,\nwhether o\ufb00ered by such persons as above described, or by\nany other person or persons whomsoever.\nThe other two propositions of the order I allow to stand.\nGeneral Schenek is fully determined, and has my strict\n orders besides, that all loyal men may vote, and vote for\nwhom they please.\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

It says \u201cGeneral Scho\ufb01eld has refused\nleave of absence to members in military service to attend\nthe legislature. All such are radical and administration\nmen. The election of two Senators from this place on\nThursday will probably turn upon this thing.\u201d what does\nthis mean? Of course members of the legislation must be\nallowed to attend its sessions.

We are met on a great battle-\ufb01eld of that\nwar. We have come to dedicate a portion of that \ufb01eld, as a\n\ufb01nal resting place for those who here gave their lives that\nthat nation might live. It is altogether \ufb01tting and proper\nthat we should do this.\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate \u2014 we can not\nconsecrate \u2014 we can not hallow \u2014 this ground. The brave\nmen, \nliving \nand \ndead, \nwho \nstruggled \nhere, \nhave\nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\nThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say\nhere, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us\nthe living, rather, to be dedicated here to the un\ufb01nished\nwork which they who fought here have thus far so nobly\nadvanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the\ngreat task remaining before us \u2014 that from these honored\ndead we take increased devotion to that cause for which\nthey gave the last full measure of devotion that we here\n highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain \u2014\nthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of\nfreedom \u2014 and that government of the people, by the\npeople, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \n A\n .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.

So help me God.\u201d\nThe persons excepted from the bene\ufb01ts of the foregoing\nprovisions are all who are or shall have been civil or\ndiplomatic o\ufb00icers or agents of the so-called Confederate\nGovernment; all who have left judicial stations under the\nUnited States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have\nbeen military or naval o\ufb00icers of said so-called Confederate\nGovernment above the rank of colonel in the army or of\nlieutenant in the navy; all who left seats in the United\nStates Congress to aid the rebellion; all who resigned\ncommissions in the Army or Navy of the United States and\nafterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged\nin any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in\ncharge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war,\nand which persons may have been found in the United\nStates service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity.\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that\nwhenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas,\nLouisiana, \nMississippi, \nTennessee, \nAlabama, \nGeorgia,\nFlorida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of\npersons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast\nin such State at the Presidential election of the year A.D.\n, each having taken oath aforesaid, and not having\nsince violated it, and being a quali\ufb01ed voter by the election\n law of the State existing immediately before the so-called\nact of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish\na State government which shall be republican and in\nnowise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as\nthe true government of the State, and the State shall\nreceive thereunder the bene\ufb01ts of the constitutional\nprovision which declares that \u201cthe United States shall\nguarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of\ngovernment and shall protect each of them against\ninvasion, and, on application of the legislature, or the\nE ECUTIVE (when the legislature can not be convened),\nagainst domestic violence.\u201d\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that\nany provision which may be adopted by such State\ngovernment in relation to the freed people of such State\nwhich shall recognize and declare their permanent\nfreedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be\nconsistent as a temporary arrangement with their present\ncondition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class, will\nnot be objected to by the National E ECUTIVE.\nAnd it is suggested as not improper that in constructing\na loyal State government in any State the name of the\nState, the boundary, the subdivisions, the constitution, and\nthe general code of laws as before the rebellion be\nmaintained, subject only to the modi\ufb01cations made\nnecessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such\nothers, if any, not contravening said co and which may be\ndeemed expedient by those framing the new State\ngovernment.\n To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that\nthis proclamation, so far as it relates to State governments,\nhas no reference to States wherein loyal State governments\nhave all the while been maintained. And for the same\nreason it may be proper to further say that whether\nmembers sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted\nto \nseats \nconstitutionally \nrests \nexclusively \nwith \nthe\nrespective Houses, and not to any extent with the\nE ECUTIVE. And, still further, that this proclamation is\nintended to present the people of the States wherein the\nnational authority has been suspended and loyal State\ngovernments have been subverted a mode in and by which\nthe national authority and loyal State governments may be\nre-established within said States or in any of them; and\nwhile the mode presented is the best the E ECUTIVE can\nsuggest, with his present impressions, it must not be\nunderstood that no other possible mode would be\nacceptable.\nGiven under my hand at the city of WASHINGTON, the\nth day of December, A. D. , and of the Independence\nof the United States of America the eighty-eighth.\nA. LINCOLN.\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of\nState.\n A\n A  \n   A\n   \n  \n      \n   \n     \n    .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: \u2014\nAnother year of health, and of su\ufb00iciently abundant\nharvests, has passed. For these, and especially for the\nimproved condition cf our national a\ufb00airs, our renewed and\nprofoundest gratitude to God is due.\nWe remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.\nThe e\ufb00orts of disloyal citizens of the United States to\ninvolve us in foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable\ninsurrection, have been unavailing. Her Britannic Majesty\u2019s\ngovernment, as was justly expected, have exercised their\nauthority \nto \nprevent \nthe \ndeparture \nof \nnew \nhostile\nexpeditions from British ports. The Emperor of France has,\nby a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neutrality\nwhich he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest.\nQuestions of great intricacy and importance have arisen\nout of the blockade, and other belligerent operations,\nbetween the Government and several of the maritime\npowers, but they have been discussed, and, as far as was\npossible, accommodated, in a spirit of frankness, justice,\nand mutual good-will. It is especially gratifying that our\nprize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications, have\n commanded the respect and con\ufb01dence of maritime\npowers.\nThe supplemental treaty between the United States and\nGreat Britain for the suppression of the African slave-trade,\nmade on the th day of February last, has been duly\nrati\ufb01ed and carried into execution. It is believed that, so far\nas American ports and American citizens are concerned,\nthat inhuman and odious tra\ufb00ic has been brought to an\nend.\nI shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a\nconvention for the adjustment of possessory claims in\nWashington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the th of\nJune, , between the United States and Great Britain,\nand which have been the source of some disquiet among\nthe citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the\ncountry.\nA novel and important question, involving the extent of\nthe maritime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which\nsurround the island of Cuba, has been debated without\nreaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in an amicable\nspirit, to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power. A\nconvention for that purpose will be submitted to the\nSenate.\nI have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the\nSenate, to concur with the interested commercial powers in\nan arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues\nupon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in\nregard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of\nDenmark.\n The long-pending controversy between this government\nand that of Chile touching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by\nChilean o\ufb00icers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to\ncitizens of the United States has been brought to a close by\nthe award of His Majesty the King of the Belgians, to whose\narbitration the question was referred by the parties. The\nsubject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that\njustly respected magistrate, and although the sum awarded\nto the claimants may not have been as large as they\nexpected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His\nMajesty\u2019s decision. That decision was promptly complied\nwith by Chile when intelligence in regard to it reached that\ncountry.\nThe joint commission under the act of the last session of\ncarrying into e\ufb00ect the convention with Peru on the subject\nof claims has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the\nbusiness intrusted to it.\nDi\ufb00iculties concerning interoceanic transit through\nNicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment.\nIn conformity with principles set forth in my last annual\nmessage, I have received a representative from the United\nStates of Colombia, and have accredited a minister to that\nRepublic.\nIncidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have\nforced \nupon \nmy \nattention \nthe \nuncertain \nstate \nof\ninternational questions touching the rights of foreigners in\nthis country and of United States citizens abroad. In regard\nto some governments these rights are at least partially\nde\ufb01ned by treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly\n stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner residing\nin this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be\nexempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent,\nin whose behalf the government of his country can not\nexpect any privileges or immunities distinct from that\ncharacter. I regret to say, however, that such claims have\nbeen put forward, and in some instances in behalf of\nforeigners who have lived in the United States the greater\npart of their lives.\nThere is reason to believe that many persons born in\nforeign countries who have declared their intention to\nbecome citizens, or who have been fully naturalized have\nevaded the military duty required of them by denying the\nfact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden\nof proof. It has been found di\ufb00icult or impracticable to\nobtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper\nsources of information. These might be supplied by\nrequiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention\nmay \nbe \nmade \nor \nnaturalizations \ne\ufb00ected \nto \nsend\nperiodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or\ndeclaring their intention to become citizens to the\nSecretary of the Interior, in whose Department those names\nmight be arranged and printed for general information.\nThere is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently\nbecome citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of\nevading duties imposed by the laws of their native\ncountries, to which on becoming naturalized here they at\nonce repair, and though never returning to the United\nStates they still claim the interposition of this government\n as citizens. Many altercations and great prejudices have\nheretofore arisen out of this abuse. It is therefore\nsubmitted to your serious consideration. It might be\nadvisable to \ufb01x a limit beyond which no citizen of the\nUnited States residing abroad may claim the interposition\nof his government.\nThe right of su\ufb00rage has often been assumed and\nexercised by aliens under pretenses of naturalization,\nwhich they have disavowed when drafted into the military\nservice. I submit the expediency of such an amendment of\nthe law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against\nany plea of exemption from military service or other civil\nobligation on the ground of alienage.\nIn common with other Western powers, our relations\nwith Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy\nthrough \nthe \nperverse \nopposition \nof \nthe \nhereditary\naristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal\npolicy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the\nsociety of nations. It is hoped, although not with entire\ncon\ufb01dence, that these di\ufb00iculties may be peacefully\novercome. I ask your attention to the claim of the minister\nresiding there for the damages he sustained in the\ndestruction by \ufb01re of the residence of the legation at Yedo.\nSatisfactory arrangements have been made with the\nEmperor of Russia, which, it is believed, will result in\ne\ufb00ecting a continuous line of telegraph through that\nEmpire from our Paci\ufb01c coast.\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the subject\nof an international telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and\n also of a telegraph between this capital and the national\nforts along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico.\nSuch communications, established with any reasonable\noutlay, would be economical as well as e\ufb00ective aids to the\ndiplomatic, military, and naval service.\nThe consular system of the United States, under the\nenactments of the last Congress, begins to be self-\nsustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become\nentirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue\nwhenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have\nbeen faithful in defending American rights. In protecting\ncommercial interests our consuls have necessarily had to\nencounter increased labors and responsibilities growing\nout of the war. These they have for the most part met and\ndischarged with zeal and e\ufb00iciency. This acknowledgment\njustly includes those consuls who, residing in Morocco,\nEgypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and other Oriental countries,\nare charged with complex functions and extraordinary\npowers.\nThe condition of the several organized Territories is\ngenerally satisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New\nMexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral\nresources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, and\nArizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore\nunderstood. I lay before you a communication on this\nsubject from the Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to\nyour consideration the expediency of establishing a system\nfor the encouragement of immigration. Although this\nsource of national wealth and strength is again \ufb02owing with\n greater freedom than for several years before the\ninsurrection occurred, there is still a great de\ufb01ciency of\nlaborers in every \ufb01eld of industry, especially in agriculture\nand in our mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious\nmetals. While the demand for labor is much increased here,\ntens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative\noccupation, are thronging our foreign consulates and\no\ufb00ering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but\nvery cheap, assistance can be a\ufb00orded them. It is easy to\nsee that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is\nbeginning a new life. This noble e\ufb00ort demands the aid and\nought to receive the attention and support of the\nGovernment.\nInjuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended\nmay in some cases have been in\ufb02icted on the subjects or\ncitizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on land, by\npersons in the service of the United States. As this\ngovernment expects redress from other powers when\nsimilar injuries are in\ufb02icted by persons in their service\nupon citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to\ndo justice to foreigners. If the existing judicial tribunals are\ninadequate to this purpose, a special court may be\nauthorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of\nthe character referred to as may have arisen under treaties\nand the public law. Conventions for adjusting the claims by\njoint \ncommission \nhave \nbeen \nproposed \nto \nsome\ngovernments, but no de\ufb01nitive answer to the proposition\nhas yet been received from any.\n In the course of the session I shall probably have\noccasion to request you to provide indemni\ufb01cation to\nclaimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered\nand damages awarded by admiralty courts, and in other\ncases where this government may be acknowledged to be\nliable in principle and where the amount of that liability has\nbeen ascertained by an informal arbitration.\nThe proper o\ufb00icers of the Treasury have deemed\nthemselves required by the law of the United States upon\nthe subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign\nconsuls in this country. While such a demand may not in\nstrictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any\nexisting treaty between the United States and a foreign\ncountry, the expediency of so far modifying the act as to\nexempt from tax the income of such consuls as are not\ncitizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments\nof their o\ufb00ice or from property not situated in the United\nStates, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make\nthis suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought\nto be reciprocated exempts our consuls in all other\ncountries from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The\nUnited States, I think, ought not to be exceptionally\nilliberal to international trade and commerce.\nThe operations of the Treasury during the last year have\nbeen successfully conducted. The enactment by Congress\nof a national banking law has proved a valuable support of\nthe public credit, and the general legislation in relation to\nloans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers.\nSome amendments may be required to perfect existing\n laws, but no change in their principles or general scope is\nbelieved to be needed.\nSince these measures have been in operation all\ndemands on the Treasury, including the pay of the Army\nand Navy, have been promptly met and fully satis\ufb01ed. No\nconsiderable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more\namply provided and more liberally and punctually paid, and\nit may be added that by no people were the burdens\nincident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne.\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, including\nloans and balance in the Treasury at its commencement,\nwere  ,,., and the aggregate disbursements\n ,,., leaving a balance on the st of July, ,\nof  ,,.. Of the receipts there were derived from\ncustoms \n ,,., \nfrom \ninternal \nrevenue\n ,,., from direct tax  ,,., from lands\n ,., from miscellaneous sources  ,,.,\nand from loans  ,,., making the aggregate\n ,,.. Of the disbursements there were for the\ncivil service  ,,., for pensions and Indians\n ,,., for interest on public debt  ,,.,\nfor the War Department  ,,., for the Navy\nDepartment  ,,., for payment of funded and\ntemporary debt  ,,., making the aggregate\n ,,. and leaving the balance of  ,,..\nBut the payment of funded and temporary debt, having\nbeen made from moneys borrowed during the year, must be\nregarded as merely nominal payments and the moneys\nborrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts, and\n their \namount, \n ,,., \nshould \ntherefore \nbe\ndeducted both from receipts and disbursements. This being\ndone there remains as actual receipts  ,,. and\nthe actual disbursements  ,,., leaving the\nbalance as already stated.\nThe actual receipts and disbursements for the \ufb01rst\nquarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for\nthe remaining three-quarters of the current \ufb01scal year\n() will be shown in detail by the report of the Secretary\nof the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is\nsu\ufb00icient to say here that it is not believed that actual\nresults will exhibit a state of the \ufb01nances less favorable to\nthe country than the estimates of that o\ufb00icer heretofore\nsubmitted while it is con\ufb01dently expected that at the close\nof the year both disbursements and debt will be found very\nconsiderably less than has been anticipated.\nThe report of the Secretary of War is a document of great\ninterest. It consists of:\n. The military operations of the year, detailed in the\nreport of the General in Chief.\n. The organization of colored persons into the war\nservice.\n. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter\nof General Hitchcock.\n. The operations under the act for enrolling and calling\nout the national forces, detailed in the report of the Provost\nMarshal General.\n. The organization of the invalid corps, and\n . The operation of the several departments of the\nQuartermaster-General, Commissary-General, Paymaster-\nGeneral, Chief of Engineers, Chief of Ordnance, and\nSurgeon-General.\nIt has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary\nof this report, except such as would be too extended for\nthis place, and hence I content myself by asking your\ncareful attention to the report itself.\nThe duties devolving on the naval branch of the service\nduring the year and throughout the whole of this unhappy\ncontest have been discharged with \ufb01delity and eminent\nsuccess. The extensive blockade has been constantly\nincreasing in e\ufb00iciency as the Navy has expanded, yet on\nso long a line it has so far been impossible to entirely\nsuppress illicit trade. From returns received at the Navy\nDepartment it appears that more than , vessels have\nbeen captured since the blockade was instituted? and that\nthe value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts\nto over  ,,.\nThe naval force of the United States consists at this time\nof \ufb01ve hundred and eighty-eight vessels completed and in\nthe course of completion, and of these seventy-\ufb01ve are\nironclad or armored steamers. The events of the war give\nan increased interest and importance to the Navy which\nwill probably extend beyond the war itself.\nThe armored vessels in our Navy completed and in\nservice, or which are under contract and approaching\ncompletion, are believed to exceed in number those of any\nother power; but while these may be relied upon for harbor\n defense and coast service, others of greater strength and\ncapacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to\nmaintain our rightful position on the ocean.\nThe change that has taken place in naval vessels and\nnaval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive\npower for ships of war demands either a corresponding\nchange in some of our existing navy yards or the\nestablishment of new ones for the construction and\nnecessary \nrepair \nof \nmodern \nnaval \nvessels. \nNo\ninconsiderable embarrassment, delay, and public injury\nhave been experienced from the want of such governmental\nestablishments. The necessity of such a navy-yard, so\nfurnished, at some suitable place upon the Atlantic\nseaboard has on repeated occasions been brought to the\nattention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again\npresented \nin \nthe \nreport \nof \nthe \nSecretary \nwhich\naccompanies this communication. I think it my duty to\ninvite your special attention to this subject, and also to that\nof establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon\none of the Western rivers. A naval force has been created\non those interior waters, and under many disadvantages,\nwithin little more than two years, exceeding in numbers the\nwhole naval force of the country at the commencement of\nthe present Administration. Satisfactory and important as\nhave been the performances of the heroic men of the Navy\nat this interesting period, they are scarcely more wonderful\nthan the success of our mechanics and artisans in the\nproduction of war vessels, which has created a new form of\nnaval power.\n Our country has advantages superior to any other nation\nin our resources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible\nquantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all\navailable and in close proximity to navigable waters.\nWithout the advantage of public works, the resources of the\nnation have been developed and its power displayed in the\nconstruction of a Navy of such magnitude, which has at the\nvery period of its creation rendered signal service to the\nUnion.\nThe increase of the number of seamen in the public\nservice from , men in the spring of  to about\n, at the present time has been accomplished without\nspecial legislation or extraordinary bounties to promote\nthat increase. It has been found, however, that the\noperation of the draft, with the high bounties paid for army\nrecruits, is beginning to a\ufb00ect injuriously the naval service,\nand will, if not corrected, be likely to impair its e\ufb00iciency\nby detaching seamen from their proper vocation and\ninducing them to enter the Army. I therefore respectfully\nsuggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval\nservices by a de\ufb01nite provision on this subject which would\nat the same time be equitable to the communities more\nespecially interested.\nI commend to your consideration the suggestions of the\nSecretary of the Navy in regard to the policy of fostering\nand training seamen and also the education of o\ufb00icers and\nengineers for the naval service. The Naval Academy is\nrendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the\nhighly responsible duties which in after life they will be\n required to perform. In order that the country should not\nbe deprived of the proper quota of educated o\ufb00icers, for\nwhich legal provision has been made at the naval school,\nthe vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make\nnominations from the States in insurrection have been\n\ufb01lled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more\nfull and complete than at any former period, and in every\nrespect entitled to the favorable consideration of Congress.\nDuring the past \ufb01scal year the \ufb01nancial condition of the\nPost-O\ufb00ice Department has been one of increasing\nprosperity, and I am grati\ufb01ed in being able to state that the\nactual postal revenue has nearly equaled the entire\nexpenditures, the latter amounting to  ,,. and\nthe former to  ,,., leaving a de\ufb01ciency of but\n ,.. In , the year immediately preceding the\nrebellion, the de\ufb01ciency amounted to  ,,., the\npostal receipts of that year being  ,,. less that\nthose of . The decrease since  in the annual\namount of transportation has been only about twenty-\ufb01ve\nper cent, but the annual expenditure on account of the\nsame has been reduced thirty-\ufb01ve per cent. It is manifest,\ntherefore, that the Post-O\ufb00ice Department may become\nself-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of\nthe whole service.\nThe international conference of postal delegates from the\nprincipal countries of Europe and America, which was\ncalled at the suggestion of the Postmaster-General, met at\nParis on the th of May last and concluded its\ndeliberations on the th of June. The principles established\n by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal\nintercourse between nations and as the basis of future\npostal conventions inaugurate a general system of uniform\ninternational charges at reduced rates of postage, and can\nnot fail to produce bene\ufb01cial results.\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior,\nwhich is herewith laid before you, for useful and varied\ninformation in relation to the public lands, Indian a\ufb00airs,\npatents, pensions, and other matters of public concern\npertaining to his Department.\nThe quantity of land disposed of during the last and the\n\ufb01rst quarter of the present \ufb01scal years was ,,\nacres, of which , acres were sold for cash, ,,\nacres were taken up under the homestead law, and the\nresidue disposed of under laws granting lands for military\nbounties, for railroad and other purposes. It also appears\nthat the sale of the public lands is largely on the increase.\nIt has long been a cherished opinion of some of our\nwisest statesmen that the people of the United States had a\nhigher and more enduring interest in the early settlement\nand substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the\namount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of\nthem. This opinion has had a controlling in\ufb02uence in\nshaping legislation upon the subject of our national domain.\nI may cite as evidence of this the liberal measures adopted\nin reference to actual settlers; the grant to the States of the\nover\ufb02owed lands within their limits, in order to their being\nreclaimed and rendered \ufb01t for cultivation; the grants to\nrailway companies of alternate sections of land upon the\n contemplated lines of their roads, which when completed\nwill so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our\ndistant possessions. This policy has received its most signal\nand bene\ufb01cent illustration in the recent enactment\ngranting homesteads to actual settlers. Since the st day of\nJanuary last the before-mentioned quantity of ,,\nacres of land have been taken up under its provisions. This\nfact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of\nincreasing \nsettlement \nupon \nthe \npublic \nlands,\nnotwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of\nthe nation have been engaged, and which has required so\nlarge a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed\npursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the\nSecretary of the Interior suggesting a modi\ufb01cation of the\nact in favor of those engaged in the military and naval\nservice of the United States. I doubt not that Congress will\ncheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essentially\nchanging the general features of the system, secure to the\ngreatest practicable extent its bene\ufb01ts to those who have\nleft their homes in the defense of the country in this\narduous crisis.\nI invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to\nthe propriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue\nfrom the mineral lands of the United States.\nThe measures provided at your last session for the\nremoval of certain Indian tribes have been carried into\ne\ufb00ect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated, which will in\ndue time be submitted for the constitutional action of the\nSenate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the\n possessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts\nof lands. It is hoped that the e\ufb00ect of these treaties will\nresult in the establishment of permanent friendly relations\nwith such of these tribes as have been brought into\nfrequent and bloody collision with our outlying settlements\nand emigrants. Sound policy and our imperative duty to\nthese wards of the Government demand our anxious and\nconstant attention to their material well-being, to their\nprogress in the arts of civilization, and, above all, to that\nmoral training which under the blessing of Divine\nProvidence will confer upon them the elevated and\nsanctifying in\ufb02uences, the hopes and consolations, of the\nChristian faith.\nI suggested in my last annual message the propriety of\nremodeling our Indian system. Subsequent events have\nsatis\ufb01ed me of its necessity. The details set forth in the\nreport of the Secretary evince the urgent need for\nimmediate legislative action.\nI commend the benevolent institutions established or\npatronized by the Government in this District to your\ngenerous and fostering care.\nThe attention of Congress during the last session was\nengaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging\nthe water communication between the Mississippi River\nand \nthe \nnortheastern \nseaboard, \nwhich \nproposition,\nhowever, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the\ngreatest respectability, a convention has been held at\nChicago upon the same subject, a summary of whose views\nis contained in a memorial addressed to the President and\n Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before\nyou. That this interest is one which ere long will force its\nown way I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted\nentirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now.\nAugmented interest is given to this subject by the actual\ncommencement of work upon the Paci\ufb01c Railroad, under\nauspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion.\nThe enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the\ngreat road.\nI transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner\nof the Department of Agriculture, asking your attention to\nthe developments in that vital interest of the nation.\nWhen Congress assembled a year ago, the war had\nalready lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been\nmany con\ufb02icts on both land and sea, with varying results;\nthe rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits; yet\nthe tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad,\nwas not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections\nthen just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while,\namid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest words\ncoming from Europe were uttered in accents of pity that we\nare too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our commerce\nwas su\ufb00ering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and\nfurnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened\nwith such additions from the same quarter as would sweep\nour trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We had\nfailed to elicit from European governments anything\nhopeful upon this subject. The preliminary emancipation\nproclamation, issued in September, was running its\n assigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month\nlater \nthe \n\ufb01nal \nproclamation \ncame, \nincluding \nthe\nannouncement that colored men of suitable condition would\nbe \nreceived \ninto \nthe \nwar \nservice. \nThe \npolicy \nof\nemancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the\nfuture a new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt\ncontended in uncertain con\ufb02ict. According to our political\nsystem, as a matter of civil administration, the General\nGovernment had no lawful power to e\ufb00ect emancipation in\nany State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the\nrebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a\nmilitary measure. It was all the while deemed possible that\nthe necessity for it might come, and that if it should the\ncrisis of the contest would then be presented. It came, and,\nas was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful\ndays. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted\nto take another review. The rebel borders are pressed still\nfarther back, and by the complete opening of the\nMississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is\ndivided into distinct parts, with no practical communication\nbetween them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been\nsubstantially cleared of insurgent control, and in\ufb02uential\ncitizens in each, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery\nat the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for\nemancipation in their respective States. Of those States not\nincluded in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and\nMissouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate\nany restraint upon the extension of slavery into new\n Territories, dispute now only as to the best mode of\nremoving it within their own limits.\nOf those who were slaves at the beginning of the\nrebellion full , are now in the United States military\nservice, about one-half of which number actually bear arms\nin the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking so\nmuch labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the\nplaces which otherwise must be \ufb01lled with so many white\nmen. So far as tested, it is di\ufb00icult to say they are not as\ngood soldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to\nviolence \nor \ncruelty \nhas \nmarked \nthe \nmeasures \nof\nemancipation and arming the blacks. These measures have\nbeen \nmuch \ndiscussed \nin \nforeign \ncountries, \nand,\ncontemporary with such discussion, the tone of public\nsentiment there is much improved. At home the same\nmeasures have been fully discussed, supported, criticized,\nand denounced, and the annual elections following are\nhighly encouraging to those whose o\ufb00icial duty it is to bear\nthe country through this great trial. Thus we have the new\nreckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends\nof the Union is past.\nLooking now to the present and future, and with\nreference to a resumption of the national authority within\nthe States wherein that authority has been suspended, I\nhave thought \ufb01t to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is\nherewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation\nit will appear, as is believed, that nothing will be attempted\nbeyond what is amply justi\ufb01ed by the Constitution. True,\nthe form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take\n it. The man is promised a pardon only in case he voluntarily\ntakes the oath. The Constitution authorizes the Executive to\ngrant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute\ndiscretion, and this includes the power to grant on terms,\nas is fully established by judicial and other authorities.\nIt is also pro\ufb00ered that if in any of the States named a\nState government shall be in the mode prescribed set up,\nsuch government shall be recognized and guaranteed by\nthe United States, and that under it the State shall, on the\nconstitutional conditions, be protected against invasion and\ndomestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the\nUnited States to guarantee to every State in the Union a\nrepublican form of government and to protect the State in\nthe cases stated is explicit and full. But why tender the\nbene\ufb01ts of this provision only to a State government set up\nin this particular way? This section of the Constitution\ncontemplates a case wherein the element within a State\nfavorable to republican government in the Union may be\ntoo feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or\neven within the State, and such are precisely the cases with\nwhich we are now dealing.\nAn attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State\ngovernment, constructed in whole or in preponderating\npart from the very element against whose hostility and\nviolence it is to be protected, is simply absurd. There must\nbe a test by which to separate the opposing elements, so as\nto build only from the sound; and that test is a su\ufb00iciently\nliberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a\nsworn recantation of his former unsoundness.\n But if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the\npolitical body an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of\nthe United States and to the Union under it, why also to the\nlaws and proclamations in regard to slavery? Those laws\nand proclamations were enacted and put forth for the\npurpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To\ngive them their fullest e\ufb00ect there had to be a pledge for\ntheir maintenance. In my judgment, they have aided and\nwill further aid the cause for which they were intended. To\nnow abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever\nof power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding\nbreach of faith. I may add at this point that while I remain\nin my present position I shall not attempt to retract or\nmodify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to\nslavery any person who is free by the terms of that\nproclamation or by any of the acts of Congress. For these\nand other reasons it is thought best that support of these\nmeasures shall be included in the oath, and it is believed\nthe Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and\nrestoration of forfeited rights, which he has clear\nconstitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon\nthe terms which he shall deem wisest for the public\ninterest. It should be observed also that this part of the\noath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of\nlegislation and supreme judicial decision.\nThe proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in\nany reasonable temporary State arrangement for the freed\npeople is made with the view of possibly modifying the\nconfusion and destitution which must at best attend all\n classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole\nStates. It is hoped that the already deeply a\ufb04icted people\nin those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the\ncause of their a\ufb04iction if to this extent this vital matter be\nleft to themselves, while no power of the National\nExecutive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the\nproposition.\nThe suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the\npolitical framework of the States on what is called\nreconstruction is made in the hope that it may do good\nwithout danger of harm. It will save labor and avoid great\nconfusion.\nBut why any proclamation now upon this subject? This\nquestion is beset with the con\ufb02icting views that the step\nmight be delayed too long or be taken too soon. In some\nStates the elements for resumption seem ready for action,\nbut remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point\n\u2014 a plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather\nthan B that of A? And if A and B should agree, how can they\nknow but that the General Government here will reject\ntheir plan? By the proclamation a plan is presented which\nmay be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which\nthey are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This\nmay bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would.\nThe objections to a premature presentation of a plan by\nthe National Executive consist in the danger of committals\non points which could be more safely left to further\ndevelopments. Care has been taken to so shape the\ndocument as to avoid embarrassments from this source.\n Saying that on certain terms certain classes will be\npardoned with rights restored, it is not said that other\nclasses or other terms will never be included. Saying that\nreconstruction will be accepted if presented in a speci\ufb01ed\nway, it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way.\nThe movements by State action for emancipation in\nseveral of the States not included in the emancipation\nproclamation are matters of profound gratulation. And\nwhile I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so\nearnestly urged upon this subject my general views and\nfeelings remain unchanged and I trust that Congress will\nomit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to\na great consummation.\nIn the midst of other cares, however important we must\nnot lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our\nmain reliance. To that power alone we look yet for a time to\ngive con\ufb01dence to the people in the contested regions that\nthe insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that\ncon\ufb01dence shall be established little can be done anywhere\nwhat is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care must\nstill be directed to the Army and Navy who have thus far\nborne their harder part so nobly and well; and it may be\nesteemed fortunate that giving the greatest e\ufb00iciency to\nthese indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize\nthe gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose\nthem, and to whom more than to others the world must\nstand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled,\nregenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.\nA.

The subject of the letter,\nas indicated above, is one of great magnitude and\nimportance, and one which these gentlemen, of known\nability and high character, seem to have considered with\ngreat attention and care. Not having the time to form a\nmature judgment of my own as to whether the plan they\nsuggest is the best, I submit the whole subject to Congress,\ndeeming that their attention thereto is almost imperatively\ndemanded.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  H\n   \n .\n[Cipher.]\nE ECUTIVE \nMANSION, \nWASHINGTON, \nD. \nC.,\nDecember , .\nMAJOR-GENERAL \nHURLBUT, \nMemphis, \nTenn.: \nI\nunderstand you have under sentence of death, a tall old\nman, by the name of Henry F. Luckett. I personally knew\nhim, and did not think him a bad man. Please do not let him\nbe executed unless upon further order from me, and in the\nmeantime send me a transcript of the record.\nA.

He is not a\ndi\ufb00icult man to satisfy, sincerity and courage being his\nstrong traits. Believing in our cause, and wanting to \ufb01ght\nfor it, is the whole matter with him. Could you, without\nembarrassment, assign him a place, if directed to report to\nyou?\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n       A     A\n \n.\n(Private.) \nE ECUTIVE \nMANSION, \nWASHINGTON, \nD. \nC.,\nDecember , .\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\nMY DEAR SIR: \u2014 Sending a note to the Secretary of the\nNavy, as I promised, he called over and said that the strikes\nin the ship-yards had thrown the completion of vessels back\nso much that he thought General Gilimore\u2019s proposition\nentirely proper. He only wishes (and in which I concur) that\nGeneral Gillmore will courteously confer with, and explain\nto, Admiral Dahlgren.\nIn regard to the Western matter, I believe the program\nwill have to stand substantially as I \ufb01rst put it. Henderson,\nand especially Brown, believe that the social in\ufb02uence of\nSt. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon General\nPope in the particular di\ufb00iculty existing there, and I think\nthere is some force in that view.\nAs to retaining General Scho\ufb01eld temporarily, if this\nshould be done, I believe I should scarcely be able to get\nhis nomination through the Senate. Send me over his\nnomination, which, however, I am not quite ready to send to\nthe Senate.\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n. \n.  I    .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December ,\n.\nO. D. FILLEY, ST. Louis, Missouri: I have just looked over\na petition signed by some three dozen citizens of St. Louis,\nand three accompanying letters, one by yourself, one by a\nMr. Nathan Ranney, and one by a Mr. John D. Coalter, the\nwhole relating to the Rev. Dr. McPheeters. The petition\nprays, in the name of justice and mercy, that I will restore\nDr. McPheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights. This gives no\nintimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld.\nYour letter states that Provost-Marshal Dick, about a year\nago, ordered the arrest of Dr. McPheeters, pastor of the\nVine Street Church, prohibited him from o\ufb00iciating, and\nplaced the management of the a\ufb00airs of the church out of\nthe control of its chosen trustees; and near the close you\nstate that a certain course \u201cwould insure his release.\u201d Mr.\nRanney\u2019s letter says: \u201cDr. Samuel S. McPheeters is enjoying\nall the rights of a civilian, but cannot preach the Gospel!!!!\u201d\nMr. Coalter, in his letter, asks: \u201cIs it not a strange\nillustration of the condition of things, that the question of\nwho shall be allowed to preach in a church in St. Louis\nshall be decided by the President of the United States?\u201d\n Now, all this sounds very strangely; and, withal, a little\nas if you gentlemen making the application do not\nunderstand the case alike; one a\ufb00irming that the doctor is\nenjoying all the rights of a civilian, and another pointing\nout to me what will secure his release! On the second day\nof January last, I wrote to General Curtis in relation to Mr.\nDick\u2019s order upon Dr. McPheeters; and, as I suppose the\ndoctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, I only quote\nthat part of my letter which relates to the church. It is as\nfollows: \u201cBut I must add that the United States Government\nmust not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches.\nWhen an individual, in a church or out of it, becomes\ndangerous to the public interest, he must be checked; but\nthe churches, as such, must take care of themselves. It will\nnot do for the United States to appoint trustees,\nsupervisors, or other agents for the churches.\u201d\nThis letter going to General Curtis, then in command\nthere, I supposed, of course, it was obeyed, especially as I\nheard no further complaint from Dr. McPheeters or his\nfriends for nearly an entire year. I have never interfered,\nnor thought of interfering, as to who shall or shall not\npreach in any church; nor have I knowingly or believingly\ntolerated any one else to so interfere by my authority. If any\none is so interfering by color of my authority, I would like to\nhave it speci\ufb01cally made known to me. If, after all, what is\nnow sought is to have me put Dr. McPheeters back over the\nheads of a majority of his own congregation, that, too, will\nbe declined. I will not have control of any church on any\nside.\n Yours respectfully, A.

It passed the House and went to\nthe Senate, where a vote was taken upon it, but by some\naccident it was not presented to the President of the Senate\nfor his signature.\nSince the adjournment of the last session of Congress,\nother errors of a kind similar to those which this resolution\nwas designed to correct, have been discovered in the law,\nand it is now thought most expedient to include all the\nnecessary corrections in one act or resolution.\nThe attention of the proper committee of the House has,\nI am informed, been already directed to the preparation of\n a bill for this purpose.\nA.

But there is a task yet before us \u2014\nto go forward and consummate by the votes of the States\nthat which Congress so nobly began yesterday. He had the\nhonor to inform those present that Illinois had already done\nthe work. Maryland was about half through, but he felt\nproud that Illinois was a little ahead.\nHe thought this measure was a very \ufb01tting if not an\nindispensable adjunct to the winding up of the great\ndi\ufb00iculty. He wished the reunion of all the States perfected,\nand so e\ufb00ected as to remove all causes of disturbance in\nthe future; and, to attain this end, it was necessary that the\noriginal disturbing cause should, if possible, be rooted out.\nHe thought all would bear him witness that he had never\nshirked from doing all that he could to eradicate slavery, by\n issuing \nan \nEmancipation \nProclamation. \nBut \nthat\nproclamation falls short of what the amendment will be\nwhen fully consummated. A question might be raised\nwhether the proclamation was legally valid. It might be\nadded, that it only aided those who came into our lines, and\nthat it was inoperative as to those who did not give\nthemselves up; or that it would have no e\ufb00ect upon the\nchildren of the slaves born hereafter; in fact, it would be\nurged that it did not meet the evil. But this amendment is a\nking\u2019s cure for all evils. It winds the whole thing up. He\nwould repeat, that it was the \ufb01tting if not the indispensable\nadjunct to the consummation of the great game we are\nplaying. He could not but congratulate all present \u2014\nhimself, the country, and the whole world upon this great\nmoral victory.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \n.  . \n A\n .\nA HI\n \n   e ruar        \nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point:\nLET NOTHING WHICH is transpiring change, hinder, or delay\nyour military movements or plans.\nA.

W. Foster, be, and they are hereby\nconstituted, a board to examine into the proper quotas and\ncredits of the respective States and districts under the call\nof December , , with directions, if any errors be\nfound therein, to make such corrections as the law and\nfacts may require, and report their determination to the\nProvost-Marshal-General. The determination of said board\nto be \ufb01nal and conclusive, and the draft to be made in\nconformity therewith.\n. The Provost-Marshal-General is ordered to make the\ndraft in the respective districts as speedily as the same can\nbe done after the \ufb01fteenth of this month.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n   \n \n   \nA  HA  \n \n  A .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February , .\nPROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL: \nThese \ngentlemen\ndistinctly say to me this morning that what they want is the\nmeans from your o\ufb00ice of showing their people that the\nquota assigned to them is right. They think it will take but\nlittle time \u2014 two hours, they say. Please give there double\nthe time and every facility you can.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\nFebruary , .\nThe Provost-Marshal brings this letter back to me and\nsays he cannot give the facility required without detriment\nto the service, and thereupon he is excused from doing it.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n  I \n  \nA\n   \n \n   \n  \n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February , .\nLIEUTENANT-COLONEL GLENN, COMMANDING Post\nat Henderson, Ky.: Complaint is made to me that you are\nforcing negroes into the military service, and even\ntorturing them \u2014 riding them on rails and the like to extort\ntheir consent. I hope this may be a mistake. The like must\nnot be done by you, or any one under you. You must not\nforce negroes any more than white men. Answer me on\nthis.\nA. LINCOLN.\n  \n \n   \n   \nI H.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February , .\nHIS E CELLENCY GOVERNOR SMITH, of Vermont:\nComplaint is made to me, by Vermont, that the\nassignment of her quota for the draft on the pending call is\nintrinsically \nunjust, \nand \nalso \nin \nbad \nfaith \nof \nthe\nGovernment\u2019s promise to fairly allow credits for men\npreviously furnished. To illustrate, a supposed case is\nstated as follows:\nVermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish\nsix thousand men on the pending call; and being equal,\neach must furnish as many as the other in the long run. But\nthe Government \ufb01nds that on former calls Vermont\nfurnished a surplus of \ufb01ve hundred, and New Hampshire a\nsurplus, of \ufb01fteen hundred. These two surpluses making\ntwo thousand and added to the six thousand, making eight\nthousand to be furnished by the two States, or four\nthousand each less, by fair credits. Then subtract\nVermont\u2019s surplus of \ufb01ve hundred from her four thousand,\nleaves three thousand \ufb01ve hundred as her quota on the\npending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire\u2019s\nsurplus of \ufb01fteen hundred from her four thousand, leaves\ntwo thousand \ufb01ve hundred as her quota on the pending\ncall. These three thousand \ufb01ve hundred and two thousand\n \ufb01ve hundred make precisely six thousand, which the\nsupposed case requires from the two States, and it is just\nequal for Vermont to furnish one thousand more now than\nNew Hampshire, because New Hampshire has heretofore\nfurnished one thousand more than Vermont, which\nequalizes the burdens of the two in the long run. And this\nresult, so far from being bad faith to Vermont, is\nindispensable to keeping good faith with New Hampshire.\nBy no other result can the six thousand men be obtained\nfrom the two States, and, at the same time deal justly and\nkeep faith with both, and we do but confuse ourselves in\nquestioning the process by which the right result is\nreached. The supposed case is perfect as an illustration.\nThe pending call is not for three hundred thousand men\nsubject to fair credits, but is for three hundred thousand\nremaining after all fair credits have been deducted, and it\nis impossible to concede what Vermont asks without\ncoming out short of three hundred thousand men, or\nmaking other localities pay for the partiality shown her.\nThis upon the case stated. If there be di\ufb00erent reasons\nfor making an allowance to Vermont, let them be presented\nand considered.\nYours truly,\nA. LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  \n    .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, February , .\nTO THE HONORABLE THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: The joint resolution entitled \u201cJoint\nresolution \ndeclaring \ncertain \nStates \nnot \nentitled \nto\nrepresentation in the electoral college\u201d has been signed by\nthe Executive in deference to the view of Congress implied\nin its passage and presentation to him. In his own view,\nhowever, the two Houses of Congress, convened under the\ntwelfth article of the Constitution, have complete power to\nexclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them\nto be illegal, and it is not competent for the Executive to\ndefeat or obstruct that power by a veto, as would be the\ncase if his action were at all essential in the matter. He\ndisclaims all right of the Executive to interfere in any way\nin the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes, and\nhe also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has\nexpressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or\nany judgment of his own upon the subject of the resolution.\nA.

Afterwards Mr. Blair told me that he\nhad been to Richmond and had seen Mr. Je\ufb00erson Davis;\nand he (Mr. B.) at the same time left with me a manuscript\nletter, as follows, to wit: RICHMOND, VA., January ,\n.

Blair of the th of January ultimo,\nor upon any other terms or conditions that he may\nhereafter propose not inconsistent with the essential\nprinciples of self-government and popular rights, upon\nwhich our institutions are founded.\n It is our earnest wish to ascertain, after a free\ninterchange of ideas and information, upon what principles\nand terms, if any, a just and honorable peace can be\nestablished without the further e\ufb00usion of blood, and to\ncontribute our utmost e\ufb00orts to accomplish such a result.\nWe think it better to add that in accepting your passport\nwe are not to be understood as committing ourselves to\nanything but to carry to this informal conference the views\nand feelings above expressed.\nVery respectfully, yours, etc.,\nALE ANDER H. STEPHENS, J. A. CAMPBELL, R. M. T.\nHUNTER.\nNote.-The above communication was delivered to me at\nFort Monroe at . P.M. February  by Lieutenant-Colonel\nBabcock, of General Grant\u2019s sta\ufb00.\nTHOMAS T. ECKERT Major and Aid-de-Camp.\nOn the morning of the third the three gentlemen, Messrs.\nStephens, Hunter, and Campbell, came aboard of our\nsteamer and had an interview with the Secretary of State\nand myself of several hours\u2019 duration. No question of\npreliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or\nmentioned; no other person was present; no papers were\nexchanged or produced; and it was in advance agreed that\nthe conversation was to be informal and verbal merely. On\nour part the whole substance of the instructions to the\nSecretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and\ninsisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith;\nwhile by the other party it was not said that in any event or\non any condition they ever would consent to reunion, and\n yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would\nconsent. They seemed to desire a postponement of that\nquestion and the adoption of some other course \ufb01rst,\nwhich, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might\nnot lead to reunion, but which course we thought would\namount to an inde\ufb01nite postponement. The conference\nended without result.\nThe foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the\ninformation sought is respectfully submitted.\nA. LINCOLN.\n    A\n   \n  H    \nA  . \nA HI\n \n e ruar         \nTo THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES: \nIN ANSWER TO the resolution of the Senate of the eighth\ninstant, \nrequesting \ninformation \nconcerning \nrecent\nconversations or communications with insurgents, under\nexecutive sanction, I transmit a report from the Secretary\nof State, to whom the resolution was referred.\nA. LINCOLN. TO THE PRESIDENT: The Secretary of\nState, to whom was referred a resolution of the Senate of\nthe th instant, requesting \u201cthe President of the United\nStates, if, in his opinion, not incompatible with the public\ninterests, to furnish to the Senate any information in his\npossession \nconcerning \nrecent \nconversations \nor\ncommunications with certain rebels, said to have taken\nplace under executive sanction, including communications\nwith the rebel Je\ufb00erson Davis, and any correspondence\nrelating thereto,\u201d has the honor to report that the Senate\nmay properly be referred to a special message of the\nPresident bearing upon the subject of the resolution, and\ntransmitted to the House this day. Appended to this report\nis a copy of an instruction which has been addressed to\nCharles Francis Adams, Esq., envoy extraordinary and\nminister plenipotentiary of the United States at London,\nand which is the only correspondence found in this\n department touching the subject referred to in the\nresolution.\nRespectfully submitted, WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February ,\n.\n  .   \nA \n  \n \n . A\nA\n .\n(Extract.) No. .\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February\n,\nOn the morning of the d, the President, attended by the\nSecretary, \nreceived \nMessrs. \nStephens, \nHunter, \nand\nCampbell on board the United States steam transport River\nQueen in Hampton Roads. The conference was altogether\ninformal. There was no attendance of secretaries, clerks, or\nother witnesses. Nothing was written or read. The\nconversation, although earnest and free, was calm, and\ncourteous, and kind on both sides. The Richmond party\napproached the discussion rather indirectly, and at no time\ndid they either make categorical demands, or tender formal\nstipulations or absolute refusals. Nevertheless, during the\nconference, which lasted four hours, the several points at\nissue between the Government and the insurgents were\ndistinctly raised, and discussed fully, intelligently, and in an\namicable spirit. What the insurgent party seemed chie\ufb02y to\nfavor was a postponement of the question of separation,\nupon which the war is waged, and a mutual direction of\ne\ufb00orts of the Government, as well as those of the\ninsurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season\nduring which passions might be expected to subside, and\n the armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse between\nthe people of both sections resumed. It was suggested by\nthem that through such postponement we might now have\nimmediate peace, with some not very certain prospect of an\nultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations\nbetween this Government and the States, section, or people\nnow engaged in con\ufb02ict with it.\nThis suggestion, though deliberately considered, was\nnevertheless regarded by the President as one of armistice\nor truce, and he announced that we can agree to no\ncessation or suspension of hostilities, except on the basis of\nthe \ndisbandment \nof \nthe \ninsurgent \nforces, \nand \nthe\nrestoration of the national authority throughout all the\nStates in the Union. Collaterally, and in subordination to\nthe proposition which was thus announced, the antislavery\npolicy of the United States was reviewed in all its bearings,\nand the President announced that he must not be expected\nto depart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in\nhis proclamation of emancipation and other documents, as\nthese positions were reiterated in his last annual message.\nIt was further declared by the President that the complete\nrestoration of the national authority was an indispensable\ncondition of any assent on our part to whatever form of\npeace might be proposed. The President assured the other\nparty that, while he must adhere to these positions, he\nwould be prepared, so far as power is lodged with the\nExecutive, to exercise liberality. His power, however, is\nlimited by the Constitution; and when peace should be\nmade, Congress must necessarily act in regard to\n appropriations \nof \nmoney \nand \nto \nthe \nadmission \nof\nrepresentatives from the insurrectionary States. The\nRichmond party were then informed that Congress had, on\nthe st ultimo, adopted by a constitutional majority a joint\nresolution submitting to the several States the proposition\nto abolish slavery throughout the Union, and that there is\nevery reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by\nthree fourths of the States, so as to become a part of the\nnational organic law.\nThe conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence,\nwithout producing an agreement of views upon the several\nmatters discussed, or any of them. Nevertheless, it is\nperhaps of some importance that we have been able to\nsubmit our opinions and views directly to prominent\ninsurgents, and to hear them in answer in a courteous and\nnot unfriendly manner.\nI am, sir, your obedient servant, WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\n  \n A\nI A  \nA I\n \n.  \n    .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, February , \nREAR-ADMIRAL \nDAVID \nD. \nPORTER, Commanding\nNorth Atlantic Squadron, Hampton Roads, Va.\nSIR: \u2014 It is made my agreeable duty to enclose herewith\nthe joint resolution approved th January, , tendering\nthe thanks of Congress to yourself, the o\ufb00icers and men\nunder your command for their gallantry and good conduct\nin the capture of Fort Fisher, and through you to all who\nparticipated in that brilliant and decisive victory under your\ncommand.\nVery respectfully, A.

This, if true, is both outrageous\nand ridiculous. Do not allow it. The courts, and not provost-\nmarshals, are to decide such questions unless when\nmilitary necessity makes an exception.

STANTON, Secretary of War.\n    \n I\nA\n A  A\n      \nA  H        .\nFELLOW-COUNTRYMEN: \u2014 AT this second appearing\nto take the oath of the presidential o\ufb00ice there is less\noccasion for an extended address than there was at the\n\ufb01rst. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be\npursued seemed \ufb01tting and proper. Now, at the expiration\nof four years, during which public declarations have been\nconstantly called forth on every point and phase of the\ngreat contest which still absorbs the attention and\nengrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could\nbe presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else\nchie\ufb02y depends, is as well known to the public as to myself,\nand it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to\nall. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to\nit is ventured.\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all\nthoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.\nAll dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural\naddress was being delivered from this place, devoted\naltogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent\nagents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war\nseeking to dissolve the Union and divide e\ufb00ects by\nnegotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them\nwould make war rather than let the nation survive, and the\n other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the\nwar came.\nOne eighth of the whole population was colored slaves,\nnot distributed generally over the Union, but localized in\nthe southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar\nand powerful interest. All knew that this interest was\nsomehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate,\nand extend this interest was the object for which the\ninsurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the\nGovernment claimed no right to do more than to restrict\nthe territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for\nthe war the magnitude or the duration which it has already\nattained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the con\ufb02ict\nmight cease with or even before the con\ufb02ict itself should\ncease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\nfundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and\npray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the\nother. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask\na just God\u2019s assistance in wringing their bread from the\nsweat of other men\u2019s faces, but let us judge not, that we be\nnot judged. The prayers of both could not be answered.\nThat of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has\nHis own purposes. \u201cWoe unto the world because of\no\ufb00enses; for it must needs be that o\ufb00enses come, but woe\nto that man by whom the o\ufb00ense cometh.\u201d If we shall\nsuppose that American slavery is one of those o\ufb00enses\nwhich, in the providence of God, must needs come, but\nwhich, having continued through His appointed time, He\nnow wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and\n South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom\nthe o\ufb00ense came, shall we discern therein any departure\nfrom those divine attributes which the believers in a living\nGod always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently\ndo we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily\npass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the\nwealth piled by the bondsman\u2019s two hundred and \ufb01fty years\nof unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of\nblood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn\nwith the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so\nstill it must be said, \u201cThe judgments of the Lord are true\nand righteous altogether.\u201d\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with\n\ufb01rmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us\nstrive on to \ufb01nish the work we are in, to bind up the\nnation\u2019s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the\nbattle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which\nmay achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among\nourselves and with all nations.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A   \nH\n  \n  .\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March , \nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, ST. Louis, Missouri: Please\nstate brie\ufb02y, by telegraph, what you concluded about the\nassessments in St. Louis County. Early in the war one\nSamuel B. Churchill was sent from St. Louis to Louisville,\nwhere I have quite satisfactory evidence that he has not\nmisbehaved. Still I am told his property at St. Louis is\nsubjected to the assessment, which I think it ought not to\nbe. Still I wish to know what you think.\nA.

As to Singleton and Hughes, I\nthink they are not in Richmond by any authority, unless it\nbe from you. I remember nothing from me which could aid\nthem in getting there, except a letter to you, as follows, to\nwit: E ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, February\n, . LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\nGeneral Singleton, who bears you this, claims that he\nalready has arrangements made, if you consent, to bring a\nlarge amount of Southern produce through your lines. For\nits bearing on our \ufb01nances, I would be glad for this to be\ndone, if it can be, without injuriously disturbing your\nmilitary operations, or supplying the enemy. I wish you to\nbe judge and master on these points. Please see and hear\nhim fully, and decide whether anything, and, if anything,\nwhat, can be done in the premises. Yours truly, A.\nLINCOLN.\nI believe I gave Hughes a card putting him with\nSingleton on the same letter. However this may be, I now\nauthorize you to get Singleton and Hughes away from\n Richmond, if you choose, and can. I also authorize you, by\nan order, or in what form you choose, to suspend all\noperations on the Treasury trade permits, in all places\nsoutheastward of the Alleghenies.

C.\nDEAR Mr. WEED: Every one likes a compliment. Thank\nyou for yours on my little noti\ufb01cation speech and on the\nrecent inaugural address. I expect the latter to wear as well\nas perhaps better than \u2014 anything I have produced; but I\nbelieve it is not immediately popular. Men are not \ufb02attered\nby being shown that there has been a di\ufb00erence of purpose\nbetween the Almighty and them. To deny it, however, in this\ncase, is to deny that there is a God governing the world. It\nis a truth which I thought needed to be told, and, as\nwhatever of humiliation there is in it falls most directly on\nmyself, I thought others might a\ufb00ord for me to tell it.\nTruly yours, A. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n  \n \n    \nH A\n \n H   .\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., March , .\nCOL. R. M. ROUGH AND OTHERS, Chicago, Ill.: Yours\nreceived. The best I can do with it is, to refer it to the War\nDepartment. The Rock Island case referred to, was my\nindividual enterprise; and it caused so much di\ufb00iculty in so\nmany ways that I promised to never undertake another.\nA. LINCOLN.\n A\n      \n A\n I\nIA\nA   \nI\n \n \nMARCH , .\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: \u2014 IT will be but a very few words\nthat I shall undertake to say. I was born in Kentucky, raised\nin Indiana, and lived in Illinois; and now I am here, where it\nis my business to care equally for the good people of all the\nStates. I am glad to see an Indiana regiment on this day\nable to present the captured \ufb02ag to the Governor of\nIndiana. I am not disposed, in saying this, to make a\ndistinction between the States, for all have done equally\nwell.\nThere are but few views or aspects of this great war\nupon which I have not said or written something whereby\nmy own opinions might be known. But there is one \u2014 the\nrecent attempt of our erring brethren, as they are\nsometimes called, to employ the negro to \ufb01ght for them. I\nhave neither written nor made a speech on that subject,\nbecause that was their business, not mine, and if I had a\nwish on the subject, I had not the power to introduce it, or\nmake it e\ufb00ective. The great question with them was\nwhether the negro, being put into the army, will \ufb01ght for\nthem. I do not know, and therefore cannot decide. They\nought to know better than me. I have in my lifetime heard\nmany arguments why the negroes ought to be slaves; but if\n they \ufb01ght for those who would keep them in slavery, it will\nbe a better argument than any I have yet heard. He who\nwill \ufb01ght for that, ought to be a slave. They have concluded,\nat last, to take one out of four of the slaves and put them in\nthe army, and that one out of the four who will \ufb01ght to keep\nthe others in slavery, ought to be a slave himself, unless he\nis killed in a \ufb01ght. While I have often said that all men\nought to be free, yet would I allow those colored persons to\nbe slaves who want to be, and next to them those white\npeople who argue in favor of making other people slaves. I\nam in favor of giving an appointment to such white men to\ntry it on for these slaves. I will say one thing in regard to\nthe negroes being employed to \ufb01ght for them. I do know he\ncannot \ufb01ght and stay at home and make bread too. And as\none is about as important as the other to them, I don\u2019t care\nwhich they do. I am rather in favor of having them try them\nas soldiers. They lack one vote of doing that, and I wish I\ncould send my vote over the river so that I might cast it in\nfavor of allowing the negro to \ufb01ght. But they cannot \ufb01ght\nand work both. We must now see the bottom of the enemy\u2019s\nresources.

SMITH AND FRANKLIN W.\nSMITH, \nMARCH , .\nI am unwilling for the sentence to stand, and be\nexecuted, to any extent in this case. In the absence of a\nmore adequate motive than the evidence discloses, I am\nwholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or\nfraudulent intent on the part of men of such well\nestablished good character. If the evidence went as far to\nestablish a guilty pro\ufb01t of one or two hundred thousand\ndollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars, the case\nwould, on the question of guilt, bear a far di\ufb00erent aspect.\nThat on this contract, involving some twelve hundred\nthousand dollars, the contractors would plan, and attempt\nto execute a fraud which, at the most, could pro\ufb01t them\nonly one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is\nto my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they\ndid not, in such a case, make far greater gains, proves that\nthey did not, with guilty or fraudulent intent, make at all.\nThe judgment and sentence are disapproved, and declared\nnull, and the defendants are fully discharged.\nA.

LINCOLN.\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of\nState.\n  A    \n  I  A\n    \nAPRIL , \nFELLOW-CITIZENS \u2014 WE meet this evening not in\nsorrow, but in gladness of heart. The evacuation of\nPetersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the\nprincipal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and\nspeedy \npeace, \nwhose \njoyous \nexpression \ncannot \nbe\nrestrained. In the midst of this, however, He from whom\nblessings \ufb02ow must not be forgotten.\nA call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared, and\nwill be duly promulgated. Nor must those whose harder\npart gives us the cause of rejoicing be overlooked. Their\nhonors must not be parceled out with others. I myself was\nnear the front, and had the pleasure of transmitting much\nof the good news to you. But no part of the honor for plan\nor execution is mine. To General Grant, his skillful o\ufb00icers,\nand brave men, all belongs. The gallant navy stood ready,\nbut was not in reach to take active part. By these recent\nsuccesses, the reinauguration of the national authority \u2014\nreconstruction which has had a large share of thought from\nthe \ufb01rst, is pressed much more closely upon our attention.\nIt is fraught with great di\ufb00iculty. Unlike a case of war\nbetween independent nations, there is no authorized organ\nfor us to treat with \u2014 no one man has authority to give up\n the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with\nand mould from disorganized and discordant elements. Nor\nis it a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal\npeople, di\ufb00er among ourselves as to the mode, manner, and\nmeasure of reconstruction. As a general rule, I abstain from\nreading the reports of attacks upon myself, Wishing not to\nbe provoked by that to which I cannot properly o\ufb00er an\nanswer. In spite of this precaution, however, it comes to my\nknowledge that I am much censured for some supposed\nagency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new State\ngovernment of Louisiana. In this I have done just so much\nand no more than the public knows. In the Annual Message\nof December, , and the accompanying proclamation, I\npresented a plan of reconstruction, as the phrase goes,\nwhich I promised, if adopted by any State, would be\nacceptable to and sustained by the Executive Government\nof the nation. I distinctly stated that this was not the only\nplan that might possibly be acceptable, and I also distinctly\nprotested that the Executive claimed no right to say when\nor whether members should be admitted to seats in\nCongress from such States. This plan was in advance\nsubmitted to the then Cabinet, and approved by every\nmember of it. One of them suggested that I should then and\nin that connection apply the Emancipation Proclamation to\nthe theretofore excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana;\nthat I should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for\nfreed people, and that I should omit the protest against my\nown power in regard to the admission of members of\nCongress. But even he approved every part and parcel of\n the plan which has since been employed or touched by the\naction of Louisiana. The new constitution of Louisiana,\ndeclaring emancipation for the whole State, practically\napplies the proclamation to the part previously excepted. It\ndoes not adopt apprenticeship for freed people, and is\nsilent, as it could not well be otherwise, about the\nadmission of members to Congress. So that, as it applied to\nLouisiana, every member of the Cabinet fully approved the\nplan. The message went to Congress, and I received many\ncommendations of the plan, written and verbal, and not a\nsingle objection to it from any professed emancipationist\ncame to my knowledge until after the news reached\nWashington that the people of Louisiana had begun to move\nin accordance with it. From about July, , I had\ncorresponded with di\ufb00erent persons supposed to be\ninterested \nin \nseeking \na \nreconstruction \nof \na \nState\ngovernment for Louisiana. When the message of , with\nthe plan before mentioned, reached New Orleans, General\nBanks wrote me that he was con\ufb01dent that the people, with\nhis military co-operation, would reconstruct substantially\non that plan. I wrote to him and some of them to try it. They\ntried it, and the result is known. Such has been my only\nagency in getting up the Louisiana government. As to\nsustaining it my promise is out, as before stated. But, as\nbad promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this\nas a bad promise and break it, whenever I shall be\nconvinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest;\nbut I have not yet been so convinced. I have been shown a\nletter on this subject, supposed to be an able one, in which\n the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to\nbe de\ufb01nitely \ufb01xed upon the question whether the seceded\nStates, so called, are in the Union or out of it. It would\nperhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn\nthat since I have found professed Union men endeavoring\nto answer that question, I have purposely forborne any\npublic expression upon it. As appears to me, that question\nhas not been nor yet is a practically material one, and that\nany discussion of it, while it thus remains practically\nimmaterial, could have no e\ufb00ect other than the mischievous\none of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may\nbecome, that question is bad as the basis of a controversy,\nand good for nothing at all \u2014 a merely pernicious\nabstraction. We all agree that the seceded States, so called,\nare out of their proper practical relation with the Union,\nand that the sole object of the Government, civil and\nmilitary, in regard to those States, is to again get them into\ntheir proper practical relation. I believe that it is not only\npossible, but in fact easier, to do this without deciding or\neven considering whether those States have ever been out\nof the Union, than with it. Finding themselves safely at\nhome, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had\nbeen abroad. Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to\nrestore the proper practical relations between these States\nand the Union, and each forever after innocently indulge\nhis own opinion whether, in doing the acts he brought the\nStates from without into the Union, or only gave them\nproper assistance, they never having been out of it. The\namount of constituency, so to speak, on which the Louisiana\n government rests, would be more satisfactory to all if it\ncontained \ufb01fty thousand, or thirty thousand, or even twenty\nthousand, instead of twelve thousand, as it does. It is also\nunsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not\ngiven to the colored man. I would myself prefer that it were\nnow conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who\nserve our cause as soldiers. Still, the question is not\nwhether the Louisiana government, as it stands, is quite all\nthat is desirable. The question is, Will it be wiser to take it\nas it is and help to improve it, or to reject and disperse?\nCan Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation\nwith the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her\nnew State government? Some twelve thousand voters in the\nheretofore Slave State of Louisiana have sworn allegiance\nto the Union, assumed to be the rightful political power of\nthe State, held elections, organized a State government,\nadopted a Free State constitution, giving the bene\ufb01t of\npublic schools equally to black and white, and empowering\nthe Legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the\ncolored man. This Legislature has already voted to ratify\nthe \nConstitutional \nAmendment \nrecently \npassed \nby\nCongress, abolishing slavery throughout the nation. These\ntwelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the\nUnion and to perpetuate freedom in the State \u2014 committed\nto the very things, and nearly all things, the nation wants \u2014\nand they ask the nation\u2019s recognition and its assistance to\nmake good this committal. Now, if we reject and spurn\nthem, we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them.\nWe, in fact, say to the white man: You are worthless or\n worse; we will neither help you nor be helped by you. To\nthe blacks we say: This cup of liberty which these, your old\nmasters, held to your lips, we will dash from you, and leave\nyou to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered\ncontents in some vague and unde\ufb01ned when, where, and\nhow. If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white\nand black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper\npractical relations with the Union, I have so far been\nunable to perceive it. If, on the contrary, we recognize and\nsustain the new government of Louisiana, the converse of\nall this is made true. We encourage the hearts and nerve\nthe arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and\nargue for it, and proselyte for it, and \ufb01ght for it, and feed it,\nand grow it, and ripen it to a complete success. The colored\nman, too, in seeing all united for him, is inspired with\nvigilance, and energy, and daring to the same end. Grant\nthat he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it\nsooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it,\nthan by running backward over them? Concede that the\nnew government of Louisiana is only to what it should be as\nthe egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by\nhatching the egg than by smashing it. Again, if we reject\nLouisiana, we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed\namendment to the National Constitution. To meet this\nproposition, it has been argued that no more than three\nfourths of those States which have not attempted secession\nare necessary to validly ratify the amendment. I do not\ncommit myself against this, further than to say that such a\nrati\ufb01cation would be questionable, and sure to be\n persistently questioned, while a rati\ufb01cation by three\nfourths of all the States would be unquestioned and\nunquestionable. I repeat the question, Can Louisiana be\nbrought into proper practical relation with the Union\nsooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State\ngovernment? What has been said of Louisiana will apply to\nother States. And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each\nState, and such important and sudden changes occur in the\nsame State, and withal so new and unprecedented is the\nwhole case, that no exclusive and in\ufb02exible plan can safely\nbe prescribed as to details and collaterals. Such exclusive\nand \nin\ufb02exible \nplan \nwould \nsurely \nbecome \na \nnew\nentanglement. Important principles may and must be\nin\ufb02exible. In the present situation as the phrase goes, it\nmay be my duty to make some new announcement to the\npeople of the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to\nact, when satis\ufb01ed that action will be proper.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \n. \n I    .\nWASHINGTON, D. C., April , . MAJOR-GENERAL\nWEITZEL, Richmond, Va.: \nI HAVE SEEN your despatch to Colonel Hardie about the\nmatter of prayers. I do not remember hearing prayers\nspoken of while I was in Richmond; but I have no doubt you\nhave acted in what appeared to you to be the spirit and\ntemper manifested by me while there. Is there any sign of\nthe rebel legislature coming together on the understanding\nof my letter to you? If there is any such sign, inform me\nwhat it is; if there is no such sign, you may withdraw the\no\ufb00er.\nA. LINCOLN.\n     \n A\n  \n \n \n  A  \n. \n I    .\nA HI\n \n  \n. .  A ri          .\nMAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.: \nI HAVE JUST seen Judge Campbell\u2019s letter to you of the th.\nHe assumes, as appears to me, that I have called the\ninsurgent legislature of Virginia together, as the rightful\nlegislature of the State, to settle all di\ufb00erences with the\nUnited States. I have done no such thing. I spoke of them,\nnot as a legislature, but as \u201cthe gentlemen who have acted\nas the legislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion.\u201d I\ndid this on purpose to exclude the assumption that I was\nrecognizing them as a rightful body. I deal with them as\nmen having power de facto to do a speci\ufb01c thing, to wit:\n\u201cTo withdraw the Virginia troops and other support from\nresistance to the General Government,\u201d for which, in the\npaper handed Judge Campbell, I promised a speci\ufb01c\nequivalent, to wit: a remission to the people of the State,\nexcept in certain cases, of the con\ufb01scation of their\nproperty. I meant this, and no more. Inasmuch, however, as\nJudge Campbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for\nan armistice, contrary to the explicit statement of the paper\nI gave him, and particularly as General Grant has since\ncaptured the Virginia troops, so that giving a consideration\nfor their withdrawal is no longer applicable, let my letter to\nyou and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn, or\n countermanded, and he be noti\ufb01ed of it. Do not now allow\nthem to assemble, but if any have come, allow them safe\nreturn to their homes.\nA. LINCOLN.\n I\n    I \n \nI H   H\n      \n  A  \n  H\n \nI\n \n  A  I          .\nMR. COLFA , I want you to take a message from me to the\nminers whom you visit. I have very large ideas of the\nmineral wealth of our nation. I believe it practically\ninexhaustible. It abounds all over the Western country, from\nthe Rocky Mountains to the Paci\ufb01c, and its development\nhas scarcely commenced. During the war, when we were\nadding a couple of millions of dollars every day to our\nnational debt, I did not care about encouraging the\nincrease in the volume of our precious metals. We had the\ncountry to save \ufb01rst. But now that the rebellion is\noverthrown, and we know pretty nearly the amount of our\nnational debt, the more gold and silver we mine, we make\nthe payment of that debt so much the easier. \u201cNow,\u201d said\nhe, speaking with more emphasis, \u201cI am going to encourage\nthat in every possible way. We shall have hundreds of\nthousands of disbanded soldiers, and many have feared\nthat their return home in such great numbers might\nparalyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply\nof labor than there will be demand for. I am going to try to\nattract them to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges,\nwhere there is room enough for all. Immigration, which\neven the war has not stopped, will land upon our shores\nhundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded\n Europe. I intend to point them to the gold and silver that\nwait for them in the West. Tell the miners for me, that I\nshall promote their interests to the utmost of my ability;\nbecause their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation;\nand,\u201d said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, \u201cwe shall\nprove, in a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury\nof the world.\u201d\n  \n \n \n  A   A\n A   \n.\nE ECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April , \nGENERAL VAN ALLEN: I intend to adopt the advice of\nmy friends and use due precaution.... I thank you for the\nassurance you give me that I shall be supported by\nconservative men like yourself, in the e\ufb00orts I may make to\nrestore the Union, so as to make it, to use your language, a\nUnion of hearts and hands as well as of States.\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN.\n  I\n \n \n    A   \n I   \n \n \nAllow Mr. Ashmer and friend to come in at  A.M. to-\nmorrow.\nA. LINCOLN. April , \n"
