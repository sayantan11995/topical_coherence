    "1912-1916": " BACK HOME AND WAR-TIME POLITICS \nIN INDIA \n\nTowards the end of  India was, politically, very dull. Tilak \nwas in gaol, the Extremists had been sat upon and were lying low \nwithout any effective leadership, Bengal was quiet after the un- \nsettling of the partition of the province, and the Moderates had \nbeen eliectively \" rallied \u201d to the Minto-Morley scheme of coun- \ncils. There was some interest in Indians overseas, especially in the \ncondition of Indians in South Africa. The Congress was a \nmoderate group, meeting annually, passing some feeble resolu- \ntions, and attracting little attention. \n\nI visited, as a delegate, the Bankipore Congress during Christ- \nmas . It was very much an English-knowing upper class affiiir \nwhere morning coats and well-pressed trousers were greatly in \nevidence. Essentially it was a social gathering with no political \nexcitement or tension. Gokhale, fresh from South Africa, at- \ntended it and was the outstanding person of the session. High- \nstrung, full of earnestness and a nervous energy, he seemed to be \none of the few persons present who took politics and public affairs \nseriously and felt deeply about them. I was impressed by him. \n\nA characteristic incident occurred when Gokhale was leaving \nBankipore. He was a member of the Public Services Commission \nat the time and, as such, was entitled to a first class railway com- \npartment to himself. . He was not well and crowds and uncon- \ngenial company upset him. He liked to be left alone by himself \nand, after me stram of the Congress session, he was looking for- \nward to a quiet journey by train. He got his compartment but \nthe rest of the train was crowded with delegates returning to \nCalcutta. After a litde while, Bhupendra Nath Basy, who later \nbecame a member of the India, Council, came up to Gokhale and \ncasually asked him if he could travel in his compartment. Mr. \nGokhale was a little taken aback as Mr. Basu was an aggressive \ntalker, but naturally he agreed. A few minutes later Mr. Basu \nagain came up to Gokhale and asked him if he would mind if a \nfnend of his also travelled in the same compartment. Mr. Gok- \nhale again mild ly agreed. A little before the train left, Mr. Basu \nmentioned casually that both he and his fidend would find it \nvery rmcomfortable to sleep in the upper berths, so would Gok- \nhale mind occupying an upper berth so that the two lower berths \n\n* \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nmight be taken by them? And that, I think, was the arrangement \narrived at and poor Mr. Gokhale had to climb up and spend a bad \nnight. \n\nI took to the law and joined the High Court. The work in- \nterested me to a certain extent. The early months after my return \nfrom Europe were pleasant. I was glad to be back home and to \npick up old threads. But gradually the life I led, in common with \nmost others of my kind, began to lose all its freshness and I felt \nthat I was\u2018 being engulfed in a dull routine of a pointless and \nfutile existence. I suppose my mongrel, or at least mixed, educa- \ntion was responsible for this feeling of dissatisfaction with my \nsurroundings. The habits and the ideas that had grown in me \nduring my seven years in England did not fit in with things as I \nfound them. Fortunately my home atmosphere was fairly con- \ngenial and that was some help, but it was not enough. For the \nrest there was the Bar Library and the club and the same people \nwere to be found in both, discussing the same old topics, usually \nconnected with the legal profession, over and over again. De- \ncidedly the atmosphere was not intellectually stimulating and a \nsense of the utter insipidity of life grew upon me. There were \nnot even worthwhile amusements or diversions. \n\nG. Lowes Dickinson is reported 'by E, M. Forster, in his recent \nlife of him, to have once said about India : \u201c And why can\u2019t the \ntaces meet? Simply because the Indians hore the English. That \nis the simple adam^tine fact.\u201d It is possible that most English- \nmen fed that way\"and it is not surprising. To quote Forster \nagain (from another book), every En^ishman in India feds and \nbehaves, and rightly, as if he was a member) of an army of occu- \npation, and it is quite impossible for natural and unrestrained \nrelations between the two races to grow under these circum- \nstances. The Englishman and the Indian are always posing to \neach other and naturally they feel uncomfortable in each other\u2019s \ncompany. Each bores the other and is glad to get away from him \nto breathe e^ and move naturally again. \n\nUsually the Englishman meets the same set of Indians, those \nconnected mth the. official world, and he seldom reaches really \ninteresting people, and if he reached them he would not easily \ndraw them out. The British regime in India has pushbd im into \nprominence, even sodally, the offidal class, both British and \nIndian, and this class is rfiost singularly dull and narrow-minded. \nEven a bright young Englishman on coming out to India will \nsoon relapse into a kind of intellectual and cultural torpor and \nwill get cut off from all live ideas and movements. After a day in \noffice, dealing with the ever-rotating and never-ending files, he \n\n\n\nWAR-TIME POLITICS IN INDIA \n\n\n. \n\nwill have some exerdse and then go to his dub to mix with his \nkind, drink whisky and read Punch and the illustrated weeklies \nfrom England. He hardly reads books and if he does he will \nprobably go bade to an old favourite. And for this gradual de- \nterioration of mind he will blame India, curse the cUmate, and \ngenerally anathematise the tribe of agitators who add to his \ntroubles, not realising that the cause of intellectual and cultural \ndecay lies in the hide-bound bureaucratic and despotic system of \ngovernment which flourishes in India and of which he is a tiny \npart. \n\nIf that is the fate of the English official, in spite of his leaves \nand furloughs, the Indian official working with him or under him \nis not likely to fare better, for he tries to model himself on the \nEnglish type. Few experiences are more dreary than sitting with \nhigh-placed officials, both English and Indian, in that seat of \nEmpire, New Delhi, and listening to their unending talk about \npromotions, leave rules, furloughs, transfers, and little tit-bits of \nService scandal. \n\nThis official and Service atmosphere invaded and set the tone \nfor almost all Indian middle-class life, especially the English- \nknowing intelligentsia, except to some extent in cities like Cal- \ncutta and Bombay. Professional men, lawyers, doctors and \nothers, succumbed to it, and even the academic halls of the semi- \nofficial universities were full of it. All these people lived in a \nworld apart, cut off from the masses and even the lower middle \nclass. Politics was confined to this upper strata. The nationalist \nmovement in Bengal from  onwards had for the first time \nshaken this up and infused a new life in the Bengal lower middle- \nclass and to a small extent even tihe masses. This process was.to \ngrow rapidly in later years under Gandhiji\u2019s^ leadership, but a \nnationalist struggle though life-giving is a narrow creed and ab- \nsorbs too much energy and attrition to allow of other activities. \n\n^ I have referred to Mr. Gandhi or Mahatma Gandhi as \" Gandhiji\u201d \nthroughout these pages as he himself prefers this to the addition of \n\u2018 Mahatma \u2019 to his name. But I have seen some extraordinary ex- \nplanations of this ' ji \u2019 in books and articles by EngKsh writers. Some \nnave imagined that it is a term of endearment-^andhiji meaning \n'dear little Gandhi\u2019! This is perfecdy absurd and shows colossal \nignorance of Indian life. \u2018 Ji \u2019 is one of the commonest additions to a \nname in India being wplied indiscrimmatingly to all kinds of people \nand to men, women, boys, girls and children. It conveys an idea of \nrespect, something equivalent to Mr., Mrs., or Miss. Hindustani is \nrich in courtly phrases and prefixes and suffixes to names and hono- \nrific titles. ' Ji \u2019 is the simplest of these and the least formal of th^, \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nI felt, therefore, dissatisfied with life in those early years after \nmy return from England. My profession did not fill me with a \nwhole-hearted enthusiasm. Politics, which to me meant aggres- \nsive nationalist activity against foreign rule, offered no scope for \nthis. , I joined the Congress and took part in its occasional meet- \nings. \\^en a special occasion arose, like the agitation against the \nFiji indenture system for Indian workers, or the South African \nIndian question, I threw myself into it with energy and worked \nhard. But these were only temporary occupations, \n\nI indulged in some diversions like shikar but I had no special \naptitude or inclination for it. I liked the outings and the jungle \nand cared little for the killing. Indeed my reputation was a \nsingularly bloodless one, although I once succeeded, more or less \nby a fluke, in killing a bear in Kashmir. An incident with a little \nantelope damped even the little ardour that I possessed for shikar. \nThis harmless little animal fell down at my feet, wounded to \ndeath, and looked up at me with its great big eyes full of tears. \nThose eyes have often haunted me since. \n\nI was attracted in those early years to Mr. Gokhale\u2019s Servants \nof India Society. I never thought of joining it, partly because its \npolitics were too moderate for me, and partly because I had no \nintention then of giving up my profession. But I had a great \nadmiration for the members of the society who had devoted \nthemselves for a bare pittance to the country\u2019s service. Here at \nleast, I thought, was straight and single-minded and continuous \nwork even though this might not be on wholly right lines. \n\nMr. Srinivas Sastri, however, gave me a great shock in a little \nmatter quite unconnected with politics. He was addressing a \nstudents meeting in Allahabad and he told them to be respectful \nand obedient to their teachers and professors and to observe care- \nfully all the rides and regulations laid down by constituted autho- \nrity. All this goody-goody talk did not appeal to me much; it \nseemed very platitudinous and somewhat undesirable, with all its \nstress on authoritarianism. I thought that this was perhaps due to \nthe semi-official atmosphere which was so prevalent in India, Mr, \n&stn wrat on and called upon the boys to report each other\u2019s sins \nof omission and commission immediately to the authorities. In \nother words they were to spy on each other and play the part of \n\n\nthough perfectly correct, I learn from my hrothcr-in-law, Ranjit S. \n\n^ honourable ancestry. It is de- \n\nSansknt meaning a gentleman or noble-born \n\nU to tetoTto p Prakrit \n\n\n\nWAR-TIMi, POLITICS IN INDIA \n\ninformers. These hard words were not used hy Mr. Sastri but their \nmeaning seemed to me clear, and I listened aghast to this friendly \ncounsel of a great leader. I had freshly returned from England \nand the lesson that had been most impressed upon my mind in \nschool and college was never to betray a colleague. There was no \ngreater sin against the canons of good form than to sneak and \ninform and thus get a companion into trouble. A sudden and \ncomplete reversal of this principle upset me and I felt that there \nwas a great diflference between Mr. Sastri\u2019s morality and the mor- \nality that had been taught to me. \n\nThe World War absorbed our attention. It was far off and \ndid not at first affect our lives much, and India never felt the \nfull horror of it. Politics petered out and sank into insi^ifi- \ncance. The Defence of India Act (the equivalent of the British \nD.O.R.A.) held the country in its grip. From the second year \nonwards news of conspiracies and shootings came to us, and of \npress-gang methods to enrol recruits in the Punjab. \n\nThere was little sympathy with the British in spite of loud \nprofessions of loyalty. Moderate and Extremist alike learnt with \nsatisfaction of German victories. There was no love for Germany \nof course, only the desire to see our own rulers humbled. It was \nthe weak and helpless man\u2019s idea of vicarious revenge. I suppose \nmost of us viewed the struggle with mixed feelings. Of all the \nnations involved my smipathies were probably most with France. \nThe ceaseless and unabashed propaganda on behalf of the Allies \nhad some effect, although we tried to discount it greatly. \n\nGradually political life grew again. Lokamanya Tilak came out \nof prison and Home Rule Leagues were started by him and Mrs. \nBesant. I joined both but I worked especially for Mrs. Besant\u2019s \nLeague. Mrs. Besant began to play an ever increasing part in the \nIndian political scene. The annual sessions of the Congress be- \ncame a litde more exciting and the Moslem League began to \nmarch with the Congress. The atmosphere became electric and \nmost of us young men felt exhilarated and expected big things \nin the near fiiture. Mrs. Besant\u2019s internment added greatly to the \nexcitement of the intelligentsia and vitalised the Home Rule \nMovement all over the country. The Home Rule Leagues were \nattracting not only all the old Extremists who had been kept out \nof the Congress since  but large numbers of newcomers \nfrom the middle classes. They did not touch the masses. \n\nMrs. Besant\u2019s interginent , stirred leven the older generation, \nincluding many of tEe \"Moderate leaders. Just before the intern- \nment I remember how moved we used to be by the eloquent \nspeeches of Mr. Srinivasa Sastri which we read in the papers. \n\n\n\nyi JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nBut just before or after the internment suddenly Mr. Sastri \nbecame silent. He failed us completely when the time for action \ncame and there was considerable disappointment and resentment \nat his silence when most of all a lead was needed. I am afraid \nthat ever since then the conviction has grown upon me that Mr. \nSastri is not a man of action and a crisis does not suit his genius. \n\nOther Moderate leaders, however, went ahead, some to draw \nback later, some to remain in the new position. I remember tliat \nthere was a great deal of discussion in those days about tlie new \nIndian Defence Force which the Government was organising \nfrom the middle classes on the lines of the European defence \nforces in India. This Indian force was treated very differently \nfrom the European force m a variety of ways, and many of us \nfelt that we should not co-operate with it till these humiliating \ndistinctions were removed. After much discussion, however, we \ndecided to co-operate in the U.P. as it was considered worth while \nfor our young men to have military training even under these \nconditions.  sent my application to join the new force, and we \nformed a committee in Allahabad to push the scheme on. Just \nthen came Mrs. Besant\u2019s internment and in the excitement of \nthe moment I managed to get the committee members \u2014 they in- \ncluded my father, Dr. Tej Bahadur Sapru, Mr. C. Y. Chintamani \nand other Moderate leaders \u2014 ^to agree to cancel our meeting and \n,all other work in connection with the Defence Force as a protest \nagainst the Government\u2019s action. A public notice was issued im- \nmediately to this effect. I think some of the signatories regretted \nlater this aggressive act in war time. \n\nMrs. Besant\u2019s internment also resulted in my father, and other \nModerate leaders joining the Home Rule League. Some months \nlater most of these Moderate members resigned from the League. \nMy father remained in it and became the president of the Ala- \nhabad branch. \n\nGradually my father had been drifting atVay from the orthodox \nModerate position. His nature rebelled against too much sub- \nmission and appeal to an authority which ignored us and treated \nus disdainfully. But the old Extremist leaders did not attract \nhim; their language and methods jarred upon him. The episode \nof Mrs. Besant\u2019s internment and subsequent events influenced \nhim considerably but still he hesitated before ' definitely com- \nmitting himself to a forward line. Often he used to say in those \ndays that moderate tactics were no good, but nothing effective \ncould be done till some solution for die Hindu-Muslim question \nwas found. If this was found then he promised to go ahead with \nthe youngest of us. The adoption by the Congress at Lucknow in \n\n\n\nWAR-TIMfi POLITICS IN INDIA \n\n\n \n\n of the Joint Congress-League Scheme, which had been \ndrawn up at a meeting of the All India Congress Committee in \nour house, pleased him greatly as it opened the way to a joint \neffort and he was prepared to go ahead then even at the cost of \nbreaking with his old colleagues of the Moderate group. They \npulled together till and during Edwin Montagu\u2019s visit to India as \nSecretary of State. Differences arose soon after the publication \nof the Montagu-Chelmsford Report, and the final break in the \nUnited Provinces came in the summer of  at a special pro- \nvincial conference held at Lucknow over which my fether pre- \nsided. The Moderates, expecting that this conference would \nadopt a strong line against the Montagu-Chehnsford proposals, \nboycotted the conference. Later they also boycotted the special \nsession of the Congress held to consider these proposals. Since \nthen they have been out of the Congress. \n\nThis Moderate practice of quietly dropping out and keeping \naway from the Congress sessions and other public gatherings and \nnot even presenting their viewpoint and fighting for it, even \nthough the majority might be against them, struck me as \npeculiarly undi^ified and unbecoming in public workers. I \nthink that was the general sense of large numbers of people in \nthe coimtry and I am sure that the almost total coUapse of the \nModerates in Indian politics was partly due to this timid attitude. \nMr. Sastri was, I think, the only Moderate leader who attended \nsome of the -early sessions of the Congress, which had been boy- \ncotted by the Moderates as a group, and put forward his solitary \nviewpoint. He went up in public estimation because of it. \n\nMy own political and public activities in the early war years \nwere modest and I kept away from addressing public gatherings. \nI was stiU diffident and terrified of public speaking. Partly also \nI felt that public speeches should not be in English and I doubted \nmy capacity to speak at any length in Hindustani, I remember \na little incident when I was indeed to deliver my first public \nspeech in Allahabad. Probably it was in  but I am not clear \nabout dates and am rather mixed up about the order of events. \nThe occasion was a protest meeting against a new Act muzzling \nthe press. I spoke briefly and in English. As soon as the meeting \nwas over Dr. Tej Bahadur Sapru, to my great embarrassment, \nembraced and kissed me in public on the dais. This was not be- \ncause of what I had said or how I had said it. His efiusive joy \nwas caused by the mere fact that I had spoken in public and thus \na new recruit had been obtained for public work, fer this work \nconsisted in those days practically of speaking only. \n\nI remember that many of us young men. m Allahabad then \n\n\n\n JAWAHARI.AL NEHRU \n\nhad a faint hope that perhaps Dr. Sapru might take up a more \nadvanced attitude in politics. Of all the Moderate group in the \ncity he seemed to he die most likely to do so because he was \nemotional and could occasionally be carried by enthusiasm. Com- \npared to him my father seemed cold-bloodedness itself, though \nunderneath this outer cover there was fire enough. But father\u2019s \nstrengdi of will left us little hope and for a brief while we actu- \nally had greater expectations from Dr. Sapru. Pandit Madan \nMohan Malaviya, with his long record of public work, attracted \nus of course and we used to have long talks with him, pressing \nhim to give a brave lead to the country. \n\nAt home, in those early years, political questions were not \npeaceful subjects for discussion, and references to them, which \nwere frequent, immediately produced a tense atmosphere. Father \nhad been closely watching my growing drift towards Extremism, \nmy continual criticism of the politics of talk and my insistent \ndemand for action. What action it should be Was not clear, and \nsometimes father imagined that I was heading straight for the \nviolent courses adopted by some of the young men of Bengal. \nThis worried him very much. As a matter of faa I was not \nattracted that way, but the idea that we must not tamely submit \nto existing conditions and that something must be done began to \nobsess me more and more. Successful action, from the national \npoint of view, did not seem to be at all easy, but I felt that both \nindividual and national honour demanded a more aggressive and \nfighting attitude to foreign rule. Father himself was dissatisfied \nwith the Moderate philosophy, and a mental conflict was going on \ninside him. He was too obstinate to change from one position to \nanother until he was absolutely convinced that there was no other \nway. Each step forward meant for him a hard and bitter tussle in \nhia mind, and when the step was taken after tliat struggle with \npart of lumsel^ there was no going back. He had not taken it in \na fit of enthusiasm but as a result of intellectual conviction, and \nthen, having done so, all his pride prevented him from looking \nback. \n\nThe outward change in his politics came about the time of \nMrs, Besant\u2019s internment and ftom that time onwards step by \nstep he went ahead, leaving his old Moderate colleagues far be- \nhind, till the tragic happenings in the Punjab in  finally led \nhim to cut adrift from his old life and his profession, and throw \nin his lot with the new movement started by Gandhi ji. \n\nBut thatwM still to be, and fi:omiito  he was still unsure \nof what to do, and the doubts in him, added to his worries about \nmeC' did not make him a peaceful talker on the public issues of \n\n\n\nWAR-TIME POLITICS IN INDIA \n\n\n.,? \n\nthe day. Often enough our talks ended abruptly by his losing his \ntemper with us. \n\nMy first meeting with Gandhiji was about the time of the \nLudtnow Congress during Christmas . All of us admired \nhim for his heroic fight in South Africa, but he seemed very dis- \ntant and different and unpolitical to many of us young men. He \nrefused to take part in Congress or national politics then and con- \nfined himself to the South African Indian question. Soon after- \nwards his adventures and victory in Champaran, on behalf of \nthe tenants of the planters, filled us with enthusiasm. We saw \nthat he was prepared to apply his methods in India also and they \npromised success. \n\nI remember being moved also, in those days after the Lucknow \nCongress, by a number of eloquent speeches delivered by Sarojini \nNaidu in Allahabad. It was all nationalism and patriotism and I \nwas a pure nationalist, my vague socialist ideas of college days \nhaving sunk into the background. Roger Casement\u2019s wonderful \nspeech at his trial in  seemed to point out exactly how a \nmember of a subject nation should feel. The Easter Week rising \nin Ireland by its very failure attracted, for was that not true \ncourage which mocked at almost certain failure and proclaimed \nto the world that no physical might could crush the invincible \nspirit of a nation? \n\nSuch were my thoughts then, and yet fresh reading was again \nstirring the embers of socialistic ideas in my head. They were \nvague ideas, more humanitarian and utopian than scientific. A \nfavourite writer of mine during the war years and after was \nBertrand Russell. \n\nThese thoughts and desires produced a growing conflict within \nme and a dissatisfaction with my profession of the law. I carried \non with it because there was nothing else to be done, but I felt \nmore and more that it was not possible to reconcile public work, \nespecially of the aggressive type which appealed to me, with the \nlawyer\u2019s job. It was not a question of pnnciple but of time and \nenergy. Sir Rash Behary Ghosh, the eminent Calcutta lawyer, \nwho for some unknown reason took a fancy to me, gave me a lot \nof good advice as to how to get on in the profession. He especially \nadvised me to write a book on a legal subject of my choice, as he \nsaid that this was the best way for a junior to train himself. He \noffered to help me with ideas in the writing of it and to revise it. \nBut all his well meant interest in my legal career was in vain, and \nfew things could be more distasteful to me than to spend my time \nand energy in writing legal books. \n\nSir Rash Behary in to old age was extraordinarily irritahl\u00abnd \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nshort of temper and a terror for his juniors. I rather liked him, \nhowever, and his very failings and wes^knesses were not wholly \nunattractive. Father and I were once his guests in Simla. It was \nin  ,  think, just when the Montagil-Chclmsford report came \nout. He invited to dinner a few friends one evening and among \nthem was old Mr. Khaparde. After dinner Sir Rash Behary \nand Mr. Khaparde became loud and aggressive in their argu- \nments for they belonged to rival schools of politics, Sir Rash \nBehary being a confirmed Moderate and Mr. Khaparde was then \nsupposed to be a leading Tilakite, although in later years he be- \ncame as mild as a dove and too moderate even for the Moderates. \nMr. Khaparde began criticising Mr. Gokhale (who had died \nsome years previously), saying that he had been a British agent \nwho had spied on him in London. This was too much for Sir \nRash Behary and he shouted that Gokhale had been the best of \nmen and a particular friend of his and that he would not \npermit any one to say a word against him. Mr. Khaparde then \nbranched off to Mr. Srinivas Sastri. Sir Rash Behary did not \nlike this but he did not resent it quite so much. Apparently he \nwas not such an admirer of Mr. Sastri\u2019s as he had been of \nGokhale\u2019s. Indeed he said that so long as Gokhale had been alive \nhe had helped the Servants of India Society financially but since \nhis death he had stopped his contribution. Mr. Khaparde then, \nas a contrast, began praising Tilak. Here was a truly great man, \nhe said; a wonderful person, a saint. \u201cA saint! \" retorted Sir \nRash Behary, \u201c I hate saints, I want to have nothing to do with \nthem.\u201d  MY WEDDING AND AN ADVENTURE IN \nTHE HIMALAYAS \n\nMy marriage took place in  in the city of Delhi. It was on \nthe Vasanta Panchavvi day which heralds the coming of spring \nin India. That summer we spent some months in Kashmir. I left \nmy family in the valley and, together with a cousin of mine, \nwandered for several weeks in the mountains and went up the \nLadakh road. \n\nThis was my first experience of the narrow and lonely \nvalleys, high up in the world, which lead to the Tibetan \nplateau. From the top of the Zoji-la pass we saw the rich verdant \nmountain sides below us on one side and the bare bleak rock on \nthe other. We went up and up the narrow valley bottom Hanked \non each side by mountains, with the snow-covered tops gleaming \non one side and little glaciers creeping down to meet us. The \nwind was cold and bitter but the sun was warm in the day time, \nand the air was so clear that often we were misled about the dis- \ntance of objects, thinking them much nearer than they actually \nwere. The loneliness grew ; there were not even trees or vegetation \nto keep us company \u2014 only me bare rock and the snow and ice \nand, sometimes, very welcome flowers. Yet I found a strange \nsatisfaction in these wild and desolate haunts of nature; I was \nfull of energy and a feeling of exaltation. \n\nI had an exciting experience during this visit. At one place on \nour march beyond the Zoji-la pass\u2014 I think it was called Matayan \n\u2014 ^we were told that the cave of Amaranath was only eight miles \naway. It was true that an enormous mountain all covered vidth \nice and snow lay in between and had to be grossed, but what did \nthat matter? Eight miles seemed so little. In our enthusiasm and \ninexperience we decided to make the attempt. So we left our \ncamp (which was situated at about , feet altitude) and with \na small party went up the moimtain. We had a local shepherd \nfor a guide. \n\nWe crossed and climbed several gladers, roping ourselves \nup, and our troubles increased and breathing became a little \ndifficult. Some of our porters, lightly laden as they were, began \nto bring up blood. It began to snow and the glaciers became \nterribly slippery; we were fa^ed our and every step meant \na special effort. But still we persisted in our foolhardy attempt. \n\n ? \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nWe had left our camp at four in the morning and alter twelve \nhours\u2019 almost continuous climbing we were rewarded by the \nsight of a huge ice-field. This was a magnificent sight, surrounded \nas it was by snow-peaks, like a diadem or an amphitheatre of the \ngods. But fresh snow and mists soon hid the sight from us. I do \nnot know what our Jiltitude was but I think it must have been \nabout , to , feet, as we were considerably higher than \nthe cave of Amaranath. We had now to cross this ice-field, a \ndistance probably of half a mile, and then go down on the other \nside to the cave. We thought that as the climbing was over, our \nprincipal difficulties had also been surmounted, and so, very \ntired but in good humour, we Iregan this stage of the journey. It \nwas a tricky business as there were many crevasses and the fresh \nsnow often covered a dangerous spot. It was this frc.sh snow that \nalmost proved to be my undoing, for I stepped upon it and it \ngave way and down I went a huge and yawning crevasse. It was \na tremendous fissure and anything that went right down it could \nbe assured of safe keeping and preservation for some geological \nages. But the rope held and I clutched to the side of the crevasse \n\u00abad was pulled out. We were shaken up by this but still we per- \nsisted in going on. The crevasses, however, increased in number \nand width and we had no equipment or means of crossing some \nof them. And so at last we turned back, weary and disappointed, \nand the cave of Amaranath remained unvisited. \n\nThe higher valleys and mountains of Kashmir fascinated me \nso much that I resolved to come back again soon. I made many \na plan and worked out many a tom, and one, the very thought of \nwhich filled me with delight, was a visit to Manasarovar, the \nwonder lake of Tibet, and snow-covered Kailas near by. That was \neighteen years ago, and I am still as far tis ever from Kailas and \nManasarovar. I have not even been to visit Kashmir again, much \nas I have longed to, and ever more and more I have got en- \ntangled in the coils of politics and public affairs. Instead of \ngoing up mountains or crossing the seas I have to satisfy my \nwanderlust by coming to prison. But still I plan, for that is a joy \nthat no one can deny even in prison, and besides what else can \none do in prison? And I dream of the day when I shall wander \nabout the Himalayas and cross them to reach that lake and \nmountain of my desire. But meanwhile the sands of life run on \nand youth passes into middle age and that will give place \nto something worse, and sometimes I think that I may grow \ntoo old to reach Kailas and Manasarovar. But the journey \nis always worth the making even though the end may not be \nin siRht. \n\n\n\nMY WEDUING AND AN ADVENTURE \n\n\u201c Yea, in tny mind these mountains rise. \nTheir perils dyed with evening\u2019s rose ; \nAnd still my ghost sits at my eyes \nAnd thirsts for their unirouhlcd snows.\u201d \n BACK TO PRISON \n\nShadow is itself unrestrained in its path while sunshine, \nas an incident of its very nature, is pursued a hundredfold \nby nuance. Thus is sorrow from happiness a thing apart; \nthe scope of happiness, however, is hampered by the aches \nand hurts of endless sorrows. \n\nRajatarangini.^ \n\nI WAS back again in Naini Prison, and I felt as if I was starting \na fresh term of imprisonment. In and out, out and in; what a \nshuttlecock I had become I This switching on and oflf shook \nup the whole system emotionally and it was not easy to adjust \nonself to repeated changes. I had expected to be put in my old \ncell at Naini to which a previous long stay had accustomed \nme. There were some flowers there; originally planted by my \nbrother-in-law, Ranjit Pandit, and a good veranda. But this \nold Barrack No.  was occupied by a detenu, a State prisoner, \nkept confined without trial or conviction. It was not considered \ndesirable for me to associate with him, and I was therefore \nplaced in another part of the gaol which was much more closed \nm and was devoid of flowers or greenery. \n\nBut the place where I spent my days and nights mattered \nlittle, for my mind was elsewhere. I feared that the little im- \nprovement that had taken place in Kamala\u2019s condition would \nnot stand the shock of my re-arrest. And so it happened. For \nsome days it was arranged to supply me in prison with a very \nbrief doctor\u2019s bulletin daily. This came by a devious route. The \ndoctor had to telephone it to the police headquarters and the \nlatter then sent it on to the prison. It was not considered \ndesirable to have any direct contacts between the doctors \nand the gaol staff. For two weeks these bulletins came to \nme, sometimes rather irregularly, and then they were stopped \nalthough there was a progressive deterioration in Kamala's \ncondition. \n\nBad news and the waiting fer news made the days intolerably \nlong and the nights were sometimes worse. Time seemed almost \nto stand still or to move with desperate slowness, and every \n\n^ R. S. Pandit\u2019s translation. (\u201cRiver of Kings.\u201d Taranga, ym \nverse, .) \n\n\n \n\n\n\nKA.MALA NEHRU \n\n\n\nBACK TO PRISON \n\n\n \n\nhour was a burden and a horror. I had never before had \nthis feeling in this acute degree. I thought then that I \nwas likely to be released within two months or so, after the \nBombay Congress Session, but those two months seemed an \neternity. \n\nExactly a month after my re-arrest a police ofBcer took me \nfrom prison on a brief visit to my wife, I was told that I would \nbe allowed to visit her in this way twice a week, and even the \ntime for it was fixed. I waited on the fourth day\u2014 no one came \nfor me; and on the fifth, sixth, seventh. I became weary of wait- \ning. News reached me that her condition was becoming critical \nagain. What a joke it was, I thought, to tell me that I would \nbe taken to see her twice a week. \n\nAt last the month of September was over. They were the \nlongest and most damnable thirty days that I had ever \nexperienced. \n\nSuggestions were made to me through various intermediaries \nthat if I could give an assurance, even an informal assurance, \nto keep away from politics for the rest of my term I would \nbe released to attend on Kamala. Politics were far enough from \nmy thoughts just then, and the politics I had seen during my \neleven days outside had disgusted me, but to give an assurance! \nAnd to be disloyal to my pledges, to the cause, to my col- \nleagues, to myself  It was an impossible condition, whatever \nhappened. To do so meant inflicting a mortal injury on the \nroots of my being, on almost everything I held sacred. I was \ntold that Kamala\u2019s condition was becoming worse and worse \nand my presence by her side might make all the difforence \nbetween Ufe and death. Was my personal conceit and pride \ngreater than my desire to give her this chance? It might have \nbeen a terrible predicament for me, but fortunately that \ndilemma did not face me in that way at least. I knew that \nKamala herself would strongly disapprove of my giving any \nundertaking, and if I did anything of the kind it would shock \nher and harm her. \n\nEarly in October I was taken to see her again. She was lying \nalmost in a daze with a high temperature. She longed to have \nme by her, but as I was leaving her, to go back to prison, she \nsmiled at me bravely and beckoned to me to bend down. When \nI did so, she whispered : \" What is this about your giving an \nassurance to Government? Do not pve it! \u201d \n\nDuring the eleven days I was out of prison it had been de- \ncided to send Kamala, as soon as she was a little better,, to a \nmore suitable place for treatment. Ever since then we had \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\n\nwaited for her to get better, but instead she had gone down- \nhill, and now, six weeks later, the change for the worse was \nvery marked. It was futile to continue waiting and watching \nthis process of deterioration, and it was decided to send her to \nBhowali in the hills even in her present condition. \n\nThe day before she was to leave for Bhowali I was taken from \nprison to bid her good-bye. When will I see her again? I \nwondered. And will I see her at all? But she looked bright \nand cheerful that day, and I felt happier than I had done \nfor long. \n\nNearly three weeks later I was transferred from Naini Prison \nto Almora District Gaol so as to be nearer to Kamala. Bhowali \nwas on the way, and my police escort and I spent a few hours \nthere. I was greatly pleased to note the improvement in Kamala, \nand I left her, to continue my journey to Almora, with a light \nheart. Indeed, even before I had reached her, the mountains had \nfilled me with joy. \n\nI was glad to be back in these mountains, and as our car sped \nalong the winding road the cold morning air and the unfolding \npanorama brought a sense of exhilaration. Higher and higher \nwe went: the 'gorges deepened: the peaks lost themselves in the \nclouds : the vegetation changed till the firs and pines covered \nthe hill-sides. A turn of the road would bring to our eyes sud- \ndenly a new expanse of hills and valleys with a little river \ngurgling in the depths below. I could not have my fill of the \nsight and I looked on hungrily, storing my memory with it, so \nthat I might revive it in my mind when actual sight was \ndenied. \n\n\nClusters of little mountain huts clung to the hill-sides, and \n\n\nfrom a distance, huge steps iraich sometimes went from the \nvalley below right up almost to the mountain top. What \nenormous labour had gone to make nature yield a little food \nto the sparse population! How they toiled unceasingly only to \nget barely enough for their needs! Those ploughed terraces \ngave a domesticated look to the hillsides and they contrasted \nstrangely with the bleaker or the more wooded slopes. \n\nIt was very pleasant in the daytime and, as the sun rose \nhigher, the growing warmth brought life to the mountains and \nthey seemed to lose their remoteness and become friendly and \ncompanionable. But how they change their aspect with the pass- \ning of day ! How cold and grim they become when \u201c Night with \ngiant strides stalks o'er the world \" and life hides and protects \n\n\n\nBACK TO PRISON \n\n\n \n\nitself and leaves wild nature to its own. In the semi-darkness \nof the moonlight or starlight the mountains loom up mys- \nterious, threatening, overwhelming, and yet almost insub- \nstantial, and through the valleys can be heard the moaning \nof the wind. The poor traveller shivers as he goes his lonely \nway and senses hostility everywhere. Even the voice of the \nwind seems to mock him and challenge him. And at other \ntimes there is no breath of wind or other sound, and there is \nan absolute silence that is oppres.sive in its intensity. Only the \ntelegraph wires perhaps hum faintly, and the stars seem \nbrighter and nearer than ever. The mountains look down \ngrimly, and one seems to be face to face with a mystery that \nterrifies. With Pascal one thinks: \u201cLa silence dternel de ces \nespaces infini m'effraie\u201d. In the plains the nights are never \nquite so soundless; life is still audible there, and the murmuring \nand humming of various animals and insects break the stillness \nof the night. \n\nBut the night with its chill and inhospitable message was yet \ndistant as we motored along to Almora. As we neared the end \nof our journey, a turn in the road and a sudden lifting of the \nclouds Ijrought a new sight which I saw with a gasp of sur- \nprised delight. The snowy peaks of the Himalayas stood glisten- \ning in the far distance, high above the wooded motmtains that \nintervened. Calm and inscmtable they seemed, with all the \nwisdom of past ages, mighty sentinels over the vast Indian \nplain. The very sight of them cooled the fever in the brain, \nand the petty conflicts and intrigues, the lusts and falsehoods \nof the plains and the cities seemed trivial and far away before \ntheir eternal ways. \n\nThe little gaol of Almora was perched up on a ridge. I was \ngiven a lordly barrack to live in. This consisted of one huge \nhall, fifty-one feet by seventeen, with a katcha, very uneven floor, \nand a worm-eaten roof which was continually coming down in \nlittle bits. There were fifteen windows and a door, or rather \nthere were so many barred openings in the walls, for there were \nno doors or windows. There was thus no lack of fresh air. As \nit grew colder some of the window-openings were covered with \ncoir matting. In this vast expanse (which was bigger than any \nyard at D^ra Dun) I lived in solitary grandeur. But I was \nnot quite alone, for at least two score sparrows had made \ntheir home in the broken-down roof. Sometimes a wandering \ncloud would visit me, its many arms creeping in through \nthe numerous openings and filling the . place with a damp \nm}\u00bbi* \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nHere I was locked up every evening at about five, after I had \ntaken my last meal, a kind of high tea, at four-thirty; and at \nseven in the morning my barred door would be unlocked. In \nthe daytime I would sit either in my barrack or outside in an \nadjoining yard, warming myself in the sun. I could just see \nover the enclosing walls the top of a mountain a mile or so \naway, and above me I had a vast expanse of blue sky dotted \nwith clouds. Wonderflil shapes these clouds assumed, and I \nnever grew tired of watching them. I fancied I saw them take \nthe shape of all manner of animals, and sometimes they would \njoin together and look like a mighty ocean. Or they would be \nlike a beach, and the rustling of the breeze through the deodars \nwould sound like the coming in of the tide on a distant sea- \nfront. Sometimes a cloud would advance boldly on us, seem- \ningly solid and compact, and then dissolve in mist as it came \nnear and finally enveloped us- \n\nI preferred the wide expanse of my barrack to a narrow cell, \nthough it was lonelier than a smaller place would have been. \nEven when it rained outside I could walk about in it. But as \nit grew colder its cheerlessness became more marked, and my \nlove for fresh air and the open abated when the temperature \nhovered about the freezing-point. The new year brought a \ngood fall of snow to my delight, and even the drab surround- \nings of prison became beautiful. Especially beautiful and fairy- \nlike were the deodar trees just outside the gaol walls with their \ngarment of snow, \n\nI was worried by the ups and downs of Kamala\u2019s condition, \nand a piece of bad news would upset me for a while, but the \nhill air calmed me and soothed me and I reverted to my habit \nof sleeping soundly. As I was on the verge of sleep I often \nthought what a wonderful and mysterious thing was sleep. \nWhy should one wake up fi:om it? Suppose I did not wake \nat all? \n\nYet the desire to be out gaol was strong in me, more than I \nhad ever felt before. The Bombay Congress was over, and \nNovember came and went by and the excitement of the As- \nsembly elections also passed away. I half expected that I might \nbe released soon. \n\nBut then came the surprising news .of the arrest and con- \nviction of Khan Abdul Ghaffiir Khan and the amazing \norders passed on Subhas Bose during his brief visit to India. \nThese orders in themselves were devoid of aU humanity \nand consideration; they were applied to one who was held \nin affection and esteem by vast numbers of his country- \n\n\n\nBACK TO PRISON \n\n\n  \n\nmen, and who had hastened home, in spite of his own \nillness, to the death-bed of his father \u2014 to arrive too late. If \nthat was the outlook of the Government there could be no \nchance of my premature release. Official announcements later \nmade this perfectly clear. \n\nAfter I had been a month in Almora gaol I was taken to \nBhoivali to see Kamala. Since then I have visited her approxi- \nmately every third week. Sir Samuel Hoare, the Secretary of \nState for India, has repeatedly stated that I am allowed to visit \nmy wife once or twice a week. He would have been more cor- \nrect if he had said once or twice a month. During the last \nthree and a half months that I have been at Almora I have \npaid five visits to her. I do not mention this as a grievance, \nbecause I think that in this matter the Government have been \nvery 'considerate to me and have given me quite unusual \nfacilities to visit Kamala. I am grateful to them for this. The \nbrief visits I have paid her have been very precious to me and \nperhaps to her also. The doctors suspended their regime for \nthe day of my visit to some extent, and I was permitted to \nhave fairly long talks with her. We came ever nearer to each \nother, and to leave her was a wrench. We met only to be \nparted. And sometimes I thought with anguish that a day \nmight come when the parting was for good. \n\nMy mother had gone to Bombay for treatment, for she had \nnot recovered ftom her ailment. She seemed to be progressing. \nOne morning in mid-January a telegram brought a wholly un- \nexpected shock. She had had a stroke of paralysis. There was \na possibility of my being transferred to a Bombay prison to \nenable me to see her, but as there was a little improvement in \nher condition I was not sent. \n\nJanuary has given place to February, and there is the whisper \nof spring in the air. The bulbul and other birds arc again to \nbe seen and heard, and tiny shoots are mysteriously bursting \nout of the ground and gazing at this strange world. Rhododen- \ndrons make blood-red patches on the hiU-sides, and peace and \nplum blossoms are peeping out. The days pass and I count \nthem as they go, thinking of my next visit to Bhowali. I won- \nder what truth there is in the saying that life's rich gifts follow \nfrustration and cruelty and sedation. Perhaps the gifts would \nnot be appreciated otherwise. Perhaps suffering is necessary for \nclear thought, but excess of it may cloud the brain. Gaol \nencourages introspection, and my long years in prison have \nforced me to look more and more withm myself. I was not by \nnamre an introvert, but prison life, like strong coffee or \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n ^ \n\nStrychnine, leads to introversion. Sometimes, to amuse myself, \nI draw an outline of Professor McDougall's cube for the \nmeasurement of introversion and extroversion, and I gaze at \nit to find out how frequent are the changes from one interpreta- \ntion to another. They seem to be rapid. ",
    "1917-1921": " THE COMING OF GANDHIJf: SATYAGRAHA \nAND AMRITSAR \n\nThe end of the World War found India in a state of suppressed \nexcitement. Industrialisation had spread and the capitalist class \nhad grown in wealth and power. This handful at the top had \nprospered and were greedy for more power and opportunity to \ninvest their savings and add to their wealth.' The great majority, \nhowever, were not so fortunate and looked forward to a lighten- \ning of the burdens that crushed them. Among the middle classes \nthere was everywhere an expectation of great constitutional \nchanges which would bring a large measure of self-rule and thus \nbetter their lot by opening out many fresh avenues of growth to \nthem. Political agitation, peacefiil and wholly constitutional as \nit was, seemed to be working itself to a head and people talked \nwith assurance of self-determination and self-government. Some \nof this unrest was visible alsp among the masses, especially the \npeasantry. In the rural areas of the Punjab the forcible methods \nof recruitment were still bitterly remembered, and the fierce \nsuppression of the \u2018 Komagata Maru ' people and others by con- \nspiracy trials added to the widespread resentment. The soldiers \nback fi-om active service on distant fronts were no longer the \nsubservient robots that they^ used to be. They had grown men- \ntally and there was much discontent among them. \n\nAmong the Muslims there was anger over the treatment of \nTurkey and the Kliilafat question and an agitation was growing. \nThe treaty with Turkey had not been signed yet, but the whole \nsituation was ominous. So, while they agitated, they waited. \n\nThe dominant note all over India was one of waiting and \nexpectation, full of hope and yet tinged with fear and anxiety. \nTheii came the Rowlatt Bills with their drastic provisions for \narrest and trial without any of the checks and formalities which \nthe law is supposed to provide. A wave of anger greeted them \naU over India and even the Moderates joined in this and opposed \nthe measures with all their might. Indeed there was universal \nopposition on the part of Indians of all shades of opinion. Still \nthe Bills were pushed through by the officials and became law, \nthe principal concession made bemg to limit them for three \nyears. \n\nIt is instructive to look back after fifteen years to these Bills \n\n \n\n\n\nTHE COMING OF GANDHIJI I \n\nand the upheaval they caused. They were made into law and yet, \nso far as I know, they were never used even once during the three \nyears of their life \u2014 ^three years 'which were not quiet years hut \nwere the most troubled years that India had known since the \nRevolt of . Thus the British Government, in the teeth of \nun anim ous public opinion, pushed through a law which they \nthemselves never used afterwards, and thus invited an upheaval. \nOne might almost think that the object of the measure was to \nbring trouble. \n\nAnother interesting ftict is this. To-day, fifteen years later, we \nhave any number of laws on the statute book, functioning ftom \nday to day, which are far harsher than the Rowlatt Bills were. \nCompared to these new laws and ordinances, under which we \nnow enjoy the blessings of British rule, the Rowlatt Bills might \nalmost be considered a charter of liberty. There is this difference, \nof course: since  we have had a large instalment of what \nis called self-government, known as the Montagu-Chelmsford \nscheme, and now we are told that we are on the verge of another \nbig instalment. We progress. \n\nGandhiji had passed through a serious illness early in . \nAlmost ftom his sick bed he begged the Viceroy not to give his \nconsent to the Rowlatt Bills. That appeal was ignored as others \nhad been and then, almost against his will, Gandhiji took the \nleadership in his first all-India agitation. He started the Satyag- \nraha Sabha, the members of wmch were pledged to disobey the \nRowlatt Act, if it was applied to them, as well as other objection- \nable laws to be specified from time to time. In other words they \nwere to court gaol openly and deliberately. \n\nWhen I first read about this proposal in the newspapers my \nreaction was one of tremendous reuef. Here at last was a way \nout of the tangle, a method of action which was straight and \nopen and possmly effective. I was , afire with enthusiasm and \nwanted to join the Satyagraha Sabha immediately.^ I hardly \nthought of the consequences\u2014 -law-breaking, gaol-going, etc. \u2014 \nand if I thought of them I did not care. But suddenly my ardour \nwas damped and I realised that all was not plain sailing. My \nfather was dead against this new idea. He was not in the habit \nof being swept away by new proposals; he thought carefully of \nthe consequences before he took any fresh step. And the more he \nthought of the Satyagraha Sabha and its prominme, the lew he \nliked it. *What good would the gaol-going of a number of indi- \nviduals do, what pressure could it bring on the Government? \nApart jftom these general considerations, what really moved him \nwas the personal issue. .It seemed to him preposterous that I \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nshould go to prison. The trek to prison had not then begun and \nthe idea was most repulsive. Father was intensely attached to his \nchildren. He was not showy in his affection, but behind his \nrestraint there was a great love. \n\nFor many days there was this mental conflict, and because \nboth of us felt that big issues were at stake involving a complete \nupsetting of our lives, we tried hard to be as considerate to each \nother as possible. I wanted to lessen his obvious suffering if I \ncould, but I had no doubt in my mind that I had to go the way \nof Satyagraha. Both of us had a distressing time, and night alter \nnight I wandered about alone, tortured in mind and trying to \ngrope my way out. Father \u2014 discovered later\u2014 actually tried \nsleeping on the floor to find out what it was like, as he thought \nthat this would be my lot in prison. \n\nGandhiji came to Allahabad at father\u2019s request and they had \nlong talks at which I was not present. As a result Gandhiji \nadvised me not to precipitate matters or to do anything which \nmight upset father. I was not happy at this, but other events \ntook place in India which changed the whole situation, and the \nSatyagraha Sabha stopped its activities. \n\nSatyagraha Day \u2014 all-India hartals and complete\u2019suspension of \nbusiness \u2014 ^firing by the police and military at Delhi andt Amritsar, \nand the killing of many people \u2014 ^mob violence in Amritsar and \nAhmedabad\u2014 the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh \u2014 ^the long horror \nand terrible indignity of martial law in the Punjab. The Punjab \nwas isolated, cut off from the rest of India; a thick veil seemed \nto cover it and hide it firom outside eyes. There was hardly \nany news, and people could not go there or come out from \nthere. \n\nOdd individuals, who managed to escape from that inferno, \nwere so terror-struck that they could give no clear account. Help- \nlessly and impotently, we, who were outside, waited for scraps of \nnews and bitterness fflled our hearts. Some of us wanted to go \nopenly to the affected parts of the Punjab and defy the martial \nlaw regulations. But we were kept ba^, and meanwhile a big \norgamsation for relief and enquiry was set up on behalf of the \nCongress. \n\nAs soon as martial law was vnthdratyn from the principal areas \nand outsiders were allowed to come in, prominent Congressmen \nand others poured into the Punjab offering their services for \nrelief or enquiry work. The relief work was largely directed by \nPandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Swami Shraddhananda; the \nenquiry part was mainly under the direction of my father and \nMr. C. R. Dm, with Gandhiji taking a great deal of interest in \n\n\n\nTHE COMING OF GANDHIJI  \n\nit and often being consulted by the others. Deshbandhu Das \nespecially took the Amritsar area under his charge and I was \ndeputed to accompany him there and assist him in any way he \ndesired. That was the first occasion  had of working with him \nand under him and I valued that experience very much and my \nadmiration for him grew. Most of the evidence relating to \nJallianwala Bagh and that terrible lane where human beings were \nmade to crawl on their bellies, that subsequently appeared in the \nCongress Inquiry Report, was taken down in our presence. We \npaid numerous visits to the so-called Bagh itself and examined \nevery bit of it carefully. \n\nA suggestion has been made, I think by Mr. Edward Thomp- \nson, that General Dyer was under the impression that there were \nother exits from the Bagh and it was because of this that he \ncontinued his firing for so long. Even if that was Dyer\u2019s impres- \nsion, and there were in fact some exits, that would hardly lessen \nhis responsibility. But it seems very strange that he should have \nsuch an impression. Any person, standing on the raised ground \nwhere he stood, could have a good view of the entire space and \ncould see how shut in it was on all sides by houses several storeys \nhigh. Only on one side, for a hundred met or so, there was no \nhouse, but a low wall about five feet high. With a murderous \nfire mowing them down and unable to find a way out, thousands \nof people rushed to this wall and tried to climb over it. The \nfire was then directed, it appears (both from our evidence and the \ninnumerable bullet-marks on the wall itself) towards this wall to \nprevent people from escaping over it. And when all was over, \nsome of the biggest heaps of dead and wounded lay on either \nside of this wall. \n\nTowards the end of that year (t*) ^ travelled fi:om Amritsar \nto Delhi by the night train. The compartment I entered was \nalmost full and aU the berths, except one upper one, were occu- \npied by sleeping passengers. I took the vacant upper berth. In \nthe morning I discovered that aU my fellow-passengers were \nmilitary officers. They conversed with each other in loud voices \nwhich I could not help overhearing. One of them was holding \nforth in an aggressive and triumphant tone and soon I discovered \nthat he was Dyer, the hero of Jallianwala Bagh, and he was \ndescribing his Amritsar experiences. He pointed out how he had \nthe whole town at his mercy and he had felt like reducing the \nrebellious city to a heap of ashes, but he took pity on it and \nrefirained. Hfe was evidently coming back from, Lahore after \ngiving his evidence before the Hunter Committee of Inqmiy. \nI was greatly shocked to hear his conversatton and to observe his \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ncallous manner. He descended at Delhi station in pyjamas with \nbright pink stripes, and a dressing-gown. \n\nDuring the Punjab inquiry I saw a great deal of Gandhiji. \nVery often his proposals seemed novel to our committee and it \ndid not approve of them. But almost always he argued his way \nto their acceptance and subsequent events showed the wisdom of \nhis advice. Faith in his political insight grew in me. \n\nThe Punjab happenings and the inquiry into them had a \nprofound effect on father. His whole legal and constitutional \nfoundations were shaken by them and his mind was gradually \nprepared for that change which was to come a year later. He had \nmready moved far from his old moderate position. Dissatisfied \nwith the leading Moderate newspaper, the Leader of Allahabad, \nhe had started another daily, the Independent, from Allahabad \nearly in . This paper met with great success, but firom the \nverjr beginning it was handicapped by quite an amazing degree \nof mcompetencc in the running of it. Almost everybody con- \nnected with it \u2014 directors, editors, managerial staff\u2014 had ' their \nshare. of responsibility for this. I was one of the directors, with- \nout the least experience of the job, and the troubles and the \nsquabbles of the paper became quite a nightmare to me. Both \nmy father and I were, however, soon dragged away to the Punjab, \nand during our long absence the paper deteriorated greatly and \nbecame involved in financial diflBculties. It never recovered from \nthem, and, although it had bright patches in  and , it \nbegan to go to pieces as soon as we went to gaol. It expired finally \nearly in . This experience of newspaper proprietorship gave \nme a fright and ever smee I have refused to assume responwbility \nas a director of any newspaper. Indeed I could not do so because \nof my preoccupations in pnson and outside. \n\nFa&er presided over the Amritsar Congress during Christmas \n. He issued a moving appeal to the Moderate leaders or the \nliberals, as they were now calling themselves, to join this session \nbecause of the new situation created by the horrors of martial \nlaw. \u201c The lacerated heart of the Punjab \" called to them, he \nwrote. Would they not answer that call? But they did not \nanswer it in the way he wanted, ^d refused to join. Their eyes \nwere on the new reforms that were coming as a result of the \nMontagu-Chehnsford recommendations. Tms refusal hurt father \nand widened the^lf between him and the Liberals. \n\nThe Amritsar Congress was the first Gandhi Congress. Loka- \nmanya Tilak was also present and took a prominent part in the \ndeliberations, but there could be no doubt about it that the \nmajority of the, delegates, and even more so the great crowds \n\n\n\nTHE COMING OF GANDHIJI  \n\noutside, looked to Gandhi for leadership. The slogan Mahatma \nGandhi ki jai began to dominate the Indian political horizon. \nThe Ali Brothers, recently discharged from internment, imme- \ndiately joined the Congress, and the national movement began \nto take a new shape and develop a new orientation. \n\nM. Mohammad Ali went off soon on a Khilafat deputarion to \nEurope. In India the KhilaBtt Committee came more and more \nunder Gandhiji\u2019s influence and began to flirt with his ideas of \nnon-violent non-co-operation. I remember one of the earliest \nmeetings of the Khilafat leaders and Moulvies and Ulemas in \nDelhi in January . A Khilafat deputation was going to wait \non the Viceroy, and Gandhiji was to join it. Before he reached \nDelhi, however, a draft of the proposed address was, according \nto custom, sent to the Viceroy. When Gandhiji arrived and read \nthis draft, he strongly disapproved of it and even said that he \ncould not be a party to the deputation, if this draft was not \nmaterially altered. His objection was that the draft was vague \nand wordy and there was no clear indication in it of the abso- \nlute minimum demands which the Muslims must have. He \nsaid that this was not ftiir to the Viceroy and the British Govern- \nment, or to the people, or to themselves. They must not make \nexaggerated clemands which they were not going to press, but \nshould state the minimum clearly and without possibility of \ndoubt, and stand by it to the death. If they were serious, this \nwas the only right and honourable course to adopt. \n\nThis argument was a novel one in political or other circles in \nIndia. \"We were used to vague exaggerations and flowery lan- \nguage and always there was an idea of a bargain in our minds. \nGandhiji, however, carried his point and he wrote to the Private \nSecretary of the Viceroy, pointing out the defects and vagueness \nof the draft address sent, and forwarding a few additional para- \ngraphs to be added to it. These paragraphs gave the minimum \ndemands. The Viceroy\u2019s reply was interesting. He refused to \naccept the new paragraphs and said that the previous draft.was, \nin his opinion, quite proper. Gandhiji felt that this corres- \npondence had made his own position and that of the Khilafat \nCommittee clear, and so he joined the deputation after all. \n\nIt was obvious that the Government were not going to accept \nthe demands of the Khilafet Committee and a struggle was \ntherefore bound to come. There were long talks with the \nMoulvies and the Ulemas, and non-violence and non-co-operation \nwere discussed, especially non-violence. Gandhiji told them that \nhe was theirs to command, but on the delate understanding \nthat they accepted non-violence with aU its implications. There \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwas to be no weakening on that, no temporising, no mental \nreservations. It was not easy for the Moulvies to grasp this idea \nbut they agreed, making it clear that they did so as a policy \nonly and not as a creed, for their religion did not prohibit the \nuse of violence in a righteous cause. \n\nThe political and the Khilafat movements developed side by \nside during that year igao, both going in the same direction and \neventually joining hands with the adoption by the Congress of \nGandhiji\u2019s non-violent non-co-operation. The Khilafat Com- \nmittee adopted this programme first, and August ist was fixed \nfor the commencement of the campaign. \n\nEarlier in the year a Muslim meeting (I think it was the Council \nof the Moslem League) was held in Allahabad to consider this \nprogramme. The meeting took place in Syed Raza Ali\u2019s house. \nM. Mohammad Ali was still in Europe but M. Shaukat Ali was \npresent. I remember that meeting because it thoroughly dis- \nappointed me. Shaukat AU was, of course, full of enthusiasm \nbut almost all the others looked thoroughly unhappy and uncom- \nfortable. They did not have the courage to disagree and yet \nthey obviously had no intention of doing anything ra.sh. Were \nthese the people to lead a revolutionary movement, I thought, \nand to challenge the British Empire? .Gandhiji addressed them \nand after hearing him they looked even more frmhtencd than \nbefore. He spoke well in his best dictatorial vein. He was humble \nbut also clear-cut and hard as a diamond, pleasant and soft- \nspoken but inflexible and terribly earnest. His eyes were mild \nand deep, yet out of them blazed out a fierce energy and deter- \nmination. This is going to be a great struggle, he said, with a \nvery powerful adversary. If you want to take it up, you must \nbe prepared to lose everything, and you must subject yourself \nto the strictest non-violence and discipline. When war is declared \nmartial law prevails, and in our non-violent struggle there will \nalso have to be dictatorship and martial law on our side, if we \nare to win. You have every right to kick me out, to demand my \nhead, or to pimish me whenever and howsoever you choose. But \nso long as you choose to keep me as your leader you must accept \nnw conditions, you must accept dictatorship and the discipline \nof martial law. But that dictatorship will always be subject to \nyour goodwill and to your accqitance arid to your co-operailon. \nThe moment you have had enough of me, throw me out, \ntrample upon me, and I shall not complain. \n\nSomething to this effect he said and these military analogies \nand the unyielding earnestness of the man made the flesh of \nmost of bis hearm creep. But Shaukat Ali was there to keep \n\n\n\nTHE COMING OF GANDHIJI  \n\nthe waverers up to the mark, and when the time for voting came \nthe great majority of them quietly and shamefacedly voted for \nthe proposition, that is for warl \n\nAs vve were coming home from the meeting I asked Gandhiji \nif this was the way to start a great struggle. I had expected \nenthusiasm, spirited language and a flashing of eyes; instead we \nsaw a very tame gathering of timid, middle-aged folk. And yet \nthese people, such was the pressure of mass opinion, voted for \nthe struggle. Of course, very few of these members of the \nMoslem League joined the struggle later. Many of them found \na safe sanctuary in Government jobs. The Moslem League did \nnot represent, then or later, any considerable section of Moslem \nopinion. It was the Khilafet Committee of  that was a \npowerful and far more representative body, and it was this Com- \nmittee that entered upon the struggle with enthusiasm. \n\nThe ist of August had been fixed by Gandhiji for the \ninauguration of non-co-operation, although the Congress had \nnot considered or accepted the proposal so far. On that dajr \nLokamanya Tilak died m Bombay. That very morning Gandhiji \nhad reached Bombay after a tour in Sindh. I was with him and \nwe joined that mighty demonstration in which the whole of \nBombay\u2019s million population seemed to have poured out to do \nreverence to the great leader whom' they had loved so well.  I AM EXTERNED AND THE CONSEQUENCES \nTHEREOF \n\nMy politics had been those of my class, the bourgeoisie. Indeed \nall vocal politics then (and to a great extent even now) were those \nof the middle classes, and Moderate and Extremist alike repre- \nsented them and, in different keys, sought their betterment. The \nModerate represented especially the handful of the upper middle \nclass who had on the whole prospered under British rule and \nwanted no sudden changes which might endanger their present \nposition and interests. They had close relations with the British \nGovernment and the big landlord class. The Extremist repre- \nsented also the lower ranks of the middle class. The industrial \nworkers, their number swollen up by the war, were only locally \norganised in some places and had little influence. The peasantiy \nwere a blind, poverty-stricken, suffering mass, resigned to their \nmiserable fate and sat upon and exploited by all who came in \ncontact with them\u2014 -the Government, landlords, money-lenders, \npetty ofl&cials, police, lawyers, priests. \n\nA reader of the newsp^ers would hardly imagine that a vast \npeasantry and millions of workers existed in India or bad any \nimportance. The British-owned Anglo-Indian newspapers were \nfun of the doings of high ofidcials; English social life in the big \ndties and in the hill stations was described at great length with \nits parties, fancy-dress balls and amateur theatricals. Indian \npolitics, fiom the Indian point of view-, were almost completely \nIgnored by them, even the Confess sessions being disposed of \nin a few lines on a back page. They were not considered news \nof any value except when some Indian, prominent or otherwise, \nslanged or criticised the Congress and its pretensions. Occasion- \nally there was a brief referents to a strike, and the rural areas \nonly came into prominence when there was a riot. \n\nIndian newspapers tried to model themselves on the Anglo- \nIndian ones but gave much greater prominence to the nationalist \nmovetnent. For the rest they were interested in the appointment \nbf Indians to important or unimportant oflSces, their promotions \nand transfers \u2014 ^when there was always a party given to the out- \ngoing ofl&cer at which \"great enthusiasm prevailed At the \ntiine of a flesh Government settlement of an agricultural area, \n\n, which almost always resulted in an increase of Government \n\n\n\nI AM EXTERKEO \n\n\n \n\nrevenue, there was an outcry because the landlord\u2019s pocket was \naffected. The poor tenant was nowhere in tlie picture. These \nnewspapers were owned and controlled chiefly by the landlords \nand the industrialists. Such was that which was called the \n\u201cnationalist \u201d press. \n\nOne of the persistent demands of the Congress itself, during \nits early years, was a permanent settlement of the land in the \nnon-settled areas, in order that the rights of the landlords might \nbe protected. No mention was made of the tenant. \n\nConditions have changed greatly during the last twenty years \nbecause of the growth of the nationalist movement, and now \neven the British-owned newspapers have to give space to Indian \npolitical problems if they are to retain their Indian readers. \nBut they do so in their own peculiar way. Indian newspapers \nhave developed a slightly wider outlook and talk benevolently of \nthe worker and the peasant, because that is the fashion, and there \nis a growing interest in industrial and rural problems among their \nreaders. But essentially now, as before, they voice the interests \nof the Indian capitalist and landlord class which owns them. \nMany Indian princes have also taken to investing money in these \nnewspapers and they see to it that they get their money\u2019s worth. \nYet many of these newspapers arc called \" Congress \u201d news- \npapers, although many of those who control them are not even \nmembers of the Congress. But the Congress is a popular word \nwith the public and many an individual and a group exploit it \nto their advantage.. Newspapers which are prepared to take up \na more advanced position have, of course, always to live in fear \nof big fines or even of suppression under the stringent press \nlaws and censorship. \n\nIn igao I was totally ignorant of labour conditions in fiictories \nor fields, and my politied outlook was entirely bourgeois. I knew, \nof course, that there was terrible poverty and misery, and I felt \nthat the first aim of a politically free India must be to tackle \nthis problem of poverty. But political fireedom, with the \ninevitable dominance of the middle class, seemed to me the \nobvious next step. I was paying a little more attention to the \npeasant problem since Gandhiji\u2019s agrarian movements in Cham- \nparan ffiehar) and Kaira (Gujrat). But my mind was full of \npolitiou developments in  and of the coming of non- \nco-operation which was looming on the horizon. \n\nJust then a new interest devdoped in my life which was to \nplay an important part in later years. I was thrown, almost \nwithout any will of my own, into contact with the peasantiy. \nThis came about in a tnirious way. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nMy mother and Kamala (my wife) were both unwell, and early \nin May  I took them up to Mussoorie. My father was busy \nthen in a big raj case in which he was opposing Mr. C. R. Das. \nWe stopped at the Savoy Hotel in Mussoorie. At that time, peace \nnegotiations were proceeding between the Afghan and British \nenvoys (this was after the brief Afghan War in  when \nAmanullah came to the throne) at Mussoorie, and the Afghan \ndelegation were stopping at the Savoy Hotel. They kept to them- \nselves, however, fed separately, and did not appear in the \ncommon rooms. I was not particularly interested in them, and \nfor a whole month I did not see a single member of their delega- \ntion, and if I saw them I did not recognise them. Suddenly one \nevening I had a visit &om the Superintendent of Police and \nhe showed me a letter from the local Government asking him to \nget an undertaking from me that I would not have any dealings \nor contacts with the Afghan delegation. This struck me as extra- \nordinary since I had not even seen them during a month\u2019s stay \nand there was little chance of my doing so. The Superintendent \nknew this, as he was closely watching the delegation, and there \nwere literally crowds of secret service men about. But to give \nany undertaking went against the grain and I told him so. He \nasked me to see the District Magistrate, the Superintendent of \nthe Dun, and I did so. As I persisted in my refusal to give an \nundertaking an order of extemment was served on me, calling \nupon me to leave the district of Dehra Dun within twenty-four \nhours, which really meant within a few hours from Mussoorie. \nI did not like the idea of leaving my mother and wife, both \nof whom were ailing; and yet  did not think it right to break \nthe order. There was no civil disobedience then. So I left \nMussoorie. \n\nMy father had known Sir Harcourt Butler, who was then \nGovernor of the United Provinces, fairly well, and he wrote to \nhim a friendly letter saying that he was sure that he (Sir \nHarcourt) could not have issued such a stupid order; it must \nbe some bright person in Simla who was responsible for it. Sir \nHarcourt replied that the order was quite a harmless one and \nJawaharlal could easily have complied with it without any injury \nto his dignity. Father, in reply, disagreed with this and added \nthat, although there was no intention of deliberately breaking \nthe order, if my mother\u2019s or wife's health demanded it, I would \ncertainly return to Mussoorie, order or no order. As it happened, \nmy mother\u2019s condition took a tpm for the worse, and both father \nand I immediatdy started for Mussoorie. Just before starting, \nwe reedved a telegram resdnding the order. \n\n\n\nI AM EXTERNED \n\n\n \n\nWhen we reached Mussoorie the next morning the first person \nI noticed in the courtyard of the hotel was an Afghan who had \nmy baby daughter in his arms! I learnt that he was a minister \nand a member of the Afghan delegation. It transpired that \nimmediately after my externment the Afghans had read about \nit in the newspapers, and they were so much interested that the \nhead of the delegation took to sending my mother a basket of \nfruit and flowers every day. \n\nFather and I met one or two members of the delegation later \nand we were cordially invited to visit Afghanistan. Unhappily \nwe were unable to take advantage of this offer, and I do not \nknow if the invitation stands under the new dispensation in that \ncountry. \n\nAs. a result of the externment order from Mussoorie I spent \nabout two weeks in Allahabad, and it was during this period that \nI got entangled in theXiron (peasant) movement. That entangle- \nment grew in later years and influenced my mental outlook \ngreatly. I have sometimes wondered what would have happened \nif I had not been externed and had not been in Allahabad just \nthen with no other engagements. Very probably I would have \nbeen drawn to the kisans anyhow, sooner or later, but the manner \nof my going to them would have been different and the eflfect \non me might also have been different. \n\nEarly in June  (so far as I can remember) about two \nhundred kisans marched fifty miles from the interior of Partab- \ngarh district to Allahabad city with the intention of drawing \nthe attention of the prominent politicians there to their woe- \nbegone condition. They were led by a man named Ramachandra, \n^ himself was not a local peasant. I learnt that these kisans \nwere squatting on the river bank, on one of the Jumna ghats, \nand, accompanied by some friends, went to see them. They told \nus of the crushing exactions of the taluqadars, of inhuman \ntreatment, and that their condition had become , wholly in- \ntolerable. They begged us to acconmany them back to make \ninquiries as weU as to protect them from the vengeance of the \ntaluqadars who were angry at thdr having come to Allaha- \nbad on this mission. They would accept no denial and literally \nclung on to us. At last I promised to visit them two days or so \nlater. \n\nI went there with some colleagues and we spent three daw in \nthe villages far from the railway and even the pucca road. That \nvisit was a revdation to me. We found the whole counti^side \nafire with enthusiasm and full of a strange excitement. Enor- \nmous gatherings would take place at the briefest notice by word \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nof mouth. One village would communicate with another, and \nthe second with the third, and so on, and presently whole villages \nwould empty out, and all over the fields there would be men and \nwomen and children on the march to the meeting-place. Or, \nmore swiftly still, the cry of Sita Ram \u2014 Sita Ra-a-a-a-m \u2014 would \nfill the air, and travel far in aU directions and be echoed back \nfirom other villages, and then people would come streaming out \nor even running as fast as they could. They were in miserable \nrags, men and women, but their faces were full of excitement \nand their eyes glistened and seemed to expect strange happen- \nings which would, as if by a miracle, put an end to their long \nmisery. \n\nThey showered their affection on us and looked on us with \nloving and hopeful eyes, as if we were the bearers of good tidings, \nthe guides who were to lead them to the promised land. Looking \nat them and their misery and overflowing gratitude, I was filled \nwith shame and sorrow, shame at my own easy-going and com- \nfortable life and our petty politics of the city which ignored this \nvast multitude of semi-naked sons and daughters of India, sorrow \nat the degradation and overwhelming poverty of India. A new \npicture of India seemed to rise before me, naked, starving, \ncrushed, and utterly miserable. And their faith, in us, casual \nvisitors from the distant dt^, embarrassed me and filled me with \na new responsibility that firightened me. \n\nI listened to their innumerable tales of sorrow, their crushing \nand ever-growing burden of rent, illegal exactions, ejectments \nfirom land and mud hut, beatings; surrounded on all sides by \nvultures who preyed on them \u2014 ^zamindar\u2019s agents, money-lenders, \npolice; toiling all day to find that what they produced was not \ntheirs and their reward was kicks and curses and a hungry \nstomach. Many of those who were present were landless people \nwho had been ejected by the landlords, and had no land or hut \nto faU back upon. The land was rich but the burden on it was \nvery heavy, the holdings were small and there were too many \npeople after them. Tafing advantage of this land hunger the \nlandlords, unable under the law to enhance their rents he- \nTOnd a certain percentage, charged huge illegal premiums, \n^e tenant, knowing of no other alternative, bprrowed money \nftom the money-lender and paid the premium, and then, un- \nable to pay his debt or even the rent, was ejected and lost all \nhe had. \n\nThis process was an old one and the progressive pauperisation \nof the peasantry had been going on for a long time. What had \nhappened to hnng matters to a head and rouse up the country- \n\n\n\nI AM EXTERNED \n\n\n \n\nside? Economic conditions, of course, but these conditions were \nsimilar all over Oudh, while the agrarian upheaval of  and \n was largely confined to three districts\u2014 Partabgarh, Rae \nBareli and Fyzabad. This was partly due to the leadership of a \nremarkable person, Ramachandra, Baba Ramachandra as he was \ncalled. \n\nRamachandra was a man fiom Maharashtra in western \nIndia and he had been to Fiji as an indentured labourer. On \nhis return he had gradually drifted to these districts of Oudh \nand wandered about reciting Tulsidas\u2019s Ramayana and listening \nto tenants\u2019 grievances. He had little education and to some \nextent he exploited the tenantry for his own benefit, but he \nshowed remarkable powers of organisation. He taught the \npeasants to meet firequently in sabhas (meetings) to discuss their \nown troubles and thus gave them a feeling of solidarity. Occa- \nsionally huge mass meetings were held and this produced a sense \nof power. Slta-Ram was an old and cominon cry but he gave it \nan almost warlike significance and made it a signal for emer- \n\nf encies as well as a bond between different villages. Fyzabad, \nartabgarh and Rae Bareli are full of the old legends of \nRamacnandra and Sita \u2014 ^thesc districts formed part of the king- \ndom of Ayodhya \u2014 and the favourite book of the masses is \nTulsidas\u2019s Hindt Ramayana. Many people knew htmdreds of \nverses from this by heart. A recitation of this book and \nappropriate quotations from it was a favourite practice of \nRamachandra. Having organised the peasantry to some extent \nhe made all manner of promises to them, vague and nebulous \nbut full of hope for them. He had no programme of any kind \nand when he had brought them to a pitch of exdtement he tried \nto shift the responsibuity to others. This led him to bring a \nnumber of peasants' to Allahabad to interest people there in the \nmovement. \n\nRamachandra continued to take a prominent part in the \nagrarian movement for another year and served two or three \nsentences in, prison, but he turned out later to be a very irres- \nponsible and unrefiable person. \n\nOudh was a particularly good area for an agrarian agitation. \nIt was, and is, the land of the taluqadars \u2014 ^the \"Barons of \nOudh \u2019\u2019 they call themselves\u2014 and the zamindari system at its \nworst flourished there. The exactions of the landlords were \nbecoming unbearable and the number of landless labourers was \ngrowing. There was on the whole only one class of tenant and \nthis heq>ed united action. \n\n\u25a0 India may be roughly divided into two parts\u2014 the zamindui \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\narea with its big landlords, and the area containing peasant pro- \nprietors, but there is a measure of overlapping. The three \nprovinces of Bengal, Behar, and the United Provinces of Agra \nand Oudh, form the zamindari area. The peasant proprietors are \ncomparatively better off, although even their condition is often \npitiable. The mass of the peasantry in the Punjab or Gujrat \n(where there are peasant proprietors) is far better off than the \ntenants of the zamindari areas. In the greater part of these \nzamindari areas there were many kinds of tenancies \u2014 occupancy \ntenants, non-occupancy tenants, sub-tenancies, etc. The interests \nof various tenants often conflict against each other and this mili- \ntates against joint action. In Oudh, however, there were no \noccuptmcy tenants or even life tenants in . There were only \nshort-term tenants who were continually being ejected in favour \nof some one who was willing to pay a higher premium. Because \nthere was principally one class of tenant, it was easier to organise \nthem for joint action. \n\nIn practice there was no guarantee in Oudh for even the short \nterm of the contract. A landlord hardly ever gave a! receipt for \nrent received, and he could always say that the rent had not been \npaid and eject the tenant, for whom it was impossible to prove \nthe contra^. Besides the rent there were an extraordinary num- \nber of illegal exactions. In one taluqa I was told that there had \nbeen as many as fifty different kinds of such exactions. Probably \nthis number was exaggerated but it is notorious how taluqadars \noften make their tenants pay for every special expenditure \u2014 a \nmarriage in the family, cost of the son\u2019s education in foreign \ncountries, a party to the Governor or other high official, a pur- \nchase of a car or an elephant. Indeed these exactions have got \nspecial names \u2014 motrauna (tax for pmehase of motor), hathauna \n(tax for purchase of elephant), etc. \n\nIt was not surprising therefore that a big agrarian agitation \nshould develop in Oudh. What was surprising to me then was \nthat this should have developed quite spontaneously without any \ndty help or intervention of politicians and the like. The agrarian \nmovement was entirely separate firom the Congress and it had \nnothing to do with the non-co-operation that was taking shape. \nOr perhaps it will be more correct to say that both these wide- \nspread and powerful movements were due to the same funda- \nmental causes. The peasantry had of course taken part in \nthe great hartals that Gandhiji had proclaimed in  and \nlater, his name was becoming a charm for the man in the \nvillage. \n\nWhat mnazed me still more was our total ignorance in the \n\n\n\nI AM EXTERNED \n\n\n \n\ncities of this great agrarian movement. No newspaper had con- \ntained a line about it; they were not interested in rural areas. I \nrealised more than ever how cut off we were &om our people and \nhow we lived and worked and agitated in a little world apart \nfrom them.  OUT AGAIN \n\nOne misses many things in prison, but perhaps most of all one \nmisses the sound of women\u2019s voices and children\u2019s laughter. \nThe sounds one usually hears are not of the pleasantest. The \nvoices are harsh and minatory, and the language brutal and \nlargely consisting of swear-words. Once I remember being struck \nby a new want. I was in the Lucknow District Gaol and I realised \nsuddenly that I had not heard a dog bark for seven or eight \nmonths. \n\nOn the last day of January  all of us politicals in the \nLucknow Gaol were discharged. There must have been between \none hundred and two hundred * special class prisoners in Luck- \nnow then. All those who had been sentenced to\u2019 a year or less in \nDecember  or the beginning of  had already served out \ntheir sentences. Only those with longer sentences, and a few who \nhad come back a second time, remained. This sudden release \ntook us by surorise, as there had been no previous intimation of \nan amnesty. The local Provincial Council had passed a resolu- \ntion favouring a political amnesty, but the executive Government \nseldom pays heed to such demands. As it happened, however, \nthe time was propitious from the point of view of Government. \nThe Congress was doing nothing against the Government, and \nCongressmen were engrossed in mutual squabbles. There were \nnot many well-known Congress people left in gaol and so the \ngesture was made. \n\n\u2022There is always a feeling of relief and a sense of glad excite- \nment in coming out of the prison gate. The fresh air and open \nexpanses, the moving street scene, and the meeting with old \nfriends, all go to the head and slightly intoxicate. Almost, there \nis a touch of hysteria in one\u2019s first reactions to the outer world. \nWe felt exhilarated, but this was a passing sensation, for the state \nof Congress politics was discouraging enough. In the place of \nideals mere were intrigues, and various cliques were trying to \ncapture the Congress machinery by the usual methods which \nhave made politics a hateful word to those who are at all \nsensitive. \n\n\u25a0 My own inclination -was wholly against Council entry, because \nthis seemed to lead inevitably to compromising tactics and to \na continuous watering down of our objective. But there really \n\n\n\nOUT AGAIN \n\n\n \n\nwas no other political programme before the country. The no- \nchangers laid stress on a \u2018 constructive programme which in \neffect was a programme of social reform, and its chief merit \nwas that it brought our workers in touch with the masses- This \nwas not likely to satisfy those who believed in political action, \nand it was inevitable that after a wave of direct action, which \nhad not succeeded, there should be a phase of parliamentary \nactivity. Even this activity was envisaged by Deshbandhu Das \nand my father, the leaders of the new movement, as one of \nobstruction and defiance and not of co-operation and con- \nstruction. \n\nMr. C. R. Das had always favoured entry into the legislatures \nfor the purpose of carrying on the national struggle there also. \nMy father had more or less the same outlook, his acceptance of \nthe Council boycott in  was partly a subordination of his own \nview-point to Gandhiji\u2019s. He wanted to throw his full weight into \nthe struggle, and the only way to do it then was to accept the \nGandhi formula in toto. The minds of many of the younger \npeople were full of the tactics of Sinn Fein in so far as they had \ncaptured the parliamentary seats and then refused to enter the \nPlouse of Commons. I remember pressing Gandhiji in the sum- \nmer of  to adopt this variant of the boycott, but in such \nmatters he was adamant. Mohamad Ali was in Europe then on \na Khilafat deputation. On his return he also expressed his regret \nat the method of boycott adopted; he would have preferred \nthe Sinn Fein way. But it was quite immaterial what other in- \ndividuals thought in the matter, as ultimately Gandhiji\u2019s view \nwas bound to prevail. He was the author of the movement, and \nit was felt that he must be given freedom as to the details. His \nchief objections to the Sinn Fein method were (apart fi\"om its \nassociation with violence) that it would not be understood by the \nmasses as much as a straight call to boycott the polling-booths \nand the voting. To get elected and then not to go to the Councils \nwould create confusion in the mass mind. Further, that once \nour people got elected they would be drawn towards the Councils \nand it would be difficult for them to keep out of them. There \nwas not enough discipline and power in our movement to keep \nthem out for long, and a demoralising dribble would set in \ntowards the many direct and indirect ways of taking advantage \nof Government patronage through the Councils. \n\nThese were weighty arguments and, indeed, we saw many of \nthem justified in the middle \u2019twenties when the Swaraj Party \nwent into the Councils. And yet one cannot help wondering \nwhat would have happened if the Congress had set itself to \n\n\n\nlOO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ncapture the legislatures in . There can be no doubt that, \nsupported as it was by the Khilafat Committee, it would have \nwoti almost every elective seat in the provincial Councils as well \nas in the central Assembly. To-day (August ) there is again \ntalk of the Congress putting up candidates for the Assembly, \nand a Parliamentary Board has been set up. But much has hap- \npened since igao to deepen the fissures in our social and \npolitical fabric, and whatever may be the measure of success \nof the Congress in the coming elections, it can hardly be what \nit might have been in igso. \n\nOn my discharge from gaol I co-operated with a few others who \nwere trying to bring about an understanding between the rival \ngroups. We met with little success, and I was fed up with the \npro-changc and no-change politics. As secretary of the U.P. Pro- \nvincial Congress Committee I devoted myself to the work of \nCongress organi-sation. There was much to be done after the \nshake-up of the past year, I worked hard, but I worked with \nlittle purpose. Mentally I was at a loose end. Soon a new field \nof activity opened out before me. Within a few weeks of my \nrelease I was pitcljfijfked into the headship of the Allahabad \nMunicipality. This election was so uncKpected that forty-five \nminutes before the event no one had mentioned my name, or \nperhaps even thought of me, in this connection. But at the last \nmoment it was felt on the Congress side that I was the only \nperson of their group who was certain of success. \n\nIt so happened that year that leading Congressmen all over \nthe country became presidents of municipalities. Mr. C, R. Das \nbecame the first Mayor of Calcutta, Mr. Vithalbhai Patel the \nPresident of Bombay Corporafion, Sardar Vallabbhai Patel of \nAhmedabad. In the United Provinces most of the big muni- \ncipalities had Congressmen for their chairman. \n\nMunicipal work in all its varied forms began to interest me, \nand I gave more and more time to it. Some of its problems \nfascinated me. I studied the subject and developed ambitious \nnotions of municipal reform. I was to find out later that there \nis little room for ambition or startling development in Indian \nmunidpalities as they are constituted to-day. Still, there was \nroom for work and a cleaning and speeding-up of the machine, \nand I worked hard enough at it Just then my Congress work \nwas growing, and in addition to the provincial secretaryship I \nwas made the All-India Secretary also. These various jobs often \nmade me work fifteen hours a day, and the end of the day found \nme thoroughly exhausted. \u2018 \n\nOn my return home firom gaol the first letter that met my eyes \n\n\n\nOUjl again lol \n\nwas one from Sir Grimwood Mears, the then Chief Justice of \nthe Allahabad High Court. The letter had been written before \nmy discharge, but evidently in the knowledge that it was coming. \nI was a little surprised at the cordiality of his language and his \ninvitation to me to visit him frequently. I hardly knew him. \nHe had just come to Allahabad in  when I was drifting \naway from legal practice. I think I argued only one case before \nhim, and that was my last one in the High Court. For some \nreason or other he developed a partiality for me without knowing \nmuch about me. He had an idea \u2014 ^he told me .so later \u2014 that I \nwould go far, and he wanted to be a wholesome inffuence on me \nto make me appreciate the British view-point. His method was \nsubtle. He was of opinion, and there are many Englishmen who \nstill think so, that the average 'extremist' politician in India \nhad become anti-British because in the social sphere he had been \ntreated badly by Englishmen. This had led to resentment and \nbitterness and extremism. There is a story, which has been \nrepeated by responsible persons, to the effect that my father was \nrefused election to an English club and this made him anti- \nBritish and extremist. The story is wholly without foundation \nand is a distortion of an entirely different incident.* But to many \nan Englishman such instances, whether true or not, afford a \nsimple and sufficient explanation of the origins of the nationalist \nmovement. As a matter of fact neither my father nor I had any \nparticular grievance on this score. As individuals we had usually \nmet with courtesy from the Englishman and we got on well tvith \nhim, though, like all Indians, we were no doubt racially conscious \nof subjection, and resented it bitterly. I must confess that even \nto-day I get on very well with an Englishman, unless he happens \nto be an official and wants to patronise me, and even then there \nis no lack of humour in our contacts. Probably I have more in \ncommon with him than the Liberals or others who co-operate \nwith him politically in India. \n\nSir Grimwood's idea was to root out this original cause of \nbitterness by friendly intercourse and frank and courteous treat- \nment.  saw him several times. On the pretext of objecting to \nsome municipal tax he would come to see me and discuss other \nmatters. On one occasion he made quite an onslaught on the \nIndian Liberals\u2014 timid, weak-kneed opportunists wilfr no char- \nacter or backbone, he called them, and his language was stronger \nand full of contempt. \" Do you think we have any respect for \nthem^ \" he said. I wondered why he spoke to me in this way; \n\n* See the footnote in Chapter XXXVIII for a fuller account of \nth  \u00ab' \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nprobably because he thought that this kind of talk might please \nme. And then he led up the conversation to the new Councils \nand their Ministers and the opportunities these Ministers had \nfor serving their country. Education was one of the most vital \nproblems before the country. Would not an Education Minister, \nwith freedom to act as he chose, have a worthy opportunity to \nmould the destinies of millions, the chance of a lifetime? Sup- \npose, he went on, a man like you, ivith intelligence, character, \nideals, and the energy to push them through, was in charge of \neducation for the province, could you not perform wonders? \nAnd he assured me, adding that he had seen the Governor \nrecently, that I would be given perfect freedom to work out my \npolicy. Then realising, perhaps, that he had gone too far, he \nsaid that he could not, of course, commit anybody officially, and \nthe suggestion he had made was a personal one. \n\nI was diverted by Sir Grimwood\u2019s diplomatic and roundabout \napproach to the proposal he had made. The idea of my associat- \ning myself with the Government as a Ministei* was unthinkable \nfor me i indeed, it was hateful to me. But I have often yearned, \nthen as well as in later years, for a chance to do some solid, \npositive, constructive work. Destruction and agitation and non- \nco-operation are hardly normal activities for human beings. And \nyet, such is our fate, that we can only reach the land where we \ncan build after passing through the deserts of conflict and \ndestruction. And it may be that most of us will spend our \nenergies and our lives in struggling and panting through those \nshifting sands, and the building will have to be done by our \nchildren or our children\u2019s children. \n\nMinistries were going cheap in those days, in the United Pro- \nvinces at least. The two Liberal Ministers, who had functioned \nthroughout the non<o-operation period, had gone. When the \nCongress movement threatened the existing order, the Govern- \nment tried to exploit the Liberal Ministers in fighting Congress. \nThey were respected then and treated with honour by the \nexecutive government, for it was something to hold them ^ in \nthose days of trouble, as supporters of the Government, \"ftey \nthought, perhaps, that this respect and honour were due to them \nas of right, not realising that this was but a reaction on the part \nof Government to the mass attack of the Congress. When that \nattack was drawn off the value of the Liberal Ministers fell \nheavily in the eyes of Government, and the respea and honour \nwere suddenly conspicuous by their absence. The Ministers re- \nsented this^ but this availed them little, and soon they were \nforced to resign. Then began a search for new Ministers, and \n\n\n\nOUT AGAIN \n\n\n \n\nthis was not immediately successful. The handful of Liberals \nin the Council kept aloof in sympathy with their colleagues \nwho had been unceremoniously thrown out. Of the others, \nmostly zamindars, there were few who could be called even \nmoderately educated. The Congress having boycotted the \nCouncils, a curious assortment of people had got in. \n\nThere is a story of a person who was offered a ministership in \nthe U.P. about this time, or perhaps a little later. He is reported \nto have replied that he was not vain enough to consider himself \nan unusually clever man, but he did think himself to be moder- \nately intelligent and, perhaps, a little above the average, and he \nhoped that he had that reputation. Did the Government want \nhim to accept a ministership and thus proclaim himself to the \nworld to be a damned fool? \n\nThis protest had some justification. The Liberal Ministers had \nbeen narrow-minded with no broad vision of politics or social \naffairs, but that was the fault of the sterile Liberal creed. They \nhad, however, the ability of professional men, and they did their \nroutine work conscientiously. Some of those who followed them \nin office came from the ranks of the zamindars, and their edu- \ncation, even in the formal sense, had been strictly limited. I \nthink they might justly have been called literate, and nothing \nmore. It almost seemed that the Governor chose these gentle- \nmen and put them in high office to display the utter incapacity \nof Indians. Of them it might well have been said that : \n\n\u201c Fortune advanced thee that all might aver \nThat nothing is impossible to her.\u201d \u2018 \n\nEducated or not, these Ministera had the zamindar vote with \nthem, and they could give delightful garden parties to the high \nofficials. What worthier use could be made of the money that \ncame to them from their starving tenantry? \n\n\n\u2018 Richard Garnett.  CONVERSION OR COMPULSION \n\nSixteen years ago Gandhiji Impressed India with his doctrine \nof non-violence. Ever since then it has dominated the Indian \nhorizon. Vast numbers of people have repeated it unthinkingly \nbut with approval, some have wrestled with it and then accepted \nit, with or without reservation, some have openly jeered at it. It \nhas played a major part in our political and social life, and it \nhas also attracted a great deal of attention in the wider world. \nThe doctrine is of course almost as old as human thought, but \nperhaps Gandhiji was the first to apply it on a mass scale to \npolitical and social movements. Formerly it was an individual \naffair and was thus essentially religious. It was the restraint of \nthe individual and his attempt to achieve complete disinter- \nestedness and thus to raise himself above the level of worldly \nconflict and attain a kind of personal freedom and salvation. \nThere was no idea behind it of dealing with the larger social \nproblems and of changing social conditions, except very indi- \nrectly and remotely. There vras almost an acceptance of the \nexisting social fabric with' all its inequality and injustice. \nGandhiji tried to make this individual ideal into a social group \nideal. He was out to change political conditions as well as \nsocial; and deliberately, with this end in view, he applied the \nnon-violent method on this wider and wholly different plane. \n\"Those who have to bring about radical changes in human \nconditions and surroundings,\u201d he has written, \u201ccannot do it \nexcept by raising a ferment in society. There are only two \nmethods of doing this, violent and non-violent. Violent pressure \nis felt on the physical being and it degrades him who uses it as \nit depresses the victim, but non-violent pressure exerted through \nself-suffering, as by fasting, works in an entirely diflferent way. \nIt touches not the phyiscal body but it touches and strengthens \nthe moral fibre of those against whom it is directed.\u201d ^ \n\nThe idea was to some extent in harmony with Indian thought \nand it was accepted, superficially at least, with enthusiasm by \nthe country. Very few realised the far-reaching implications \nthat lay behind it, and the few who did so rather vaguely took \nrefuge in faith and action. But, when the tempo of aaion \n\n^ Extracts from statement made by Gandhiji on December , a \non the occasion of one of his fasts. \n\nm \n\n\n\nJAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nslackened, innumerable questions arose in the minds of some \npeople, and it was extraordinarily difficult to find answers to \nthem. These questions did not affect the immediate course that \nhad to be followed in politics. Rather they dealt with the whole \nphilosophy that lay behind this idea of non-violent resistance. \nIn a political sense the non-violent movement has not succeeded \nso far, for India is still held in the vice-like grip of imperialism. \nIn a social sense it has not even envisaged a radical change. \nAnd yet any one with the slightest penetration can see that it \nhas worked a remarkable change in India\u2019s millions. It has \ngiven them character, strength and self-reliance \u2014 precious gifts \nwithout which any progress, political or social, is difficult to \nachieve or to retain. How far these undoubted gains are due to \nnon-violence or to the fact of conflict itself, it is difficult to say. \nSuch gains have been achieved by various peoples on numerous \noccasions through violent conflict. Yet it may be said, I think \nwith confidence, that the non-violent method has been of ines- \ntimable value to us in this respect. It has definitely helped in \nraising that \u2018ferment in society\u2019 to which Gandhiji refers, \nthough undoubtedly that ferment was due to basic causes and \nconditions. It has brought about that quickening process in the \nmasses that precedes revolutionary change. \n\nThat is an obvious point in its favour, but it does not carry us \nfar. The real questions remain unanswered. Unfortunately \nGandhiji does not help us much in solving the problem. He has \nwritten and spoken on innumerable occasions on the subject, \nbut, so far as I know, he has never considered in public all its \nimplications, philosophically or scientifically. \u2018 He lays stress \non the means lieing more important than the end, of conversion \nbeing better than coercion, and there is a tendency to identify \nnon-violence with truth and all goodness. Indeed he often uses \nthe terms as if they were synonymous. There is also the ten- \ndency to consider all those who may not agree with this as \noutside the pale of the elect and as having offended against \nthe moral law. In the case of some of his followers this \ntranslates itself inevitably into a feeling of self-righteousness. \n\nThose of us who are not fortunate enough to have this faith \nare, however, troubled with a host of doubts. These doubts \ndo not relate so much to immediate necessities, but to the \nmind\u2019s desire for some consistent philosophy of action which is \nboth moral from the individual view-point and is at the same \n, * Richard B. Gregg in his The Power of Non-Violence has dis- \ncussed the subject scientifically. His book is most interesting and \nthought-provoking. \n\n\n\nCONVERSION OR COMPULSION \n\n\n \n\ntime socially effective. I confess that these doubts have not left \nme, and I see no satisfiictory solution of the problem. I dislike \nviolence intensely, and yet I am full of violence myself and, \nconsciously or unconsciously, I am often attempting to coerce \nothers. And can anything be greater coercion than the psychic \ncoercion of Gandhiji which reduces many of his intimate fol- \nlowers and colleagues to a state of mental pulp? \n\nBut the real question was: can national and social groups \nimbibe sufficiently this individual creed of non-violence, for it \ninvolved a tremendou.s rise of mankind in the ma.ss to a high \nlevel of love and goodness? It is true that the only really \ndesirable ultimate ideal is to raise humanity to this level and to \nabolish hatred and ugliness and selfishness. Whether that is \npossible or not, even ultimately, may be a debatable question; \nbut without that to hope for life would almost become \u201c a tale \ntold by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d \nTo attain this ideal, are we to work for it directly by preaching \nthese virtues, regardless of the obstructions whiA make it im- \npossible of achievement and which encourage every contrary \ntendency? Or must we not remove these obstructions first and \ncreate a more suitable and more ffivourable environment for the \ngrowth of love, beauty, goodness? Or can we combine- the two \nprocesses? \n\nAnd then again is the line between violence and non-violence, \ncompulsion and conversion, so obvious? Often enough moral \nforce is a far more terrible coercive factor than physical violence. \nAnd is non-violence synonymous with truth? What is truth is \nan ancient question to which a thousand answers have been \ngiven, and yet the question remains. But whatever it majr be, it \ncannot certainly be wholly identified with non-violence. Violence \nitself, though bad, cannot be considered intrinsically unmoral. \nThere are shades and grades of it and often it may be preferable \nto something that is worse. Gandhiji himself has said that it is \nj better than cowardice, fear, and slavery, and a host of other evils \nmight be added to this list. It is true that usually violence is \nassociated with ill-will, but in theory at least this need not always \nbe so. It is conceivable that violence may be based on goodwill \n(that of a surgeon, for example) and anything that has this for \na basis can never be fundamentally immoral. After all, the final \ntests of ethics and morality arp goodwill and ill-will. Thus, \nalthough violence is very often imjustifiable morally and may be \nconsidered dangerous ftom that view-point, it need not always \nbe so. \n\nAll life is full of conflict and violence, and it seems to be true \n\n\n\n JAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\nthat violence breeds violence and is thus not a way to overcome \nit. And yet to forswear it altogether leads to a wholly negative \nattitude utterly out of touch with life itself. Violence is the very \nlife-blood of the modern State and social system. Without the \ncoercive apparatus of the State taxes would not be realised, land- \nlords would not get their rents, and private property would \ndisappear. The law, with the help of its armed forces, excludes \nothers from the use of private property. The national State \nitself exists because of offensive and defensive violence. \n\nGandhiji\u2019s non-violence, it is true, is certainly not a purely \nnegative affair. It is not non-resistance. It is non-violent resis- \ntance, which is a very different thing, a positive and dynamic \nmethod of action. It was not meant for those who meekly accept \nthe status quo. The very purpose for which it was designed was \nto create \u201ca ferment in society\u201d and thus to change existing \nconditions. Whatever the motives of conversion behind it, in \npractice it has been a powerful weapon of compulsion as well, \nthough that compulsion is exercised in the most civilised and \nleast objectionable manner. Indeed it is interesting to note that \nGandhiji actually used the word,' compel \u2019 in Itia earlier writings. \nCriticising the Viceroy\u2019s (Lord Chelmsford's) speech in  on \nthe Punjab Martial Law wrongs, he wrote: \n\n\". . . the speech his Excellency delivered at the time of the \nopening of the Council shows to me a mental attitude which \nmakes association with him or his Government impossible for \nself-respecting men. \n\n\u201cThe remarks on the Punjab mean a flat refusal to grant \nredress. He would have us to concentrate on the problems of the \nimmediate ' future \u2019I The immediate future is to compel repen- \ntance on the part of the Government on the Punjab matter. Of \nthis there is no sign. On the contrary his Excellency resists the \ntemptation to reply to his critics, meaning thereby that he has \nnot changed his opinion on the many vital matters affecting the \nhonour of India. He is \u2018 content to leave the issues to the verdict \nof history.' Now this kind of language, in my opinion, is calcu- \nlated further to inflame the Indian mind. Of what use can a \nfavourable verdict of history be to men who have been wronged \nand who are still under the heels of officers who have shown \nthemselves utterly unfit to hold offices of trust and responsi- \nbility? The plea tor co-operation is, to say the least, hypocritical \nin the face of the determination to refuse justice to the Punjab.\u201d \n, Governments are notoriously based on nolence, not only the \nopen violence of the armed forces, but the fer more dangerous \nviolence, more subtly exercised, of spies, informers, agents pro- \n\n\n\nCONVERSION OR COMPULSION I \n\nvocateurs, false propaganda, direct and indirect through educa- \ntion, Press, etc., religious and other forms of fear, economic \ndestitution and starvation. As between two governments it is \ntaken for granted that every manner of falsehood and treachery \nis justified, provided it is not found out, even in peace-time and \nmuch more so in war-time. Three hundred years ago Sir Henry \nWotton, a poet and himself a British ambassador, defined an \nambassador as \u201c an honest man sent to lie abroad for the good \nof his country.\u201d Nowadays ambassadors are supported by mili- \ntary, naval and commercial attaches whose chief function is to \nspy in the country to which they are sent. Behind them functions \nthe vast network of the secret service, with its innumerable \nramifications and webs of intrigue and deception, its spies and \ncounter-spies, its connections with the underworld of crime, its \nbribery and degradation of human nature, its secret murders. Bad \nas all this is in peace-time, war gives it enormous importance and \nits baneful influence spreads'ln every direction. It is astonishing \nto read now of some of the instances of propaganda during the \nWorld War, the amazing falsehoods spread about enemy \ncountries, the vast sums spent on this and on the secret services. \nBut peace to-day is itself merely an interval between two wars, \na preparation for war, and to some extent a continuation of the \nconflict in economic and other spheres. There is a continuous \ntug-of-war between the victors and the vanquished, between the \nimperialist powers and their colonial dependencies, between the \nprivileged classes and the exploited classes. The war atmosphere, \nwith all its accompaniments of violence and falsehood, continues \nin some measure therefore even during so-called peacertime, and \nboth the soldier and the civilian official are trained to meet this \nsituation. Lord Wolseley writes in the Soldier\u2019s Pocket-Book for \nField Service : \u201c We will keep hammering along with the con- \nviction that ' honesty is the best policy \u2019, and that truth always \nwins in the long run. These pretty sentences do well for a child\u2019s \ncopy-book, but the man who acts upon them in war had better \nsheathe his sword for ever.\u201d \n\nUnder present conditions with nation against nation and class \nagainst class this basis of violence and falsehood seems almost \ninevitable. Privileged nations and groups, desirous of holding on \nto their power and privileges and denying those whom they \noppress the opportunities of growth, must rely on violence, coer- \ncion and i^sehood. It may be possible, as public opinion grows \nand the realities of these conflicts and their suppression become \nmore manifest, for the violence to he toned down. As a matter \nof fact all recent experience points to the contrary, and violence \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nhas grown as the challenge to existing institutions has gained \nweight. Even when outward violence has been toned down, it \nhas taken subtler and more dangerous forms. Neither the growth \nof reason nor of the religious outlook nor morality have checked \nin any way this tendency to violence. Individuals have pro- \ngressed and gone up in the human scale, and probably there are \nfar more of these higher-type individuals (the highest type \nexcepted) in the world to-day than at any previous period of \nhistory; society as a whole has progressed, and to a very small \nextent begun to attempt the control of the primitive and bar- \nbarian instincts. But on the whole groups and communities have \nnot improved greatly. The individual in becoming more civilised \nhas passed on many of his primitive passions and vices to the \ncommunity, and as violence always attracts the morally second- \nrate, the leaders of these communities are seldom their best men \nand women. \n\nBut even if we assume that the worst forms of violence will be \ngradually removed from the State, it is impossible to ignore the \nFact that both government and social life necessitate some \ncoercion. Social life necessitates some form of government, and \nthe men so placed in authority must curb and prevent all indi- \nvidual or group tendencies which are inherently selfish and likely \nto injure society. Usually they go much further than necessary, \nfor power corrupts and degrades. So that however much those \nrulers may love liberty and hate coercion, they will have to \nexercise coercion on recalcitrant individuals, till such time when \nevery human being in that State is perfect, wholly unselfish, and \ndevoted to the common good. The rulers of that State will also \nhave to exercise coercion on outside groups who make predatory \nattacks, that is to say they will have to defend themselves, meet- \ning force with force. The necessity for this will only disappear \nwhen there is only a single World-State. \n\nIf force and coercion are thus necessary both for external \ndefence and internal cohesion, where is one to draw the line? \nOnce this fateful concession is made of ethics to politics. Rein- \nhold Neibuhr points out,* and coercion is accepted as a necessary \n- instrument of social cohesion, it is not possible to make absolute \ndistinctions between non-violent and violent types of coercion, or \nbetween the coercion used by governments and that used by \nrevolutionaries. \n\nI do not know for certain, but I imagine that Gandhiji will \nadmit that in this imperfect world a national State will have to \n\n\n* In Moral Man and Immoral Society, \n\n\n\nCONVERSION OR COMPULSION  \n\nuse force to defend itself against unprovoked attack from out- \nside. Of course the State should allow an absolutely peaceful and \nfriendly policy to its neighbour and other States, but nevertheless \nit is absurd to deny the possibility of attack. The State will also \nhave to pass some laws of a coercive nature, in the sense that they \ntake away some rights and privileges from various classes and \ngroups and restrict liberty of action. All laws are to some extent \ncoercive. The Karachi programme of the Congress lays down \nthat \u201c In order to end the exploitation of the masses, political \nfreedom must include real economic freedom of the starving \nmillions.\u201d To give effect to this desirable sentiment the over- \nprivileged will have to give up much to the under-privileged. \nFurther, it is laid down that workers must have a living wage and \nvarious other amenities; that special taxes will be charged on \nproperty; that \u201c the State shall own or control key industries and \nservices, mineral resources, railways, waterways, shipping and \nother means of public transport.\u201d Also that \u201c intoxicating drinks \nand drugs shall be totally prohibited.\u201d All this is likely to be \nobjected to by considerable numbers of people. They may sub- \nmit to the will of the majority, but that will be because they are \nafraid of the consequences of disobedience. Democracy indeed \nmeans the coercion of the minority by the majority. \n\nIf a law affecting property rights or abolishing them to a large \nextent is passed by a majority, is that to be objected to because \nit is coercion? Manifestly not, because the same procedure is \nfollowed in the adoption of all democratic laws. Objection, there- \nfore, cannot be taken on the ground of coercion. It might be \nsaid that the majority was acting wrongly or immorally. The \nquestion to be considered then is : whether the law as passed by \na majority offended any ethical principle. Who is to decide this? \nIf individuals and groups are allowed to interpret ethics in \naccordance with their own interests, there is an end of demo- \ncratic procedure. Personally I feel that the institution of private \nproperty (except in a very restricted sense) gives dangerous power \nto individuals over society as a whole, and is therefore very harm- \nful to society. I consider it immoral, far more so than drink, \nwhich harms the individual more than society. \n\nI have been told, however, by some people who claim to believe \nin the doctrine of non-violence that to attempt to nationalise \nprivate property, except with the consent of the ovjners thereof, \nwould be coercion, and as such opposed to non-violence. Indeed \nthis view-point has been impressed upon me by big zamindars, \nwho do not scruple to take the aid of the State in forcibly \ncollecting their rents; and capitalists, owning many factories. \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NiiHRU \n\n\nJ \n\nwho will not even permit independent labour unions to exist in \ntheir domains. The fact that a majority of the people affected \ndesires the change is not considered enough, the very people who \nstand to lose by it should be converted. Thus a few interested \nparties can hold up an obviously desirable change. \n\nIf there is one thing that history shows it is this : that economic \ninterests shape the political views of groups and classes. Neither \nreason nor moral considerations override these interests. Indi- \nviduals may be converted, they may surrender their special \nprivileges, although this is rare enough, but classes and groups \ndo not do so. The attempt to convert a governing and privileged \nclass into forsaking power and giving up its unjust privileges has \ntherefore always so far failed, and there seems to be no reason \nwhatever to hold that it will succeed in the future. Reinhold \nNiebuhr in his book \u2018 directs his argument against the moralists \n\"who imagine that the egoism of individuals is being pro- \ngressively checked by the development of rationality or the \ngrowth of a religiously inspired goodwill, and that nothing but \nthe continuance of this process is necessary to establish social \nharmony between all the human societies and colleaives.\" These \nmoralists \"\u2018disregard the political necessities in the struggle for \njustice in human society by failing to recognise those elements \nin man\u2019s collective behaviour which belong to the order of \nnature and can never be brought completely under the dominion \nof reason or conscience. They do not recognise that when col- \nlective power, whether in the form of imperialism or class \ndomination, exploits weakness, it can never be dislodged unless \npower is raised against it.\u2019\u2019 And again : \" Since reason is always, \nto some degree, the servant of interest in a social situation, social \njustice cannot be resolved by moral or rational suasion alone. . . . \nConflict is inevitable, and in this conflict power must be chal- \nle^ed by power.\" \n\nTo think, therefore, in terms of pure conversion of a class or \nnation ojr of the removal of conflict by rational argument and \nappeals to justice, is to delude oneself. It is an illusion to imagine \nthat a dominant imperialist Power will give up its domination \nover a country, or that a class will give up its superior position \nand privileges unless effective pressure, amounting to coercion, \nis exercised. \n\nGandhiji obviously wants to apply that pressure, though he \ndoes not call it coercion. According to him, his method is self- \nsuffering. It is a little difflcult to consider this, as there is a \n\n\u2019 . . *' Moral Man and Immoral Society. \n\n\n\nCONVERSION OR COMPULSION  \n\nmetaphysical element in it and it does not yield to measurement \nor any other material approach. That it has considerable effect \non the opponent is undoubted. It exposes his moral defences, it \nunnerves him, it appeals to the best in him, it leaves the door \nopen for conciliation. There can be no doubt that the approach \nof love and self-suffering has powerful psychic reactions on the \nadversary as well as on the onlookers. Most shikaris know that it \nmakes a difference how one approaches a wild animal. He seems \nto sense the aggressive spirit from afar and reacts to it. Even \na suspicion of fear in the man, hardly realised by him, is con- \nveyed somehow to the animal and makes him afraid, and in this \nfear he attacks. If the nerve of a lion-tamer fail him for an \ninstant there is immediate danger of his being attacked. An \nabsolutely fearless man is seldom in danger from wild animals \nunless some untoward accident occurs. It seems natural, there- \nfore, that human beings should be susceptible to these psychic \ninfluences. But though individuals may be affected, it is doubtful \nif a class or group is affected. That class, as a class, does not \ncome into personal and intimate contact with the other party; \neven the reports it hears are partial and distorted. And, in any \nevent, its automatic reaction of anger against any group that \nchallenges its position is so great that all minor feelings are \nswallowed up in it. Having for long accustomed itself to the \nnotion that its superior position and privileges were necessary \nfor the good of society, any contrary opinion savours of heresy. \nLaw and order and the maintenance of the status quo become \nthe chief virtues, and attempts to challenge them the chief sins. \n\nSo that, so far as the opposite group is concerned, the process \nof conversion does not go far. Indeed sometimes the very \nmildness and saintliness of their adversary makes them angrier \nstill, for it seems to put them in the wrong; and when a person \nbegins to suspect that he might be in the wrong, his virtuous \nindignation grows. Nevertheless, a non-violent technique does \naffect odd individuals on the oiiier side, and thereby weakens \nthe solidity of opposition. Even more so it gains the sympathy \nof neutrals and is a powerful means of influencing world \nopinion. But here again there is the probability of the governing \n\ng roup preventing the news from going out or of distorting it, \necause it controls the agencies of publicity and can thus prevent \nthe real facts ftom being known. The most potent and far- \nreaching effect of the non-violent method is, however, on the \nlarge numbers of more or less indifferent people of the country \nin which this technique is practised. They are certainly con- \nverted and often become enthusiasts in its favour, but then they \n\nNN \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\ndid not require much conversion as they generally approved of \nthe object aimed at. The effect is not so obvious on those who \ndread the change. The rapid spread of non-co-operation and \ncivil disobedience in India was a demonstration of how a non- \nviolent movement exercises a powerful influence on vast numbers \nand converts many waverers. It did not convert to any marked \nextent those who were ab initio hostile to it. Indeed the success \nof the movement increased their fears and made them even \nmore hostile. \n\nIf it is once admitted that a State is justified in using violence \nto defend its freedom, it is difficult to understand why it is not \nequally justified in adopting violent and coercive methods in \nti^ng to achieve that freedom. A violent method may be unde- \nsirable and inexpedient, but it would not be wholly unjustifiable \nand barred. The mere fact that a government happens to be \nthe dominant faction controlling the armed forces does not give \nit a greater right to the use of violence. In the event of a non- \nviolent revolution succeeding and controlling the State, does it \nimmediately acquire the right to use violence, which it did not \npossess before? If there is an insurrection against its authority, \nhow is it going to meet it? It will naturally be disinclined to use \nviolent methods, and will try every peaceful way to ineet the \nsituation, but it cannot give up the right to use violence. There \nare sure to be disaffected elements in the population opposed to \nthe change, and they will try to go back to the previous condi- \ntion. If they think that their violence will not be checked by \nthe coercive apparatus of the new State, they are all the more \nlikely to indulge in it. It seems, therefore, that it is quite im- \npossible to draw a hard and fast line between violence and non- \nviolence, coercion and conversion. The difficulty is real enough \nin considering political changes, it becomes far worse as between \nprivileged and exploited classes. \n\nTo suflFer for an ideal has always commanded admiration; to \nsubmit to suffering for a cause tvithout giving in or hitting back \nhas a nobility and grandeur in it which force recognition. And \nyet there is only a thin line which divides this from suffering \nfor suffering\u2019s sake, and this latter kind of self-suffering is apt to \nbecome morbid and even a little degrading. If violence is often \nsadistic, non-violence in its negative aspects at least is likely to \nerr on the other side. There is also always the possibility for \nnon-riolence to be made a cloak for cowardice and inaction, as \nwell as the maintenance of the status quo. \n\nDuring the past few years in India, ever since the idea of \nradical social changes has assumed importance here, it has often \n\n\n\nCONVEJISION OR COMPULSION  \n\nbeen stated that such a change necessarily involves the -use of \nviolence and cannot therefore be advocated. Class conflicts must \nnot be mentioned (however much they might exist) because they \njar on the vision of perfect co-operation and a non-violent pro- \ngress to whatever goal might lie in the future. It is quite \npossible that a solution of the social problem cannot be brought \nabout ivithout violence at some stage, for it seems certain that \nthe privileged classes will not hesitate to use violence to maintain \ntheir favoured position. But, in theory, if it is possible to bring \nabout a great political change by a non-violent technique, why \nshould it not be equally possible to affect a radical social change \nby this method? If we can get political freedom and the elimi- \nnation of British imperialism from India non-violently, why \nshould we not also solve the problem of the feudal princes and \nlandlords and other social problems in the same way, and estab- \nlish a Socialist State? Whether all this is possible or not non- \nviolently is not so much the question. The point is that either \nboth of these objectives are possible of attainment non-violently \nor neither. Surely it cannot be said that a non-violent method \ncan only be used against a foreign ruler. Prima facie it should be \nfar easier to use it within a country against indigenous selfish \ninterests and obstructionists, for the psychological effect on them \nwill be greater than elsewhere. \n\nThe recent tendency in India to condemn objectives and \npolicies simply because they are supposed to conflict with non- \nviolence seems to me an inversion of the right method of look- \ning at such problems. We took to the non-violent method \nfifteen years ago because it promised to take us to our goal in the \nmost desirable and effective way. The goal was then apart from \nnon-violence; it was not a mere appendage or outcome of it. No \none could have said then that freedom or independence must \nonly be aimed at if they are attainable by non-violent means. \nBut now our goal itself is judged in terms of non-violence and \nrejected if it does not seem to fit in with it. The idea of non- \nviolence is thus becoming an inflexible dogma which may not \nbe challenged. As such it is losing its spiritual appeal to the \nintellect, and taking its place in the pigeon-holes of faith and \nreligion. It is even becoming a sheetanchor for vested interests, \nwho exploit it to maintain the status quo,' \n\nThis is unfortunate for, I do believe, the ideas of non-violent \nresistance and the non-violent technique of struggle are of \ngreat value to India as well as to the rest of the world, and \nGandhiji has done a tremendous service in forcing modem \nthought to consider them. I believe they have a great future \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nbefore them. It may be that mankind is not sufficiently advanced \nto adopt them in their entirety. \u201cYou offer your candle of \nvision to the blind,\u201d says a character in A.E.\u2019s Interpreters, \u201c but \nvirhat use can it be to the blind except as a bludgeon? \u201d For the \npresent the vision may not materialise sufficiently, but like all \ngreat ideas its influence will grow and it will more and more \naffect our actions. Non-co-operation, the withdrawal of co- \noperation from a State or society which is considered evil, is a \npowerful and dynamic notion. Even if a handful of persons of \nmoral worth practise it, its effect spreads and goes on increasing. \nWith large numbers the external effect becomes more marked, \nbut there is a tendency for other factors to obscure the moral \nissue. The extension of it seems to affect its intensity. The \ncollective man gradually pushes back the individual. \n\nThe stress, however, on pure non-violence has made it some- \nthing remote and apart from life, and there is a tendency for \npeople either to accept it blindly and religiously or not at all. \nThe intellectual element has receded into the background. In \n it had a great effect on the Terrorists in India, and drew \nmany away from their ranks, and even those who remained \nwere held back by doubt and stopped their violent activities. It \nhas no such influence on them now. Even within the Congress \nranks many of the vital elements who played a notable part in \nthe Non-Co-operation and Civil Disobedience movements, and in \nall sincerity tried to live up to the implications of the non-violent \nmethod, are now considered as heretics who have no business to \ncontinue as Congressmen because they are not prepared to make \nnon-violence a creed and a religion, or to give up the only goal \nthey consider worth striving for \u2014 a Socialist State with equal \njustice and opportunity for all, a planned society which can only \ncome into existence with the abolition of most of the privileges \nand property rights that exist to-day. Gandhiji, of course, con- \ntinues to be a vital force whose non-violence is of a dynamic \nand aggressive character, and no one knows when he might \nagain galvanise the country in a forward movement. With all \nhis greatness and his contradictions and power of moving \nmasses, he is above the usual standards. One cannot measure \nhim. or judge him as we would others. But riiahy of ffiose who \nclaim to follow him tend to become ineffectual pacifists or non- \nresisters of the Tolstoyan variety or juSt mfembers of a narrow \nsect, not in touch with life and reality. And they gather rotmd \nthemselves quite a number of people who are interested in main- \ntaining the' present order, and who take shelter under non- \nviolence for this purpose. Opportunism thus creeps ih\u2019 and the \n\n\n\nCONVERSION OR COMPULSION  \n\nprocess of converting the adversary leads, in the interests of \nnon-violence, to one\u2019s own conversion and lining up with the \nadversary. When enthusiasm wanes and we weaken, there is \nalways a tendency to go back a little, to compromise, and it is \ncomforting to call this the art of winning over the opponent. \nAnd sometimes we make this gain at the cost of our own old \ncolleagues. We deprecate their extravagances, their utterances, \nthat irritate our new friends, and accuse them of breaking the \nunity of our ranks. Instead of a real change of the social order, \nstress is laid on charity and benevolence within the existing \nsystem, the vested interests remaining where they were. \n\nI am convinced that Gandhiji has done a great service to us by \nstressing the importance of the means. And yet I feel sure that \nthe final emphasis must necessarily be on the end and goal in \nview. Unless wc can conceive that, clearly we can never be any- \nthing but aimless wanderers, wasting our energies on unimpor- \ntant side-issues. But the means cannot be ignored for, quite \napart from the moral side, they have a practical side. Bad and \nimmoral means often defeat the end in view or raise tremendous \nnew problems. And, after all, it is the means that a person adopts \nand not the end he declares that enables us to judge him truly. \nI\u2019o adopt means that leads to needless conflict and to the piling \nup of hatreds, is likely to make the achievement of the goal \nmore difficult and distant. End and means are indeed so inti- \nmately connected that they can hardly be separated. Essentially, \ntherefore, the means must be such as lessen conflict and hatred \nor, at any rate, try to limit them as fiir as possible (for they seem \nto be inevitable), and to encourage goodwill. It becomes more \na question of motive and intention and temper than of any \nparticular method. It is on this basic motive that Gandhiji's \nstress has been, and if he has fiiiled to change human nature to \nany appreciable extent, he succeeded surprisingly in impressing \nthis motive on a great national movement involving millions. \nHis insistence on strict moral discipline was also very necessary, \nthough his standards of that individual discipline are perhaps \ndebatable. \u2019He attaches vast importance to the self-regarding sins \nor failings and very little to social sins. The necessity for this \ndiscipline is obvious, for the temptation to leave the wilderness \nand join the privileged groups in the seats of power has drawn \naway many a Congressman. For a noted Congressman the door \nto that favoured land is always open. \n\nThe whole world is in the gnp to-day of various crises, but \nthe greatest of these is the crisis of the spirit. This is especially \nso in the East, for recent chan^^ in Asia have been more rapid \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nthan elsewhere and the process of adjustment is painful. The \npolitical problem which seems to dominate the situation is \nperhaps the least important of all, though it is the primary \nproblem for us, and it must be disposed of satisfactorily before \nthe real questions are tackled. For ages past we have been \naccustomed to an almost unchanging basic social order, and \nmany of us still believe that it is the only possible and rightful \nbasis of society, and associate our moral notions with it. But \nour attempts to fit in the past with the present fail, as they are \nbound to do. \u201cIn the last resort,\u201d wrote Veblen, the American \neconomist, \u201cthe economic moralities wait on the economic \nnecessities.\u201d The necessities of to-day will force us to formulate \na new morality in accordance with them. If we are to find a \nway out of this crisis of the spirit and realise what are the true \nspiritual values to-day, we shall have to face the issues frankly \nand boldly and not take refuge under the dogmas of any reli- \ngion. What rdigion says may be good or bad, but the way it \nsays it and wants us to believe it is certainly not conducive to an \nintellectual consideration of any problem. As Freud has pointed \nout, the dogmas of religion \u201cdeserve to be believed: firstly, \nbecause our primal ancestors already believed them; secondly, \nbecause we possess proofs, which have been handed down to us \nfrom this very period of antiquity; and thirdly, because it is \nforbidden to raise the question of their authenticity at all.\u201d^ \n\nIf we consider non-violence and all it implies from the reli- \ngious, dogmatic point of view there is no room for argument. \nIt reduces itself to the narrow .creed of a sect which people may \nor may not accept. It loses vitality and application to present- \nday problems. But if we are prepared to discuss it in relation \nto' existing conditions it can help us greatly in our attempts to \nrefashion this world. Tliis consideration must take into account \nl^e nature and wealoiesses of collective man. Any activity on a \nmass scale, and especially any activity aiming at radical and \nrevolutionaiy changes, is affected not only by what the leaders \nthink of it hut by existing conditions and, still more, by what \nthe human material they work with thinks about it. \n\nViolence has played a great part in the world\u2019s history. It is \nto-day playing an equally important part, and probably it will \ncontinue to do so for a considerable time. Most of the changes \nin the past have been caused by violence and coercion. W. E. \nGladstone once said: \"I am sorry to say that if no instructions \nhad been addressed in political crises to the people of this \n\n^ The Future of an Illusion. \n\n\n\nCONVJiRSION OR COMPULSION I \n\ncountry except to remember to hate violence, to love order, and \nto exercise patience, the liberties of this country would never \nhave been attained.\u201d \n\nIt is impossible to ignore the importance of violence in the \npast and present. To do so is to ignore life. Yet violence is un- \ndoubtedly bad and brings an unending trail of evil conse- \nquences with it. And worse even than violence are the motives \nof hatred, cruelty, revenge and punishment which very often \naccompany violence. Indeed violence is bad not intrinsically, \nbut because of these motives that go with it. There can be \nviolence without these motives; there can be violence for a good \nobject as well as for an evil object. But it is extremely difficult \nto separate violence from those motives, and therefore it is \ndesirable to avoid violence as far as possible. In avoiding it, \nhowever, one cannot accept a negative attitude of submitting \nto other and far greater evils. Submission to violence or the \nacceptance of an unjust rdgime based on violence, is the very \nnegation of the spirit of non-violence. The non-violent method, \nin order to justify itself, must be dynamic and capable of \nchanging such a regime or social order. \n\nWhether it can do so or not I do not know. It can, I think, \ncarry us a long way, but I doubt if it can take us to the final \ngoal. In any event, some form of coercion seems to be inevit- \nable, for people who hold power and privilege do not give them \nup till they are forced to do so, or till conditions are created \nwhich make it more harmful to them to keep these privileges \nthan to give them up. The present conflicts in society, national \nas well as class conflicts, can never be resolved except by coer- \ncion^ Conversion, of course, there must be on a large seme, for \nso long as large numbers are not converted there can be no real \nbasis for a movement of social change. But coercion over some \nwill follow. Nor is it right for us to cover up these basic conflicts \nand try to make out that they do not exist. That is not only a \nsuppression of the truth, but it direedy leads to bolstering up \nthe existing order by misleading people as to the true facts, and \ngiving the ruling classes the moi^ basis which they are always \nseeking in order to justify their special privileges. In order to \ncombat an unjust system the false premises on which it is based \nmust be exposed and the reality laid bare. One of the virtues \nof non-co-operation is that it exposes these false premises and \nlies by our refusal to submit to them or to co-operate in their \nfurtherance. \n\nOur final aim can only be a classless society with equal \neconomic justice and opportunity for all, a society organised on \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NLHRU \n\na planned basis for the raising of mankind to higher material \nand cultured levels, to a cultivation of spiritual values, of co- \noperation, unselfishness, the spirit of service, the desire to do \nright, goodwill and love \u2014 ^ultimately a world order. Everything \nthat comes in the way will have to be removed, gently if pos- \nsible, forcibly if necessary. And there seems to he little doubt \nthat coercion will often be necessary. But if force is used it \nshould not be in the spirit of hatred or cruelty, but with the \ndispassionate desire to remove an obstruction. That will be \ndifficult. It is not an easy task; there is no easy way, and the \npitfalls are numerous. The difficulties and pitfalls do not dis- \nappear by our ignoring them, but by realising their true nature \nand facing them boldly. All this sounds fanciful and Utopian, \nand it is highly unlikely that many people will be moved by \nthese noble motives. But we can keep them in view and stress \nthem, and it may be that gradually they will lessen the hatreds \nand passions that fill most of us. \n\nOur methods must lead to this goal and be based on these \nmotives. But we must also realise that human nature being \nwhat it is, in the mass, it will not always respond to our appeals \nand persuasions, or act in accordance with high moral prin- \nciples. Compulsion will often be necessary, in addition to con- \nversion, and the best we can do is to limit this compulsion and \nuse it in such a manner that its evil is lessened.  NON-CO-OPERATION \n\nI HAVE dealt with the Oudh agrarian upheaval in some little \ndetail because it lifted the veil and disclosed a fundamental \naspect of the Indian problem to me to which nationalists had \npaid hardly any attention. Agrarian troubles arc frequently \ntaking place in various parts of India, symptoms of a deep- \nseated unrest, and the kisan agitation in certain parts of Oudh \nin  and  was but one of them, though it was, in its own \nway, a remarkable and a revealing one. In its origin it was en- \ntirely unconnected with politics or politicians, and right through \nits course the influence of outsiders and politicians was of tie \nslightest. From an all-India point of view, however, it was a \nlocal affair and very little attention was paid to it. Even the \nnewspapers of the United Provinces largely ignored it. For their \neditors and the majority of their town-dwelling readers, the \ndoings of mobs of semi-naked peasants had no real political or \nother significance. \n\nThe Punjab and the Khilafat wrongs were the topics of the \nday, and non-co-operation, which was to attempt to bring about a \nrighting of these wrongs, was the all-absorbing subject. The \nlarger issue of national freedom or Swaraj was for the moment \nnot stressed. Gandhiji disliked vague and big objectives, he \nalways preferred concentrating on something specific and defi- \nnite. Nevertheless, Swaraj was very much in the air and in \npeople\u2019s thoughts, and frequent reference was made to it in \ninnumerable gatherings and conferences. \n\nIn the autumn of  a special session of the Congress met \nat Calcutta to consider what steps should be taken and, in par- \nticular, to decide about non-co-operation, Lala LajpatRai, freshly \nback from the United States after a long absence from home, \nwas the President. He' disliked the new-fangled proposal of non- \nco-operation and opposed it. He was usually considered an \nExtremist in Indian politics, hut his general outlook was defi- \nnitely constitutional and moderate. Force of drcumstances and \nnot <moice or convictions had made him an ally of Lokamanya \nTilak and other Extremists in the early days of the century. \nBut he had a social and economic outlook, strengthened by his \nlong residence abroad, and this gave him a broader vision than \nthat of most Indian leaders. \n\ne* \n\n\n\n JAWAHARI-AL NEHRU \n\nWilfrid Scawen Blunt in his \u201c Diaries \u201d describes an interview \nhe had (about ) with Gokhale and Lalaji. He is very hard \non both, considering them far too cautious and afraid of facing \nrealities. And yet Lalaji feced them far more than most Indian \nleaders. Blunt\u2019s impressions make us realise how low was the \ntemper of our politics and our leaders at that time, and how \nan able and experienced foreigner was struck by them. But a \ndecade had made a great difference to that temper. \n\nLala Lajpat Rai was not alone in his opposition; he had a \ngreat and impressive company with him. Indeed, almost the \nentire Old Guard of the Conmess opposed Gandhiji\u2019s resolution \nof non-co-operation. Mr. C. R. Das led the opposition, not be- \ncause he disapproved of the spirit behind the resolution, for he \nwas prepared to go as far or even farther, but chiefly because \nhe objected to the boycott of the new legislatures. \n\nOf the prominent leaders of the older generation my father \nwas the only one to take his stand by Gandhiji at that time. It \nwas no easy matter for him to do so. He sensed and was much \ninfluenced by the objections that had led most of his old col- \nleagues to oppose. He hesitated, as they did, to take a novel \nstep towards an xmknown re^bn, where it was hardly possible \nto keep one\u2019s old bearings. Yet he was inevitably drawn to om \nform of effective action, and the proposal did embody definite \naction, though not exactly on the lines of his thought. It took \nhikn a long time to make up his mind. He had long talks with \nGandhiji and Mr. C. R. Das. Mr. Das and he were thrown a \ngreat deal together just then as they were both appearing, on \nopposite sides, in a big thofussil case. 'They looked at the problem \nftom much the same point of view and there was very little \ndifference between them even as regards the conclusion. Yet \nthat little difference was just enough to keep them on either side \nof the main resolution at the Special Congress. Three months \nlater they met again at the Nagpur Congress, and from then \nonwards they pulled together, ever coming nearer to ekeh \nother. - \n\nI saw very little of father in those days before the Calcutta \nSpecial Congress.' But whenever I met him, I noticed, how he \nwas continually grappling with this problem. Quite apart from \nthe national aspect of the q^uestion there was the personal aspect. \nNon-co-operation meant his withdrawing firom his legal practice; \nit meant a total break with his past life and a new \nof it\u2014 not an easy matter when one is on the eve of one's sixties \nbirthday. It was a break from old political colleagues, firom Hs \nprofession, firom the sodal life to which he had grown accus- \n\n\n\nNON-CO-OPERATION \n\n\n \n\ntomed, and a giving up of many an expensive habit which he \nhad grown into. For the financial aspect of the question was \nnot an unimportant one, and it was obvious that he would have \nto reduce his standard of living if his income from his pro- \nfession vanished. \n\nBut his reason, his strong sense of self-respect, and his pride, \nall led him step by step to throw in his lot wholeheartedly with \nthe new movement. The accumulated anger with which a series \nof events, duminating in the Punjab tragedy and its aftermath, \nfilled him; the sense of utter wrong-doing and injustice, the \nbitterness of national humiliation, had to find some way out. \nBut he was not to be swept away by a wave of enthusiasm. It \nwas only when his reason, backed by the trained mind of a \nlawyer, had weighed all the pros and cons that he\\ook the final \ndecision and joined Gandhiji in his campaign. \n\nHe was attracted by Gandhiji as a man, and that no doubt was \na factor which influenced him. Nothing could have made him \na close associate of a person he disliked, for he was always strong \nin his likes and dislikes. But it was a strange combination \u2014 the \nsaint, the stoic, the man of religion, one who went through life \nrejecting what it offers in the way of sensation and physical \npleasure, and one who had been a bit of an epicure, who \naccepted life and welcomed and enjoyed its many sensations, \nand cared little for what may come in the hereafter. In the \nlanguage of psychoanalysis it was a meeting of an introvert with \nan extrovert. Yet there were common bonds, common in- \nterests, which drew the two together and kept up, even when, \nin later years, their politics diverged, a close friendship between \nthem. \n\nWalter Pater, in one of his books, mentipns how the saint and \nthe epicure, starting from opposed points, travelling different \npaths, one with a rdigious teir^r, the other opposed to it, and \nyet both with an outlook which, in its stress and earnestness, is \nvery unlike any lower development of temper, often understand \nea<\u00b1i other better than either would understand the mere man \nof the world\u2014 and sometimes they actually touch. \n\nThis Special Session at Calcutta began the Gandhi era in Con- \ngress politics which has lasted since then, except for a period \nin the twenties when he kept in the background and allowed the \nSwaraj Party, under the leadership of Deshbandhu C. R. Das \nand my father, to fill the picture. The whole look of the Con- \ngress changed; European dothes vanished and soon only khadi \nwas to be seen; a new class of delegate, chiefly drawn firom the \nlower middle classes became the type of Congressman; the \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nlanguage used became increasingly Hindustani, or sometimes \nthe language of the province where the session was held, as \nmany of the delegates did not understand English, and there \nwas also a growing prejudice against using a foreign language \nin our national work ; and a new life and enthusiasm and earnest- \nness became evident in Congress gatherings. \n\nAfter the Congress was over Gandhiji paid a visit to the \nveteran editor of the Amrit Bazaar Patrika, Syt Motilal Ghose, \nwho was lying on his death-bed. I accompanied him. Motilal \nBahu blessed Gandhiji and his movement, and he added that, \nas for himself, he was going away to other regions, and wherever \nthese might be, he had one great satisfaction \u2014 ^lie would be some- \nwhere where the British Empire did not exist. At last he would \nbe beyond the reach of this Empire ! \n\nOn our way back from the Calcutta Special Congress I accom- \npanied Gandhiji to Santiniketan on a visit to Rabindra Nath \nTagore and his most lovahlc elder brother \u2018 Boro Dada \u2019. We \nspent some days there, and I remember C. E. Andrews giving \nme some books which interested and influenced me greatly. \nThey dealt with the economic aspects of inmerialism in Africa. \nOne of these hooks \u2014 ^Morell\u2019s Black Man's Burden \u2014 amoved me \ngreatly. \n\nAbout this time or a little later, C. F. Andrews wrote a pam- \nphlet advocating independence for India. I think it was called \nIndependence \u2014 the Immediate Need. This was a brilliant essay \nbased on some of Seeley\u2019s writings on India, and it seemed to \nme not only to make out an unanswerable case for independence \nbut also to mirror the inmost recesses of our hearts. The deep \nurge that moved us and our halflformed desires seemed to take \nclear shape in. his simple and earnest language. There was no \neconomic background or socialism in what he had written; it \nwas nationalism pure and simple, the feeling of the humiliation \nof India and a fierce desire to be rid of it and to put \nan end to our continuing degradation. It was wonderful that \nC. F. Andrews, a foreigner and one belonging to the dominant \nrace in India, should echo that cry of our inmost being. Non- \nco-operation was essentially, as Seeley had said long ago, \" the \nnotion that it was shameful to assist the foreigner in maintain- \ning his domination \u201d. And Andrews had written that \" the only \nway of self-recovery was through some vital upheaval &om \nwimin. The explosive force needed for such an upheaval must, \nbe generated vdthin the soul of India itself. It could not come \nthrough loans and gifts and grants and concessions and pro- \nclamations ftom without. It must come from. within . \n\n\n\nNON-CO-OPERATION \n\n\n \n\nTherefore, it was with the intense joy of mental and spiritual \ndeliverance from an intolerable burden, that I watched the \nactual outbreak of such an inner explosive force, as that which \nactually occurred when Mahatma Gandhi spoke to the heart \nof India the mantram . \u2014 \u2018Be free I Be slaves no more! \u2019 and \nthe heart of India responded. In a sudden moveinent her \nfetters began to be loosened, and the pathway of freedom \nwas opened.\u201d \n\nThe next three months witnessed the advancing tide of non- \nco-operation all over the country. The appeal for a boycott of \nthe elections to the new legislatures was remarkably successful. \nIt did not and could not prevent everybody from going to these \ncouncils and thus keep the seats vacant. Even a handful of \nvoters could elect or there might be an unopposed election. But \nthe great majority of voters aljstained from voting, and all who \ncared for the vehemently expressed sense of the country re- \nfrained from standing as candidates. Sir Valentine Chirol \nhappened to he in Allahabad on the election day, and he made \na round of the polling booths. He returned amazed at the \nefficiency of the boycott. At one rural polling station, about \nfifteen miles from Allahabad city, he found that not a single \nvoter had appeared. He gives an account of his experiences in \none of his books on India. \n\nThe wisdom of this boycott had been questioned by Mr. C. R. \nDas and others at the Calcutta session, but they stood by the \nCongress decision. The elections being over, this point of dif \nference was removed, and the next full session of the Congress \nat Nagpur in December  saw a reunion of many of the old \nCongress leaders on the plank of non-co-operation. The very \nsuccess of the movement had convinced many a doubter and \nwaverer, \n\nA few old leaders, however, dropped out of the Congress after \nCalcutta, and among these a popular and well-known figure was \nthat of Mr. M. A. Jinnah. Sarojini Naidu had called him the \n\u201cAmbassador of Hindu-Muslim unity\u201d, and he had been \nlargely responsible in the past fer bringing the Moslem League \nnearer to the Congress. But the new devdopments in the Con- \ngress \u2014 ^non-co-operation and the new constitution which made it \nmore of a popular and mass organization \u2014 were thoroughly dis- \napproved of by him. He disagreed on political grounds, but it \nwas not politics iii the main diat kept him away. There were \nstill many people m the Congress who were politically even less \nadvanced than he was. But temperamentally he did not fit in \nat all with the new Congress. He felt completely out of his \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nelement in the khadi-dad crowd demanding speeches in Hindu- \nstani. The enthusiasm of the people outside struck him as \nmob-hysteria. There was as much difference between him and \nthe Indian masses as between Savile Row and Bond Street and \nthe Indian village with its mud-huts. He suggested once \nprivately that only matriculates should he taken into the Con- \ngress. I do not know if he wa.s serious in making this remarkable \nsuggestion, but it was in harmony with his general outlook. So \nhe drifted away from the Congress and became a rather solitary \nfigure in Indian politics. Later, unhappily, the old Ambassador \nof Unity associated himself with the most reactionary elements \nin Muslim communalism. \n\nThe Moderates or Liberals had, of course, nothing to do with \nthe Congress, They not only kept away from it; they merged \nthemselves in the Government, became ministers and high \nofficials under the new scheme, and helped in fighting non- \nco-operation and the Congress. They had obtained almost what \nthey desired, some reforms had been granted, and so there was \nno need for them to agitate. While the country was seething \nwith excitement and becoming more and more revolutionary, \nthey became frankly counter-revolutionary, a part of the Govern- \nment itself. They were completely cut off from the people and \ndeveloped a habit, which has persisted since, of looking at prob- \nlems firom the official point of view. They ceased to be a party \nin any real sense and became a small number of individuals \ndotted about in a few big cities. Mr. Srinivasa Sastri became an \nImperial Envoy, visiting, at the instance of the British Govern- \nment, various British dominions as well as the United States of \nAmerica, and strongly criticising the Congress and his own \ncotmtrymen for the struggle they were carrying on against that \nGovernment. \n\nAnd yet the Liberals were far from happy. It is not a pleasant \nexperience to be cut off from one\u2019s own people, to sense hostility \neven though one may not see it or hear it. A mass upheaval is \nnot kind to the non-conformists, though Gandhiji\u2019s repeated \nwarnings made non<o-operation far milder and gentler to its \nopponents than it otherwise would have been. But even so, the \nvery atmosphere stifled those who opposed the movement, just \nas it invigor^e,d and filled with life and energy those who sup- \nported itr^mass upheavals and real revolutionary movements \nalways have this double effect : they encourage and bring out \nthe personality of those whp constitute the masses or side with \nthem, and at the same time they suppress psycholoeicallv and \nstifle those who differ from them \n\n\n\nNON-CO-OPERATION \n\n\n \n\nThis was the reason why some people complained that non- \nco-operation was intolerant and tended to introduce a dead \nuniformity of opinion and action. There was truth in this \ncomplaint, but the truth lay in this, that non-co-operation was \na mass movement, and it was led by a man of commanding \npersonality who inspired devotion in India\u2019s millions. A more \nvital truth, however, lay in its effect on the masses. There was a \ntremendous feeling of release there, a throwing-olf of a great \nburden, a new sense of freedom. The fear that had crushed \nthem retired into tlie background, and they straightened their \nbacks and raised their heads. Even in remote bazaars the \ncommon folk talked of the Congress and Swaraj (for the Nagpur \nCongress had finally made Swaraj the goal), and what had hap- \npened in the Punjab, and the Khilafat \u2014 ^but the word \u2018 Khilafat \u2019 \nbore a strange meaning in most of the rural areas. People \nthought it came from Wiilaf, an Urdu word meaning \u2018 against ' \nor \u2018 opposed to \u2019, and so they took it to mean : opposed to Govern- \nment ! They discussed, of course, especially their own particular \neconomic grievances. Innumerable meetings and conferences \nadded greatly to their political education. \n\nMany of us who worked for the Congress programme lived \nin a kind of intoxication during the year ipai. We were full of \nexcitement and optimism and a buoyant enthusiasm. We \u00a7cnsed \nthe happiness of a person , crusading for a cause. We were not \ntroubled with doubts or hesitation; our path seemed to lie glear \nin front of us and we marched ahead-, lifted up by the en- \nthusiasm of others, and helping to push on others. We worked \nhard, harder than we had ever done before, for we knew \nthat the conflict with the Government would come soon, \nand we wanted to do as much as possible before we were \nremoved. \n\nAbove all, we had a sense of fireedom and a pride in that firee- \ndom. The old feeling of oppression and frustration was \ncompletely gone. There was no more whispering, no round- \nabout legal phraseology to avoid getting into trouble with the \nauthorities. We said what we felt and shouted it out firom the \nhouse-tops. What did we care for the consequences? Prison? We \nlooked forward to it ; that would help our cause still further. The \nirmumerable spies and secret-service men who used to surround \nus and follow us about became rather pitiable individuals as there \nwas nothing secret for them to discover. All our cards were \nalways on ihe table. \n\nWe had not only a feeling of satisfaction at doing efiective \npolitical work which was changing the face of India before our \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\neyes and, as wc believed, bringing Indian freedom very near, \nbut also an agreeable sense of moral superiority over our \nopponents, both in regard to our goal and our methods. We \nwere proud of our leader and of the unique method he had \nevolved, and often we indulged in fits of self-righteousness. In \nthe midst of strife, and while we ourselves encouraged that \nstrife, we had a sense of inner peace. \n\nAs our moral grew, that of the Government went down. They \ndid not understand what was happening; it seemed that the \nold world they knew in India was toppling down. There was a \nnew aggressive spirit abroad and self-reliance and fearlessness, \nand the great prop of British rule in India \u2014 prestige \u2014 was \nvisibly wilting. Repression in a small way only strengthened \nthe movement, and the Government hesitated for long before \nit would take action against the big leaders. It did not know \nwhat the consequences might be. Was the Indian Army \nreliable? Would the police carry out orders? As Lord Reading, \nthe Viceroy, said in December , they were \"puzzled and \nperplexed \n\nAn interesting circular was sent confidentially by the \nU.P. Government to its district officers in the summer of \n. This circular, which was published later in a newspaper, \nstated with sorrow that the \u201c initiative \u201d was always with the \n\"enemy\u201d, meaning the Congress, and this was an unfortu- \nnate state of affairs. Various methods were then suggested to \nregain the initiative, among them being the starting of those \nludicrous bodies, the \u201c Aman Sabhas It was believed that this \nparticular method of combating non-co-operation was adopted \nat the suggestion of the Liberal Ministers. \n\nThe nerves of many a British official began to give way. The \nstrain was great. There was this ever-growing opposition and \nspirit of defiance which overshadowed official India like a vast \nmonsoon cloud, and yet because of its peaceful methods it \noffered no handle, no grip, no opportunity for forcible sup- \npression. The average En^ishman did not believe in the hona- \nfides of non-violence; he thought that all this was camouflage, \na cloak to cover some vast secret design which would burst out \nin violent upheaval one day. Nurtured from childhood in the \nwide-spread belief that the East is a mysterious place, and in its \nbazaars and narrow lanes secret conspiracies are being continu- \nally hatched, the Englishman can seldom think straight on \nmatters relating to these lands of supposed mystery! He never \nmakes an 'attempt to understand that somewhat obvious and \nvery unmysterious person the Easterner. He keeps well away \n\n\n\nNON-CO-OPERATION \n\n\n \n\nfrom him, gets his ideas about him from tales abounding in spies \nand secret societies, and then allows his imagination to run riot. \nSo it was in the Punjab early in April  when a sudden fear \noverwhelmed the authorities and the English people generally, \nmade them see danger everywhere, a widespread rising, a second \nmutiny with its frightful massacres, and, in a blind, instinctive \nattempt at self-preservation at any cost, led them to that \nfrightfulness, of which Jallianwala and the Crawling Lane of \nAmritsar have become symbols and byw'ords. \n\nThe year  was a year of great tension, and there was much \nto irritate and annoy and unnerve the official. What was actu- \nally happening was bad enough, but what was imagined was \nfar worse. I remember an instance which illustrates this riot of \nthe imagination. My sister Swarup\u2019s wedding, which was taking \nplace at Allahabad, was fixed for the loth May, , the actual \ndate having been calculated, as usual on such occasions, by a \nreference to the Samvat calendar, and an auspicious day chosen. \nGandhiji and a number of leading Congressmen, including the \nAli brothers, had been invited, and to suit their convenience, \na meeting of the Congress Working Committee was fixed at \nAllahabad about that time. The local Congressmen wanted to \nprofit by the presence of famous leaders from outside, and so \nthey organised a district conference on a big scale, expect- \ning a large number of peasants from the surrounding rural \nareas. \n\nThere was a great deal of bustle and excitement in Allahabad \non account of Uiese political gatherings. This had a remarkable \neffect on the nerves of some people. I learnt one day through a \nbarrister ffiend that many English people were thoroughly upset \nand expected some sudden upheaval in the city. They distrusted \ntheir Indian servants, and carried about revolvers in their \n\nE ockets. It was even said privately that the Allahabad Fort was \nept in readiness for the English colony to retire tliere in case \nof need. I was much surprised and could not make out why \nany one should contemplate the possibility of a rising in the \nsleepy and peaceful city of Allahabad just when the very apostle \nof non-violence was going to visit us. Oh, it was said. May loth \n(the day accidentally fixed for my sister\u2019s marriage) was the anni- \nversary of the outbreak of the Mutiny at Meerut in  and \ntliis was going to be celebrated I \nOwing to the prominence given to the Khilafat movement in \n a large number of Moulyies and Muslim religious leaders \ntook a prominent part in the political struggle. They gave a \ndefinite religious tinge to the movement, and Muslims generally \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwere greatly influenced by it. Many a Westernised Muslim, who \nwas not of a particularly religious turn of mind, began to grow \na beard and otherwise conform to the tenets of Orthodoxy. The \ninfluence and prestige of the Moulvics, which had been gradu- \nally declining owing to new ideas and a progressive Westernisa- \ntion, began to grow again and dominate the Muslim community. \nThe Ali brothers, themselves of a religious turn of mind, helped \nin this process, and so did Gandhiji, who paid the greatest regard \nto the Moulvies and the Maulanas. \n\nGandhiji, indeed, was continually laying stress on the religious \nand spiritual side of the movement. His religion was not dog- \nmatic, but it did mean a definitely religious outlook on life, and \nthe whole movement was strongly influenced by this and took \non a revivalist character so far as the masses were concerned. \nThe great majority of Congress workers naturally tried to model \nthemselves alter their leader and even repeated his language. \nAnd yet Gandhiji's leading colleagues in the Working Com- \nmittee\u2014 my father, Deshbandhu Das, Lala Lajpat Rai, and \nothers\u2014 were nor men of religion in the ordinary sense of the \nword, and they considered political problems on the political \nplane only. In their public utterances they did not bring in \nreligion. But whatever they said had far less influence than the \nforce of their personal example \u2014 ^had they not given up a great \ndeal that the world values and taken to simpler ways of living? \nThis in itself was taken as a sign \"of religion and helped in \nspreading the atmosphere of revivalism. \n\nI used to be troubled sometimes at the growth of this religious \nelement in our politics, both on the Hindu and the Muslim side. \nI did not like it at all. Much that Moulvies and Maulanas and \nSwamis and the like said in their public addresses seemed to me \nmost unfortunate. Their history and sociology and economics \nappeared to me all wrong, and the religious twist that was given \nto everjrthing prevented all clear thinking. Even some of \nGandhiji\u2019s phrases sometimes jarred upon me\u2014 thus his frequent \nreference to Rama Raj as a golden age which was to return. But \nI was powerless to intervene, and I consoled myself with the \nthought that Gandhiji used the words because they were well \nknown and understood by the masses. He had an amazing knack \nof reaching the heart of the people. \u2014 \u2022 . \n\nBut I did not worry myself much over these matters. I was \ntoo full of my work and the progress of our movement to care \nfor such trifles, as I thought at the time they were. A vast move- \nment had all sorts and kinds of people in it, and so long as our \nmain direction was correct, a few eddies and bac^^waters did not \n\n\n\nNON-CO-OPERATION \n\n\n \n\nmatter. As for Gandhiji himself, he was a very difficult person \nto understand, sometimes his language was almost incom- \nprehensible to an average modern. But we felt that we knew \nhim quite well enough to realise that he was a great and unique \nman and a glorious leader, and having put our faith in him we \ngave him an almost blank cheque, for the time being at least. \nOften we discussed his fads and peculiarities among ourselves \nand said, half-humorously, that when Swaraj came these fads \nmust not be encouraged. \n\nMany of us, however, were too much under his influence in \npolitical and other matters to remain wholly immune even in \nthe sphere of religion. Where a direct attack might not have \nsucceeded, many an indirect approach went a long way to under- \nmine the defences. The outward ways of religion did not appeal \nto me, and above all I disliked the exploitation of the people by \nthe so-called men of religion, but still I toned down towards it. \nI came nearer to a religious frame of mind in  than at any \nother time since my early boyhood. Even so I did not come very \nnear. \n\nWhat I admired was the moral and ethical side of our \nmovement and of satyagraha. I did not give an absolute \nallegiance to the doctrine of non-violence or accept it for ever, \nbut it attracted me more and more, and the belief grew upon \nme that, situated as we were in India and with our background \nand traditions, it was the right policy for us. The spiritualisation \nof politics, using the word not in its narrow religious sense, \nseemed to me a fine idea. A worthy end should have worthy \nmeans leading up to it. That seemed not only a good ethical \ndoctrine but sound, practical politics, for the means that are not \ngood often defeat the end in view and raise new problems and \ndifficulties. And then it seemed so unbecoming, so degrading \nto the self-respect of an individual or a nation to submit to such \nmeans, to go through the mire. How can one escape being sullied \nby it? How can we march ahead swiftly and with dignity if we \nstoop or crawl? \n\nSuch were my thoughts then. And the non<o-operation move- \nment offered me what I wanted\u2014 the goal of national freedom \nand (as I thought) the ending of the exploitation of the under- \ndog, and the means which satisfied my moral sense and gave me \na sense of personal freedom. So great was this personal satis- \nftiction that even a possibility of failure did not count for much, \nfor such failure could only be temporary. I did not understand \ndr feel drawn to the metaphysical part of the Bhagavad Gita, \nbut I l^ff to read the verses\u2014 recited every evening in Gandhiji\u2019s \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nashram prayers \u2014 which say what a man should be like : Calm \nof purpose, serene and unmoved, doing his job and not caring \novermuch for the result of his action. Not being very calm or \ndetached myself, I suppose, this ideal appealed to me all the \nmore.  LUCKNOW DISTRICT GAOL \n\nImprisonment for political offences was not a new thing in the \nIndia of . From the time of the Bengal partition agitation \nespecially, there had always been a continuous stream of men \ngoing to prison, sentenced often to very long terms. There had \nbeen internments without trial also. The greatest Indian leader \nof the day, Lokamanya Tilak, was sentenced in his declining \nyears to six years\u2019 imprisonment. The Great War speeded up \nthis process of internment and imprisonment, and conspiracy \ncases became frequent, usually resulting in death sentences or \nlife terms. The Ali brothers and M. Abulkalam Azad -were \namong the war-time internees. Soon after the war, martial law in \nthe Punjab took a heavy toll, and large numbers were sentenced \nin conspiracy cases or summary trials. So political imprisonment \nhad become a frequent enough occurrence in India, but so far it \nhad not been deliberately courted. It had come in the course of \na person\u2019s activities, or perhaps because the secret police did not \nfancy him, and every effort was made to avoid it by means of \na defence in the law court. In South Africa, of course, a different \nexample had been set by Gandhiji and thousands of his fol- \nlowers in their campaign of Sat^agraha. \n\nBut still in  prison was an almost unknown place, and \nvery few knew what happened behind the grim gates that swal- \nlowed the new convict. Vaguely we imagined that its inhabitants \nwere desperate people and dangerous criminals. In our minds \nthe place was associated with isolation, humiliation, and suffer- \ning, and, above all, the fear of the unknown. Frequent references \nto gaol-going from  onwards, and the march of many of our \ncomrades to prbon, gradually accustomed us to the idea and \ntook away the edge from that almost involtmtary feeling of re- \npugnance and reluctance. But no amount of previous mental \npreparation could prevent the tension and nervous excitement \nthat filled us when we first entered the iron gates. Since those \ndays, thirteen years ago, I imagine that at least three hundred \nthousand men and women of India have entered those gates for \npolitical offences, although often enough the actual charge has \nbeen under some other section of the criminal code. Thousands \nof these have gone in and out many a time; they have got to \nknow well what to expect inside; they have tried to adapt them- \n\noo \n\n\n\nLUCKNOW DISTKICT GAOL gi \n\nselves to the strange life there, as far as one can adapt oneself to \nan existence full of abnormality and a dull suffering and a dread- \nful monotony. We grow accustomed to it, as one grows ac- \ncustomed to almost anything; and yet every time that we \nenter those gates again, there is a bit of the old excitement, a \nfeeling of tension, a quickening of the pulse. And the eyes \nturn back involuntarily to take a last good look outside at the \ngreenery and wide spaces, and people and conveyances moving \nabout, and familiar faces that they may not see again for a long \ntime. \n\nMy first term in gaol, which ended rather suddenly after three \nmonths, was a hectic period both for us' and the gaol staff. The \ngaol officials were half paralysed by the influx of the new type \nof convict. The number itself of these newcomers, added to \nfrom day to day, was extraordinary and created an impression \nof a flood which might sweep away the old traditional land- \nmarks. More upsetting still was the type of the newcomer. It \nbelonged to all classes, but had a high proportion of the middle \nclass. All these classes, however, had this in common; they \ndiffered entirely from the ordinary convict, and it was not easy \nto treat them in the old way. This was recognised by the authori- \nties, but there vras nothing to take the place of the existing \nrules; there were no precedents and no experience. The average \nCongress prisoner was not very meek and mild, and even inside \nthe gaol walls numbers gave him a feeling of strength. The agita- \ntion outside, and the new interest of the public in what trans- \npired inside the prisons, added to this. In spite of this somewhat \naggressive attitude, our general policy was one of co-operation \nwii the gaol authorities. But for our help, the troubles of the \nofficials would have been far greater. The gaoler would come to \nus frequently and ask u? to visit some of the barracks containing \nour volimteers in order to soothe them or get them to agree to \nsomething. \n\nWe had come to prison of our own accord, many of the volun- \nteers indeed having pushed their way in almost uninvited. There \nwas thus hardly any question of any one of them trying to \nescape. If he had any desire to go out, he could do so easily by \nexpressing regret for his action or giving an undertaking that he \nwould refrain from such acdvity in future. An attempt to escape \nwould only bring a measure of ignominy, and in itself was tan- \ntamount to a withdrawal from political acdvity of the civil \nresistance variety. The superintendent of our prison in Lucknow \nfully appreciated this and used to tell the gaoler (who was a Khan \nSamb) that if he could succeed in allowing some of the Congress \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nprisoners to escape he, the superintendent, would recommend \nhim to Government for the title of Khan Bahadur. \n\nMost of our fellow-prisoners were kept in huge barracks in the \ninner circle of the prison. About eighteen of us, selected I sup- \npose for better treatment, were kept in an old weaving shed with \na large open space attached. My fether, two of my cousins, and I \nhad a small shed to ourselves, about  feet by . We had con- \nsiderable freedom in moving about from one barrack to another. \nFrequent interviews with relatives outside were allowed. News- \npapers came, and the daily news of fresh arrests and the develop- \nments of our struggle kept up an atmosphere of excitement. \nMutual discussions and talks took up a lot of time, and I could \ndo little reading or other solid work. I spent the mornings in a \nthorough cleaning and washing of our shed, in washing father\u2019s \nand my own clothes, and in spinning. It was winter, the best \ntime of year in North India. For the first ftw .weeks we were \nallowed to open classes for our volunteers, or such of them as \nwere illiterate, to teach them Hindi and Urdu and other elemen- \ntary subjects. In the afternoons we played volley-ball.* \n\nGradually restrictions grew. We were stopped from going out- \nside our enclosure and visiting the part of the gaol where most \nof our volunteers were kept. The classes naturally stopped. I \nwas discharged about that time. \n\nI went out early in March, and six or seven weeks later, in \nApril, I returned. I found that the conditions had greatly \nchanged. Father had been transferred to the Naini Tal Gaol and, \nsoon after his departure, new rules were enforced. All the \nprisoners in the big weaving shed, where I had been kept pre- \nviously, were transferred to the inner gaol and kept in the bar- \nracks (single halls) there. Each barrack was practically a gaol \nwithin a gaol, and no communications were allowed between \ndifferent barracks. Interviews and letters were now restricted to \none a month. The food was much simpler, though we were \nallowed to supplement it firom outside. \n\nIn the barrack in which I was kept there must have been about \n\n* A ridiculous story has appeared in the Press, and, though con- \ntradicted, condnues to appear from time to dme. According to this. \nSir Harcourt Butler, the men Governor of the U.P., sent champagne \nto my father in prison. Sir Harcourt sent ray father nothing at all \nin prison; nobody sent him champagne or any other alcoholic drink; \nand indeed he had given up alcohol in  after the Congress took \nto non-co-operation, and was not taking any such drinks at that \ntime, \n\n\n\nLUCKNOW DISTRICT GAOL  \n\nfifty persons. We were all crowded together, our beds being \nabout three or four feet from each other. Fortunately almost \neverybody in that barrack was known to me, and there were \nmany friends. But the utter want of privacy, all day and night, \nbecame more and more difficult to endure. Always the same \ncrowd looking on, the same petty annoyances and irritations, \nand no escape fi:om them to a quiet nook. We bathed in public \nand washed our clothes in public, and ran round and round the \nbarrack for exercise, and talked and argued till we had largely \nexhausted each other\u2019s capacity for intelligent conversation. It \nwas the dull side of family life, magnified a hundred-fold, with \nfew of its graces and compensations, and all this among people \nof all kinds and tastes. It was a great nervous strain for all of us, \nand often I yearned for solitude. In later years I was to have \nenough of this solitude and privacy in prison, when for months \nI would see no one except an occasional gaol official. Again I \nlived in a state of nervous tension, but this time I longed for \nsuitable company. I thought then sometimes, almost with envy, \nof my crowded existence in the Lucknow District Gaol in , \nand yet I knew well enough that of the two I preferred the \nsolitude, provided at least that I could read and write. \n\nAnd yet I must say that the company was unusually decent \nand pleasant, and we got on well together. But all of us, I sup* \npose, got a little bored with the others occasionally and wanted \nto be away from them and have a little privacy. The nearest \napproach to privacy that I could get was by leaving my barrack \nand sitting in the open part of the enclosure. It was the monsoon \nseason and it was usually possible to do so because of the clouds. \nI braved the heat and an occasional drizzle even, and spent as \nmuch time as possible outside the barrack. \n\nLying there in the open, I watched the skies and the clouds \nand I realised, better than I had ever done before, how amaz- \ningly beautiful were their changing hues. \n\n\" To watch the changing douds, like clime in clime; \n\n, Oh! sweet to lie and bless the luxury of time.\u201d \n\nTime was not a luxury for to, it was more of a burden. But \nthe time I spent in watching those ever-shifting monsoon clouds \nwas filled with delight and a sense of relief. I had the joy of \nhaving made almost a discovery, and a feeling of escape firom \nconfinement, I do not know why that particular monsoon had \nthat great effect on me; no previous or subsequent one has moved \nme in that way. I had seen and admired many a fine sunrise \nand sunset in the mountains and over the sea, and bathed in its \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL KEHRU \n\nglory, and felt stirred for the time being by its magnificence. \nHaving seen it, I had almost taken it for granted and passed on \nto other things. But in gaol there were no sunrises or sunsets to \nbe seen, the horizon was hidden from us, and late in the morning \nthe hot-rayed sun emerged over our guardian walls. There were \nno colours anywhere, and our eyes hardened and grew dull at \nseeing always that same drab view of mud-coloured wall and \nbarrack. They must have hungered for some light and shade \nand colouring, and when the monsoon clouds sailed gaily by, \nassuming fantastic shapes, and playing in a riot of colour, . I \ngasped in surprised delight and watched them almost as if I \nwas in a trance. Sometimes the clouds would break, and one saw \nthrough an opening in them that wonderful monsoon phenome- \nnon, a dark blue of an amazing depth, which seemed to be a \nportion of infinity. \n\nThe restrictions on us gradually grew in number, and stricter \nrules were enforced. The Government, having got the measure \nof our movement, wanted us to experience the full extent of its \ndispleasure with our temerity in having dared to challenge it. \nThe introduction of new rules or the manner of their enforce- \nment led to friction between the gaol authorities and the political \nprisoners. For several months nearly all of us \u2014 ^we were some \nhundreds at the time in that particular gaol \u2014 gave up our inter- \nviews as a protest. Evidently it was thought that some of us \nwere the trouble-makers, and so seven of us were transferred to a \ndistant part of the gaol, quite cut off from the main barracks. \nAmong those who were thus separated were Purushottam Das \nTandon, Mahadev Desai, George Joseph, Balkrishna Sharma, \nDevadas Gandhi and . \n\nWe were sent to a smaller enclosure, and there were some dis- \nadvantages in living there. But on the whole I was glad of the \nchange. There was no crowdiiw here; we could live in greater \n\na uiet and with more privacy. There was more time to read or \no other work. We were cut off completely from our colleagues \nin other parts of ihe gaol as well as firom the outside world, for \nnewspapers were now stopped for all political prisoners. \n\nNewspapers did not come to us, but some news firom outside \ntrickled through, as it always manages to trickle through in \nprison. Our monthly interviews and letters also brought us odd \nbits of information. We saw; that our movement was at -a low \nebb outside. The magic moment had passed and success seemed \nto retire into the dim future. Outside, the Congress was split into \ntwo factions\u2014 the pro-changers and no-changers. The former, \nunder the leadership of Deshbandhu Das and my father, wanted \n\n\n\nLUCKNOW DISTRICT GAOL  \n\nthe Congress to take part in the new elections to the central and \nprovincial councils and, if possible, to capture these legislatures; \nthe latter, led by C. Rajagopalachari, opposed any change \nof the old programme of non-co-operation. Gandhiji was, \nof course, in prison at the time. The fine ideals of tlie move- \nment which had carried us forward, as on the crest of an \nadvancing tide, were being swamped by petty squabbles and \nintrigues for power. We realised how much easier it was to \ndo great and venturesome deeds in moments of enthusiasm \nand excitement than to carry on fi'om day to day when the \nglow was past. Our spirits were damped by the news from \noutside, and this, added to the various humours that prison \nproduces, increased the strain of life there. But still there re- \nmained within- us an inner feeling of satisfaction, that we had \npreserved our self-respect and dignity, that we had acted rightly \nwhatever the consequences. The future was dim, but, whatever \nshape it might take, it seemed that it would be the lot of many \nof us to spend a great part of our lives in prison. So we talked \namongst ourselves, and I remember particularly a conversation \nwith George Joseph in which we came to this conclusion. Since \nthose days Joseph has drifted far apart from us and has even \nbecome a vigorous critic of our doings. I wonder if he ever \nremembers that talk we had on an autumn evening in the Civil \nWard of the Lucknow District Gaol? \n\nWe settled down to a routine of work and exercise. For exer- \ncise we used to run round and round the little enclosure, or two \nof us would draw water, like two bullocks yoked together, pull- \ning a huge leather bucket from a well in our yard. In this way \nwe watered a small vegetable garden in our enclosure. Most of \nus used to spin a little daily. But reading was my principal occu- \npation during those winter days and long evenings. Almost \nalways, whenever the superintendent visited us, he found me \nreading. This devotion to reading seemed to get on his nerves a \nlittle, and he remarked on it once, adding that, so fer as he was \nconcerned, he had practically finished his general reading at the \nage of twelve I No doubt this abstention on his part had been of \nuse to that gallant English colonel in avoiding troublesome \nthoughts, and perhaps it helped him subsequently in rising to \nthe position of Inspector-General of Prisons in the United \nProvinces. \n\nThe long winter evenings and the clear Indian sky attracted us \nto the stars and, with the help of some charts, we spotted many \nof them. Nightly we would await their appearance and greet \nthem with the satisfacion of seeing old acquaintances. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nSo we passed our time, and the days lengthened themselves \ninto weeks, and the weeks became months. We grew accustomed \nto our routine existence. But in the world outside the real burden \nfell on our womenfolk, our mothers and wives and sisters. They \nwearied with the long waiting, and their very freedom seemed a \nreproach to them when their loved ones were behind prison bars. \n\nSoon after our first arrest in December  the police started \npaying frequent visits to Anand Bhawan, our house in Allaha- \nbad. They came to realise the fines which had been imposed on \nfather and me. It was the Congress policy not to pay fines. So \nthe police came day after day and attached and carried away \nbits of furniture. Indira, my four-year-old daughter, was greatly \nannoyed at this continuous process of despoilation and protested \nto the police and expressed her strong displeasure. I am afraid \nthose early impressions are likely to colour her future views \nabout the police force generally. \n\nIn the gaol every effort was made to keep us apart from the \nordinary non-political convicts, special gaols being as a rule re- \nserved for politicals. But complete segregation was impossible, \nand we often came into touch with those prisoners and learnt \nfrom them, as well as directly, the realities of prison life in those \ndays. It was a story of violence and widespread graft and corrup- \ntion. The food was quite amazingly bad; I tried it repeatedly \nand found it quite uneatable. The staff was usually wholly \nincompetent and was paid very low salaries, but it had every \nopportunity to add to its income by extorting money on every \nconceivable occasion from the prisoners or their relatives. The \nduties and responsibilities of the gaoler and his assistants and the \nwarders, as laid down by the Gaol Manual, were so many and so \nvarious that it was quite impossible for any person to discharge \nthem conscientiously or competently. The general policy of the \nprison administration in the United Provinces (and probably in \nother provinces) had absolutely nothing to do with the reform \nof the prisoner or of teaching him good habits and useful trades. \nThe object of prison labour was to harass the convict.^ He was \n\n\u2022 ^ Article  of the United Provinces Gaol Manual, which has now \nbeen removed from the new edition, stated that : \n\n\u201c Labour in a gaol should be considered primarily as a means of \npunishment and not of employment only; neither should the ques- \ntion of its being highly remunerative have much weight, the object \nof paramount importance being that prison work should be irksome \nand laborious and a cause of dread to evil-doers.\" \n\nThis might be compared with the following articles of the Russian \n\nrntnin-l Podi-- \n\n\n\nLUCKNOW DISTRICT GAOL  \n\nto be frightened and broken into blind submission; the idea was \nthat he should carry away from prison a fear and a horror of it, \nso that he might avoid crime and a return to prison in the \nfuture. \n\nThere have been some changes in recent years for the better. \nFood has improved a little, so also clothing and other matters. \nThis was largely due to the agitation carried on outside by poli- \ntical prisoners after their discharge. Non-co-operation also \nresulted in a substantial increase in the warders\u2019 salaries to give \nthem an additional inducement to remain loyal to the Sarkar. \nA feeble effort is also made now to teach reading and writing to \nthe boys and younger prisoners. But all these changes, welcome \nas they are, barely scratch the problem, and the old spirit remains \nmuch the same. \n\nThe great majority of the political prisoners had to put up \nwith this regular treatment for ordinary prisoners. They liad no \nspecial privileges or other treatment, but being more aggressive \nand intelligent than the others, they could not easily be ex- \nploited, nor could money be made out of them. Because of this \nthey were naturally not popular with the staff, and when occasion \noffered itself a breach of gaol discipline by any of tliem was \npunished severely. For such a breach a young boy of fifteen or \nsixteen, who called himself Azad, was ordered to be flogged. \nHe was stripped and tied to the whipping triangle, and as each \nstripe fell on him and cut into his flesh, he shouted \u201c Mahatma \nGandhi ki Jai Every stripe brought forth the slogan till the \nboy fainted. Later, that boy was to beepme one of the leaders \nof the group of Terrorists in North India. \n\n\nArticle  . \u2014 \u201c The measures of social defence do not have for their \nobject the infliction of physical suffering nor the lowering of human \ndignity, nor are they meant to avenge or to punish.\" \n\nArtide  . \u2014 \" Sentences, being a measure of protection, must be \nfree from any element of torture, and must not cause the criminal \nneedless or superfluous suffering.\u201d ",
    "1922-1926": " COCONADA AND M. MOHAMAD ALI \n\nIn December  the annual session of the Congress was held \nat Coconada in the South. Maulana Mohamad Ali was the \nPresident and, as was his wont, he delivered an enormously long \npresidential address. But it was an interesting one. He traced \nthe growth of political and communal feeling amon^ the Mos- \nlems and showed how the famous Moslem deputation to the \nViceroy in , under the leadership of the Aga Khan, which \nled to the first official declaration in favour of separate elector- \nates, was a command performance and had been engineered by \nthe Government itself. \n\nMohamad Ali induced me, much against my will, to accept \nthe All-India Congress secretaryship for his year of president- \nship. I had no desire to accept executive responsibQity, when \nI was not clear about future policy. But I could not resist \nMohamad Ali, and both of us felt that some other secretary \nmight not be able to work as harmoniously with the new Presi- \ndent as I could. He had strong Ukes and dislikes, and I was \nfortunate enough to be included in his \u2018likes\u2019. A bond of \naffection and mutual appreciation tied us to each other. He was \ndeeply and, as I considered, most irrationally religious, and I was \nnot, but I was attracted by his earnestness, his over-flowing \nenergy and keen intelligence. He had a nimble wit, but some- \ntimes his devastating sarcasm hurt, and he lost many a fiiend \nthereby. It was quite impossible for him to keep a clever remark \nto himself, whatever the consequences might be. \n\nWe got on well together during his year of office, though we \nhad many little points of difierence. I introduced in our A.I.C.C. \noffice a practice of addressing all our members by their names \nonly, without any prefixes or suffixes, honorific titles and the like. \nThere ate so many of these m India \u2014 Mahatma, Maulana, Pan- \ndit, Shaikh, Syed, Mimshi, Kfoulvi, and latterly Sriyut and Shri, \nand, of course, Mr. and Esquire \u2014 and they are so abhndantly \nand often unnecessarily used that  wanted to set a good example. \nBut I was not to have my way. Mohamed Ali sent me a frantic \ntelegram directing me 'as:pr\u00abident\u2019 to revert to our old prac- \ntice and, in particular, always to address Gandhi ji as Mahatma. \n\nAnother firequent subject for argum^t between us was the \nAlmighty. Mohamed Afi had an extrfiordinary way of hrin^g \n\n \n\n\n\nIl JAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\nin some reference to God even in Congress resolutions, either by \nway of expressing gratitude or some kind of prayer. I used to \nprotest, and then he would shout at me for my irreligion. And \nyet, curiously enough, he would tell me later that he was quite \n\u2022sure that I was fundamentally religious, in spite of my super- \nficial behaviour or my declaradons to the contrary, I have often \nwondered how much truth there was in his statement. Perhaps \nit depends on what is meant by religion and religious. \n\nI avoided discussing this subject of religion with him, because \nI knew we would only irritate each other, and I might hurt him. \nIt is always a difficult subject to discuss with convinced believers \nof any creed. With most Moslems it is probably an even harder \nmatter for discussion, since no latitude of thought is officially \npermitted to them. Ideologically, theirs is a straight and narrow \npath, and the believer must not swerve to the right or the \nleft. Hindus are somewhat different, though not always so. In \npractice they may be very orthodox; they may, and do, indulge \nin the most out-or-date, reactionary and even pernicious customs, \nand yet they will usually be prepared to discuss the most radical \nideas about religion. I imagine the modern Arya Samajists have \nnot, as a rule, this wide intellectual approach. Like the Moslems, \nthey follow their own straight and narrow path. There is a \ncertain philosophical tradition among the intelligent Hindus, \nwhich, though it does not affect practice, does make a difference \nto the ideological approach to a religious question. Partly, I \nsuppose, this is due to the wide and often conflicting variety \nof opinions and customs that are included in the Hindu fold. \nIt has, indeed, often been remarked that Hinduism is hardly \na religion in the usual sense of the word. And yet, what amazing \ntenacity it has got, what tremendous power of survival I One \nmay even be a professing atheist \u2014 as the old Hindu philosopher, \nCharvaka, was \u2014 and yet no one dare say that he has ceased to \nbe a Hindu. Hinduism clings on to its children, almost despite \nthem. A Brahman I was bom, and a Brahman I seem to remain \nwhatever I might say or do in regard to religion or social cus- \ntom. To the Indian world I am \u2018 Pandit \u2019 so and so, in spite of \nmy desire not to have this or any other honorific title attached \nto niy name. I remember meeting a Turkish scholar once in \nSwitprland, to whom I had sent previously a letter of intro- \nduction in which I had been referred to as \u2018 Pandit Jawaharlal \nNehm He was surprised and a little disappointed to see me \nfor, as he told me, the ' Pandit \u2019 had led him to expect a reverend \nand scholarly gentleman of advanced years. \n\nSo Mohamad Ali and  did not discuss religion. But he did \n\n\n\nCOCONADA AND M- MOHAMAD ALI I Ip \n\nnot possess the virtue of silence, and some years later (I think \nthis was in  or early in ) he could not repress himself \non this subject any more. He burst out one day, as I was visiting \nhim in his house in Delhi, and said that he insisted on discussing \nreligion with me. I tried to dissuade him, pointing out that our \nview-points were very different, and we were not likely to make \nmuch impression on each other. But he was not going to be \ndiverted. \u201c We must have it out,\u201d he said. \u201c I suppose you think \nthat I am a fanatic. Well, I am going to show you that I am \nnot.\u201d He told me that he had studied the subject of religion \ndeeply and extensively. He pointed out shelves full of books \non various religions, especially Islam and Christianity, and \nincluding some modern books like H. G. Wells\u2019s God, the \nInvisible King. During the long years of his war-time intern- \nment, he had gone through the Quran repeatedly, and consulted \nall the commentaries on it. As a result of this study he found \nout, so he told me, that about  per cent, of what was contained \nin the Quran was entirely reasonable, and could be justified \neven apart from the Quran. The remaining  per cent, was \nnot prima facie acceptable to his reason. But was it more likely \nthat the Quran, which was obviously right in regard to  per \ncent., was also right in regard to the remaining  per cent,, \nthan that his feeble reasoning feculty was right and the Quran \nwrong? He came to the conclusion that the chances were \nheavily in favour of the Quran, and so he accepted it as  per \ncent, correct. \n\nThe logic of this argument was not obvious, but I had no \nwish to argue. What rollowed really surprised me. Mohamad \nAli said that he was quite certain that if any one read the \nQuran with an open and receptive mind, he would be convinced \nof its truth. He knew (he added) that Bapu (Gandhiji) had \nread it carefuUy, and he must, therefore, have been convinced \nof the truth of Islam. But his pride of heart had kept him \nfi:om declaring this. \n\nAfter his year of presidentship, Mohamad Ali gradually \ndrifted away from the Congress, or, perhaps, as he would have \nput it, the Congress drifted away from him. The process was \na slow one, and he continued to attend Congress and A.I.C.C. \nmeeting, and take vigorous part in them for several years \nmore. But the rift widened, estrangement grew. Perhaps no \nparticular individual or individuals were to blame for this; it \nwas an inevitable result of certain objective conditions in the \ncountry. But it was an unfortunate result, which hurt many \nof us. For, whatever the differences on the communal question \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nmight have been, there were very few differences on the political \nissue. He was devoted to the idea of Indian independence. And \nbecause of this common political outlook, it was always possible \nto come to some mutually satisfactory arrangement with him \non the communal issue. There was nothing in common, poli- \ntically, between him and the reactionaries who pose as the \nchampions of communal interests. \n\nIt was a misfortune for India that he left the country for \nEurope in the summer of . A great effort was then made \nto solve the communal problem, and it came very near success. \nIf Mohamad Ali had been here then, it is just conceivable that \nmatters would have shaped differently. But by the time he \ncame back the break had already taken place and, inevitably, \nhe found himself on the other side. \n\nTwo years later, in , when large numbers of our people \nwere in prison and the Civil Disobedience movement was in full \nswing, Mohamad Ali ignored the Congress decision, and at- \ntended the Round Table Conference. I was hurt by his going. \nI believe that in his own heart he was tmhappy about it, and \nthere is enough evidence of this in his activities in London. He \nfelt that his real place was in the fight in India, not in the \nfutile conference chamber in London. And if he had returned \nto his country he would, I feel sure, have joined that struggle. \nPhysically, he was a doomed man, and for years past the grip of \ndisease was tightening upon him. In London his overwhelming \nanxiety to achieve, to do something worth while, when rest and \ntreatment was what he needed, hastened his end. The news of \nhis death came to me in Naini Prison as a blow. \n\nI met him for the last time on the occasion of the Lahore \nCongress in December . He was not pleased with some \nparts of my presidential address, and he criticised it vigorously. \nHe saw that the Congress was going ahead, and becoming poli- \ntically more aggressive. He was aggressive enough himself, and, \nbeing so, he disliked taking a back-seat and allowing others to \nbe in the front. He gave me solemn warning : \" I warn you, \nJawahar, that your present colleagues will desert you. Tliey \nwill leave you in the lurch in a crisis. Your own Congressmen \nwill send you to the gallows.\" A dismal prophecy  \n\nThe Coconada Congress, held in Deceinber , had a special \ninterest for me, because the foundations of an aU-India volun- \nteer organisation, the Hindustani Seva Dal, were laid there. \nThere had been no lack of volunteer organisations even before, \nboth fi>r or^nisatlonal work and for gaol-going. But there was \nlittle disciplme, little cohesion. Dr. N. S. Hardii^pr conreivpd \n\n\n\nCOCONAUA AND M. MOHAMAU ALI II \n\nthe idea of having a well-disciplined all-India corps trained to do \nnational work under the general guidance of the Congress, He \npressed me to co-operate with him in this, and I gladly did so, \nfor the idea appealed to me. The beginnings were made at \nCoconada. We were surprised to find later how much opposition \nthere was to the Seva Dal among leading Congressmen. Some \nsaid that this was a dangerous departure, as it meant introducing \na military element in the Congress, and the military arm might \nover-power the civil authority I Others seemed to think that \nthe only discipline necessary was for the volunteer to obey orders \nissued from above, and for the rest it was hardly desirable for \nvolunteers even to walk in step. At the back of the mind of some \nwas the notion that the idea of having trained and drilled \nvolunteers was somehow inconsistent with the Congress prin- \nciple of non-violence. Hardiker, however, devoted himself to \nthis task, and by the patient labour of years he demonstrated \nhow much more efficient and even non-violent our trained \nvolunteers could be. \n\nSoon after my return from Coconada, in January  ,  had \na new kind of experience in Allahabad. I write from memory, \nand I am likely to get mixed up about dates. But I think that \nwas the year of the Kumbh, or the Ardh-Kumbh, the great bath- \ning mela held on the banks of the Ganges at Allahabad. Vast \nnumbers of pilgrims usually turn up, and most of them bathe \nat the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna\u2014 the Triveni, it \nis called, as the mydiical Saraswati is also supposed to join the \nother two. The Ganges river-bed is about a mile wide, but in \nwinter the river shrinks and leaves a wide expanse of sand \nexposed, which is very useful for the camps of the pilgrims. \nWithin this river-bed, the Ganges frequently changes its course. \nIn  the current of the Ganges was such that it was un- \ndoubtedly dangerous for crowds to bathe at the Triveni. With \ncertain precautions, and the control of the numbers bathing at \na time, the danger could be greatly lessened. \n\nI was not at all interested in this question, as I did not pro- \npose to acquire merit by bathing in the river on the auspicious \ndays. But I noticed in the Press that a controversy was |;oing \non between Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and the Provindd \nGovernment, the latter (or the local authorities) having issued \norders prohibiting all bathing at the junction of the rivers. \nThis was objected to by Malaviyaji, as, from the religious point \nof view, the whole point was to bathe at that confluence. The \nGovernment was perfectly justified in taking precautions to pre- \nvent accidents and possible serious loss of life, but, as usual. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nit set about its work in the most wobden and irritating way \npossible. \n\nOn the big day of the Kumbh, I went down to the river early \nin the morning to see the mela, with no intention of bathing. \nOn arrival at the river bank, I learnt that Malaviyaji had sent \nsome kinti of polite ultimatum to the District Magistrate, ask- \ning him fer permission to bathe at the Triveni. Malaviyaji was \nagitated, and the atmosphere was tense. The Magistrate refused \npermission. TTbiereupon Malaviyaji decided to offer Satyagraha, \nand, accompanied by about two hundred others, he marched \ntowards the junction of the rivers. I was interested in these \ndevelopments and, on the spur of the moment, joined the \nSatyagraha band. A tremendous barrier had been erected right \nacross the open space, to keep away people from the confluence. \nWhen we reached this high palisade, we were stopped by the \npolice, and a ladder we had was taken aw^ from us. Being \nnon-violent Satyagrahis, we sat down peacefully on the sands \nnear the palisade. And there we sat for the whole morning and \npart of the afternoon. Hour after hour went by, the sim became \nstronger, the sand hotter, and all of us hungrier. Foot and \nmounted police stood by on both sides of us. I think the \nregular cavalry was also there. Most of us grew impatient, and \nsaid that something should be done. I believe the authorities \nalso grew impatient, and decided to force the pace. Some order \nwas given to the cavalry, who mounted their horses. It struck \nme ^ do not know if I was right) that they were going to \ncharge us and drive us away in this fashion. I did not fency \nthe idea of being chased by mounted troopers, and, anyhow, \nI was fed up with sitting there. So I suggested to those sitting \nnear me that we might as well cross over the palisade, and \nI motmted it. Immediately scores of others did likewise, and \nsome even pulled out a few stakes, thus making a passage-way. \nSomebody gave me a national flag, and I stuck it on top of the \npalisade, where I continued to sit. I grew rather excited, and \nthoroughly enjoyed myself, watching the people clambering up \nor going through and the mounted troopers trying to push them \naway. I must say that the cavalry did their work as harmlessly \nas possible. They waved about thm wooden stafi^, and pushed \npeople with them, but reflrained from causing much injury. \nFaint memories of revolutionary barricades came to me. \n\nAt last I got down on the other side and, feeling very hot after \nmy exertions, decided to have a dip in the Ganges. On coming \nback, I was amazed to find that Malaviyaji and many others \nwere still sitting on the other side of the palisade as before. But \n\n\n\nCOCONADA AND M. MOHAMAD AH  \n\nthe mounted troopers and the foot police now stood shoulder \nto shoulder between the Satyagrahis and the palisade. So I \nwent (having got out by a roundabout way) and sat down again \nnear Malaviyaji. For some time we sat on, and I noticed that \nMalaviyaji was greatly agitated; he seemed to be trying to con- \ntrol some strong emotion. Suddenly, without a hint to any one, \nhe dived in the most extraordinary way through the policemen \nand the horses. For any one, that would have been a surprising \ndive, but for an old and physically weak person like Malaviyaji, \nit was astounding. Anyhow, we all followed him; we all dived. \nAfter some effort to keep us back the cavalry and the police \ndid not interfere. A little later they were withdrawn. \n\nWe half expected some proceedings to be taken against us \nby the Government, but nothing of the kind happened. Govern- \nment probably did not wish to lake any steps against Malaviyaji, \nand so the smaller fry got off too.  MY FATHER AND GANDHIJI \n\nEarly in  there came suddenly the news of the serious \nillness of Gandhiji in prison, followed by his removal to a \nhospital and an operation. India was numbed with anxiety; we \nheld our breaths almost and waited, full of fear. The crisis \npassed, and a stream of people began to reach Poona from all \nparts of the country to see him. He was still in hospital, a \nprisoner under guard, but he was permitted to see a limited \nnumber of friends. Father and I visited him in the hospital. \n\nHe was not taken back from the hospital to the prison. As \nhe xvas convalescing, Government remitted the rest of his sen- \ntence and discharged him. He had then served about two years \nout of the six years to which he had been sentenced. He went \nto Juhu, by the sea-side near Bombay, to recuperate. \n\nOhr family also trekked to Juhu, and established itself in a \ntiny little cottage by the sea. We spent some weeks there, and \nI had, after a long gap, a holiday after my heart, for I could \nindulge in swimming and running and riding on the beach. \nThe main purpose of our stay, however, was not holiday-makingi \nbut discussions with Gandhiji. Father wanted to explain to him \nthe Swarajist position, and to gain his passive co-operation at \nleast, if not his active sympathy. I was also anxious to have \nsome light thrown on the problems that were troubling me. I \nwanted to know what his future programme of action was going \nto be. \n\nThe Juhu talks, so far as the Swarajists were concerned, did \nnot succeed in winning Gandhiji, or even in influencing him to \nany extent. Behind all the friendly talk, and the courteous \ngestures, the fact remained that there was no compromise. They \nagreed to differ, and statements to this effect were issued to the \nPress. \n\nI also returned from Juhu a little disappointed, for Gandhiji \ndid not resolve a single one of my doubts. As is usual with Mm, \nhe refused to look into the future, or lay down any long-distance \npromamme. We were to carry on patiently * serving \u2019 the people, \nworking ft)r the constructive and social reform programme of \nthe Congress, and await the time for aggressive activity. The \nreal difficulty, of course, was that even when that time came, \nwould not some incident like Chauri Chaura upset all our calcu- \n\nIS \n\n\n\nMY FATHER AND GANDHIJI ' \n\nlations and again hold us up? To that he gave no answer then. \nNor was he at all definite in regard to our objective. Many of \nus wanted to be clear in our own minds what we were driving at, \nalthough the Congress did not then need to make a formal de- \nclaration on the subject. Were we going to hold out for indepen- \ndence and some measure of social change, or were our leaders \ngoing to compromise for something very much less? Only a few \nmonths before, I had stressed independence in my presidential \naddress at the U.P. Provincial Conference. This Conference was \nheld in the autumn of , a little after my return from Nabha. \nI was just recovering from the illness with which Nabha Gaol had \npresented me and I was unable to attend the Conference; but my \naddress, written under fever in bed, went to it. \n\nWhile some of us wanted to make the issue of independence \nclear in the Congress, our friends the Liberals had drifted so far \nfrom us \u2014 or perhaps the drifting had been done by us \u2014 that they \npublicly gloried in the pomp and power of the Empire, although \nthat Empire might treat our countrymen as a doormat, and its \ndominions keep our countrymen as helots or refuse them all \nadmittance. Mr. Sastri had become an Imperial Envoy, and Sir \nTej Bahadur Sapru had proudly declared at the Imperial Con- \nference in London in : \"I can say with pride that it is my \ncountry that makes the Empire imperial.\u201d \n\nA vast ocean seemed to separate us from these Liberal leaders; \nwe lived in different worlds, we spoke in different languages, and \nour dreams \u2014 ^if they ever had dreams \u2014 ^had nothing in common. \nWas it not necessary then to be clear and precise about our goal? \n\nBut such thoughts were then confined to a few. Precision is not \nloved by most people, especially in a nationalist movement which \nby its very nature is vague and somewhat mystical. In the early \nmonths of , public attention was largely concentrated on the \nSwarajists in the Legislative Assembly and the Provincial Coun- \ncils. Wiat were these groups going to do after their brave talk \nabout \"opposition from within\u201d and wrecking the Councils? \nSome fine gestures took place. The budget for the year was re- \njected by the Assembly; a resolution demanding a round-table \ndiscussion to settle the terms of Indian freedom was passed. The \nBengal Council, under Deshbandhu\u2019s leadership, also bravely \nvoted down supplies. But both in the Assembly and in the pro- \n\u2022vinces, the Viceroy or the Governor certified the budgets and \nthey became law. There were some speeches, some excitement \nin the legislatures, a momentary feeling of triumph among the \nSwarajists, headlines in the Press, and nothing more. What else \ncould they do? Tltey could repeat their tactics, but the novelty. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwore oftj the excitement vanished, and the public mind grew \naccustomed to budgets and laws being certified by tlie Viceroy \nor Governor, The next step, of course, was beyond the compe- \ntence of the Swarajists inside the Councils. It lay outside the \nCouncil chamber. \n\nSome time in the middle of that year () a meeting of the \nAll-India Congress Committee was held at Ahmedabad. At this \nmeeting, unexpectedly, a sharp conflict appeared between \nGandhiji and the Swarajists, and there were some dramatic situa- \ntions. The initiative was taken by Gandhiji. He proposed a fun- \ndamental alteration in the Congress constitution, changing the \nfranchise and the rules for membership. So far, every one who \nsubscribed to the first article of the Congress constitution, which \nlaid down the objective of Swaraj and peacefiil methods, and \npaid four annas could become a member. He now wanted to \nlimit membership to those who gave a certain amount of self- \nspun yam instead of the four annas. This was a serious limita- \ntion of the franchise, and the A.I.C.C. was certainly not com- \npetent to do this. But Gandhiji has seldom cared for the letter \nof a constitution when this has come in his way, I was shocked \nat what I considered a violence to oin constitution, and I offered \nto the Working Committee my resignation from the secretary- \nship. But some new developments took place and I did not press \nit. In the A.I.C,C. the proposal was fiercely resisted by my father \nand Mr. Das, and ultimately, to show their entire disapproval of \nit, they marched out with a goodly number of their followers \njust before the voting. Even then some people, opposed to the \nresolution, still remained present in the Committee. The resolu- \ntion was passed by a majority, but ultimately it was withdrawn. \nFor Gandhiji had been tremendously affected by the walk-out \nof the Swarajists and the unbending attitude on this subject of \nDeshbandhu and my father. He was emotionally wo rked up . \nand a chance remark of a member upset him and he broae \ndo^. It was obvious that he had been cut to the quick. He \naddressed the Committee in a most feeling inanner and reduced \na number of members to tears. It was a moving and extra- \nordinary sight.* \n\n* The above account was written in prison from memory. I find \nnow that my memory was defective antf I had overlooked an impor- \ntant aspect of the A.I.C.C. discussions, thus giving a wrong impres- \nsion of what happened. What moved Gandhiji was a resolution \nrelating to a , young Bengali terrorist (Gopinath Saha) which was \nmoved m the meeting and was ultimately lost. The resolution, so \ntar as I remember, condemned his deed but expressed sympathy for \n\n\n\nMY FATHER AND GANDHIJI  \n\nI could never make out why he was so keen on that exclusive \nform of spuming franchise then, for he must have known that it \nwould be bitterly opposed. Probably he wanted the Congress to \nconsist only of people who were believers in his constructive \nprogramme of Khadi, etc., and was prepared to drive out the \nothers or make them conform. But although he had the majority \nwith him, he weakened in his resolve and began to compromise \nwith the others. During the next three or four months, to my \namazement, he changed several times on this question. He \nseemed to be completely at sea, unable to find his bearings. That \nwas the one idea that I did not associate with him, and hence \nmy surprise. The question itself was not, so it seemed to me, a \nvery vital one. The idea of labour being made the qualification \nfor franchise was a very desirable one, but in the restricted form \nin which it came up, it lost some of its meaning. \n\nI came to the conclusion that Gandhiji\u2019s difficulties had been \ncaused because he was moving in an unfamiliar medium. He was \nsuperb in his special field of Satyagrahic direct acdon, and his \ninstinct unerringly led him to take the right steps. He was also \n\n\nhis motives. More than the resolution itself, the speeches accom- \npanying it distressed Gandhiji, and it was this feeling that many \npeople in the Congress were not serious about its profession of non- \nviolence that upset him. Writing of this meeting in Young India \nsoon after, he said : \" I had a bare majority always for the four reso- \nlutions. But it must be regarded by me as a minority. The house \nwas fairly evenly divided. The Gopinath Saha resolution clinched \nthe issue. The speeches, the result and the scenes I wimessed after \nwere a perfect eye-opener. . . . Dignity vanished after the Gopinath \nSaha resolution. It was before this house that  had to put my last \nresolution. As the proceedings went on, I must have become more \nand more serious. I felt like runifing away from the oppressive scene. \nI dreaded having to move a resolution m my charge. ... I do not \nknow ffiat  have made it dear that no speaker had any malice in \nhim. What preyed upon my mind was the fact of unconsdous \nirresponsibility and disregard of the Congress creed or policy of non- \nviolence. . . . That there were seventy Congress representatives to \nsupport the resolution was a staggering levdation.\u201d This inddent, \n\u2022with Gandhiji\u2019s commentary on it, is vary agnificant, as it shows \nthe extreme importance attached by Gan&ji to non-violence, and \nthe reactions on him of any attempt, even though this might be \nunconsdous and indirect, to challenge it. Much that he has subse- \nquently done is probably due fundamentally to some such reactions. \nNon-violence has been, and is, the sheet-anchor of his policy and \nartivitie\" \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nvery good in working himself and making others work quietly \nfor social reform among the masses. He could understand abso- \nlute war or absolute peace. Anything in between he did not \nappreciate. The Swarajist programme, of struggle and opposi- \ntion inside Councils, left him cold. If a person wants to go to \nthe legislature, let him do so with the object of co-operating \nwith the authorities for better legislation, etc., and not for the \nsake of opposition. If he does not want to do so, let him stay \nout. The Swarajists adopted neither of these positions, and hence \nhis difficulty in dealing with them. \n\nUltimately he adjusted himself to them. Tlie spinning fran- \nchise became an alternative form, the old four-anna fianchise \nremaining. He almost blessed the Swarajist work in the legis- \nlatures, but for himself he kept severely aloof. It was said that \nhe had retired from politics, and the British Government and its \nofficers believed that his popularity was waning and that he was \na spent force. Das and Nehru, it was said, had driven Gandhi \ninto the badkground; they seemed to dominate the political \nscene. Such remarks, with suitable variations, have been repeated \nmany times in the course of the last fifteen years, and they have \ndemonstrated evety time how singularly ignorant our rulers are \nabout the feelings of the Indian people. Ever since Gandhiji \nappeared on the Indian political scene, there has been no going \nback in popularity for him, so far as the masses are concerned. \nThere has been a progressive increase in his popularity, and this \nprocess still continues. They may not carry out his wishes, for \nhuman nature is often weak, but Aeir hearts are full of goodwill \nfor him. When objective conditions help they rise in huge mass \nmovements, otherwise they lie low. A leader does not create a \nmass movement out of nothing, as if by a stroke of the magi- \ncian\u2019s wand. He can take advantage of the conditions themsdves \nwhen they arise; he can prepare for them, but not create them. \n\nBut it is true to say that there is a waning and a waxing of \nGandhiji\u2019s popularity among the intelligentsia. In moments of \nforward-going enthusiasm they follow him; when the inevitable \nreaction comes they grow criticaL But even so the great majority \nof them bow down to him. Partly this has been due to the \nabsence of any other effective programme. The Liberals and \nvarious groups resembling them, like the Responsivists, do not \ncount; those who believe in terroristic violence are completely \nout of court in the modem world and are considered ineffective \n,and out of date. The socialist programme is still little known, \nand it ftightens the upper-class members of the Congress. \n\nAfter a brief political estrangement in the middle of , the \n\n\n\nMi jjATHJiR ANiJ GANDHIJI  \n\nold relations between my father and Gandhiji were resumed and \nthey grew even more cordial. However much they differed from \none another, each had the warmest regard and respect for the \nother. What was it that they so respected? Father has given us \na glimpse into his mind in a brief Foreword he contributed to a \nbooklet called Thought Currents, containing selections horn \nGandhi ji\u2019s writings : \n\n\" I have heard,\u201d he writes, \u201c of saints and supermen, hut have \nnever had the pleasure of meeting them, and must confess to a \nfeeling of scepticism about their real existence. I believe in men \nand things manly. The \u2018 Thought Currents \u2019 preserved in this \nvolume have emanated fiom a man and are things manly. They \nare illustrative of two great attributes of human nature \u2014 ^Faith \nand Strength. . . . \n\n\u201c \u2018 What is all this going to lead to? ' asks the man with neither \nfaith nor strength in him. The answer \u2018 to victory or death ' does \nnot appeal to him. . . . Meanwhile the humble and lowly figure \nstanding erect ... on the firm footholds of faith unshakable \nand strength imconquerable, continues to send out to his country- \nmen his message of sacrifice and suffering for the motherland. \nThat message finds echo in millions of hearts. . . .\u201d \n\nAnd he finishes up by quoting Swinburne\u2019s lines : \n\nHave we not men with us royal. \n\nMen the masters of things? . . . \n\nEvidently he wanted to stress the fact that he did not admire \nGandhiji as a saint or a Mahatma, but as a man. Strong and \nunbending himself, he admired strength of spirit in him. For it \nwas dear that this little man of poor physique had something \nof steel in him, sometliing rock-like which did not yield to \nphysical powers, however great they might be. And in spile of \nhis unimpressive features, his Ioin<ioth and bare body, there was \na royalty and a kingiigess in him which compelled a willing \nobdsance fiom others. Consdously and deliberately meek and \nhumble, yet he was full of power and authority, and he knew it, \nand at times he was imperious enough, issuing commands which \nhad to be obeyed. His calm, deep eyes would hold one and \ngently probe into the depfhs; his voice, clear and limpid, would \npurr its way into the heart and evoke an emotional response. \nWhether his audience consisted of one person or a thousand, the \ncharm and magnetism of the man passed on to it, and each one \nhad a &eling of communion with the speaker. This feeling had \nlittle to do with the mind, though the appeal to the mind was \nnot wholly ignored. But mind and reason definitely had second \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nplace. This process of \u2018 spell-binding ' was not brought about by \noratory or the hypnotism of silken phrases. The language was \nalways simple and to the point and seldom was an unnecessary \nword used. It was the utter sincerity of the man and his person- \nality that gripped; he gave the impression of tremendous inner \nreserves of power. Perhaps also it was a tradition that had grown \nup about him which helped in creating a suitable atmosphere. \nA stranger, ignorant of this tradition and not in harmony with \nthe surroundings, would probably not have been touched by \nthat spell, or, at any rate, not to the same extent. And yet one \nof the most remarkable things about Gandhiji was, and is, his \ncapacity to win over, or at least to disarm, his opponents. \n\nGandhiji had litde sense of beauty or artistry in man-made \nobjects, though he admired natural beauty. The Taj Mahal was \nfor him an embodiment of forced labour and little more. His \nsense of smell was feeble. And yet in his own way he had dis- \ncovered the art of living and had made of his life an artistic \nwhole. Every gesture had meaning and grace; without a false \ntouch. There were no rough edges or sharp corners about him, \nno trace of vulgarity or commonness, in which, unhappily, our \nmiddle classes excel. Having found an inner peace, he radiated \nit to others and marched tlirough life\u2019s tortuous ways with firm \nand undaunted step. \n\nHow different was my father from him  But in him too there \nwas strength of personality and a measure of kingliness, and the \nlines of Swinburne he had quoted would apply to him also. In \nany gathering in which he was present he would inevitably be \nthe centre and the hub. Whatever the place where he sat at table \nit would become, as an eminent English judge said later, the \nhead of the table. He was neither meek nor mild, and, again \nunlike Gandhiji, he seldom spared those who differed firom him , \nConsciously imperious, he evoked great loyalty as well as bitter \nopposition. It was difficult to feel neutral about him; one had to \nlike him or dislike him. With a broad forehead, tight lips and a \ndetermined chin, he had a marked resemblance to the busts of \nthe Roman Emperors in the museums in Italy. Many friends in \nItaly who saw his photograph with us remarked on this resem- \nblance. In later years especially, when his head was covered with \nsilver hair\u2014 unlike me, he kept his hair to the end\u2014 -there was a \nmagmficence about him and a grand manner, which is sadly to \nseek in this world of to-day. I suppose I am partial to him, but \nI miss his noble presence in a world full of pettiness and weak- \nness. I look round in vain for that grand manner and splendid \nstrength that was his. r \u00ab \n\n\n\nMY FATHER AND GANDHIJI I \n\nI remember showing Gandhiji a photograph of father\u2019s some \ntime in , when he was having a tug-of-war with the Swaraj \nParty. In this photograph father had no moustache, and, till \nthen, Gandhiji had always seen him with a fine moustache. He \nstarted almost on seeing this photograph and gazed long at it, \nfor the absence of the moustache brought out the hardness of \nthe mouth and the chin, and he said, widi a somewhat dry smile, \nthat now he realised what he had to contend against, Ine face \nwas softened, however, by the eyes and by the lines that frequent \nla^hter had made. But sometimes the eyes glittered. \n\nfather had taken to the work in the Assembly like a duck to \nwater. It suited his legal and constitutional training, and, unlike \nSatyagraha and its offshoots, he knew the rules of this game. \nHe kept his party strictly disciplined and even induced other \ngroups and individuals to give support. But soon he had to face \ndifficulties with his own people. During the early days of the \nSwaraj Party, it had to contend against the No-changers in the \nCongress, and many undesirables were taken in to increase its \nstrength within the Congress. Then came the elections, and these \ndemanded funds which had to come from the rich. So these rich \nfolk had to be kept in good humour, and some were even asked \nto become Swarajist candidates. \u201cPolitics,\u201d says an American \nsocialist (quoted by Sir Stafforcl Cripps), \"is the gentle art of \ngetting votes from the poor and campaign funds from the rich \nby promising to protect each fixim the other.\u201d \n\nAll these elements weakened the Party from the very begin- \nning. Work in the Assembly and the Councils necessitated daily \ncompromises with other and more moderate groups, and no \ncrusading spirit or principles could long survive this. Gradually a \ndecline in the discipline and temper of the Party set in, and the \nweaker elements and the opportunists began to give trouble. The \nSwaraj Party had invaded the legislatures \u2022 with the declared \nobject of \u201c opposition from within But two could play at this \ngame, and the Government decided to have a hand in it by \ncreating opposition and disruption within the ranks of the \nSwarajists. High office and patronage in innumerable ways was \nplaced in the way of the westker brethren. They had just to pick \nthem up. Their ability and their qualities of statesmanship and \nsweet reasonableness were praised. A pleasant and agreeable \natmosphere was created round them \u2014 so different from the dust \nand tumult of the field and market-place. \n\nThe general tone of the Swarajists went down. Individuals \nhere and there began to slip away to the other side. My father \nshouted and thundered and talked about cutting \u2018 the mscased \n\n\n\n^ JAWAIIARLAL NEHRU \n\nlimb But this threat has no great eflfect when the limb is eager \nto walk away by itself. Some Swarajists became ministers, some \nbecame Executive Councillors in the provinces later. A number \nformed a separate group calling themselves ' Responsivists \u2019 or \n\u2018Responsive Co-operators\u2019, a name ori^nally used by Loka- \nmanya Tilak in entirely different circumstances. As used now it \nseemed to mean : take a job when you have the chance and make \nthe best of it. The Swaraj Party carried on in spite of these \ndefections, but father and Mr. Das became a little disgusted with \nthe turn of events and somewhat weary of what seemed to be \ntheir profitless work in the legislatures. To add to this weariness \nof spirit was the growing Hindu-Muslim tension in North India, \nleading occasionally to riots. \n\nSome Congressmen who had been to prison with us in  \nand ipaa were now ministers and holders of high offices in the \nGovernment. In  we had had the satisfaction of being de- \nclared unlawful and being sentenced to prison by a Government \nof which some Liberals (also old-time Congressmen) were mem- \nbers. In future we were going to have the additional solace of \nbeing imprisoned and outlawed by some of our own old col- \nleagues in some provinces at least. These new ministers and \nExecutive councillors were far more efficient for this job than the \nLiberals had been. They knew us and our weaknesses and how \nto exploit them; they were well acquainted with our methods; \nand they had some e^erience of crowds and the feelings of \nthe masses. Like the Nazis, they had flirted with revolutionary \nmethods before changing sides, and could apply this knowledge \nto suppress more efficiently their old colleagues of the Congress \ntlian either the official hierarchy or the Liberal ministers in their \nignorance could have done. \n\nIn December  the Congress session was held at Belgaum, \nand Gandliiji was President. For him to become the Congress \nPresident was something.in the nature of an anticlimax, for he \nhad long been the permanent super-president. I did not like his \npresidential address. It struck me as being very uninspiring. At \nthe end of the session I was again elected, at Gandhiji\u2019s instance, \nthe working secretary of the A.I.G.C. for the next year. In spite \nof my own wishes in the matter, I was gradually becoming a \nsemi-permanent secretary of the Congress. \n\nIn the summer of  my father was unwell and his asthma \ntroubled him greatly. He went vnth the family to Dalhousie in \nthe Himalayas, and I joined him for a short while later; We \nmade a Uttle trip from Dalhousie to Chamba in the interior of \nthe Himalayas. It was a June day when we arrive^ and we were \n\n\n\nMY FATHF.R AND GANDIIIJI  \n\na little tired after our journey by mountain paths. A telegram \ncame. It told us that Chitta Ranjan Das had died. For a long \ntime father sat .still without a word, bowed down with grief. It \nwas a cruel blow to him, and I had seldom seen him so affected. \nThe one person who had grown to be a closer and dearer comrade \nto him than any one else had suddenly gone and left him to \nshoulder the burden alone. That burden had been growing, and \nboth he and Deshbandhu had grown aweary of it and of the \nweakness of their people. Deshbandhu\u2019s last speech at the \nFaridpur Conference was the speech of a person who is a little \ntired. \n\nWe left Chamba the next morning and tramped back over the \nmountains to Dalhousie, and from there to the distant railhead \nby car, and then to Allahabad and Calcutta.  COMMUNALISM RAMPANT \n\nMy illness in the autumn of . after my return from Nabha \nprison, when I had a bout with the typhus germ, was a novel \nexperience for me. I was unused to illness or lying in bed with \nfever or physical weakness. I was a little proud of my health, \nand I objected to the general valetudinarian attitude that was \nfairly common in India. My youth aiid good constitution pulled \nme through, but, after the crisis was over, I lay long in bed in an \nenfeebled condition, slowly working my way to health. And \nduring this period I felt a strange detachment from my surround- \nings and my day-to-day work, and I' viewed all this from a \ndistance, apart. I felt as if I had extricated myself from the trees \nand could see the wood as a whole; my mind seemed clearer and \nmore peaceful than it had previously been. I suppose this experi- \nence, or something like it, is common enough to those who have \npassed through severe illness. But for me it was in the nature of \na spiritual experiencc-^I use the word not in a narrow religious \nsense \u2014 and it influenced me considerably. I felt lifted out or the \nemotional atmosphere of our politics and could view the objec- \ntives and the springs that had moved me to action more clearly. \nWith this clarification came further questioning for which I had \nno satisfactory answer. But more and more I moved away from \nthe religious outlook on life and politics. I cannot write much \nabout that experience of mine; it was a feeling I cannot easily \nexpress. It was eleven years ago, and only a faded impression \nof it remains in the mind now. But I remember'well that it \nhad 'a lasting effect on me and on my way of thinking, and for \nthe next two years or more I went about my work with some-' \nthing of that aif of detachment. \n\nPardy, no doubt, this was due to developments which were \nwholly outside my control and with which I did not fit in. I have \nreferred already to some of the political dianges. Far more im- \nportant was die progressive deterioration of Hindu-Mudim \nrelations, in North India especially. In the bigger cities a nunaber \nof riots took place, brutal and callous in die extreme. The \natmosphere of distrust and anger bred new causes of dispute \nwhich most of us had never heard of before. Previously a fruitful \nsource of discord had been the question of cow sacrifice, especi- \nally on the Baki^id day. There was also tension when Hindu and \n\nm \n\n\n\nCOMMUNALISM RAMPANT  \n\nMuslim festivals clashed, as, for instance, when the Moharrara \nfell on the days when the Ram Lila was celebrated. The Mohar- \nram revived the memory of a past tragedy and brought sorrow \nand tears; the Ram Lila was a festival of joy and the celebration \nof the victory of good over evil. The two did not fit in. For- \ntunately they came together only once in about thirty years, for \nthe Ram Lila is celebrated according to the solar calendar at a \nfixed time of the year, while the Moharram moves round the \nseasons, following a lunar year. \n\nBut now a fresh cause of fnction arose, something that was \never present, ever recurring. This was the question of music \nbefore mosques. Objection was taken by the Muslims to music \nor any noise which interfered with their prayers in their \nmosques. In every city there are many mosques, and five times \nevery day they have prayers, and there is no lack of noises and \nprocessions (including marriage and funeral processions). So the \nchances of friction were always present. In particular, objection \nwas taken to processions and noises at the time of the sunset \nprayer in the mosques. As it happens, this is just the time when \nevening worship takes place in the Hindu temples, and gongs \nare sounded and the temple bells ring. Arti, this is called, and \narti-namaz disputes now assumed major proportions. \n\nIt seems amazing that a question which could be settled with \nmutual consideration for each other\u2019s feelings and a little adjust- \nment should give rise to great bitterness and rioting. But reli- \ngious passions have little to do with reason or consideration or \nadjustments, and they are easy to fan when a third party in \ncontrol can play oflT one group against another. \n\nOne is apt to exaggerate the sigiuficance of these riots in a few \nnorthern cities. Most of the towns and cities and the whole of \nrural India carried on peacefully, little affected by these happen- \nings, but the newspapers, naturally gave great prominence to \nevery petty communal disturbance. It is perfectly true, however, \nthat communal tension and bitterness increased in the city \nmasses. This was pushed on by the communal leaders at the \ntop, and it was reflected in the stiffening up of the political \ncommunal demands. Because of the communal tension, Muslim \npolitical reactionaries, who had taken a back seat during all these \nyears of non-co-operation, emerged into prominence, helped in \nthe process by the British Government. From day to day new \nand more fer-reaching communal demands appeared on their \nbehalf, striking at the very root of national unitf and Indian \nfreedom. On the Hindu side also political reactionaries were \namong the principal communal leaders, and, iik the name of \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nguarding Hindu interests, they played definitely into the hands \nof the Government. They did not succeed, and indeed they \ncould not, however much they tried by. their methods, in gaining \nany of the points on which they laid stress ; they succeeded only \nin raising the communal temper of the country. \n\nThe Congress was in a quandary. Sensitive to and represen- \ntative of national feeling as it was, these communal passions were \nbound to affect it. Many a Congressman was a communalist \nunder his national cloak. But the Congress leadership stood firm \nand, on the whole, refused to side with either communal party, \nor rather with any communal group, for now the Sikhs and other \nsmaller minorities were also loudly voicing their particular \ndemands. Inevitably this led to denunciation from both the \nextremes. \n\nLong ago, right at the commencement of non-co-operation or \neven earlier, Gandhiji had laid down his formula for solving the \ncommunal problem. According to hiiti, it could only be solved \nby goodwill and the generosity of the majority group, and so he \nwas prepared to agree to everything that the Muslims might \ndemand. He wanted to win them over, not to bargain with them. \nWith foresight and a true sense of values he grasped at the \nreality that was worth while; but others who thought they knew \nthe market price of everything, and were ignorant of the true \nvalue of anything, stuck to the methods of the market-place. \nThey saw the cost of purchase tvith painful clearness, but they \nhad no appreciation of the worth of the article they might have \nbought. \n\nIt is easy to criticise and blame others, and the temptation is \nalmost irresistible to find some excuse for the failure of one\u2019s \nplans. Was not the failure due to the deliberate thwarting of \nothers, rather than to an error in one\u2019s own way of thinking or \nacting? We cast the blame on the Govenmient and the com- \nmtmalists, the latter blame tlie Congress. Of course, there was \nthwarting of us, deliberate and persistent thwarting, by the \nGovernment and their allies. Of course, British governments in \nthe' past and the present have based their policy on creating \ndivisions in our raius. Divide and rule has always been the way \nof empires, and the measure of their success in this policy has \nbeen also the measure of their superiority over those whom they \nthus exploit. We cannot complain of this or, at any rate, w\u00ab \nought not to be surprised at it. To ignore it and not to provide \nagainst it is in itself a mistake in one's thought. \n\nHow are we to provide against it? Not surely by bargaining \nand haggling and generally adopting ihe tactics of the market \n\n\n\nCOMMUNALISM RAMPANT J \n\nplace, for whatever oiFer we make, however high our bid might \nbe, there is always a third party which can bid higher and, what \nis more, give substance to its w\u2019ords. If there is no common \nnational or social outlook, there will not be common action \nagainst the common adversary. If we think in terms of the \nexisting political and economic structure and merely wish to \ntamper with it here and there, to reform it, to 'Indianise\u2019 it, \nthen all real inducement for joint action is lacking. The object \nthen becomes one of sharing in the spoils, and the third and \ncontrolling party inevitably plays the dominant r  e and hands \nout its gifts to the prize boys of its choice. Only by thinking in \nterms of a different political framework \u2014 ^and even more so a \ndifferent social framework \u2014 can we build up a stable foundation \nfor joint action. The whole idea underlying the demand for in- \ndependence was this: to make people realise that we were \nstruggling for an entirely different political structure and not just \nan Indianised edition (with British control behind the scenes) of \nthe present order, which Dominion Status signifies. Political in- \npendence meant, of course, political freedom only, and did not \ninclude any social change or economic freedom for the masses. \nBut it did dgnify the removal of the financial and economic \nchains which bind us to the City of London, and this would \nhave made it easier for us to change the social structure. So I \nthought then. I would add now that I do not think it is likely \nthat real political freedom will come to us by itself. When it \ncomes it will bring a large measure of social freedom also. \n\nBut almost all our leaders continued to think within the narrow \nsteel frame of the existing political, and of course the social, \nstructure. They faced every problem \u2014 communal or constitu- \ntional\u2014 with this background and, inevitably, they played into \nthe hands of the British Government, which controlled com- \npletely that struemre. They could not do otherwise, for their \nwhole outlook was essentially reformist and not revolutionary, \nin spite of occasional experiments with direct action. But the \ntime had gone by when any political or economic or communal \nproblem in India could be satisfactorily solved by reformist \nmethods. Revolutionary outlook and planning and revolutionary \nsolutions were demanded by the situation. But there was no one \namong the leaders to ofrer these. \n\nThe want of dear ideals and objectives in our struggle for \nfreedom undoubtedly helped the spread of communalism. The \nmasses saw no clear connection between their day-to-day suffer- \nings and the fight for swaraj. They fought well enough at times \nby instinct, but that was a feeble weapon whidi could be easily \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nblunted or even turned aside for other purposes. There was no \nreason behind it, and in peribds of reaction it was not difficult \nfor the communalists to play upon this feeling and exploit it in \nthe name of religion. It is nevertheless extraordinary how the \nbourgeois classes, both among the Hindus and the Muslims, suc- \nceeded, in the sacred name of religion, in getting a measure of \nmass sympathy and support for programmes and demands \nwhich had absolutely nothing to do with the masses, or even the \nlower middle class. Every one of the communal demands put \nforward by any communal group is, in the final analysis, a \ndemand for jobs, and these jobs could only go to a handful of \nthe upper middle class. There is also, of course, the demand for \nspecial and additional seats in the legislatures, as symbolising \npolitical power, but this too is looked upon chiefly as the power \nto exercise patronage. These narrow political demands, benefit- \ning at the most a small number of the upper middle classes, and \noften creating barriers in the way of national unity and progress, \nwere cleverly made to appear the demands of the masses of that \nparticular religious group. Religious passion was hitched on to \nthem in order to hide their barrenness. \n\nIn this way political reactionaries came back to the political \nfield in the guise of communal leaders, and the real explanation \nof the various steps they took was not so much their communal \nbias as their desire to obstruct political advance. We could only \nexpect opposition from them politically, but still it was a pecu- \nliarly distressing feature of an unsavoury situation to find to \nwhat lengths they would go in this respect. Muslim communal \nleaders said the most amazing things and seemed to care not at \nall for Indian nationalism or Indian freedom; Hindu communal \nleaders, though always speaking apparently in the name of \nnationalism, had little to do with it in practice and, incapable of \nany real action, sought to humble themselves before the Govern- \nment, and did that too in vain. Both agreed in condemning \nsocialistic and such-like \"subversive\u201d movements; there was a \ntouching unanimity in regard to any proposal affecting vested \ninterests. Muslim communal leaders said and did many things, \nharmful to political and econormc freedom, but as a group and \nindividually they conducted themselves before the Government \nand the public with some dignity. That could hardly be said of \nthe Hindu communal leaders. \n\nThere were many Muslims in the Congress, Thdr numbers \nwere large, and included many able men, and the best-known \nand mopt popular Muslim leaders in India were in it. Many of \nthose Congress Muslims organised themselves into a group called \n\n\n\ncommunalism rampant  \n\nthe * Nationalist Muslim Party and they combated the com- \nmunal Muslim leaders. They did so with some success to begin \nwith, and a large part of the Muslim intelligentsia seemed to be \nwith them. But they were all upper middle-class folk, and there \nwere no dynamic personalities amongst them. They took to their \nprofessions and their businesses, and lost touch with the masses. \nIndeed, they never went to their masses. Their method was one \nof drawing-room meetings and mutual arrangements and pacts, \nand at this game their rivals, the communal leaders, were greater \nadepts. Slowly the latter drove the Nationalist Muslims from \none position to another, made them give up, one by one, the \nprinciples for which they stood. Always the Nationalist Muslims \ntried to ward oiF further retreat and to consolidate their position \nby adopting the policy of the \u2018 lesser evil \u2019, but always this led \nto another retreat and another choice of the \u2018 lesser evil There \ncame a time when they had nothing left to call their own, no \nfundamental principle on which they stood except one, and \nthat had been the very sheet-anchor of their group: joint \nelectorates. But again the policy of the lesser evil presented the \nfatal choice to them, and they emerged from the ordeal minus \nthat sheet-anchor. So to-day they stand divested of every shred \nof principle or practice on the basis of which they formed their \ngroup, and which they had proudly nailed to their masthead\u2014 \nof everything, all, except their namel \n\nThe collapse and elimination of the Nationalist Muslims as \na group \u2014 as individuals they are, of course, still important \nleaders of the Congress \u2014 ^forms a pitiful story. It took many \nyears, and the last chapter has only been written this year \n(). In  and subsequent years they were a strong group, \nand they took up an aggressive attitude against the Muslim \ncommunalists. Indeed, on several occasions, Gandhiji was pre- \npared to agree to some of the latter\u2019s demands, much as he \ndisliked them, but his own collea^es, the Muslim Nationalist \nleaders, prevented this and were bitter in their opposition. \n\nDuring the .middle 'twenties many attempts were made to \nsettle the communal problem by mutual talks and discussions \u2014 \n\u2018Unity Conferences' they were called. The most notable of \nthese was the conference convened by M. Moham&d Ali, the \nCongress president for the year, in , and held in Delhi under \nthe shadow of Gandhiji\u2019s twenty-one-day fast. There were many \nearnest and well-meaning people at these conferences, and they \ntried hard to come to an agreement. Some pious and good \nresolutions were passed, .but the basic problem remained un- \nsolved. It could hot be solved by those conferences, for a solution \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ncould not be reached by a majority of votes but by virtual \nunanimity, and there were always extremists of various groups \npresent whose idea of a solution was a complete submission of \nall others to their views. Indeed, one was led to doubt whether \nsome of the prominent communalists desired a solution at all. \nMany of them were political reactionaries, and there was no \ncommon ground between them and those who desired radical \npolitical change. \n\nBut the real difficulties went deeper and were not just the \nresult of Individual back-sliding. The Sikhs were now loudly \nadvancing their communal demands, and an extraordinarily \ncomplicated triangle was created in the Punjab. The Punjab, \nindeed, became the crux of the matter, and the fear of each \ngroup of the others produced a background of passion and \nprejudice. In some provinces agrarian trouble \u2014 Hindu zamin- \ndars and Muslim tenants in Bengal\u2014 appeared under communal \nguise. In the Punjab and Sind, the banker and richer classes' \ngenerally were Hindus, the debtors were Muslim agriculturists, \nand all the feeling of the impoverished debtors against the \ncreditor, out for his pound of flesh, went to swell the com- \nmunal tide. As a rule, the Muslims were the poorer com- \nmunity, and the Muslim communal leaders managed to exploit \nthe antagonism of the have-nots against the haves ior communal \npurposes, though, strangely enough, these purposes had nothing \nwhatever to do with the betterment of those have-nots. Because \nof this, these Muslim communal leaders did represent some \nmass elements, and gained strength thereby. The Hindu com- \nmunal leaders, in an economic sense, represented the rich banker \nand professional classes; they had little backing among the \nHindu masses although, on occasions, they had their sympathy. \n\nThe problem, therefore, is getting a little mixed up with \neconomic groupings, though uMappuy this fact is not realised. \nIt may develop into more obvious conflicts between economic \nclasses, but if that time comes, the present-day communal \nleaders, representing the upper classes of all groups, will hasten \nto patch up their differences in order to face jointly the common \nclass foe. Even under [present conditions it should not he dif- \nficult to arrive at a political solution, but only if, and it is a big \nif, the third party was not present. \n\nThe Delhi Uiiity Conference of  was hardly over when a \nI^du-Muslim riot broke out in Allahabad, It was not a big \nriot, as such riots go, in so far as casualties were concerned, hut \nit was pamful to have these troubles in one\u2019s home town. I \nrushed back with ot  \\ers from Delhi to find that the actu*'l riot- \n\n\n\ncommunalism rampant  \n\ning was over; but the aftermath, in the shape of bad blood \nand court cases, lasted a long time. I forget why the riot had \nbegun. That year, or perhaps later, there was also some trouble \nover the Ram Lila celebrations at Allahabad. Probably because \nof restrictions about music before mosques, these celebrations, \ninvolving huge processions as they did, were abandoned as a \nprotest. For about eight years now the Ram Lila has not been \nheld in Allahabad, and the greatest festival of the year for htm- \ndreds of thousands in the Allahabad district has almost become \na painful memory. How well I remember my visits to it when \nI was a child I How excited we used to get I And the vast crowds \nthat came to see it from all over the district and even from other \ntowns. It was a Hindu festival, but it was an open-air affair, \nand Muslims also swelled the crowds, and there was joy and \nlightheartedness everywhere. Trade flourished. Many years \nafterwards when, as a grown-up, I visited it I was not excited, \nand the procession and the tableaux rather bored me. My \nstandards of art and amusement had gone up. But even then, \nI saw how the great crowds appreciated and enjoyed the show. \nIt was carnival time for them. And now, for eight or nine years, \nthe children of Allahabad, not to mention the grown-ups, have \nhad no chance of seeing this show and having a bright day of \njoyful excitement in the dull routine of their lives. And all be- \ncause of trivial disputes and conflicts I Surely religion and the \nspirit of religion have much to answer for. What kill-joys they \nhave beenl  MUNICIPAL WORK \n\nFor two years I carried on, but with an ever-increasing reluc- \ntance, with the Allahabad Municipality. My term of office as \nchairman was for three years. Before the second year was well \nbegun, I was trying to rid myself of the responsibility. I had \nliked the work, and given a great deal of my time and thought \nto it. I had met with a measure of success and gained the good- \nwill of all my colleagues. Even the Provincial Government had \novercome its political dislike of me to the extent of commend- \ning some of my municipal activities. And yet I found myself \nhedged in, obstructed and prevented from doing anything really \nworth while. \n\nIt was not deliberate obstruction on anybody\u2019s part; indeed, \nI had a surprising amount of willing co-operation. But \non the one side, there was the Government machine; on the \nother, the apathy of the members of the municipality as \nwell as the public. The whole steel-frame of municipal adminis- \ntration, as erected by Government, prevented radical growth or \ninnovation. The financial policy was such that the municipality \nwas always dependent on the Government. Most radical schemes \nof taxation or social development were not permissible under \nthe existing municipal laws. Even such schemes as were legally \npermissible had to be sanctioned by Government, and only the \noptimists, vnth a long stretch of years before them, could con- \nfidently ask for and await this sanction. It amazed me to find \nout how slowly and laboriously and inefficiently the machinery \nof Government moved when any job of social construction, or \nof nation building was concerned. There was no slowness or \ninefficiency, however, when a political opponent had to be \ncurbed or struck down. The contrast was marked. \n\nThe d^aftment of the Provindal Government dealing with \nLocal Self-government was presided over by a Minister; but, as \na rule, this presiding genius was supremely ignorant of muui- \napal a^irs or, indeed, of any public afiTaixs. Indeed, he counted \nfor little and was largely ignored by his own department, which \nws run by the permanent officials of the Indian Civil Service, \n^ese officials were influenced by the prevailing conception of \nhigh officials in India that government was primarily a police \nfunction. Some idea of authoritarian paternalism coloured this \n\n*  * \n\n\n\nMUNICIPAL VSfOiv.*. \n\n\nH \n\nconception, but there was hardly any appreciation of the neces- \nsity of social services on a large scale. \n\nGovernment is always a creditor of the municipalities, and, \nnext to the police view, it is the creditor\u2019s view that it takes of \nthem. Are the debt instalments paid regularly? Is the munici- \npality thoroughly solvent, and has it got a substantial balance in \nhand? All very necessary and relevant questions, but it is often \noverlooked that the municipality has some positive functions to \nperform\u2014 education, sanitation, etc.\u2014 and that it is not merely \nan organisation for borrowing money and paying it back at \nregular intervals. The social services provided by Indian muni- \ncipalities are few enough, but even these are curtailed where \nthere is financial stringency, and usually the first to suffer is \neducation. The ruling classes are not personally interested in \nmunicipal schools ; their children go to more up-to-date and \nexpensive private schools, often receiving grants-in-aid from the \nState. \n\nMost Indian cities can be divided into two parts : the densely \ncrowded city proper, and the widespread area with bungalows \nand cottages, each with a fairly extensive compound or garden, \nusually referred to by the English as the \u2018 Civil Lines It is in \nthese Civil Lines that the English offidals and business-men, as \nwell as many upper middle-class Indians, professional men, \nofficials, etc., live. The income of the municipality from the \ncity proper is greater than that from the Civil Line.s, but the \nexpenditure on the latter far exceeds the city expenditure. For \nthe far wider area covered by the Civil Lines requires more \nroads, and they have to he repaired, cleaned-up, watered, and \nlighted; and the drainage, the water supply, and the sanitation \nsystem have to he more widespread. The city part is always \ngrossly neglected, and, of course, the poorer parts of the '\u2022ity \nare almost ignored; it has few good roads, and most of the \nnarrow lanes are ill-lit and have no proper drainage or sanitation \nsystem. It puts up with all these disabilities patiently and seldom \ncomplains; and when it does complain, nothing much happens. \nNearly all the Big Noises and Little Noises live in the Civil \nlines. \n\nTo equalise the burden a little and to encourage improvements, \nI wanted to introduce a tax on land values. But- hardly had I \nmade the suggestion when a protest came from a Government \nofficial, I think it was the Distria Magistrate, who pointed our \nthat this would be in contravention of various enactments or. \nconditions of land tenure. Such a tax would obviously have \nfallen more heavily on the owners of the bungalows in the Civil \n\n\n\n jawahahlal nehru \n\nLines. But Government approves thoroughly of an indirect \ntax like the octroi which crushes trade, raises prices of all goods, \nincluding foodstuffs, and falls most heavily on the poor. And \nthis most unsocial and harmful levy has been the mainstay of \nmost Indian municipalities, though, I believe, it is very slowly \ndisappearing in the larger cities. ^ \n\nAs chairman of the Municipality I had thus to deal with, on \nthe one side, an impersonal authoritarian government machine \nwhich jogged along laboriously in the old ruts and obstinately \nrefused either to move faster or in a different direction; and on \nthe other, were my colleagues, the members, most of whom \nwere equally in the ruts. Some of them were idealists, and took \nto their work with enthusiasm, but taken as a whole there was \nno vision, no passion for change or betterment. The old ways \nwere good enough, why try experiments which might not come \noff? Even the idealists and enthusiasts gradually succumbed to \nthe narcotic effects of dull routine. But one subject could alwars \nbe relied upon to infuse vigour into the members \u2014 ^the subject \nof patronage and appointments. This interest did not always \nresult in greater efficiency. \n\nYear after year government resolutions and officials and some \nnewspapers criticise municipalities and local boards, and point \nout their many failings. And from this the moral is drawn that \ndemocratic institutions are not suited to India. Their failings \nare obvious enough, but little attention is mid to the frame- \nwork within whioi they have to function. This framework is \nneither democratic nor autocratic; it is a cross between the \ntwo, and has the disadvantages of both. That a central govern- \nment should have certain powers of supervision and control may \nbe admitted, but this can only fit in with a popular local body \nif the central government itsdf is democratic and responsive to \npublic needs. Where this is not so, there will either be a tussle \nbetween the two or a tame submission to the will of the central \nauthority, which thus exercises power without in any way \nshouldering responsibility. This is obviously unsatisfactory, and \nit takes away from the reality of popular control. Even the \nmembers of the Municipal Board look more to the central \nauthority than to their constituents, and the public also often \nignores the Board. Real social issues hardly ever come before \nthe Board, chiefly because they lie outside its functions, and its \nmost obvious activities are tax-collecting, which do not maV^ it \nexcessively popular. \n\nThe franchise for flbie focal bodies is also limited, and should \nbe greatly lowered and extended. Even a great city corporation \n\n\n\nMUNiCIPAL WORK \n\n\nH \n\nlike the Bombay Corporation is, I believe, elected on a very re- \nstricted franchise. Some time back a resolution asking for wider \nfranchise was actually defeated in the Corporation itself. Evi- \ndently the majority of councillors were satisfied with their lot \nand saw no reason to change it or risk it. \n\nWhatever the reasons, the fact remains that our local bodies \nare not, as a rule, shining examples of success and efficiency, \nthough they might, even so, compare with some municipalities \nin advanced democratic countries. They are not usually corrupt ; \nthey are just inefficient, and their weak point is nepotism, and \ntheir perspectives are all wrong. All this is natural enough ; for, \ndemocracy to be successful, must have a background of in- \nformed public opinion and a sense of responsibility. Instead, we \nhave an aU-pervading atmosphere of authoritarianism, and the \naccompaniments of democracy are lacking. There is no mass \neducational system, no effort to build up public opinion based \non knowledge. Inevitably public attention turns to personal or \ncommunal or other petty issues. \n\nThe main interest of Government in municipal administra- \ntion is that \u2018 politics \u2019 should be kept out. Any resolution of \nsympathy with the national movement is frowned upon; text- \nboolu which might have a nationalist flavour are not permitted \nin the municipal schools, even pictures of national leaders are \nnot allowed there. A national fla^ has to be pulled down on pain \nof suppression of the municipality. Lately a concerted attempt \u25a0 \nseems to have been made by several Provincial Governments to \nhound out Congressmen from the service of the municipal cor- \nporations and boards. Usually, pressure was enough to bring this \nabout, accompanied as it was with the threat of withholding \nvarious Government grants for municipal education or other \npurposes. But in some cases, notably that of the Calcutta Cor- \nporation,^ l^slation has been promoted to keep out all persons \nwho may have gone to prison in connection with civil dis- \nobedience or any other political movement against the Govern- \nment. The object was purely political ; there was no question \nof incompetence or unfimess for the job. \n\nThese few instances show how much freedom our municipal \nand district boards have, how little democratic they are. The \nattempt to keep out political opponents from all municipal and \nlocal services \u2014 of course they dxd not go in for direct govern- \nment service \u2014 deserves a little attention. It is esrimated that \nabout three htmdred thousand persons have gone to prison at \nvarious times during the past fourteen years; and there can he \nno doubt that, politics apart, these three hundred thousand \n\ni \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nincluded some of the most dynamic and idealistic, the most \nsocially minded and selfless people in India. They had push \nand energy and the ideal of service to a cause. They were thus \nthe best material from which a public department or utility \nservice could draw its employees. And yet Government has \nmade every effort, even to the extent of passing laws, to keep \nout these people, and so to punish them and those who sym- \npathised with them. It prefers and pushes on the lap-dog breed, \nand then complains of the inefficiency of our local bodies. And \nalthough politics are said to be outside the province of local \nbodies, Government has no objection whatever to their indulg- \ning in politics in support of itself. Teachers in local board schools \nhave been practically compelled, for fear of losing their jobs, \nto go out in the villages to do propaganda on behalf of Govern- \nment. \n\nDuring the last fifteen years Congress workers have had to face \nmany difficult positions; they have shouldered heavy responsi- \nbilities; they have, after all, combated, not without success, a \npowerful and entrenched Government. This hard course of \ntraining has given them self-reliance and efficiency and strength \nto persevere; it has provided them with the very qualities of \nwhich a long and emasculating course of authoritarian govern- \nment had deprived the Indian people. Of course, the Congress \nmovement, like all mass movements, had, and has, many un- \ndesirables\u2014 fixils, inefficients, and worse people. But I have no \ndoubt whatevCT that an average Congress worker is likely to be \nfar more efficient and dynamic than another person of aitnil^ir \nqualifications. \n\nThere is one aspect of this matter which Government and its \nadvisers perhaps do not appreciate. The attempt to deprive \nCongress workers of all jobs and to shut avenues of employ- \nment to them is welcomed by the real revolutionary. The \naverage Congressman is notoriously not a revolutionary, and \nafter a period of semi-revolutionary action he resumes his hum- \ndrum life ^d activities. He gets entangled either in his business \nor profession or in the mazes of local politics. Larger issues \n^m to fade off in his mind, and revolutionary ardour, such as \nit was, subsides. Muscle turns to fat, and spirit to a love of \nsecurity. Because of this inevitable tendency of middle-class \nworkers, it has always been the effort of advanced and revolu- \ntiona^-minded Congressmen to prevent their comrades ftom \nentering the constitutional mazes of the legislatures and the \nmeal bodies, or accepting whole-time jobs which prevent them \nfrom effective action. The Government has, however, now romp \n\n\n\nMUNICIPAL WORK \n\n\n \n\nto their help to some extent by making it a little more difEcult \nfor the Congress worker to get a job^ and it is thus likely that he \nwill retain some of his revolutionary ardour or even add to it. \n\nAfter a year or more of fnunidpal work I felt that I was not \nutilising my energies to the best advantage there. The most I \ncould do was to speed-up work and make it a little more efficient. \nI could not push through any worth-while change. I wanted to \nresign from the chairmanship, but all the members of the Board \npressed me to stay. I had received uniform kindness and courtesy \nfrom them, and I found it hard to refuse. At the end of my \nsecond year, however, I finally resigned. \n\nThis was in . In the autumn of that year my wife fell \nseriously ill, and for many months she lay in a Lucknow hospital. \nThe Congress was held that year at Cawnpore, and, somewhat \ndistracted, I rushed backwards and forwards between Allahabad, \nCawnpore, and Lucknow. (I was still General Secretary of the \nCongress.) \n\nFurther treatment in Switzerland was recommended for my \nwife. I welcomed the idea, for I wanted an excuse to go out of \nIndia myself. My mind was befogged, and no dear path was \nvisible; and I thought that, perhaps, if I was far from India I \ncould see .things in better perspective and lighten up the dark \ncomers of my mind. \n\nAt the beginning of March  we sailed, my wife, our \ndaughter and I, from Bombay for Venice. With us on the same \nboat went also my sister and brother-in-law, Ranjit S. Pandit. \nThey had planned thdr European trip long before the question \nof our going had arisen.  CONTROVERSIES IN INDIA \n\nSoon after our arrival in Switzerland, the General Strike broke \nout in England. I was vastly excited, and my sympathies were \nnaturally all on the strikers\u2019 side. The collapse of the strike, \nafter a few days, came almost as a personal blow. Some months \nlater I happened to visit England for a few days. The miners\u2019 \nstruggle was still on, and London lay in semi-darkness at night. \nI paid a brief visit to a mining area \u2014 I think it was somewhere \nin Derbyshire. I saw the haggard and pinched faces of the men \nand women and children and, more revealing still, I saw many \nof the strikers and their wives being tried in the local or coimty \ncourt. The magistrates were themselves directors or managers \nof the coal mines, and they tried the miners and sentenced them \nfor trivial offences under certain emergency regulations. One \ncase especially angered me : three or four women, with babies in \ntheir arms, were brought ^ in the dock for the offence of having \njeered at the blacklegs. Tne young mothers (and their babie^ \nwere obviously miserable and undernourished; the long struggle \nhad told upon them and enfeebled them, and embittered them \nagainst the scabs who seemed to take the bread from their \nmouths. \n\nOne reads often about class justice, and in India nothing is \ncommoner than this, but somehow I had not expected to come \nacross such a flagrant example of it in England. It came as \na shock. Another fact that I noticed with some surprise was the \ngeneral atmosphere of fear among the strikers. They had \ndefinitely been terrorised by the police and the authorities, and \nthey put up very meekly, I thought, with rather offensive treat- \nment. It is true that they were thorougjhly exhausted after a long \nstruggle, their spirit was near breaking-point, their comrades of \nother trade unions had long deserted them. But still, compared \nto the poor Indian worker, there was a world of difference. The \nBritish miners had still a powerful organisation, the sympathy \nof a nation-wide, and indeed world-wide, trade union move- \nment, publicity, and resources of many kinds. All these were \n\u2022lacking to the Indian worker. And yet that frightened and \nterrorised look in the two had a strange resemblance. \n\nIn In^a that year there were the triennial elections to the \nLegislative Assembly and the Provincial Councils. I was not \n\nIii \n\n\n\nCONTROVERSIES IN INDIA \n\n\n>  - \n\ninterested in them, but some echoes of fierce controversies \nmanaged to reach me in Switzerland. I learnt of a new party \nhaving been formed by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and \nLala Lajpat Rai to oppose the Swaraj Party or the regular Con- \ngress Party in the legislature, as it now vras. The Nationalist \nParty, this was called. I could not make out, and I stiU do not \nknow, what grounds of principle separated the new party from \nthe old. Indeed, most present-day Indian parties in the legis- \nlature are like Tweedledum and Tweedledee; no real principles \nseparate them. The Swaraj Party, for the first time, brought a \nnew and aggressive element in the Councils, and it stood for a \nmore extreme political policy than the others. But the difference \nwas one of degree, not of kind. \n\nThe new Nationalist. Party represented a more moderate out- \nlook, and was definitely more to the right than was the Swaraj \nParty. It was also wholly a Hindu party working in close co- \noperation with the Hindu Mahasabha. Pandit Malaviya\u2019s leader- \nship of it was easy to understand, for it represented as nearly as \npossible his own public attitude. He had, because of old associa- \ntions, continued to remain in the Congress, but his intellectual \noutlook was not dissimilar to that of the Liberals or Moderates. \nHe had not taken kindly to non-co-operation and the new direct \naction methods of the Congress, and had had no share in shaping \nCongress policy. Although greatly respected and always welcome \nto it, he was not really of the new Congress. He was not a mem- \nber of its small executive, the Working Committee. He did not \ncarry out the Congress mandates, especially in regard to the legis- \nlatures. He was also the most popular leader of the Hindu Maha- \nsabha, and, in regard to commimal matters, his policy differed \nfrom that of the Congress. To Congress he had that sentimental \nattachment to an organisation with which he had been con- \nnected almost from the very begnning, partly to an emotional . \npull in the direction of the freedom struggle, for he saw that the \nCongress was the only organisation doing anything effective \nabout it. His heart was thus often in the Congress camp, especi- \nallj in times of struggle; his head was in other camps. Inevitably \nthis led to a continual conflict within him, and occasionally to a \nsimultaneous attempt to march in opposite directions. The result \nwas public confusion; but nationalism is a confusing medley, and \nMalaviyaji was a nationalist alone and not concerned with \nsocial or economic change. He was, and is, a supporter of the \nold orthodox order culturally, socially, economically; the Indian \nprinces and the taluqadars and big zamindars consider him \nrightly as a benevolent friend. The sole change he desires, and \n\n\n\nIjS . JAWAHARtAL NEHRU \n\ndesires passionately, is the complete elimination of foreign \ncontrol in India. The political training and reading of his youth \nstill influence his mind greatly, and he looks upon this dynamic, \nrevolutionary, post-war world of the twentieth century with the \nspectacles of a semi-static nineteenth century, of T, H. Green \nand John Stuart Mill and Gladstone and Morley, and a three- or \nfour-thousand-year background of old Hindu culture and socio- \nlogy, It is a curious combination, brisding with contradictions, \nbut he has an amazing confidence in his own capacity to resolve \ncontradictions. His long record of public service in various fields \nfirom early youth upwards, his success in establishing a grfeat \ninstitution like the Benares Hindu University, his manifest sin- \ncerity and earnestness, his impressive oratory, and his gentle \nnature and winning personality, have endeared him to the Indian \npublic, particularly Ae Hindu public, and though many may not \nagree with him or follow him in politics, they yield him respert \nand affection. Both by his age and his long public record he is \nthe Nestor of Indian politics, but a Nestor who seems a little out \nof date, and very much out of touch, with the modern world. \nHis voice commands attention, but the language he speaks is no \nlonger understood or heeded by many. \n\nIt was natural, therefore, for Malaviyaji not to'join the Swaraj \nParty, which was too advanced politically for him and required \na disciplined adherence to the Congress policy. He wanted some- \nthing more to the right and grmer latitude, both politically and \ncommunally, and he got this in a new party, of which he was \nthe founder and leader. \n\nIt is not so easy to understand Lala Lajpat Rai\u2019s adherence to \nthis new party, though his inclination was also somewhat to the \nright as wdl as towards a more communal orientation. I bad \nmet Lalaji in Geneva that summer, and from our talks I had not \ngathered that he contemplated trddng up an aggressive attitude \nagainst the Congress Party. How this happened I have still no \nidea. But in the course of tibe election campaign, he made certain \n^gue charges, which showed how his mind had been working. \nHe accused the Congress leaders of intriguing with people out- \nside India. He further accused them of some such mtrigue in , \nestablishing a Congress branch in Kiahul. I do not tbink he ever \nspecified his charges or went into any details, in spite of repeated \nrequests. ^ \n\nI remember that when I read in the Indian papers that readbed \niM m Switzerland about Ijalaji\u2019s charges I was astounded. As \nConfess Secretary, I knew all about our organisation; I had \nmyself been instrumental in getting the Kabul Committee affili- \n\n\n\nCONTROVERSIES IN INDIA \n\n\n \n\natcd (Deshbandhu Das had taken the initiative in the matter); \nand though I did not then know (as I do not now know) the \ndetails of the charges, I could say from their general nature that \nthey could have no foundation so far as the Congress was con- \ncerned. I do not know how Lalaji was misled in the matter. He \nmay have relied on various rumours, and I think he must have \nbeen influenced by the talk he had recently had with Moulvi \nObeiduUa, although there was nothing in that talk which seemed \nextraordinary to me. But elections are extraordinary phenomena. \nThey have a curious way of upsetting tempers and ordinary \nstandards. The more I see of them the more I wonder, and a \nwholly undemocratic distaste of them grows vtithin me. \n\nBut, personalities apart, the rise of the Nationalist Party, or \nsome such party, was inevitable owing to the growing communal \ntemper of the country. On the one side, there were the Muslim \nfears of a Hindu majority; on the other side, Hindu resentment \nat being bullied, as they conceived it, by the Muslims. Many a \nHindu felt that there was too much of the stand-up-and-deliver \nabout the Muslim attitude, too much of an attempt to extort \nspecial privileges vidth the threat of going over to the other side. \nBecause of this, the Hindu Mahasabna rose to some importance, \nrepresenting as it did Hindu nationalism, Hindu communalism \nopposing h&slim communalism. The aggressive activities of the \nMahasabha acted on and stimulated stul flirther this Muslim \ncommunalism, and so action and reaction went on, and in the \n\ng rocess the communal temperature of the country went up. \n\nIssentiaUy this was a question between the majority group in the \ncountry and a big minority. But, curiously enough, in some \nparts of the country the position was reversed. In the Punjab \nand Sind the Hindus as well as the Sikhs were in a minority, the \nMuslims in a majority; and these provincial minorities had as \nmuch fear of being crushed by a hostile majority in those \nprovinces as the Muslims had in the whole of India. Or, to be \nmore accurate, the middle-class jobseekers in each group were \nafraid of being ousted by the otaier group, and to some extent \nthe holders of vested interests were afraid of radical changes \nafEecting those interests. \n\nThe Swaraj, Party suffered because of this growth of com- \nnu^hsm. Some of its Muslim'members dropped off wd joined \nthe \"communal orgahlsations, and some of its Hindu .inembers \ndrifted off to the Nationalist P^ty. Malavi^ji and Lala Lajpat \nRaimade a powerful combinarion so fer as the Hindu electorate \nwas concerned, and Lalaji had great influence in thfi\u201ePunjab> the \nstorm centre of communalism. On the side of the Swaraj Pany\" \n\n\n\nlo JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nor Congress, the chief burden of fighting the elections fell on \nmy father. C. R. Das was no longer there to share it with him. \nHe enjoyed a fight, or at any rate never shirked it, and the grow- \ning strength of the opposition made him throw all his great \nenergy into the election campaign. He received and gave hard \nblowsj little grace was shown or quarter given by either party. \nThat election left a trail of bitter memories. \n\nThe Nationalist Party met with a great measure of success, \nbut this success definitely lowered the political tone of the Legis- \nlative Assembly. The centre of gravity moved more to the right. \nThe Swaraj Party had itself been the right wing of the Congress. \nIn its attempts to add to its strength, it had allowed many a \ndoubtful person to creep in, and had suffered in quality because \nof this. The Nationalist Party followed the same policy, only \non a lowCT plane, and a motley crew of title-];iolders, big land- \nholders, industrialists and others, who had little to do with \npolitics, came into its ranks. \n\nThe end of tha.t year  was darkened by a great tragedy, \nwhich sent a thrill of horror all over India. It showed to what \ndepths communal passion could reduce our people. Swami \nShraddhanand was assassinated by a fanatic as he lay in bed. \nWhat a death for a man who had bared his chest to the bayonets \nof the Gurkhas and marched to meet their fire I Nearly eight \nyears earlier he, an Arya Samajist leader, had stood in the pulpit \nof the great Jame Musjid of Delhi and preached to a mighty \ngathering of Muslims and Hindus of unity and India\u2019s fieedom. \nAnd that great multitude had greeted him with loud cries of \nHindu-Musalman-ki-jai, and outside in the streets they had \njointly sealed that cry with their blood. And now he lay dead, \nkilled by a fellow-countryman, who thought, no doubt, that he \nwas doing a meritorious deed, which would lead him to paradise. \n\nAlways I have admired sheer physical courage, the coWge to \nface physical suffering in a good cause, even unto death. Most of \nus, I suppose, admire it, Swami Shraddhanand had an \namount of that fearlessness. His tall and stately figure, wrapped \nm a sanyKin's robe, perfectly erect in spite of advanced yms, \neyes flasbii^, sometimes a shadow of irritation ot anger at the \nwe^ess of others passing over his face\u2014 how I remember that \nvivid picture, and how often it has come back to met THE OPPRESSED MEET AT BRUSSELS \n\nTowards the end of   happened to be in Berlin, and I learnt \nthere of a forthcoming Congress of Oppressed Nationalities, \nwhich was to be held at Brussels. The idea appealed to ine, and \nI wrote home, suggesting that the Indian National Congress \nmight take official part in the Brussels Congress. My suggestion \nwas approved, and I was appointed the Indian Congress repre- \nsentative for this purpose. \n\nThe Brussels Congress was held early in February . I do \nnot know who originated the idea. Berlin was at the time a centre \nwhich attracted political exiles and radical elements from abroad; \nit was gradually catching up Paris in that respect. The Com- \nmunist element was also strong there. Ideas of some common \naction between oppressed nations inter $e, as well as between \nthem and the Labour left wing, were very much in the air. It \nwas felt more and more that ffie struggle for freedom was a \ncommon one against the thing that was imperialism, and joint \ndeliberation and, where possmle, joint acuon were desirable. \nThe colonial Powers\u2014 England, France, Italy, etc., were natur- \nally hostile to any such attempts being made, but Germany was, \nsince the War, no longer a colonial Power, and the German \nGovernment viewed wiui a benevolent neutrality the growth of \nagitation in the colonies and dependencies of other Powers. This \nwas one of the reasons which made Berlin a centre for advanced \nand disaftected elements from abroad. Among these the most \nprominent and active were the Chinese belonging to the left wing \nof the Kuo-Min-Tang, which was then sweeping across China, \nand the old feudal elements seemed to be rollmg down befere its \nirresistible advance. Even the Imperialist powers lost their \naggressive habits and minatory tone befere this new phenome- \nnon. It appeared that the solution of the problem of China's \nunity and freedom could not long be delayed. The Kuo-Min- \nTang was flushed with success, but it knew the difficulties that \nlay ahead, and it wanted to stiaigthen itself by international \npropaganda. Probably it was the left wring of the party, co- \noperating with . Communists and near-Commimists abroad, that \nlaid stress on this propaganda, both to strengthen China\u2019s \nnational position abroad and its own position in the Party ranks \nat home. The Party had not split up at the time into two or \n\nii/T . \n\n\n\nl JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nmore rival and bitterly hostile groups, and presented, to all out- \nward seeming, a united front. \n\nThe European representatives of the Kuo-Min-Tang, there- \nfore, welcomed the idea of the Congress of Oppressed Nationali- \nties; perhaps they even originated the idea jointly with some \nother people. Some Communists and near-Communists were also \nat the back of the proposal right from the beginning, but, as a \nwhole, the Communist element kept in the backgroimd. Active \nsupport and help also came from Latin America, which was \nchafing at the time at the economic imperialism of the United \nStates. Mexico, with a radical President and policy, was eager \nto take the lead in a Latin American bloc against the United \nStates; and Mexico, therefore, took great interest in the Brussels \nCongress. Officially the Government could not take part, but it \nsent one of its leading diplomats to be present as a benevolent \nobserver. \n\nThere were also present at Brussels representatives from the \nnational organisations of Java, Indo-China, Palestine, Syria, \nEgypt, Arabs from North Africa, and African Negroes. Then \nthere were many left-wing Labour organisations represented, and \nseveral well-known men, who had played a leading part in Euro- \npean Labour struggles .for a generation, were present. Com- \nmunists were there also, and they took an important part in the \njiroceedings; they came not as Communists, but as representa- \ntives of trade umon or similar organisations. \n\nGeorge Lansbury was elected president, and he delivered an \neloquent address. That in itself was proof that the Congress \nwas not so rabid after all, nor was it merely hitched on to the star \nof Communism. But there is no doubt that the gathering was \nfriendly towards the Communists, and, even though agreement \nmight be lacking on some matters, there appeared to be several \ncommon grounds for aaion. \n\nMr. Lansbury agreed to be president also of the permanent \norganisation that was formed\u2014 the League Against Imperialism. \nBut he repented of his rash behaviour soon, or perhaps his \ncolleagues of the British Labour Party did not approve of it. \nThe Labour Party was \u2018 His Majesty\u2019s Opposition ' then, soon to \nblossom out as \u2018 Ifrs Majesty\u2019s Government \u2019, and future Cabinet \nMinisters cannot dabble in risky and revolutionary politics. Mr. \nLansbury resigned from the presidentship on the ground ' of \nbeing too busy &r it; he even resigned from the membership of \nthe League.. I was hurt by this sudden change in a person whose \nspeech I had admired only two or three months earlier. \n\nThe League Against Imperialism had, however, quite a num- \n\n\n\nTHE OPPRESSED MEET AT BRUSSELS  \n\nber of distinguished persons as its patrons, Einstein was one of \nthem, and Madame Sun Yat Sen and, I think, Remain Rolland. \nMany months later Einstein resigned, as he disagreed with the \npro-Arab policy of the League in the Arab-Jewish quarrels in \nPalestine. \n\nThe Brussels Congress, as well as the subsequent Committee \nmeetings of the League, which were held in various places from \ntime to time, helped me to understand some of the problems of \ncolonial and dependent countries. They gave me also an insight \ninto the inner conflicts of the Western Labour world. I knew \nsomething about them already; I had read about them, but there \nwas no reality behind my knowledge, as there had been no per- \nsonal contacts. I had some such contacts now, and sometimes \nhad to face problems which reflected these inner conflicts. As \nbetween the Labour worlds of the Second International and the \nThird International, my sympathies were with the latter. The \nwhole record of the Second International from the War onwards \nfilled me with distaste, and we in India had had sufficient per- \nsonal experience of the methods of one of its strongest supports \n\u2014 the British Labour Party. So I turned inevitably with good- \nwill towards Communism, for, whatever its faults, it was at least \nnot hypocritical and not imperialistic. It was not a doctrinal \nadherence, as I did not know much about the fine points of \nCommunism, my acquaintance being limited at the time to its \nbroad features. These attracted me, as also the tremendous \nchanges taking place in Russia. But Communists-often irritated \nme by their dictatorial ways, their aggressive and rather vulgar \nmethods, their habit of denouncing everybody who did not agree \nwith them. This reaction was no doubt due, as they would say, \nto my own bourgeois education and up-bringing. \n\nIt was curious how, in our League Against Imperialism Com- \nmittee meetings, I would usually be on the side of the Anglo- \nAmerican members on petty matters of argument. There was a \ncertain similarity in our outlook in regard to method at least. \nWe would both object to declamatory and long-winded resolu- \ntions, which resembled manifestos. We preferred something \nsimpler and shorter, but the Continental tradition was against \nthis. There was often difference of opinion between the Com- \nmunist elements and the non-Communists. Usually we agreed \non a compromise. Later on, some of us returned to our homes \nand could not attend any further Committee meetings. \n\nThe Brussels Congress was viewed with some consternation by \nthe Foreign and Colonial Offices of the Imperialist powers. \n'Angur\u2019, the well-known writer of the British Foreign Office, \n\n\n\n JAWAHAHLAL NEHRU \n\nhas given a somewhat sensational, and occasionally ludicrous, \naccount of it in one of his books. The Congress itself was \nprobably full of international spies, mahy of the delegates even \nrepresenting various secret services. We had an amusing instance \nof this. An American friend of mine, who was in Paris, had a \nvisit from a Frenchman who belonged to the French secret \nservice. It was quite a friendly visit to enquire about certain \nmatters. When he had finished his enquiries he asked the \nAmerican if he did not recognise him, for they had met \npreviously. The American looked hard, but he had to admit \nthat he could not place him at aU. The secret service agent then \ntold him that he had met him at the Brussels Congress as a \nNegro delegate, with his face, hands, etc., all blacked overl \n\nOne of the meetings of the Committee of the League Against \nImperialism took place at Cologne, and I attended it. After the \nmeeting was over we were asked to go to Dusseldorf, near by, to \nattend a Saccho-Vanzetti meeting. As we were returning from \nthat meeting, we were asked to show our passports to the police. \nMost of the people had their passports with them, but I had \nleft mine at the hotel in Cologne, as we had only come for a few \nhours to Dusseldorf. I was thereupon marched to a police^tation. \nFortunately for me I had companions in distress\u2014 an English- \nman and his wife, who also had left their passport in Cologne. \nAfter about an hour\u2019s wait, during which probably tdephonic \nenquiries were made, the police chief was graciously pleased to \nallow us to depart. \n\nThe League Against Imperialism veered more towards Com- \nmunism in later years, though at no time, so far as I know, did \nit lose its individual character. I could only remain in distant \ntouch with it Iw means of correspondence. In , because of \nmy part in the Delhi truce between the Congress and the Govern- \nment of India, it grew exceedingly angry witib me, and excom- \nmunicated me with bell, book, and candle \u2014 or to be more accu- \nrate, it expelled me by some kind of a resolution. I must confess \nthat it had great provocation, but it might have given me some \nchance of explaining my position. \n\nIn the summer of  my father came to Europe. I met biTvi \nat Venice, and during the next few months we were often \ntogether. All of us \u2014 ^my father, my wife, my young sister, and \nI \u2014 paid a brief visit to Moscow in November during the tenth \nanniversary celebrations of the Soviet. It was a very brief visit, \njust three or four days in Moscow, decided upon at the last \nmoment. But we were glad we went, for even that glimpse \nwas worth while. It did not, and could not, tearb ns much about \n\n\n\nTHE OPPRESSED MEET AT BRUSSELS  \n\nthe new Russia, but it did give us a background for our reading. \nTo my father all such Soviet and collectivist ideas were wholly \nnovel. His whole training had been legal and constitutional, and \nhe could not easily get out of that framew'ork. But he was \ndefinitely impressed by what he saw in Moscow. \n\nWe were in Moscow when the announcement about the Simon \nCommission was first made. We first read about it in a Moscow \nsheet. A few days' aftenvards, fether was appearing in the Prity \nCouncil in London in an Indian appeal with Sir John Simon \nas a colleague. It was an old zamindari case in the earlier stages \nof which, many years previously, I had also appeared. I had \nno further interest in it, but at Sir John Simon\u2019s suggestion I \naccompanied my father on one occasion to Sir John\u2019s chambers \nfor a consultation. \n\nThe year  was drawing to an end, and our stay in Europe \nhad been unduly prolonged. Probably we would have returned \nhome sooner but ror father visiting Europe. It was our intention \nto spend some lime in south-eastern Europe and Turkey and \nEgypt on our way back. But there was no time for this then, \nand I was eager to be back in time for the next Congress session \nwhich was going to be held in Madras at Christma.s-time. We \nsailed firom Marseilles, my wife, sister, daughter and I, early in \nDecember for Colombo. My fiither remained in Europe for \nanother three months.  DEATtI OF MY FATHER \n\nI SAW father after two weeks, for he had visited me at Naini \non January lath when his appearance had given me a shock. \nHe had now changed for the worse, and his irace was even more \nswollen. He had some little difiRculty in speaking, and his mind \nwas not always quite clear. But his old will remained, and this \nheld on and kept the body and mind functioning. \n\nHe was pleased to see Ranjit and me. A A&y or two later \nRanjit (who did not come in tihe category of Working Com- \nmittee members) was taken back to Naini Prison. This lipset \nfather, and he was continually asking for him and complaining \nthat when so many people were coming to see him from dis- \ntant parts of India, his own son-in-law was kept away. The \ndoctors were worried by this insistence, and it was obvious that \nit was dqing father no good. After three or four days, I think \nat the doctors\u2019 suggestion, the U.P. Government released Ranjit. \n\nOn January ath, the same day that I was discharged, Gandhiji \nwas also discharged from Yeravda Prison. I was anxious to \nhave him in Allahabad, and when I mentioned his release to \nfather, I found that he was eager to see him. The very next \nday Gandhiji started from Bombay after a stupendous mass \nmeeting of welcome there, such as even Bombay had not seen \nbefore. He arrived at Allahabad late at night, but father was \nlying awake, waiting for him, and his presence and the few \nwords he uttered had a markedly soothing effect on father. To \nmy mother also his coming brought solace and relief. \n\nThe various Working Committee members, original and sub- \nstitute, who had been released, were meanwhile at a loose end \nand were waiting for directions about a meeting. Many of \nthem, anxious about fkther, wanted to come to Allahabad im- \nmediately. It was decided therefore to summon them all forth- \nwith to a meeting at Allahabad. Two days later thir^ or forty \nof them arrived, and their meetings took place in Swaraj \nBhawan next to our house. I went to these meetings from time \nto time, but I was much too distraught to take any efectiye \npart in them, and I have at present no recollection whatever \nof what their decisions were.  suppose they were in favour of \na continuance of the civil disobedience movement. \n\nAll these old friends and colleagues who had come, many of \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nthem freshly out of prison and expecting to go back again soon, \nwanted to visit father and to have what was likely to be a last \nglimpse and a last farewell of him. They came to him in twos \nand threes in the mornings and evenings, and father insisted \non sitting up in an easy-chair to receive his old comrades. There \nhe sat, massively and rather expressionlessly, for the swelling \non his face prevented much play of expression. But as one old \nfriend came after another and comrade succeeded comrade, \nthere was a glitter in his eye and recognition of them, and his \nhead bowed a little and his hands joined in salutation. And \nthough he could not speak much, sometimes he would say a \nfew words, and even then liis old humour did not leave him. \nThere he sat like an old lion mortally wounded and with his \nphysical strength almost gone, but still very leonine and kingly. \nAs I watched him, I wondered what thoughts passed through \nhis head, or was he past taking interest in our activities? He \nwas evidently often struggling with himself, trying to keep a \ngrip of things which threatened to slip away from his grasp. \nTo the end this struggle continued, and he did not give in, \noccasionally speaking to us with extreme clarity. Even when \na constriction in his throat made it difficult for him to make \nhimself understood, he took to writing on slips of paper what \nhe wanted to say. \n\nHe took practically no interest in the Working Committee \nmeetings which were taking place next door. A fortnight earlier \nthey would have excited him, but now he felt that he was \nalready far away from such happenings. \u201cI am going soon, \nMahatmaji,\u201d he said to Gandhiji, \u201c and I shall not be here to \nsee Swaraj. But I know that you have won it and will soon \nhave it.\u201d \n\nMost of the people who had come from other cities and pro- \nvinces departed. Gandhiji remained, and a few intimate friends \nand near relatives, and the three eminent doctors, old friends \nof his, to whom, he used to say, he had handed over his body \nfor s^e keeping\u2014 M. A. Ansari, Bidhan Chandra Roy, and \nJivraj Mehta. On the morning of February th he seemed to \nbe a little better, and it was decided to take advantage of this \nand remove him to Lucknow, where there were facilities for \ndeep X-ray treatment which AlIaha^d did not possess. That \nvery day we took him by car, Gandhiji and a large party fol- \nlowing us. We went slowly, but he was nevertheless exhausted. \nThe next day he seemed to be getting over the fatigue, and yet \nthere were some disquieting symptoms. Early next morning, \nFebruary th, I was watching by his bedside. He had had a \n\n\n\nDEATH OP MY FATHER  \n\ntroublesome and restless night; suddenly I noticed that his face \ngrew calm and the sense of struggle vanished from it. I thought \nthat he had fallen asleep, and I was glad of it. But my mother\u2019s \nperceptions were keener, and she uttered a cry. I turned to her \nand begged her not to disturb him as he had fallen asleep. But \nthat sleep was his last long sleep, and from it there was no \nawakening. \n\nWe brought his body that very day by car to Allahabad. I \nsat in that car and Ranjit drove it, and there was Hari, father\u2019s \nfavourite personal servant. Behind us came another car con- \ntaining my mother and Gandhiji, and then other cars. I was \ndazed all that day, hardly realising what had happened, and a \nsuccession of events and large crowds kept me from thinking. \nGreat crowds in Lucknow, gathered together at brief notice\u2014 \nthe swift dash from Lucknow to Allahabad sitting by the body, \nwrapped in our national flag, and with a big flag flying above\u2014 \nthe arrival at Allahabad, and the huge crowds that had gathered \nfor miles to'pay homage to his memo^. There were some \nceremonies at home, and then the last journey to the Ganga \nwith a mighty concourse of people. As evening fell on the \nriver bank on that winter day, the great flames leapt up and \nconsumed that body which had meant so much to us who were \nclose to him as well as to millions m India. Gandhiji said a few \nmoving words to the multitude, and then all of tis crept silently \nhome. The stars were out and shining brightly when we re- \nturned, lonely and desolate. \n\nMany thousands of messages of sympatliy came to my \nmother and to me. Lord and Lady Irwin also sent my inother \na courteous message. This tremendous volume of goodwill and \nsympathy took, away somewhat the sting from our sorrow, but \nit was, above all, the wonderfully soothing and healing presence \nof Gandhiji that helped my mother and all of us to face that \ncrisis in our hves, \n\nI found it difiBcult to realise that he had gone. Three months \nlater I was in Ceylon with my wife and daughter, and we were \nspending a few quiet and restful days at Nuwara Eliya. I liked \nthe place, and it struck me suddenly that it would suit fether. \nWhy not send for him? He must be tired out, and rest would \ndo him good I was on the point of sending a telegram to him \nto Allahabad. \n\nOn our return to Allahabad from Ceylon the post brought \none day a remarkable letter. The envelope was addressed to \nme in fether\u2019s handwriting, and it bore innumerable marks and \nstamps of different post offices, I opened it in amazement to \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nfind that it was, indeed, a letter from father to me, only it was \ndated the th February, . It was delivered to me in the \nsummer of , thus taking five and a half years in its \njourney. The letter had been written by father at Ahmedabad' \non the eve of my departure for Europe with Kamala in . \nIt was addressed to me to Bombay care of the Italian Lloyd \nsteamer on which we were travelling. Apparently it just missed \nus there, and then it visited various places, and perhaps lay in \nmany pigeon-holes till some enterprising person sent it on to \nme. Curiously enough, it was a letter df farewell. \n",
    "1927-1931": " THEOSOPHY \n\nWhen I was ten years old we changed over to a new and much \nbigger house which my father named ' Anand Bhawan This \nhouse had a big garden and a swimming pool and I was full of \nexcitement at the fresh discoveries I was continually making. \nAdditional buildings were put up and there was a great deal of \ndigging and construction and I loved to watch the labourers at \nwork. \n\nThere was a large swimming pool in the house and. soon I \nlearnt to swim and felt completely at home in and under the \nwater. During the long and hot summer days I would go for a \ndip at all odd hours, many times a day. In the evening many \nfiiends of my father\u2019s came to the pool. It was a novelty, and the \nelectric light that had been installed there and in the house was an \ninnovation for Allahabad in those days. I enjoyed myself hugely \nduring these bathing parties and an unfailing joy was to frighten, \nby pushing or pullmg, those who did not know how to swim. \nI remember, particularly. Dr. Tej Bahadur Sapru who was then \na junior at Ae Allahabad Bar. He knew no swimming and had \nno intention of learning it. He would sit on the first step in \nfifteen inches of water, refusing absolutely to go forward even to \nthe second step, and shouting loudly if anyone tried to move him. \nMy father himsdf was no swimmer, but he could just manage \nto go the length of the pool with set teeth and violent and \nexhausting effort. \n\nThe Boer War was then going on and this interested me and \nall my sympathies were with the Boers. I began to read .the \nnewspapers to get news of the fighting. \n\nA domestic event, however, just then absorbed my attention. \nThis was the birth of a little sister. I had long n ou ri s hed a secret \ngrievance at not having any brothers or sisters when everybody \nelse seemed to have them, and the prospect of having at last a \nbaby brother or sister all to myself was exhilarating. Father was \nthen in Europe. I remember waiting anxiously in the verandah \nfor the event. One of the doctors came and told me of it and \nadded, presumably as a jokfe, that I must be glad that it was not \na boy who would have taken a share in my patrimony., I felt \nbitter and angry at the thought that any one should imagine \nthat I could harbour such a vile notion. \n\n \n\n\n\nTHEOSOPHY \n\n\n \n\nFather's visits to Europe led to an internal storm in the Kash- \nmiri Brahman comm-unity in india. He refused to perform any \nprayashchit or purification ceremony on his return. Some years \npreviously another Kashmiri Brahman, Pandit Bishan Narayan \nDar, who later became a President of the Congress, had gone \nto England to be called to the Bar. On his return the orthodox \nmembers of the community had refused to have anything to \ndo with him and he was outcast, although he performed the \nprayashchit ceremony. This had resulted in the splitting up of \nthe community into two more or less equal halves. Many Kash- \nmiri young men went subsequently to Europe for their studies \nand on their return joined the reformist section, but only after \na formal ceremony of purification. This ceremony itself was a \nbit of a farce and there was little of religion in it. It merely \nsignified an outward conformity and a submission to the group \nwill. Having done so, each person indulged in all manner of \nheterodox activities and mixed and fed with non-Brahmans and \nnon-Hindus. \n\nFather went a step further and refused to go through any \nceremony or to submit in any way, even outwartfiy and formally, \nto a so-called purification. A great deal of beat was generated, \nchiefly becaiae of father\u2019s aggressive and rather disd^mfiil atti- \ntude, and ultimately a consid^ble number of Kashmiris joined \nfather and so a third group was formed. .Within a few years \nthese groups gradually merged into one another as ideas changed \nand the old restrictions fell. Large numbers of Kashmiri young \nmen and girls have visited Europe or America for their studies \nand no question has arisen of their performing any ceremonies \non their return. Food restrictions have almost entirely gone, \nexcept in the case of a handful of orthodox people, chiefly old \nladies, and inter-dining with non-Kashmiris, Muslims and non- \nIndians is conunon. Purdah, the seclusion of women, has dis- \nappeared among Kashmiris even as regards other communities. \nThe last push to this was given by the political upheaval of . \nInter-marriage with other communities is still not popular, \nalthough (increasingly) instances occur. Both my sisters have \nmarried non-Kashn^s and a young member of our family has \nrecently married a Hungarian girl. The objection to inter- \nmarriage with others is not based on rdigion; it is largely racial. \nThere is a desire among many Kashimris to preserve our group \nidentity and our distinctive Aryan features, and a fear that we \nshall lose these in the sea of Indian and non-Indian humanity. \nWe are small in numbers in this vast country. \n\nProbably the first Kashmiri Brahman in modem times to visit \n\n\n\nH JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nWestern countries was Mirza Mohan Lai \u2018 Kashmerian \u2019 (as he \ncalled himself) about a hundred years ago. He was a bright and \nhandsome young man, a student of the Mission College at Delhi, \nand he was chosen to accompany a British mission to Kabul as \nPersian interpreter. Later he travelled all over Central Asia and \nPersia and wherever he went he managed to take a new wife \nunto himself, usually marrying in the highest circles. He became \na Muslim and in Persia married a girl of the royal family, hence \nhis title of Mirza. He visited Europe also and was presented to \nthe young Queen Victoria. He has written delightful memoirs \nand accounts of his travels. \n\nWhen I was about eleven a new resident tutor, Ferdinand T. \nBrooks, came and took charge of me. He was partly Irish (on his \nfather\u2019s side) and his mother had been a Frenchwoman or a \nBelgian. He was a keen theosophist who had been recommended \nto my father by Mrs. Annie Besant. For nearly three years he \nwas with me and in many ways he influenced me greatly. The \nonly other tutor I had at the time was a dear old Pandit who was \nsMposed to teach me Hindi and Sanskrit. After many years\u2019 \neffort the Pandit managed to teach me extraordinarily little, so \nlittle that I can only measure my pitiful knowledge of Sanskrit \nwith the Latin I learnt subsequently at Harrow. The fault no \ndoubt was mine. I am not good at languages, and grammar has \nhad no attraction for me whatever. \n\nF. T. Brooks developed in me a taste for reading and I read a \ngreat many English books, though rather aimlessly. I was well \nup m children\u2019s and boys\u2019 literature; the Lewis Carroll books \nwere great favourites, and The Jungle Books and Kim. I was \n^_mated by Gustave Dora\u2019s illustrations to Don Quixote, and \nFridtjof hJansens Farthest North opened out a new realm of \nadventure to me. I remember reading many of the novels of \nwott, Dickens and Thackeray, H. G. Wells\u2019s romances, Mark \nTwain, and the Sherlock Hohnes stories. I was thrilled by the \nPrtsoner of Zenda, and Jerome K. Jerome\u2019.s Three Men in a Boat \nWM for me the last word in humour. Another book stands out \nniemory; it was Du Maurier\u2019s Trilby, also Peter \nIbbetson. I also developed a liking for poetry, a liking which has \nto S(^e extent radured and survived the many other changes \nto which I have been subject. \u00b0 \n\nBrooks also initiated me into the mysteries of science. Wc \nrigged up a little laboratory and there I used to spend long and \nSASdst^*^* working out experiments in elementary physics \n\nApart from my studies, F. T. Brooks brought a new influence \n\n\n\nTHEOSOPHY \n\n\n* \n\nto bear upon me which affected me powerfully for a while. This \nwas Theosophy. He used to have weekly meetings of theoso- \nphists in his rooms and I attended them and gradually imbibed \ntheosophical phraseology and ideas. There were metaphysical \narguments, and discussions about reincarnation and the astral \nand other super-natural bodies, and auras, and the doctrine of \nKarma, and references not only to big books by Madame \nBlavatsky and other Theoaophists but to the Hindu scriptures, \nthe Buddhist \u201c Dhamma-pada\u2019*, Pythagoras, Apollonius of \nTyana, and various philosophers and mystics. I did not under- \nstand much that was said but it all sounded very mysterious and \nfascinating and I felt that here was the key to the secrets of the \ntmiverse. For the first time I began to think, consciously and \ndeliberately, of religion and other worlds. The Hindu religion \nespecially went up in my estimation; not the ritual or ceremonial \npart, but its great books, the \" Upanishads\" and the \"Bhagavad \nGita \u201d. I did not understand them, of course, but they seemed very \nwonderful. I dreamt of astral bodies and imagined myself flying \nvast distances. This dream of flying high up in the air (without \nany appliance) has indeed been a frequent one throughout my \nlife; and sometimes it has been vivid and realistic and the country- \nside seemed to lie underneath me in a vast panorama. I do not \nknow how the modem interpreters of dreams, Freud and others, \nwould interpret this dream. \n\nMrs. Annie Besant visited Allahabad in those days and \ndelivered several addresses on theosophical subjects. I was deeply \nmoved by her oratory and returned from her speeches dazed \nand as in a dream. I decided to join the Theosophical Society, \nalthough I was only thirteen then. When I went to ask father\u2019s \npermission he laughingly gave it; he did not seem to attach \nimportance to the subject either way. I was a little hurt by his \nlack of feeling. Great as he was in many ways in my eyes, I felt \nthat he was lacking in spirituality. As a matter of fact he was \nan old theosophist, having joined the Sodety in its early days \nwhen Madame Blavatsky was in India. Curiosity probably led \nhim to it more than religion, and he soon dropped out of it, but \nsome of his friends, who had joined with him, persevered and \nrose high in the spiritual hierarchy of the Society. \n\nSo I became a member of the Theosophical Sodety at thirteen \nand Mrs. Besant herself performed the ceremony of initiation, \nwhich consisted of good advice and instruction in some mys- \nterious signs, pmbably a relic of freemasonry. I was thrilled. I \nattended the Theosophical Convention at Benares and saw old \nColonel Olrott with hi\u00ae fine beard. \n\n\n\nl JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nIt is difficult to realise what one looked like or felt like in one\u2019s \nboyhood, thirty years ago. But I have a fairly strong impression \nthat during these theosophical days of mine I developed the \nflat and insipid look which sometimes denotes piety and which \nis (or was) often to be seen among theosophist men and women. \nI was smug, with a feeUng of being one-of-the-elect, and alto- \ngether I must have been a thoroughly undesirable and unpleasant \ncompanion for any boy or girl of my age. \n\nSoon after F. T. Brooks left me I lost touch with Theosophy, \nand in a remarkably short time (partly because I went to school \nin England) Theosophy left my life completely. But I have no \ndoubt that those years with F. T. Brooks left a deep impress upon \nme and I feel that I owe a debt to him and to Theosophy. But \nI am afraid that theosophists have since then gone down in my \nestimation. Instead of the chosen ones they seem to be very \nordinary folk, liking security better than risk, a soft job more \nthan the martyr\u2019s lot. But, for Mrs. Besant, I always had the \nwarmest admiration. \n\nThe next important event that I remember affecting me was \nthe Russo-Japanese War. Japanese victories stirred up my \nenthusiasm and I waited eagerly for the papers for fresh news \ndaily. I invested in a large number of books on Japan and tried \nto read some of them. I felt rather lost in Japanese history, but \nI liked the knightly tales of old Japan and the pleasant prose of \nLafeadio Hearn. \n\nNationalistic ideas filled my mind. I mused of Indian freedom \nand Asiatic freedom fi:om the thraldom of Europe. I dreamt of \nbrave deeds, of how, sword in hand, I would fight for India and \nhelp in fireeing her. \n\nI was fourteen. Changes were taking place in our house. My \nolder cousins, having become professional men, were leaving the \ncommon home and setting up their own households separately. \nFresh thoughts and vague fandes were floating in my mind and \nI began to take a little more interest in the opposite sex. I still \npreferred the company of boys and tliought it a little beneath \nmy dignity to mix with groups of girls. But sometimes at \nKashmiti parties, where pretty girls were not lacking, or else- \nwhere, a glance or a touch would thrill me. \n\nIn May , when I was fifteen, we set sail for England. \nFather and mother, my baby sister and I, we all went together.  NON-VIOLENClL AND THE DOCTRINE OF \nTHE SWORD \n\nThe sudden suspension of our movement after the Chauri \nChaura incident was resented, I think, by almost all the promi- \nnent Congress leaders\u2014 other than Gandhiji of course. My father \n(who was in gaol at the time) was much upset by it. The younger \npeople were naturally even more agitated. Our mounting hopes \ntumbled to the ground, and this mental reaction was to be \nexpected. What troubled us even more were the reasons given \nfor this suspension and the consequences that seemed to flow \nfrom them. Chauri Chaura may have been and was a deplorable \noccurrence and wholly opposed to the spirit of the non-violent \nmovement; but were a remote village and a mob of excited \npeasants in an out-of-the-way place going to put an end, for \nsome time at least, to our national struggle for tteedom? If this \nwas the inevitable consequence of a sporadic act of violence, \nthen surely there was something lacking in the philosophy and \ntechnitjue of a non-violent struggle. For it seemed to us to be \nimpossible to ^arantee against the occurrence of some such \nimtoward incident. Must we train the three hundred and odd \nmillions of India in the theory and practice of non-violent \naction before we could go forward? And, even so, how many of \nus could, say that imder extreme provocation from the police \nwe would be able to remain perfectly peaceful? But even if we \nsucceeded, what of the numerous agents provocateurs, stool \npigeons, and the like who crept into our movement and indulged \nin violence themselves or induced others to do so? If this was \nthe sole condition of its function, then the non-violent method \nof resistance would always fail. \n\nWe had accepted that method, the Congress had made that \nmethod its own, because of a belief in its effectiveness. Gandhiji \nhad placed it before the coimt^ not only as the right method \nbut as the most effective one tor our purpose. In spite of its \nnegative naine it was a dynamic method, the very opposite of \na meek submission to a tyrant\u2019s will. It was not a coward\u2019s refuge \nfrorn action, but the brave m an\u2019s defiance of evil and national \nsubjection. But what was the use of the bravest and the strongest \nif a few odd persons\u2014 maybe even our opponents in the guise of \nfriends \u2014 ^had the power to upset or end our movement bv their \nrash behaviour? , ^ \n\n\n\nNON-VIOLENCE \n\n\n \n\nGandhiji had pleaded fo? the adoption of the way of non- \nviolence, of peaceful non-co-operation, with all the eloquence \nand persuasive power which he so abundantly possessed. His \nlanguage had been simple and tmadorned, his voice and appear- \nance cool and clear and devoid of all emotion, but behind that \noutward covering of ice there was the heat of a blazing fire and \nconcentrated passion, and the words he uttered winged their \nway to the innermost recesses of our minds and hearts, and \ncreated a strange ferment there. The way he pointed out was \nhard and difficult, but it was a brave path, and it seemed to \nlead to the promised land of freedom. Because of that promise \nwe pledged our faith and marched ahead. In a famous article \u2014 \n\u201c The Doctrine of the Sword he had written in  : \n\n\"I do believe that when there is only a choice between \ncowardice and violence, I would advise violence. ... I would \nrather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour \nthan that she should in a cowardly manner become or remain \na helpless victim to her own dishonour. But I believe that non- \nviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more \nmanly than punishment Bpti \n\n\" Forgiveness adorns a soldier. But abstinence is forgiveness \nonly when there is power to punish; it is meaningless when \nit pretends to proceed from a helpless creature. A mouse hardly \nforgives a cat when it allows itself to be tom to pieces by \nher- . . . But I do not believe India to be helpless, I do not \nbelieve myself to be a helpless creature. . . . \n\n\u201c Let me not be misunderstood. Strength does not come from \nphysical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. . . . \n\n\u201c I am not a visionary. I claim to be a practical idealist. The \nreligion of non-violence is not meant merely for the Rishis \nand saints. It is meant for the common people as well. Non- \nviolence is the law of our species as violence is the law of the \nbrute. The spirit lies dormant in the brute and he knows no \nlaw but that of physical might. The dignity of man requires \nobedience to a higher law \u2014 to the strength of the spirit. \n\n\u201c I have therefore ventured to place before India the ancient \nlaw of self-sacrifice. For Satyagrahjand its off-shoots, non-co- \noperation and civil resistance, are nothing but new names for \nthe law of suffering. The Rishis who discovered the law of \nnon-violence in the midst of violoice, were greater geniuses than \nNewton. They were themselves greater warriors than Welling- \nton. Having themselves known the use of arms, they realised \ntheir uselessness and taught a weary world that its salvation \nlay not through violence but through non-violence. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAI. NEHRU \n\n\u201cNon-violence in its dynamic condition means conscious \nsuffering. It does not mean meek submission to the will of \nthe evil-doer, but it means the putting of one\u2019s whole soul \nagainst the will of the tyrant. Working under this law of our \nbeing, it is possible for a single individual to defy the whole \nmight of an unjust empire to save his honour, his religion, his \nsoul and lay the foundation for that empire\u2019s fall or regenera- \ntion. \n\n\u201c And so I am not pleading for India to practise non-violence \nbecause it is weak. I want her to practise non-violence being \nconscious of her strength and power. ... I want India to \nrecognise that she has a soul that cannot perish, and that can \nrise triumphant above any physical weakness and defy the \nphysical combination of a whole world. . . . \n\n\u201c I isolate this non-co-operation from Sinn Feinism, for, it is \nso conceived as to be incapable of being offered side by side \nwith violence. But I invite even the school of violence to give \nthis peaceful non-co-operation a trial. It will not fail through \nits inherent weakness. It may fail because of poverty of \nresponse. Then will be the time for real danger. The high- \ns\u2019ouled men, who are unable to suffer national humiliation any \nlonger, will want to vent their wrath. They will take to violence. \nSo far as I know, they must perish without delivering them- \nselves or their country from the wrong. If India takes up the \ndoctrine of the sword, she may gain momentary victory. Then \nIndia will cease to be the pride of my heart. I am wedded to \nIndia because I owe my all to her. I believe absolutely that she \nhas a mission for the world.\u201d \n\nWe were moved by these argmnents, but for us and for the \nNational Congress as a whole the non-violent method was not, \nand could not be, a religion or an unchallengeable creed or \ndogma. It could only be a policy and a method promising \ncertain results, and by those results it would have to be finally \njudged. Individuals might make of it a religion or incontro- \nvertible creed. But no political organisation, so long as it \nremained political, could do so. \n\nChauri Chaura and its consequences made us examine these \nimplications of non-violence as a method, and we felt that, if \nGandhiji\u2019s argument for the suspension of civil resistance was \n, correct, our opponents would always have the power to create \ncircumstances which would necessarily result in our abandoning \nthe struggle. Was this the fault of the non-violent method itself \nor of Gandhiji\u2019s interpretation of it? After all, he was the \nauthor and originator of it, and who could be a better judge of \n\n\n\nNON-VIOLENCE  \n\nwhat it was and what it was not? And without him where was \nour movement? \n\nMany years later, just before the  Civil Disobedience \nmovement began, Gandhiji, much to our satisfaction, made this \npoint clear. He stated that the movement should not be aban- \ndoned because of the occurrence of sporadic acts of violence. \nIf the non-violent method of struggle could not function \nbecause of such almost inevitable happenings, then it was \nobvious that it was not an ideal method for all occasions, and \nthis he was not prepared to admit. For him the method, being \nthe right method, should suit all circumstances and should be \nable to function, at any rate in a restricted way, even in a hostile \natmosphere. Whether this interpretation, which widened the \nscope of non-violent action, represented an evolution in his own \nmind or not I do not know. \n\nAs a matter of fact even the suspension of civil resistance in \nFebruary  was certainly not due to Chauri Chaura alone, \nalthough most people imagined so. That was only the last straw. \nGandhiji has offen acted almost by instinct; by long and close \nassociation with the masses he appears to have developed, as \ngreat popular leaders often do, a new sense which tells him how \nthe mass feels, what it does and what it can do. He reacts to \nthis instinctive feeling and fashions his action accordingly, and \nlater, for the benefit of his surprised and resentful colleagues, \ntries to clothe his decision with reasons. This covering is often \nvery inadequate, as it seemed after Chauri Chaura. At that time \nour movement, in spite of its apparent power and the widespread \nenthusiasm, was going to pieces. All organisation and discipline \nwas disappearing; almost all our good men were in prison, and \nthe masses had so fer received little training to carry on by them- \nselves. Any unknown man who wanted to do so could take \ncharge of a Congress Committee and, as a matter of fact, large \nnumbers of undesirable men, including agents provocateurs, \ncame to die front and even controlled some local Congress and \nKhilafat organisations. There was no way of checking them. \n\nThis kind of thing is, of course, to some extent almost \ninevitable in such a struggle. The leaders must take the lead in \ngoing to prison, and trust to others to carry on. All that can be \ndone is to train the masses in some simple kinds of activity and, \neven more so, to abstain from certain other kinds of activity. \nIn  we had already spent several years in ^ving some such \ntraining, and the Civil Disobedience movement then and in  \nwas a very powerful and organised a\u00a3^. This was lacking in \n and iQaa, and there was little behind the excitement and \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nenthusiasm of the people. There is little doubt that if the move- \nmen had continued there would have been growing sporadic \nviolence in many places. This would have been crushed by \nGovernment in a bloody manner and a reign of terror estab- \nlished which would have thoroughly demoralised the people. \n\nThese were probably the reasons and influences that worked in \nGandhiji\u2019s mind, and granting his premises and the desirability \nof carrying on with the technique of non-violence, his decision \nwas right. He had to stop the rot and build anew. From another \nand an entirely different view-point his decision might be con- \nsidered wrong, but that view-point had nothing to do with the \nnon-violent method. It was not possible to have it both ways. To \ninvite a bloody suppression of the movement in that pardculai \nsporadic way and at that stage would not, of course, have put an \nend to the national movement, for such movements have a way \nof rising from their ashes. Temporary set-backs are often helpful \nin clarifying issues and in giving backbone; what matters is not \na set-back or apparent defeat, but the principles and ideals: If \nthese principles can be kept untarnished by the masses, then re- \ncovery comes soon. But what were our principles and objectives \nin I pa I and ipaa? A vague Swaraj with no dear ideology behind \nit and a particular technique of non-violent struggle. %ie latter \nmethod would naturally have gone if the country had taken to \nsporadic violence on any big scale, and as to the former, there \nwas little to hold on to. The people generally were not strong \nenough to carry on the struggle for long and, in spite of almost \nuniversal discontent with foreign rule and sympathy with the \nCongress, there was not enough backbone or organisation. They \ncould not last. Even the crowds that went to prison did so on the \nspur of the moment, expecting the whole thing to be over very \nsoon. \n\nIt may be, therefore, that the dedsion to suspend civil resist- \nance in ipaa was a right one, though the manner of doing it left \nmuch to be desired and brought about a certain demoralisation. \n\nIt is possible, however, that this sudden bottling up of a great \nmovement contributed to a tragic development in Ae country. \nThe drift to sporadic and futile violence in the political struggle \nwas stopped, but the suppressed violence had to find a way out, \nand in the following years this perhaps aggravated the com- \nmunal trouble. The communalists of various denominations, \nmostly political reactionaries, had been forced to lie low because \nof the overwhelming mass support for the non-co-operation and \ncivil disobedience movemmt. They emerged now from their \nretirement. Many others, secret service agents and people who \n\n\n\nNON-VIOLENCE \n\n\n \n\nsought to please the authorities by creating communal friction, \nalso worked on the same theme. The Moplah rising and its extra- \nordinarily cruel suppression \u2014 ^what a horrible thing was the \nbaking to death of the Moplah prisoners in the closed railway \nvansl \u2014 ^had already given a handle to those who stirred the \nwaters of communal discord. It is just possible that if civil \nresistance had not been stopped and the movement had been \ncrushed by Government, there would have been less communal \nbitterness and less superfluous energy left for the subsequent \ncommunal riots. \n\nBefore civil resistance was called off an incident occurred which \nmight have led to different results. The first wave of civil resist- \nance amazed and frightened the Government. It was then that \nLord Reading, the Viceroy, said in a public speech that he was \ntroubled and perplexed. The Prince of Wales was in India, and \nhis presence added greatly to the Government's responsibility. \nAn attempt was made by the Government in December ipai, \nsoon after the mass arrests at the beginning of the month, to \ncome to some understanding with the Congress. This was especi- \nally in view of the Prince\u2019s forthcoming visit to Calcutta. There \nwere some informal talks between representatives of the Bengal \nGovernment and Deshbandhu Das, who was in gaol then. A \nproposal seems to have been made, that a small round table con- \nference might take place between the Government and the Con- \ngress. This proposal appears to have fallen through because \nGandhiji insisted that Maulana Mohamad Ali, who was then in \nprison in Karachi, should be present at this conference. Govern- \nment would not agree to thite. \n\nMr. C. R. Das ^d not approve of Gandhiji\u2019s attitude in this \nmatter and, when he came out of prison later, he publicly criti- \ncised him and said that he had blundered. Most of us (we were \nin gaol) do not know the details of what took place then, and it \nis difficult to judge without all the facts. It seems, however, that \nlittle good could have come out of the conference at that stage. \nIt was an effort on the part of Government to tide over somehow \nthe period of the Prince\u2019s visit to Calcutta. The basic problems \nthat faced us would have remained. Nine years later, when the \nnation and the Congress were fer stronger, such a conference \ntook place without any great results. But apart firom this, it seems \nto me that Gandhiji\u2019s insistence on Mohamad Ali\u2019s presence was \nperfectly justified. Not only as a Congress leader but as the leader \nof the Khilafat movement \u2014 and the Khilafat question was then \nan important plank in the Congress programme\u2014 his presence \nwas essential. No policy or manoeuvre can ever be a right one if \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nit involves the forsaking of a colleague. The fact that Govern- \nment were not prepared to release him from gaol itself shows \nthat there was no likelihood of any results from a conference. \n\nBoth my father and I had been sentenced to six months\u2019 im- \nprisonment on different charges and by different courts. The \ntrials were farcical and, as was our custom, we took no part in \nthem. Il was easy enough, of course, to find enough material in \nour speeches or other activities for a conviction. But the actual \nchoice was amusing. Father was tried as a member of an illegal \norganisation, the Congress Volunteers, and to prove this a form \nwith his signature in Hindi was produced. The signature was \ncertainly his, but, as it happened, he had hardly ever signed in \nHindi before, and very few persons could recognise his Hindi \nsignature. A tattered gentleman was then produced who swore \nto the signature. The man was quite illiterate, and he held the \nsignature upside down when he examined it. My daughter, \naged four at the time, had her first experience of the dock during \nfather's trial, as he held her in his arms throughout. \n\nMy offence was distributing notices for a hartal. This was no \noflfence under the law then, though I believe it is one now, for \nwe are rapidly advancing towards Dominion Status. However, I \nwas sentenced. Three months later I was informed in the prison, \nwhere I was with my father and others, that some revising \nauthority had come to the conclusion that I was wrongly sen- \ntenced and I was to be discharged. I was surprised, as no one had \ntaken any step on my behalf. The suspension of civil resistance \nhad apparently galvanised the revising judges into activity. I was \nsorry to go out, leaving my father behind. \n\nI decided to go almost immediately to Gandhiji in Ahmeda- \nbad. Before I arrived there he had been arrested, and my inter- \nview with him took place in Sabarmati Prison. I was present at \nhis trial. It was a memorable occasion, and those of us who were \npresent are not likely ever to forget it. The judge, an English- \nman, behaved with dignity and feeling. Gandhiji\u2019s statement to \nthe court was a most moving one, and we came away, emotion- \nally stirred, and with the impress of his vivid phrases and \nstriking images in our mind. \n\nI came badt to Allahabad. I felt unhappy and lonely outside \nthe prison when so many of my friends and colleagues were \nbehind prison bars. I found that the Congress organisation was \nnot functioning well and I tried to put it straight. In particular \nI interested myself in the boycott of foreign cloth. This item of \nour programme still continued in spite of the withdrawal of \ncivil resistance. Nearly all the cloth merchants in Allahabad had \n\n\n\nNON-VIOLENCE \n\n\n \n\npledged themselves not to import or purchase foreign cloth, and \nhad formed an association for the purpose. The rules of this \nassociation laid dovm that any infringement would be punished \nby a fine. I found that several of the big dealers had broken \ntheir pledges and were importing foreign cloth. This was very \nunfair to those who stuck to their pledges. We remonstrated \nwith little result, and the cloth dealers\u2019 association seemed to be \npowerless to take action. So we decided to picket the shops of the \nerring merchants. Even a hint of picketing was enough for our \npurpose. Fines were paid, pledges were taken afresh. The money \nfrom the fines went to the clofri merchants\u2019 association. \n\nTwo or three days later I was arrested, together with a number \nof colleagues who had taken part in the negotiations with the \nmerchants. We were charged with criminal intimidation and \nextortion  I was further charged with some other offences, in- \ncluding sedition. I did not d^end myself, but I made a long \nstatement in court. I was sentenced on at least three counts, \nincluding intimidation and extortion, but the sedition charge \nwas not proceeded with, as it was probably considered that I had \nalready got as much as I deserved. As far as I remember there \nwere three sentences, two of which were for eighteen months \nand were concurrent- In all, I think, I was sentenced to a year \nand nine months. That was my second sentence. I went back to \nprison after about six weeks spent outside it.  INDEPENDENCE AND AFTER \n\nThe Lahore Congress remains firesh in my memory \u2014 a vivid \npatch. That is natural, for I played a leading r&le there, and, for \na moment, occupied the centre of the stage; and I like to think \nsometimes of the emotions that filled me during those crowded \ndays. I can never forget the magnificent welcome that the people \nof Lahore gave me, tremendous in its volume and its intensity. \nI knew well that this overflowing enthusiasm was for a symbol \nand an idea, not for me personally; yet it was no little thing for \na person to become that symbol, even for a while, in the eyes \nand hearts of great numbers of people, and I felt exhila- \nrated and lifted out of myself. But my personal reactions \nwere of little account, and there were big issues at stake. The \nwhole atmosphere was electric and surcharged with the gravity \nof the occasion. Our decisions were not going to be mere criti- \ncisms or protests or expressions of opinion, but a call to action \nwhich was bound to convulse the country and affect the lives of \nmillions. \n\nWhat the distant future held for us and our country, none \ndare prophesy; the immediate future was clear enough, and \nit held the promise of strife and suflfering for us and those who \nwere dear to us. This thought sobered our enthusiasms and \nmade us very conscious of our responsibility. Every vote that \nwe gave became a message of farewell to ease and comfort and \ndomestic happiness and the intercourse of fiiends, and an \ninvitation to lonely days and nights and physical and mental \ndistress. \n\nThe main resolution on Independence, and the action to be \ntaken in furtherance of our freedom struggle, was passed almost \nunanimously, barely a score of persons, out of many thousands, \nvoting against it. The real voting took place on a side issue, \nwhich came in the form of an amendment. This amendment \nwas defeated and the voting figures were announced and the \nmain resolution declared carried, by a curious coincidence, at the \nstroke of midnight on December  ist, as the old year yielded \nplace to the new. Thus even as the year of grace, fixed by the \nCalcutta Congress, expired; the new dedsion was i^en and pre- \nparations for the struggle laundied. The wheels had been set \nmoving, but we were stiU in darkness as to how and when we \n\nSOI \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwere to begin. The All-India Congress Committee had been \nauthorised to plan and carry out our campaign, but all knew \nthat the retd decision lay with Gandhiji. \n\nThe Lahore Congress was attended by large numbers of people \nfrom the Frontier Province near by. Individual delegates from \nthis province had always come to the Congress sessions, and for \nsome years past Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan had been attending \nand t^ing part in our deliberations. In Lahore for the first time \n''a large batch of earnest young men from the Frontier came into \ntouch with all-India political currents. Their fresh minds were \nimpressed, and they returned with a sense of unity with the rest \nof India in the struggle for freedom and full of enthusiasm for \nit. They were simple but effective men of action, less given to \ntalk and quibbling than the people of any other province in \nIndia, and they started organising their people and spreading \nthe new ideas. They met with success, and the men and women \n' of the Frontier, the latest to join m India's struggle, played an \noutstanding and remarkable part from  onwards. \n\nImmediately after the Lahore Congress, and in obedience to \nits mandate, my father called upon the Congress members of \nthe Legislative Assembly and the Provincial Councils to resign \nfrom their seats. Nearly all of them came out in a body, a very \nfew refusing to do so, although this involved a breach of their \nelection promises. \n\n^ Still we were vague about the future. In spite of the enthu- \nsiasm shown at the Congress session, no one knew- what the \nresponse of the country would be to a programme of action. \nWe had burned our boats and could not go back, but the country \nahead of us was an almost strange and uncharted land. To give \na start to our campaign, and partly also to judge the temper \nof the country, January th was fixed as Independence Day, \nwhen a pledge of independence was to be taken all over the \ncountry. \n\nAnd so, full of doubt about our programme, but pushed on \nby enthusiasm and the desire to do something effective, we \nwaited for the march of events. I was in Allahabad during the \nearly part of January; my father was mostly away. It was the \ndime of the great annual fair, the Magh Mela; probably it was \nthe special Kumbh year, and hundreds of thousands of men \nand women were continually streaming into Allahabad, or holy \nPrayag, as it was to the pilgrims. They were all kinds of people, \nchiefly peasants, also labourers, shopkeepers, artisans, merchants, \nbusiness men, professional people\u2014 indeed, it was a cross-section \nof Hindu India. As I lyatehed these great crowds and the un- \n\n\n\n\nLAHORE CONGRESS   \nNehru (standing on right) as President Elert \n\n\n\n\n\nINDtPENDENCt AND AFTER ^ \n\nending streams of people going to and from the river, I won- \ndered how they would react to the call for civil resistance and \npeaceful direct action. How many of them knew or cared for \nthe Lahore decisions? How amazingly powerful was that faith \nwhich had for thousand.s of years brought them and their for- \nbears from ever;^ corner of India to bathe in the holy Gan^a I \nCould they not divert some of this tremendous energy to political \nand economic action to better their own lot? Or were their \nminds too full of the trappings and traditions of their religion \nto leave room for other thought? I knew, of course, that these \nother thoughts were already there, stirring the placid stillness of \nages. It was the movement of these vague ideas and desires \namong the masses that had caused the upheavals of the past \ndozen years and had changed the face of India. There was no \ndoubt about their existence and of the dynamic energy behind \nthem. But still doubt came and questions arose to which there \nwas no immediate answer. How far had these ideas spread? \nWhat strength lay behind them, what capacity for organised \naction, for long endurance? \n\nOur house attracted crowds of pilgrims. It lay conveniently \nsituated near one of the places of pilgrimage, Bharadwaj, where \nin olden times there was a primitive university, and on me days \nof the mela an endless stream of visitors would come to us from \ndawn to dusk. Curiosity, I suppose, brought most of them, and \nthe desire to see well-known persona they had heard of, especi- \nally my father. But a large proportion of those who came were \npolitically inclined, and asked questions about the Congress and \nwhat it had decided and what was going to happen; and they \nwere full of their own economic troubles and wanted to know \nwhat they should do about them. Our political slogans they \nknew well, and aU day the house resounded with them. I started \nthe day by saying a few words to each group of twenty or fifty \nor a hundred as it came, one after the other, but soon this proved \nan impossible undertaking, and I silently saluted them whrai \nthey came. There was a limit to this, too, and then I tried to \nlijd e myself. It was all in vain. The slogans became louder and \nlouder, the verandas of the house were full of these visitors of \nours, each door and vrindow had a collection of prying eyes. It \nwas impossible to work or talk or feed or, indeed, do anything. \nThis was not only embarrassing, it was annoying and irritating. \nYet there they were, these people looking up vwth shining eyes \nfull of affection, with generations of poverty and suffering \nbehind them, and still pouring out their gratitude and love and \nasking for little in return, except fellow-feeling and sympathy. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nIt was impossible not to feel humbled and awed by this abun- \ndance of affection and devotion. \n\nA dear friend of ours was staying with us at the time, and \noften it became impossible to carry on any conversation with \nher, for every five minutes or less T had to go out to say a word \nor two to a crowd that had assembled, and in between we listened \nto the slogans and shouting oucside. She was amused at my \nplight and a little impressed, I think, by what she considered my \ngreat popularity with the masses. (As a matter of fact the prin- \ncipal attraction was my father, but, as he was away, I had to \nface the music.) She turned to me suddenly and asked me how \nI liked this hero-worship. Did I not feel proud of it? I hesitated \na little before answering, and this led her to think that she had, \nperhaps, embarrassed me by too personal a question. She apolo- \ngised. She had not embarrassed me in the least, but I found the \nquestion difficult to answer. My mind wandered away, and I \nbegan to analyse my own feelings and reactions. They were very \nmixed. \n\nIt was true that I had achieved, almost accidentally as it \nwere, an unusual degree of popularity with the masses; I was \nappreciated by the intelligentsia; and to young men and women \nI was a bit of a hero, and a halo of romance seemed to surround \nme in their eyes. Songs had been written about me, and the \nmost impossible and ridiculous legends had grown up. Even my \nopponents had often put in a good word for me and patronis- \ningly admitted that I was not lacldng in competence or in good \nfaith. \n\nOnljr a saint, perhaps, or an inhuman monster could survive \nall this, tmscathed and unaffected, and I can place myself in \nneither of these categories. It went to my head, intoxicated me a \nlittle, and gave me confidence and strength. I became ^I imagine \n, for it is a difficult task to look at oneself from outside) just a \nlittle bit autocratic in my ways, just a shade dictatorial. And \nyet I do not think that mj conceit increased markedly. I had a \nfair measure of my abilities, I thought, and I was by no means \nhumble about them. But  knew well enough that there was \nnothing at all remarkable about them, and I was very conscious \nof my Failings. A habit of introspection probably helped me to \nretain my balance and view many happenings connected with \nmyself in a detached manner. Experience of public life showed \nme that popularity was often the handmaiden of undesirable \npersons; it was certainly not an invariable sign of virtue or \nintelligence. Was I popular then because of my failings or my \naccomplishments? Why indeed was I popular? \n\n\n\nINDEPENDENCE AND AFTER  \n\nNot because of intellectual attainments, for they were not \nextraordinary, and, in any event, they do not make for popu- \nlarity. Not because of so-called sacrifices, for it is patent that \nhundreds and thousands in our own day in India have suffered \ninfinitely more, even to the point of the last sacrifice. My repu- \ntation as a hero is entirely a bogus one, and I do not feel at all \nheroic, and generally the heroic attitude or the dramatic pose in \nlife strikes me as silly. As for romance,  should say that I am \nthe least romantic of individuals. It is true that I have some \nphysical and mental courage, but the background of that is \nprobably pride ; personal, group, and national, and a reluctance * \nto be coerced into anything. \n\nI had no satisfactory answer to my question. Then I proceeded \nalong a diflerent line of inquiry. I found that one of the most \npersistent legends about my father and myself was to the effect \nthat we used to send our linen weekly from India to a Paris \nlaundry. We have repeatedly contradicted this, but the legend \npersists. Anything more fantastic and absurd it is difficult for \nme to imagine, and if anyone is foolish enough to indulge in \nthis wasteml snobbery, I should have thought he would get a \nspecial mention for being a prize fool. \n\nAnother equally persistent legend, often repeated in spite of \ndenial, is that I was at school with the Prince of Wales. The \nstory goes on to say that when the Prince came to India in iqai \nhe asked for me; I was then in gaol. As a matter of fact,  was \nnot only not at school with him, but I have never had the advan- \ntage of meeting him or speaking to him. \n\nI do not mean to imply that my reputation or popularity, such \nas they are, depend on these or similar legends. They may have \na more secure foundation, but there is no doubt that the super- \nstructure has a thick covering of snobbery, as is evidenced by \nthese stories. At any rate, there is the idea of mixing in high \nsociety and living a life of luxury and then renouncing it all, \nand renunciation has always appemed to the Indian mind. As a \nbasis for a reputation this does not at all appeal to me. I prefer \nthe active virtues to the passive ones, and renunciation and sacri- \nfice for their own sakes have litde appeal for me. I do value \nthem &om another point of view\u2014 that of mental and spiritual \ntraining\u2014 just as a simple and regular life is necessary for the \nathlete to keep in good physical condition. And die capacity for \nendurance and perseverance in spite of hard knocks is essential \nfor those who wish to dabble in great undertakings. But I have \nno liking or attraction for the ascetic view of life, the negation \nof life, the terrified abstention firom its joys a.nd sensadons. I \n\n\n\no \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nhave not consciously renounced anything that I really valued; \nbut then values change. \n\nThe question that my friend had asked me still remained un- \nanswered; did I not feel proud of this hero-worship of the \ncrowd? I disliked it and wanted to run atvay from it, and yet I \nhad got used to it, and when it was wholly absent, I rather missed \nit. Neither way brought .satisfaction, but, on the whole, the \ncrowd had filled some inner need of mine. The notion that I \ncould influence them and move them to action gave me a sense \nof authority over their minds and hearts; and this satisfied, to \nsome extent, my tvill to power. On their part, they exercised a \nsubtle tyranny over me, for their confidence and affection moved \ninner depths within me and evoked emotional responses. \nIndividualist as I was, sometimes the barriers of individuality \nseemed to melt away, and I felt that it would be better to be \naccursed with these unhappy people than to be saved alone. But \nthe barriers were too solid to disappear, and I peeped over them \nvirith wondering eyes at this phenomenon which I railed to under- \nstand. \n\n\nConceit, like fat on the human body, grows imperceptibly, \nIwer upon layer, and the person whom it affects is unconscious \nof the daily accretion. Fortunately the hard knocks of a mad \nworld tone it down or even squash it completely, and there has \nbeen no lack of these hard knocks for us in India during recent \nyears. The school of life has been a difficult one for us, and \nsuffering is a hard taskmaster. \n\nI have been fortunate in another respect also \u2014 the possession \nof family members and friends and comrades, who have helped \nme to retain a proper perspective and not to lose my mental \nequilibrium. Public funaions, addresses by municipalities and \nlocal boards and other public bodies!, processions and the like, \nused to be a great strain on my nerves and my sense of humour \nwd reality. The most extravagant and pompous language would \nw used, Md everybody would look so solemn and pious that I \nfelt an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh, or to stick out \nmy tongue, or stand on my head, just for the pleasure of shock- \ning and w\u00abching the reacrions on the faces at that august \nassetnblyl Fortunately for my reputation and for the sober res- \npcrabihty of public life in India, I have suppressed this mad \nand usually behaved with due propriety. But not always \noom^es there has been an exhibition on my part in a crowded \n\nin processions, which I find extra- \nordt^y trymg. I have sudd^y left a procession, arranged in \nour honour, and disappeared in the crowd, leaving my wife or \n\n\n\nINDEPENDENCE AND AFTER  \n\nsome Other person to carry on, perched up in a car or carriage, \nwith that procession. \n\nThis continuous effort to suppress one\u2019s feelings and behave \nin public is a bit of a strain, and the usual result is that one puts \non a glum and solid look on public occasions. Perhaps because \nof this I was once described in an article in a Hindu magazine \nas resembling a Hindu widow! I must say that, much as I \nadmire Hindu widows of the old type, this gave me a shock. \nThe author evidently meant to praise me for some qualities he \nthought I possessed \u2014 a spirit of gentle resignation and renuncia- \ntion and a smileless devotion to work. I had hoped that I pos- \nsessed \u2014 and, indeed, I wish that Hindu tvidows would possess \u2014 \nmore active and aggressive qualities and the capacity for humour \nand laughter. Gandhiji once told an interviewer that if he had \nnot had the gift of humour he might have committed suicide, \nor something to this effect. I would not presume to go so far, \nbut life certainly w'ould have been almost intolerable for me but \nfor the humour and light touches that .some people gave to it, \n\nMy vety popularity and the brave addresses that came my way, \nfoil (as is, indeed, the custom of all such addresses in India) of \nchoice and flowery language and extravagant conceits, became \nsubjects for raillery in the circle of my family and intimate \nfriends. The high-sounding and pompous words and titles that \nwere often used for all those prominent in the national move- \nment, were picked out by my wife and sisters and others and \nbandied about irreverently. I was addressed as Bharat Bhushan \u2014 \n\u2018Jewel of India\u2019 Tyagamurti \u2014 ^\u2018O Embodiment of Sacrifice\u2019; \nand this light-hearted treatment soothed me, and the tension \nof those solemn public gatherings, where I had to remain on my \nbest behaviour, gradually relaxed. Even my little daughter \njoined in the game. Only my mother insisted on taking me \nseriously, and she never wholly approved of any sarcasm or \nraillery at the expense of her darling boy. Father was amused; \nhe had a way of quietly expressing his deep understanding and \nsympathy. \n\nBut aU these shouting crowds, and dull and wearying public \nfunctions, and interminable arguments, and the dust and tumble \nof politics touched me on the surface only, though sometimes \nthe touch was sharp and pointed. My real conflict lay within \nme, a conflict of ideas, desires and loyalties, of subconscious \ndepths struggling with outer circumstances, of an inner hunger \nunsatisfied. I became a battleground, where various forces \nstruggled for mastery. I sought an escape from this; I tried to \nfind harmony and equilibrium, and in this, attempt I rushed \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nao \n\ninto action. That gave me some peace; outer conflict relieved \nthe strain of the inner struggle. \n\nWhy am I writing all this sitting here in prison? The quest \ni.? stiirthe .same, in prison or outside, and I write down my past \nfeelings and experiences in the hope that this may bring me \nsome peace and psychic satisfaction.  CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BEGINS \n\nIndependence Day came, January ath. , and it revealed to \nus, as in a flash, the earnest and enthusiastic mood of the \ncountry. There was something vastly impressive about the great \ngatherings everywhere, peacefully and solemnly taking the \npledge of independence * without any speeches or exhortation. \nThis celebration gave the necessary impetus to Gandhiji, and he \nfelt, with his sure touch on the pulse of the people, that the \ntime was ripe for action. Events followed then in quick suc- \ncession, like a drama w-orking up to its climax. \n\nAs Civil Disobedience approached and electrified the atmo- \nsphere, our thoughts went back to the movement of - and \nthe manner of its sudden suspension after Qiauri Chaura. The \ncountry was more disciplined now, and there was a clearer \nappreciation of the nature of the struggle. The technique was \nunderstood to some extent, but more important still from \nGandhiji\u2019s point of view, it was fully realised by every one that \nhe was terribly in earnest about non-violence. There could be \nno doubt about that now as there probably was in the minds of \nsome people ten years before. Despite all this, how could we \npossibly be certain that an outbreak of violence might not occur \nin some locality either spontaneously or as the result of an in- \ntrigue? And if such an incident occurred, what would be its \neffect on our civil disobedience movement? Would it be suddenly \nwound up as before? That prospect w^as most disconcerting. \n\nGandhiji probably thought over this question also in his own \nway, though the problem that seemed to trouble him, as far as \nI could gather from scraps of conversation, was put differently. \n\nThe non-violent method of action to bring about a change for \nthe better was to him the only right method and. if rightly \npursued, an infallible method. Must it be said that this method \nrequired a specially favourable atmosphere for its functioning \nand succe.ss, and that it should not be tried if outward conditions \nwere not suited to it? That led to the conclusion that the non- \nviolent method was not meant for all contingencies, and was \nthus neither a universal nor an infallible method. This con- \nclusion was intolerable for Gandhiji, for be firmly believed that \nit was a universal and infallible method. Therefore, necessarily, \n\n* This pledge is given in Appendix A. (p. or). \naoo \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NRHRU \n\nit must fuiiciioii even tlmugh the external conditions were un- \nfavourable. and even in the midst of strife and violence. The \nway of its functioning might be varied to suit varying circum- \nstances, but to stop it would be a confession of failure of the \nmethod itself. \n\nPerhaps his mind worked in some such way, but I cannot be \nsure of his thoughts. He did ^ve us the impression that there \nwas a slightly diffei'cnt orientation to his thinking, and that Civil \nDisobedience, when it came, need not be stopped because of a \nsporadic act of violence. If, however, the violence became in \nany way part of the movement itself, then it ceased to be a \npeaceful civil disobedience movement, and its activities had to \nbe curtailed or varied. This assurance went a long way in satis- \nfying many of us. The great question that hung in the air \nnow was \u2014 how? How were vve to begin? What irorm of civil \ndisobedience should we take up that would be effective, suited \nto the circumstances, and popular with the masses? And then \nthe Mahatma gave the hint. \n\nSalt suddenly became a mysterious word, a word of power. \nThe Salt Tax was to be attacked, the salt laws were to be broken. \nWe were bewildered and could not quite fit in a national \nstruggle with common .salt. Anodier surprising development was \nGandhiji\u2019s announcement of his \u2018 Eleven Points What was the \npoint of making a list of some political and social refiirms \u2014 good \nm themselves, no doubt \u2014 when we were talking in terms of \nindependence? Did Gandhiji mean the same thing when he used \nthis term as we did, or did we speak a different ^guage? We \nhad no time to argue for events were on the move. They were \nmoving politically before our eyes from day to day in India; and, \nhardly realised by us at the time, they were moving fast in the \nworld and holding it in the grip of a terrible depression. Prices \nwere falling, and the city dwellers welcomed this as a sign of \nthe plenty to come, but the farmer and the tenant saw the pros- \npect with alarm. \n\nThen came Gandhiji\u2019s correspondence with the Viceroy and \nthe beginning of the Dandi Salt Mardi ffom the Ashram at \nSabarmati^ As people followed the fertimes of this marching \ncolumn of pilgrims from day to day, the temperature of the \ncountry went up. A meeting of the All-India Congress Com- \nmittee was held at Alimedabad to make final arrangements fi)r \nthe struggle that was now almost upon us. The Leader in the \nstruggle was not present, for he was already tramping with his \npilgrim hand to the sea, and he refused to return. The A,I.C.C. \nplanned what should be done in case of arrests, and large powers \n\n\n\nCIVIL i^laUuLUlLNCj-^ Bi:.UlNo \n\n\n \n\n\nwere given to the President to act on behalf of the Committee, \nin case it could not meet, to nominate members of the Working \nCommittee in place of those arrested, and to nominate a suc- \ncessor for himself with the same powers. Similar powers were \ngiven by Provincial and local Congress Committee.s to their \npresidents. \n\nThus was inaugurated a regime when so-called \u2018 dictators \u2019 \nflourished and controlled the struggle on behalf of the Congress. \nSecretaries of State for India and Viceroys and Governors have \nheld up their hands in horror and proclaimed how vicious and \ndegraded was the Congress because it believed in dictatorships; \nthey, of course, being convinced adherents of democracy. \nOccasionally the Moderate Press in India has also preached to \nus the virtues of democracy. We listened to all this in silence \n(because we were in prison) and in amazement. Brazen-faced \nhypocrisy could hardly go further. Here was India being \ngoverned forcibly under an absolute dictatorship with Ordinance \nlaws and suppression of every kind of civil liberty, and yet our \nrulers talked unctuously of democracy. Even normally, where \nwas the shadow of democracy in India? It was no doubt natural \nfor the British Government to defend its power and vested in- \nterests in India and to suppress those who sought to challenge \nits authority. But its assertion that all this was the democratic \nmethod was worthy of record for future generations to admire \nand ponder over. \n\nThe Congress had to face a situation when it would be impos- \nsible for it to function normally; when it would be declared an \nunlawful organisation, and its committees could not meet for \nconsultation or any action, except secretly. Secrecy was not \nencouraged by us, as tve wanted to keep our struggle a perfectly \nopen one, and thus to keep up oiu: tone and influence the masses. \nBut even secret work did not take us far. All our leading men \nand women at the centre, as well as in the provinces and in local \nareas, were botmd to be arrested. Who was then to carry on? \nThe only course open to us was, after the fashion of an army \nin action, to make arrangements for new commanders to be \nappointed as old ones were disabled. We could not sit down in \nthe field of battle and hold committee meetings. Indeed, we did \nso sometimes, but the object of this, and the inevitable result, \nwas to have the whole committee arrested en bloc. We did not \neven have the advantage of a general staff sitting safely behind \nthe lines, or a dvilian cabinet in still greater saety elsewhere. \nOur general staffs and cabinets had to keep, by the very nature of \nour struggle, in the most advanced and exposed positions, and \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAIIARLAL NEHRU \n\nthey were arrested and removed in the early stages. And what \nwas the power we conferred on our \u2018 dictators \u2019? It was an honour \nfor them to be put forward as symbols of the national determina- \ntion to carry on the struggle: but the actual authority they had \nwa.s largely confined to ' dictating \u2019 thera.selves to prison. They \ncould only function at all when the committee they represented \ncould not meet on account of force majeure-, and wherever and \nwhenever that committee could meet, the 'dictator\u2019 -lost his \nindividual authority, such as it was. He or she could not tackle \nany basic problems or principles; only minor and superficial \nphases of the movement could be affected by the \u2018dictator\u2019. \nCongress \u2018 dictatorships \u2019 were really stepping-stones to prison; \nand from day to day this proces.s went on, new persons taking \nthe place of those who were disabled. \n\nAnd so, having made our final preparations, we bade good-bye \nto our comrades of the All-India Congress Committee at \nAhmedabad, for none knew when or how we would meet again, \nor whether we would meet at all. We hastened back to our posts \nto give the finishing touches to our local arrangements, in \naccordance with the new directions of the A.I.C.C., and, as \nSarojini Naidu said, to p^ck up our toothbrushes for the journey \nto prison. \n\nOn our way back, father and I went to see Gandhiji. He was \nat Jambusar with his\u2019pilgrim band and we spent a few hours \nwith him there, and then saw him stride away with his party \nto the next stage in the journey to the salt sea. That was my \nlast glimpse of him then as I saw him, staff in hand, marching \nalong at the head of his followers, with firm step and a peaceful \nbut undaunted look. It was a moving sight. \n\nAt Jambusar my father had decided, in consultation with \nGandhiji, to make a gift of his old house in Allahabad to the \nnation and to rename this Swaraj Bhawan. On his return to \nAllahabad he made the announcement, and actually handed \nover charge to the Congress people; part of the large house being \nconverted into a hospital. He was unable to go through the legal \nformalities at the time, and, a year and half later, I created a \ntrust of the property, in accordrace with his wishes. \n\nApril came, and Gandhiji drew near to the sea, and we waited \nfor the word to begin civil disobedience by an attack on the salt \nlaws. For months past we had been drilling our volunteers, and \nKamala and Krishna (my wife and sister) had both joined them \nand donned male attire for the purpose. The volunteers had, of \ncourse, no arms or even sticks. The object of training them was \nto make them more efficient in their work and capable of dealing \n\n\n\nCIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BEGINS \n\n\n \n\nwith large crowds. The th of April was the first day of the \nNational Week, which is celebrated annually in memory of the \nhappenings in , Irom Satyagraha Day to Jallianwala Bagh. \nOn that day Gandhiji began the breach of the salt laws at Dandi \nbeach, and three or four days later permission was given to all \nCongress organisations to do likewise and begin Civil Dis- \nobedience in their own areas. \n\nIt seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released; and \nall over the country, in town and village, salt manufacture was \nthe topic of the day, and many curious expedients were adopted \nto produce salt. We knew precious little about it, and so we read \nit up where we could, and issued leaflets giving directions, and \ncollected pots and pans and ultimately succeeded in producing \nsome unwholesome stuff, which we waved about in triumph, \nand often auctioned for fancy prices. It was really immaterial \nwhether the stuff was good or bad; the main thing was to commit \na breach of the obnoxious Salt I..aw, and we were successful \nin that, even though the quality of our salt was poor. As we saw \nthe abounding enthusiasm or the people and the way salt- \nmaking was spreading like a prairie fire, we felt a little abashed \nand ashamed for having questioned the efficacy of this method \nwhen it was first proposed by Gandhiji. And we marvelled at \nthe amazing knack of the man to impress the multitude and \nmake it act in an organised way. \n\nI was arrested on the th of April as I was entraining for \nRaipur in the Central Provinces, where I was going to attend \na conference. That very day I was tried in prison and sentenced \nto six months\u2019 imprisonment under the Salt Act. In anticipation \nof arrest I had nominated (under the new powers given to me \nby the A.I.C.) Gandhiji to act as Congress President in ray \nabsence, but, fearing his refusal, my second nomination was for \nfather. As I expected, Gandhiji would not agree, and so father \nbecame the acting-President of the Congress. He was in poor \nhealth, nevertheless he threw himself into the campaign with \ngreat energy; and, during those early months, his strong \n\nf uidance and enforcement of discipline was of tremendous \nenefit to the movement. The movement benefited greatly, but \nit was at the cost of such health and physical fitness as had \nremained in him. \n\nThose were days of stirring news\u2014 processions and lathi \ncharges and firing, frequent hartals to celebrate noted arrests, \nand special observances, like Peshawar Day, Garhwali Day, etc. \nFor the time being the boycott of foreign cloth and all British \ngoods was almost complete. When I heard that my aged mother \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nand, of course, my sisters used to stand under the hot summer \nsun picketing before foreign cloth shops, I was greatly moved. \nKamala did so also, but she did something more. She threw \nherself into the movement in Allahabad city and district with \nan energy and determination which amazed me. who thought \nI had known her so well for so many years. She forgot \nher ill-health and rushed about the whole day in the sun, and \nshowed remarkable powers of organisation. I heard of this \nvaguely in gaol. Later, when my father joined me there, I was \nto learn from him how much he had himself appreciated \nKamala\u2019s work, and especially her organising capacity. He did \nnot at all fancy my mother or the girls rushing about in the hot \nsun, but, except for an occasional remonstrance, he did not \ninterfere. \n\nThe biggest news of all that came to us in those early days \nwas of the ocairrences in Peshawar on April rd, and sub- \nsequently all over the Frontier Province. Anywhere in India \nsuch a. remarkable exhibition of disciplined and peacefiil courage \nbefore machine-gun firing would have stirred the country. In \nthe Frontier Province it had an additional significance, for the \nPathans, noted for their courage, were not noted for their peace- \nful nature; and these Pathans had set an example which was \nunique in India. In the Frontier Province also occurred the \nfamous incident of the refusal to fire on the civil population by \nthe Garhwali soldiers. They refused to fire because of a soldier's \ndistaste for firing on an unarmed crowd, and because, no doubt, \nof sympathy with the crowd. But even sympathy is not usually \nenough to induce a soldier to take the grave step of refusing to \nobey his officer\u2019s orders. He knows the consequences. The \nGarhwalis probably did so (in common with some other regi- \nments elsewhere whose disobedience did not receive publicity) \nbecause of a mistaken notion that the British power was collaps- \ning. Only when such an idea takes possession of the soldier does \nhe dare to act according to his own sympathies and inclinations. \nProbably for a few days or weeks the general commotion and \ncivil disobedience led some people to think that the last days \nof British rule had come, and this influenced part of the Indian \nArmy. Soon it became obvious that no such thing was going to \nhappen in the near future, and then there was no more dis- \nobedience in rile army. Care was also taken not to put them in \ncoxnpromising positions. \n\nNtoy strange things happened in those days, hut undoubtedly \nthe most striking was the part of the women in the national \nstruggle. They came out in large numbers from the sedusion \n\n\n\nCIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BEGINS IJ \n\nof tlieir homes and, though imusued to public activity, threv? \nthemselves into the heart of the struggle. The picketing of \nforeign cloth and liquor shops they made their preserve. \nEnormous processions consisting of women alone were taken \nout in all the cities; and, generally, the attitude of the women \nwas more unyielding than that of the men. Often they became \nCongress \u2018 dictators \u2019 in provinces and in local areas. \n\nThe breach of the Salt Act soon became jmt one activity, and \ncivil resistance spread to other fields. This was facilitated by the \npromulgation of various ordinances by the Viceroy prohibiting \na number of activities. As these ordinances and prohibitions \ngrew, the opportunities for breaking them also grew, and civil \nresistance took the form of doing the very thing that the ordi- \nnance tvas intended to stop. The initiative definitely remained \nwith the Congress and the people, and as each ordinance law \nfailed to control the situation from the point of vietv of govern- \nment, fresh ordinances were issued by the Viceroy. Many of the \nCongress Working Committee members had been arrested, but \nit continued to function with new members added on to it, \nand each official ordinance was countered by a resolution of the \nWorking Committee giving directions as to how to meet it. \nThese directions were carried out with surprising uniformity all \nover this country \u2014 with one exception, the one relating to the \npublication of newspapers. \n\nWhen an ordinance was issued for the further control of the \nPress and the demand of security from newspapers, the Working \nCommittee called upon the Nationalist Press to refuse to give \nany security, and to stop publication instead. This was a hard \npill to swallow for the newspapermen, for just then the public \ndemand for news was very great. Still the great majority of \nnewspapers \u2014 some Moderate papers excepted \u2014 stopped publica- \ntion, with the result that all manner of rumours began to spread. \nBut they could not hold out for long, the temptation was too \ngreat, and the sight of their moderate rivals picking up their \nbusiness too irritating. So most of them drifted back to pub- \nlication. \n\nGandhiji had been arrested on May th. After his arrest big \nraids on the salt pans and depots were organized on the west \ncoast. There were very painful incidents of police brutality \nduring these raids. Bombay then occupied the centre of the \npicture with its tremendous hartals and processions and lathi \ncharges. Several emergency hospitals grew up to treat the vic- \ntims of these lathi charges. Much that was remarkable happened \nin Bombay, and being a great city it had the advantage or pub* \n\n\n\nI(J JAWAHAUI.AL NtHRU \n\nlicity. OccurrencYs of equal importance in small towns and the \nrural areas received no publicity. \n\nIn the latter half of June my father went to Bombay; and \nwith him went my mother and Kamala. They had a great \nreception, and during their stay there occurred some of the \nfiercest of the lathi charges. These were, indeed, becoming \nfrequent occurrences in Bombay. A fortnight or so later an \nextraordinary all-night ordeal took place there, when Malaviyaji \nand members of the Working Committee, at the head of a huge \ncrowd, spent the night facing the police, who blocked their way. \n\nOn his return from Bombay father was arrested on June th, \nand Syed JVIahmud was arrested tvith him. They were arrested \nas acting-president and Secretary of the Working Committee, \nwhich was declared unlawful. Both of them were sentenced to \nsix months. My father's arrest was probably due to his having \nissued a statement defining the duties of a soldier or policeman \nin the event of an order to fire on civil populations being given. \nThe statement was st];ictly a legal affair, and contained the \npresent British Indian law on this point. Nevertheless, it was \nconsidered a provocative and dangerous document. \n\nThe Bombay visit had been a great strain on father, and from \nearly morning to late at night he was kept busy, and he had to \ntake the responsibility for every important decision. He had \nlong been unwell, but now he returned fagged out, and decided, \nat the urgent advice of his doctors, to take complete rest \nimmediately. He arranged to go to Mussoorie and packed up \nfor it, but the day before he intended leaving for Mussoorie, he \nappeared before us in our barrack in Naini Central Prison.  IN NAINI PRISON \n\nI HAD gone back to gaol after nearly seven years, and memories \nof prison life had somewhat faded. I was in Naini Central \nPrison, one of the big prisons of the province, and I was to have \nthe novel experience of being kept by myself. My enclosure was \napart from the big enclosure containing the gaol population of \nbetween aaoo and . It was a small enclosure, circular in \nshape, with a diameter of about one hundred feet, and with a \ncircular wall about fifteen feet high surrounding it. In the middle \nof it was a drab and ugly building containing four cells. I was \ngiven two of these celb, connecting with each other, one to \nserve as a bathroom and lavatory. The others remained un- \noccupied for some time. \n\nAfter the exciting and very active life I had been leading \noutside, I felt rather lonely and depressed. I was tired out, and \nfor two or three days I slept a great deal. The hot weather had \nalready begun, and I was permitted to sleep at night in the open, \noutside my cell in the narrow space between the inner building \nand the enclosing wall. My bed was heavily chained up, lest I \nmight take it up and walk away, or, more probably, to avoid \nthe hed being used as a kind of scaling ladder to climb the wall \nof the enclosure. The nights were full of strange noises. The \nconvict overseers, who guarded the main wall, frequently shouted \nto each other in varying keys, sometimes lengthening out their \ncries till they sounded like the moaning of a distant wind; the \nnight-watchmen in the barracks were continually counting away \nin a loud voice the prisoners under their charge and shoutii^ out \nthat all was well; and several times a night some gaol official, \ngoing his rounds, visited our enclosure and shouted an enquiry \nto the warder on duty. As my enclosure was some distance away \nfrom the others, most of these voices reached me indistinctly, \nand I could not make out at first what they were. At times I felt \nas if I was on the verge of the forest, and the peasantry were \nshouting to keep the wild animals away from their fields; some- \ntimes if seemed the forest itself and the beasts of the night were \nkeeping up their nocturnal chorus. \n\nWas it my fancy, I wonder, or is it a fact that a circular wall \nreminds one more of captivity than a rectangular one? The \nabsence of corners and angles adds to the sense of oppression. \n\nSI \n\n\n\ni JAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\nIn the daytime that wall even encroached on the sky and only \nallowed a glimpse of a narrow-bounded portion. With a wistful \neye I looked \n\n\" Upon that little tent of blue \nWhich prisoners call the sky, \n\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went \nWith sails of silver by.\u201d \n\nAt night that wall enclosed me all the more, and I felt as if \nI was at the bottom of a well. Or else that- part of the star-lit sky \nthat I saw ceased to be real and seemed part of an artificial \nplanetarium. \n\nMy barrack and enclosure were popularly known throughout \nthe gaol as the Kuttaghar\u2014ths. Dog House. This was an old \nname which had nothing to do with me. The little barrack had \nbeen built originally, apart from all others, for especially danger- \nous criminals who had to be isolated. Latterly it had been used \nfor political prisoners, detenus, and the like who could thus be \nkept apart from the rest of the gaol. In front of the enclosure, \nsome distance away, was an erection that gave me a shock when \n first had a glimpse of it from my barrack. It looked like a \nhuge cage, and men went round and round inside it. I found \nout later that it was a water-pump worked by human labour, \nas many as sixteen persons being employed at a time. I got used \nto it as one gets used to everything, but it has always seemed to \nme one of the mast foolish and barbarous ways of utilising \nhuman labour-power. And whenever I pass iti think of the zoo. \n\nFor some days I was not permitted to go outside my enclosure \nfor exercise or any other purpose. I was later allowed to go out \nfor half an hour in the early mornings, when it was almost dark, \nand to walk or run under the main wall. That early morning \nhour had been fixed for me so that I might not come in contact \nwith, or be seen by, the other prisoners. I liked that outing, and \nit refr^hed nie tremendously. In order to compress as much \nopen-air exercise as I could in the short time at my disposal, I \ntook to running, and gradually increased this to over two miles \ndaily. \n\nI used to get up very early in the morning, about fijur, or even \nhalf-past three, when it was quite dark. Partly this was due to \ngoing to bed early, as the light provided was not good for much \nrea^ng. I liked to watch the stars, and the position of some \nwell-known constellation would give me the approximate time. \nFrom where I lay I could just see the Pole Star peeping over \nthe wail, and as it was always there, I found it extraordinarily \n\n\n\nIN NAINI PRISON \n\n\n \n\ncomforting. Surrounded by a revolving sky, it seemed to be a \nsymbol of cheerful constancy and perseverence. \n\nFor a month I had no companion, but I was not alone, as I \nhad the warder and the convict overseers and a convict cook and \ncleaner in my enclosure. Occasionally other prisoners came there \non some business, most of them being convict overseers \u2014 C.O.\u2019s \n\u2014 serving out long sentences. 'Lifers\u2019 \u2014 convicts sentenced for \nlife \u2014 were common. Usually a life-sentence was supposed to ter- \nminate after twenty years, or even less, but there were many in \nprison then who had served more than twenty years already. I \nsaw one very remarkable case in Naini. Prisoners carry about, \nattached to their clothes at the shoulder, little wooden boards \ngiving information about their convictions and mentioning the \ndate when release was due. On the board of one prisoner I read \nthat his date of release was ! He had already, m , served \nout several years, and he w'as then a person of middle age. Prob- \nably he had been given several sentences and they had been \nadded up one after the other; the total, I think, amounting to \nseventy-five years. \n\nFor years and years many of these \u2018 lifers \u2019 do not see a child \nor woman, or even animals. They lose touch with the out- \nside world completely, and have no human contacts left. They \nbrood and wrap themselves in angry thoughts of fear and re- \nvenge and hatred; forget the good of the wond, the kindness and \njoy, and live only wrapped up in the evil, till gradually even \nhatred loses its edge and life becomes a soulless thing, a machine- \nlike routine. Like automatons they pass their days, each exactly \nlike the other, and have few sensations, except one \u2014 fear! From \ntime to time the prisoner\u2019s body is weighed and measured. But \nhow is one to weigh the mind and the spirit which wilt and stunt \nthemselves and wither away in this terrible atmosphere of \noppression? People argue against the death penalty, and their , \narguments appeal to me greatly. But when I see the long drawn- \nout agony, of a life spent in prison, I feel that it is perhaps \nbetter to have that penalty rather than to kill a person slowly \nand by degrees. One of the 'lifers\u2019 came up to me once and \nasked me : \u201c What of us lifers? Will Swaraj take us out of this \nhell? \u201d \n\n\u2022Who are these lifers? Many of them come in gang cases, \nwhen large numbers, as many as fifty or a hundred, may be \nconvicted en bloc. Some of these are probably guilty, but I doubt \nif most of those convicted are really guilty; it is easy to get \npeople involved in such cases. An approver\u2019s evidence, a little \nidentification, is all that is needed. Dacoities are increasing now^ \n\n\n\nJ AWAII A . At* NEHRU \n\nadays and the prison population goes up year by year. If people \nstarve, wJiat are they to do? Judges and magistrates wax \neloquent about the increase of crime, but are blind to the \nobvious economic cause.s of it. \n\nThen there are the agriculturists who have a little village riot \nover some land dispute, lalhis fly about, and somebody dies\u2014 \nresult, many people in gaol for life or for a long term. Often all \nthe menfolk in a family will be imprisoned in this way, leaving \nthe women to carry on as best they can. Not one of these is \na criminal type. Generally they are fine young men, consider- \nably above the aver.ige villager, both physically and mentally. \nA little training, some diversion of interest to other subjects \nand jobs, and these people would be valuable assets to the \ncountry. \n\nIndian prisons contain, of course, hardened criminals, persons \nwho are aggressively anti-social and dangerous to the com- \nmunity. But I have been amazed to find large numbers of fine \ntypes in prison, boys and men, whom I would trust unhesi- \ntatingly. I do not know what the proportion of real criminals \nto non<riminal types is, and probably no one in the prison \ndepartment has ever even thought of this distinction. Some \ninteresting figures are given on this subject by Lewis E. Lawes, \nthe Warden of Sing Sing Prison in New York. He says of his \nprison population, that to his knowledge  per cent, are not \ncriminally inclined at all; that  per cent, are the products of \ncircumstances and environment; that of the remaining  per \ncent, only a possible half, that is  per cent., are aggressively \nanti-sodal. It is a weU-known fact that real criminality flourishes \nmore in the big cities and centres of modem civilisation than \nin the undevelcmed countries. American gangsterdom is notori- \nous, and Sing Sing has a special reputation as a prison where \nsome of the worst criminals And yet, according to its \nwarden, only  per cent, of its prisoners are really bad. I \n.think it may very safely be said that this proportion is far \nless in an Indian prison, A more sensible economic policy, \nmore employment, more education would soon empty out our \nprisons. But of course to make that successful, a radical plan, \naffecting the whole of our social febric, is essential. Tlie only \nother real alternative is what the British Government is doing : \nincreasing its police forces and enlarring its prisons in India, \nThe number of pEarsons sent to gaol m India is appalling. In \na recent^ report issued b^ the Secretary of the All-India \nPrisoners Aid Sodety, it is stated that in the Bombay Presi- \ndency alone , persons were sent to gaol in and tlie \n\n\n\nIN NAINI PRISON \n\n\n \n\n\nfigure for Bengal for the same year was ,.* I do not know \nthe figures for all the provinces, but if the total for two \nprovinces exceeds a quarter of a million, it is quite possible that \nthe All-India total approaches the million mark. This figure \ndoes not, of course, represent the permanent gaol population, \nfor a large number of persons get short sentences. The per- \nmanent population will be very much less, but still it must be \nenormous. Some of the major provinces in India are said to \nhave the biggest prison administrations in the world. The U.P. \nis among those supposed to have this doubtful honour, and \nvery probably it is, or was, one of the most backward and \nreactionary administrations. Not the least effort is made to \nconsider the prisoner as an individual, a human being, and to \nimprove or look after his mind. The one thing the U.P. \nadministration excels in is keeping its prisoners. There are \nremarkably few attempts to escape, and I doubt if one in ten \nthousand succeeds in escaping. \n\nOne of the most saddening features of the prisons is the \nlarge number of boys, from fifteen upwards, who are to be \nfound in them. Most of them are bright-looking lads who, if \ngiven the chance, might easily make good. Lately some \nbeginnings have been made to teach them the elements of \nreading and writing but, as usual, these are absurdly inade- \nquate and inefficient. There arc very few opportunities for \ngames or recreation, no newspapers of any kind are permitted \nnor are books encouraged. For twelve hours or more all \nprisoners are kept locked up in their barracks or cells with \nnothing whatever to do in the long evenings. \n\nInterviews are only permitted once in three months, and so \narc letters \u2014 a monstrously long period. Even so, many \nprisoners cannot take advantage of them. If they are illiterate, \nas most are, they have to rely on some gaol official to write \non their behalf ; and the latter, not being keen on adding to his \nother work, usually avoids it. Or, if a letter is written, the \naddress is not properly given and the letter does not reach. \nInterviews are still more difficult. Almost invariably they de- \npend on a gratification for some gaol official. Often prisoners \nare transferred to different gaols, and their people cannot trace \nthem. I have met many prisoners who had lost complete touch \nwith their families for years, and did not know what had \nhappened. Interviews, when they do take place after three \nmonths or more, ate most extraordinary, A number of \n\n\n* Statesman, December ii, . \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAIIARLAL NEKHtJ \n\n\nprisoners and their interviewers are placed togetlaer on cither \nside of a barrier, and they all try to talk simultaneously. There \nis a great deal of shouting at each other, and the slight human \ntouch that might have come from the interview is entirely \nabsent. \n\nA very small number of prisoners, ordinarily not exceeding \none in a thousand (Europeans excepted), are given some extra \nprivileges in the shape of better food and more frequent inter- \nviews and letters. During a big political civil resistance move- \nment, when scores of thousands of political prisoners go to \ngaol, this figure of special class prisoners goes up slightly, but \neven so it is very low. About  per cent, of these political \nprisoners, men and women, are treated in the ordinary way \nand are not given even these facilities. \n\nSome individuals, sentenced for revolutionary activities for \nlife or long terms of imprisonment, are often kept in solitary \nconfinement for long periods. In the U.P., I believe, all such \npersons are automatically kept in solitary cellular confinement. \nOrdinarily, this solitary confinement is awarded as a special \npunishment for a prison offence. But in the case of these per- \nsons\u2014 -usually young boys\u2014 they are kept alone although their \nbehaviour in gaol might be exemplary. Thus an additional \nand very terrible punishment is added by the Gaol Department \nto the sentence of the court, without any reason therefor. This \nseems very extraordinary, and hardly in conformity with any \nrule of law. Solitary confinement, even for a short period, is \na most painful affair; for it to be prolonged for years is a \nterrible thing. It means the slow and continuous deterioration \nof the mind, till it begins to border on insanity; and the \nappearance of a look of vacancy, or a frightened animal type \nof expression. It is the lulling of the spirit by degrees, the slow \nvmsection of the soul. Even if a man survives it, he becomes \nabnormal and an absolute misfit in the world. And the question \nalways arises \u2014 wm this man guilty at all of any act or offence? \nPolice methods in India have long been suspect; in political \nmatters they are doubly so. \n\nEuropean or Eurasian prisoners, whatever their crime or \nstams, am automatically placed in a higher class and get better \nfood, lighter work and more interviews and letters. A weekly \nvisit from a clergyman keeps them b touch with outside affairs, \nihe parson brmgs them foreign illustrated and humorous \npapers, and communicates with their families when necessary. \n\nNo one grudges the European convicts these privileees, for \nthey are few enough, but it is a little painful to see the utter \n\n\n\nIN NAINI PRISON \n\n\n \n\nabsence of any human standard in the treatment of others \u2014 \nmen and women. The convict is not thought of as an indi- \nvidual human being, and so he or she is seldom treated as such. \nOne sees in prison the inhuman side of the State apparatus \nof administrative repression at its worst. It is a machine which \nworks away callously and imthinkingly, crushing all that come \nin its grip, and the gaol rules have been purposely framed to- \nkeep this machine in evidence. Offered to sensitive men and \nwomen, this soulless regime is a torture and an anguish of the \nmind. I have seen long-term convicts sometimes breaking down \nat the dreariness of it all, and weeping like little children. And \na word of sympathy and epcouragement, so rare in this atmos-> \nsphere, has suddenly made their faces light up with joy and \ngratitude. \n\nAnd yet among the prisoners themselves there were often \ntouching instances of charity and good comradeship. A blind \n\u2018habitual\u2019 prisoner was once discharged after thirteen years. \nAfter this long period he was going out, wholly unprovided for, \ninto a friendless world. His fellow convicts were eager to help \nhim, but they could not do much. One gave his shirt deposited \nin the gaol office, another some other piece of clothing. A third \nhad that very morning received a new pair of chappals (leather \nsandals) and he had shown them to me with some pride. It was \na great acquisition in prison. But when he saw this blind com- \npanion of many years going out bare-footed, he willingly parted \nwith his new chappals. I thought then that there appeared to* \nbe more charity inside the gaol than outside it. \n\nThat year  was full of dramatic situations and inspiring, \nhappenings; what surprised most was the amazing power of \nGandhiji to inspire and enthuse a whole people. Tnere was \nsomething almost hypnotic about it, and we remembered the \nwords used by Gokhale about him : how he had the power of \nmaking heroes out of clay. Peaceful civil disobedience as a \ntechnique of action for achieving great national ends seemed \nto have justified itself, and a quiet confidence grew in the \ncountry, shared by friend and opponent alike, that we were \nmarching towards victory. A strange excitement filled those \nwho were active in the movement, and some of this even crept \ninside the gaol. \u201c Swaraj is coming I \u201d said the ordinary con- \nvicts; and they waited impatiently for it, in the selfish hope \nthat it might do them some good. The warders, coming in \ncontart with the gossip of the bazaars, also expected that Swaraj \nwas near; the petty gaol official grew a little more nervous. \n\nWe had no daily newspapers in prison, but a Hindi weekly \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nbrought US some news, and often this news would set our \nimagination afire. Daily lathi charges, sometimes firing, \nmartial law at Sholapur with sentences of ten years for \ncarrying the national Hag. We felt proud of our people, and \nespecially of our womenfolk, all over the country. I had a \nspecial feeling of satisfaction because of the activities of my \nmother, wife and sisters, as well as many girl cousins and \nfriends; and though I was separated from th^em and was in \nprison, we grew nearer to each other, hound by a new sense \nof comradeship in a great cause. The family seemed to merge \ninto a larger group, and yet to retain its old flavour and \nintimacy. Kamala surprised me, for her energy and enthusiasm \novercame her physical ill-health and, for some time at least, \nshe kept well in spite of strenuous activities. \n\nThe thought that I was having a relatively easy time in \nprison, at a time when others were facing danger and suffering \noutside, began to oppress me. I longed to go out, and as I could \nnot do that, I made my life in prison a hard one, full of work. \n\nI used to spin daily for nearly three hours on my own cliarkha; \nfor another two or three hours I did n^war weaving, which I \nhad especially asked for from the gaol authorities. I liked these \nactivities. They kept me occupied without undue strain or \nrequiring too much attention, and they soothed the fever of \nmy mind. I read a great deal, and otherwise busied myself \nwith cleaning up, washing my clothes, etc. The manual labour \nI did was of my own choice as my imprisonment was ' simple \nAnd so, between thought of outside happenings and my \ngaol routine, I passed my days in Naini Prison. Watching the \nworking^ of an Indian prison, it struck me that it was not unlike \nthe British government of India. There is great efficiency in \nthe apparatus of government, which goes to strengthen the \nhold of the Government on the country, and little or no care \nfbi the human material of the country. Outwardly the prison \nmust appear efficiently run, and to some extent this was true. \nBut no One seemed to think that the main purpose of the \nprison must be to improve and help the unhappy individuals \nwho come to it. Break them \u2014 that is the idea, so that by the \nnme they go out, they may not have the least bit, of spirit left \nin them. And how is the prison controlled, and the convicts \nkept m check and punished? Very largely with the help of the \nthemselves, some of whom are made convict-warders \n(G.W s.) or convict-overseers (C-O.\u2019s.), and are induced to co- \noperate with the authorities because of fear, and in the hope \nof rewards and special remissions. There are relatively few \n\n\n\nIN NAINI PRISON \n\n\n \n\npaid non-convict-warders; most of the guarding inside the \nprison is done by convict-warders and C.O.\u2019s. A widespread \nsystem of spying pervades the prison, convicts being encouraged \nto become stool pigeons and to spy on each other; and no \ncombination or joint action is, of course, permitted among the \nprisoners. This is easy to understand, for only by keeping \nthem divided up could they be kept in check. \n\nOutside, in the government of our country, we see much of \nthis duplicated on a larger, though less obvious, scale. \u25a0 But \nthere the C.W.\u2019s. or C.O.\u2019s. are known differently. They have \nimpressive titles, and their liveries of office are more gorgeous. \nAnd behind them, as in prison, stands the armed guard with \nweapons ever ready to enrorce conformity. \n\nHow important and essential is a prison to the modern State! \nThe prisoner at least begins to think so, and the numerous \nadministrative and other functions of the government appear \nalmost superficial before the basic functions of the prison, the \npolice, the army. In prison one begins to appreciate the \nMarxian theory, that the State is really the coercive apparatus \nmeant to enforce the will of a group that controls the govern- \nment. \n\nFor a month I was alone in my barrack. Then a companion \ncame \u2014 ^Narmada Prasad Singh \u2014 ^and his coming was a relief. \nTwo and a half months later, on the last day of June , \nour little enclosure was the scene of unusual excitement. Un- \nexpectedly, early in the moraing, my father and Dr. Syed \nMahmud, were brought there. They had both been arrested \nin Anand Bhawan, while they were actually in their beds, that \nmorning.  NEGOTIATIONS AT YERAVDA \n\nMy father\u2019s arrest was accompanied by, or immediately preceded \nby, the declaration of the Congress Working Committee as an \nunlawful body. This led to a new development outside \u2014 the \nCommittee would be arrested en bloc when it was having a \nmeeting. Substitute members were added to it, under the \nauthority given to the Acting-Presidents, and in this way \nseveral women became acting members. Kamala was one of \nthem. \n\nFather was in very poor health when he came to gaol, and \nthe conditions in which he was kept there were of extreme \ndiscomfort. This was not intentional on the part of the Govern- \nment, for they were prepared to do what they could to lessen \nthose discomforts. But they could not do much in Naini Prison. \nFour of us were now crowded together in the four tiny cells of \nmy barrack. It was suggested by the superintendent of the \nprison that father might be kept in some other part of the gaol \nwhere he might have a little more room, but we preferred to \nbe together, so that some of us could attend personally to his \ncomforts. \n\nThe monsoon was just beginning and it wa.H not particularly \neasy to keep perfectly dry even inside the cells, for the raim \nwater came through the roof occasionally and dripped in \nvarious places. At night it was alw^s a problem where to put \nfather\u2019s bed, in the little loft. by jft. veranda attached to our \ncell, in order to avoid the rain. Sometimes he had fever. The \ngaol authorities ultimately decided to build an additional \nveranda, a fine broad one, attached to our cell. This veranda \nwas built and it was a great improvement, but father did not \nprofit by it much, as he was disenarged soon after it was ready. \nThose of us who continued to live in that barrack took full \nadvantage of it later. \n\nTowards the end of July there was a great deal of talk about \nSir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr, M. R. Jayakar, endeavouring \nto bnng about peace between the Congress and the Goverm \nment. We read about it in a daily newspaper, which was sup- \nplied as a special favour to father. We read in this paper the \ncorrespondence that had passed between the Viceroy, Lord \nIrwm, and Messrs. Sapru and Jayakar, and then we learnt that \n\n\u00bba \n\n\n\nNEGOTIATIONS AT YERAVDA * \n\nthe so-called \u2018 peacemakers \u2019 had visited Gandhiji. We did not \nknow at all what had induced them to take this initiative, or \nwhat they were driving at. Later we were told by them that \nthey had been encouraged to proceed in the matter because of \na brief statement that father had agreed to in Bombay a few \ndays before his arrest. The statement had been drafted by Mr. \nSlocombe (a correspondent of the London Daily Herald then \nin India) after a conversation with my father, and had been \napproved by the latter. This statement^ considered the possi- \nbility of the Congress withdrawing the civil disobedience cam- \npaign, subject to the Government agreeing to a number of \nconditions. It was a vague and tentative affair, and it made it \nquite clear that even those vague conditions could not be con- \nsidered till father had a chance of consulting Gandhiji and me. \nI came in as the President of the Congress for the year. I \nremember father mentioning it to me in Naini, after his arrest, \nand adding that he was rather sorry that he had given such a \nvague statement in a huriy, as it was possible that it might be \nmisunderstood. It was indeed misunderstood, as even the most \nexact and explicit statements are likely to be, by people whose \nway of thinking is entirely different. \n\nSir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar suddenly descended \non us in Naini Prison, on July th, with a note from Gandhiji. \n\n* Statement, dated Bombay, June , , agreed to by Pandit \nMotilal Nehru: \u201cIf in certain drcurastances die British Govern- \nment and the Government of India, although unable to anticipate \nthe recommendations that may in perfect freedom be made by the \nRound Table Conference or the attitude which the British Parlia- \nment may reserve for such recommendations, would nevertheless \nbe willing to give a private assurance that they would support 'the \ndemand for full responsible government for India, subject to such \nmutual adjustments and terms of transfer as are required by the \nspecial needs ^nd conditions of India and by her long association \nwith Great Britain and as may be decided by the Round Table \nConference! Pandit Motilal Nehru would undertake to take per- \nsonally stich an assurance \u2014 or the indication rcceiv^ from a \nresponsible third party that such an assurance wouldbe forth- \ncoming \u2014 to Mr. Gandhi and to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. If such \nan assurance were offered and accepted it would render possible \na general measure of conciliation which would entail the simul- \ntaneous calling off of the dvil disobedience movement, the cessation \nof the Government\u2019s present repressive policy and a general \nmeasure of amnesty for political prisoners, and would be followed \nby Congress participation in the Round Table Conference on terms \nto be mutually agreed upon.\u201d '' \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nOn that day and the next we had long interviews with them, \nwhich were very exhausting for father as he was actually \nfeverish then. We talked and argued in a circle, hardly under- \nstanding each other\u2019s language or thought, so great was the \ndifference in political outlook. It was obvious to us that there \nwas not the faintest chance of any peace between the Congress \n. and the Government as matters stood. We refused to make any \nsuggestions without first consulting our colleagues of the Work- \ning Committee, especially Gandhiji. And we wrote something \nto this effect to Gandhiji. \n\nEleven days later, on August th, Dr. Saprii came to see us \nagain with the Viceroy\u2019s reply. The Viceroy had no objection \nto our going to Yeravda (the prison in Poona where Gandhiji \nwas kept) but he and his Council could not allow us to meet \nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and other \nmembers of the Working Committee who were outside and \nwere still carrying on an active campaign against the Govern- \nment. Dr. Sapru asked us if we were prepared to go to Yeravda \nunder these circumstances. We told him that we had and could \nhave no objection to going to see Gandhiji at any time, but as \nwe could not meet our other colleagues there was no chance of \nour deciding anything finally. That very day\u2019s paper (or perhaps \nthat of the day before) had given the news of a fierce lathi \ncharge in Bombay, and the arrest there of Vallabhbhai Patel, \nMalaviyaji, Tasadduk Sherwani and others as permanent or \nacting members of the Working Committee. We pointed out \nto Dr. Sapru that this had not improved matters, and we asked \nhim to make the position quite clear to the Viceroy. Dr. Sapru, \nhowever, said that there would be no harm, in our meeting \nGandhiji as soon as possible. Wc had previously pointed out \nto him that in case we were sent to Yeravda, our colleague. \nDr. Syed Mahmud, who was with us at Naini, should also go \nthere as he was the Congress secretary. \n\nTwo days later, on August loth, the three of us\u2014 father, \nMahmud and I\u2014 were sent by a special train from Naini to \nPoon^ Our train did not stop at the big stations; we rushed \npast them, stopping at the small wayside ones. Still news of us \ntravelled ahead, and large crowds gathered both at the stations \nwhere we stopped and at those where we did not stop. We \nreached Kirkee, near Poona, late at night on the i ith. \n\nWe expected to be kept in the same barrack as Gandhiji or, at \nleast, to see him soon. That was the arrangement made by the \nSupenntendent of Yeravda prison, but at the last moment he \nhad to change his arrangements because of some instructions \n\n\n\nNEGOTIATIONS AT YERAVDA \n\n\n \n\n\nreceived through the police officer who had accompanied us \nfrom Naini. Lt.-Col. Martin, the Superintendent, would not \ntell us the secret, but a little subtle questioning by fatlier made \nit clear to us that the idea was that we should not meet Gand- \nhiji (for the first time, at least) except in the presence of Messrs. \nSapru and Jayakar. It was feared that a previous meeting \nbetween us might stiffen our attitude, or make us hold together \nmore firmly than otherwise. So that night and the whole of \nthe next day and night, we were kept apart in a separate \nbarrack, and father was exceedingly irritated at this. It was \ntantalising and annoying to be there and not to be allowed to \nsee Candhiji, to meet whom he had come all the way from \nNaini. On the forenoon of the th we were told that Sir Tej \nBahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar had arrived, and Mr. Gandhi \nhad joined them in the prison office, and we were asked to go \nthere ourselves. Father refused to go, and only agreed after \nvarious explanations and apologies, and on condition that we \nshould see Gandhiji alone first. At our joint request later, \nVallabhbhai Patel and Jairamdas Doulatram, who had both \nbeen brought to Yeravda, as well as Sarojini Naidu, who was \nkept in the Women\u2019s Prison opposite, were allowed to join our \nconference. Tliat evening father, Mahmud and I were moved \nto Gandhiji\u2019s enclosure and there we remained for the rest of \nour stay in Yeravda. Vallabhbhai Patel and Jairamdas Doulat* \nram were also brought there for those few days to enable us to \nconsult together. \n\nOur conferences in the prison office with Messrs. Sapru and \nJayakar lasted three days, the th, th and th August, and \nwe exchanged letters giving expression to our views and indi- \ncating the minimum conditions necessary to enable us to \nwithmaw civil disobedience and offer co-operation to the \nGovernment. Thbse letters were subsequently published in the \nnewspapers.^ \n\nThe strain of these conferences had told on father, and on \nthe  th he suddenly got high fever. This delayed our return, \nand we started back on the night of the rpth, again by special \ntrain, for Naini. Every effort was made by the Boinbay Govern- \nment to provide a comfortable journey for father, and even in \nYeravda, during our brief stay there, his comforts were studied. \nI remember an amusing incident on the night of our arrival at \nYeravda, Colonel Martin, the Superintendent, asked ffither \n\n^ The letter containing these nunimum conditions is given in \nAppendix B. (p. ). \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwhat kind of food he would like. Father told him that he look \nvery simple and light food, and then he enumerated his various \nrequirements from early morning tea in bed to dinner at night. \n(In Naini we used to get food for him daily from home.) The \nlist father gave in all innocence and simplicity consisted cer- \ntainly of light foods, but it was impressive. Very probably at \nthe Ritz or the Savoy it would have been considered simple \nand ordinary food, as father himself was convinced that it was. \nBut in Yeravda Prison it seemed strange and far away and most \ninappropriate. Mahmud and I were highly amused to watch \nthe expression on Colonel Martin\u2019s face as he listened to father\u2019s \nnumerous and expensive requirements in the way of food. For \na long time he had had in his keeping the greatest and most \nfamous of India\u2019s leaders, and all that he had required in the \nway of food was goat\u2019s milk, dates, and perhaps oranges occa- \nsionally. The new type of leader that had come to him was \nvery dilferent. \n\nDuring our journey back from Poona to Naini we again \nrushed by the big stations and stopped in out-of-the-way places. \nBut the crowds were larger still, filling the platfo'rms and some- \ntimes even swarming over the railway lines, especially at Harda, \nItarsi and SohagpUr. Accidents were narrowly averted. \n\nFather\u2019s condition was rapidly deteriorating. Many doctors \ncame to examine him, his own doctors as well as doctors sent \non behalf of ^e Provincial Government. It was obvious that \ngaol was the worst place for him and there could be no proper \ntreatment there. And yet, when a suggestion was made by \nsome friend in the Press that he should be released because of \nhis illness, he was irritated, as he thought that people might \nthink that the suggestion came from him. He even went to the \nlength of sending a telegram to Lord Irwin, saying that he did \nhot want to be released as a special favour. But his condition \nwas growing worse from day to day; he was losing weight \nrapidly, and , physically he was a shadow of himself On the \nth September he was discharged after exactly ten weeks of \nprison. \n\nOur barrack became a dull and Ufrless place after his depar- \nture. There was so much to be done when he was with us, \nlittle services to add to his comfort, and all of us\u2014 -Mahmud, \nNarmada. Prasad and I \u2014 filled our days with this joyful service, \nI had given up newar weaving, I spun very little, and I did not \nhave much time for books either. And now that he was gone, \nwe reverted rather heavily and joylessly to the old routine. \nEven the daily newspaper stopped after father's release. Four \n\n\n\nNEGOTIATIONS AT YERAVDA  \n\nor five days later my brother-in-law, Ranjit S. Pandit, was \narrested, and he joined us in our barrack. \n\nA month later, on October iith, I was discharged on the \nexpiry of six months\u2019 sentence. I knew I would have little fi^ee- \ndom, for the struggle was going on and becoming more intense. \nThe attempts of the ' peacemakers \u2019 \u2014 ^Messrs. Sapru and Jaya- \nkar \u2014 ^had failed. On the very day I was discharged one or two \nmore ordinances were announced. I was glad to be out and \neager to do something effective during my short spell of free- \ndom. \n\nKamala was in Allahabad then, busy with her Congress work; \nfather was under treatment at Mussoorie, and my mother and \nsisters were with him. I spent a busy day and a half in Alla- \nhabad before going up to Mussoorie myself with Kamala. The \ngreat question before us then, was whether a no-tax campaign . \nin the rural areas should be started or not. The time for rent \ncollection and payment of revenue was close at hand, and, in \nany event, collections were going to be difficult because of the \ntremendous fall in the prices of agricultural produce. The \nworld slump was now very evident in India. \n\nIt seemed an ideal opjjortunity for a no-tax campaign, both as \na part of the general civil disobedience movement and, iridepen- \ndently, on its own merits. It was manifestly impossible both for \nlandlords and tenants to pay up the full demand out of that \nyear\u2019s produce. They had to fell back on old reserves, if they \nhad any, or borrow. The zamindars usually had something to \nfell back upon, or could borrow more easily. The average \ntenant, always on the verge of destitution and starvation, had \nnothing to fall back upon. In any democratic country, or where \nthe agriculturists were properly organised and had influence, it \nwould have been quite impossible, under those circumstances, \nto make them pay much. In India their influence was negli- \ngible, except in so far as the Congress, in some parts of me \ncountry, stood for them; and except, of course, for the ever- \npresent fear of peasant risings when the situation became in- \ntolerable for them. But they had been trained for generations \npast to stand almost anything without much murmuring. \n\nIn Gujrat, and in some other parts, there were no-tax cam- \npaigns in progress at the time, but they were almost wholly , \npolitical canmaigns, started as parts of the civil disobedience' \nmovement. 'These were areas where the ryotwari system pre- \n,. vailed and the peasant proprietors dealt directly with the \nGovernment. Their non-payment of revenue affected the State \nimmediately. The United Provinces were different, for we were \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NICIIRU \n\n\n\u25a0> no \n\"J\" \n\na zamindari and tahiqadari area, and there were middlemen \nbetween the cultivator and the State. If the tenants stopped \npaying their rent the landlord suffered immediately. A class \nissue also was thus raised. The Congress, as a whole, was a \npurely nationalist body, and included many middling zamin- \ndars and a few of the larger ones also. Its leaders were terribly \nafraid of doing anything which might raise this class issue or \nirritate the zamindar elements. So, right through the first six \nmonths of civil disobedience, they avoided calling for a general \nno-tax campaign in the rural areas, although conditions for this \nseemed to me to be ripe. I was not afraid of raising the class \nissue in this way or any other way, but I recognised that the \nCongress, being what it was, could not then patronise class \nconflict. It could, however, call upon both parties, zamindars \nand tenants, not to pay. The average zamindar would probably \npay up the revenue demanded from him by the Government, \nbut that would be his fault. \n\nWhen I came out of gaol in October, both political and \neconomic conditions seemed to me to be crying out for a no-tax \ncampaign in rural areas. The economic difliculties of the agri- \nculturists were obvious enough. Politically, our civil disobedi- \nence activities, though still flourishing everywhere, were getting \na bit stale. People went on going to gaol in small numbers, and \nsometimes in large groups, but the sting had gone from the \natmosphere. The cities and the middle classes were a bit tired \nof the hartals and processions. Obviously something was needed \nto liven things up, a fresh infusion of blood was necessary. \nWhere could this come from except from the peasantry?\u2014 and \nthe reserve stocks there were enormous. It would again become \na mass movement touching the vital interests of the masses, \nand, what was to me very important, would raise social issues. \n\nWe discussed these matters, my colleagues and I, during tlte \nbrief day and a half I was at Allahabad. At short notice we \nconvened a meeting there of the executive of our Provincial \nCongress Committee, and, after long debate, we decided to \n^nction a^no-tax campaign, making it permissive for any dis- \ntrict to take it up. We did not declare it ourselves in any part \nof the province, and the Executive Council made it apply to \nzammdars as well as tenants, to avoid the class issue if possible. \nWe knew, of course, that the main response would come from \n, the peasantry. \n\nHaving got this permission to go ahead, our district of Alla- \nhabad wanted to take the first step. We decided to convene a \nrepresentative kisan or peasants\u2019 conference of the district a \n\n\n\nNEGOTIATIONS AT YERAVDA \n\n\n \n\nweek later, to give the new campaign a push. I felt that I had \ndone a good first day\u2019s work alter release from gaol. I added to \nit a big mass meeting in Allahabad city, where I spoke at \nlength. It was for this speech that I was subsequently convicted \nagain. \n\nAnd then, on October th, Kamala and I went off to Mus- \nsoorie to spend three days with father. He was looking just a \nlittle better, and I was happy to think that he had turned the \ncorner and was getting well. I. remember those quiet and de- \nlightful three days well; it was good to be back in the family. \nIndira, my daughter, was there; and my three little nieces, my \nsister\u2019s daughters. I would play with the children and some- \ntimes we would march bravely round the house in a stately \nprocession, led, flag in hand, Ijy the youngest, aged three or \nfour, singing Jhanda uncha rahe hamara, our flag song. And \nthose three days were the last I was to have with father before \nhis fatal illness came to snatch him away from me. \n\nExpecting my re-arrest soon, and desiring perhaps to see a \nlittle more pf me, father suddenly decided to return to Alla- \nhabad also. Kamala and I were going down from Mussoorie on \nthe  th October to be in time for the Peasant Conference at \nAllahabad on the th. Father arranged to start with the \nothers on the ith, the day after us. \n\nWe had a somewhat exciting journey back, Kamala and I. \nAt Dchra Dun an order under Section  Criminal Procedure \nCode was served on me almost as I was leaving. At Lucknow \nwe got off for a few hours, and I learnt that another order under \nSection  awaited me there, but it was not actually served on \nme, as the police officer could not reach me owing to the large \ncrowds. I was presented with an address by the Municipality, \nand then we left by car for Allahabad, stopping at various places \nen route to address some peasant gatherings. We reached Alla- \nhabad on the night of the ith. \n\nThe morning of the th brought yet another order under \nSection  for me I The Government was evidently hot on my \ntrail and my hours were numbered. I was anxious to attend \nthe kisan conference before my re-arrest. We called this confer- \nence a private one of delegates only, and so it was, and did \nnot allow outsiders to come in. It was very representative of \nAllahabad District, and, as far as I remember, about , dele- \ngates were present. The conference decided very enthusiastic- \nally to start the no-tax campaign in the district. There was \nsome hesitation among our prinapal workers, some doubt about \nthe success of such a yenture, for the influence and the power \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nof the big zamiudars to terrorise, backed as this was by the \nGovernment, was very great, and they wondered if the \npeasantry would be able to withstand this. But there was no \nhesitation or doubt in the minds of the sixteen hundred and \nodd peasants of all degrees who were present, or at any rate it \nwas not apparent. I was one of the speakers at the conference. \nI do not know if thereby I committed a breach of the Section \n order which had forbidden me from speaking in public. \n\nI then went to the station to receive my father and the rest \nof the famhy. The train was late, and, immediately after their \narrival, I left them to attend a public meeting, a joint affair of \nthe peasants, who had come from the surrounding villages, and \nthe townspeople. Kamala and I were returning from this meet- \ning, thoroughly tired out, after  p,m. I was looking forward \nto a talk with father, and I knew that he was waiting for me, \nfor we had hardly spoken to each other since his return. On \nour way back our car was stopped almost in sight of our \nhouse, and I was arrested and carried off across the river Jumna \nto my old quarters in Naini. Kamala went on, alqne, to Anand \nBhawan to inform the waiting family of this new development; \nand, at the stroke of nine, I re-entered the great gate of Naini \nPrison.  THE NO-TAX CAMPAIGN IN THE \nUNITED PROVINCES \n\nAfter eight clays\u2019 absence I was back again in Naini, and I \nrejoined Syed Mahmucl, Narmada Prasad and Ranjit Pandit in \nthe same old barrack. Some days afterwards I was tried in \nprison on a number of charges, all based on various parts of \nthat one speech I had delivered at Allahabad, the day after my \ndischarge. As usual with us, I did not defend myself, but made \na brief statement in court. I was sentenced for sedition under \nSection . A to  months\u2019 rigorous imprisonment and a fine \nof Rs.; under the Salt Act of  to six months and a fine \nof Rs.ioo; and under Ordinance VT of  (I forget what this \nOrdinance was about) also to six months and a fine of Rs. . \nAs the last two were concurrent, the total sentence was two years' \nrigorous imprisonment and, in addition, five months in default \nof fines. This was my fifth term. \n\nMy re-arrest and conviction had some effect on the tempo of \nthe civil disobedience movement for a while; it put on a little \nspurt and showed greater energy. This was largely due to \nfather. When news was brought to him by Kamala of my \narrest, he had a slightly unpleasant shock. Almost immediately \nhe pulled himself together and banged a table in front of him, \nsaying that he had made up his mind to be an invalid no \nlonger. He was going to be well and to do a man\u2019s work, and \nnot to submit weakly to illness. It was a brave resolve, but un- \nhappily no strength of will could overcome ^d crush that \ndeep-seated disease that was eating into him. Yet for a few days \nit worked a marked change, to ihe surprise of those who saw \nhim. For some months past, ever since he was at Yeravda, he \nhad been bringing up blood in his sputum. This stopped quite \nsuddenly after this resolve of his, and for some days it did not \nreappear. He was pleased' about it, and he came to see me in , \nprison and mentioned this feet to me in some triumph. It was \u2022' \nunfortunately a brief respite, for the blood came later in greater \nquantities and the disease reasserted itself. During this interval \nhe worked with his old energy and gave a push to the civil \ndisobedience movement all over India. He conferred with many \npeople from various places and issued detailed instructions. He \nfixed one day (it was my birthday in November  ) fijr an all- \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nIndia celebration at which the offending passages from my \nspeech, for which I had been convicted, were read out at public \nmeetings. On that day there were numerous lathi charges and \nforcible dispersals of processions and meetings, and it was esti- \nmated that, on that day alone, about five thousand arrests were \nmade all over the country. It was a unique birthday celebra- \ntion. \n\nIll as he was, this assumption of responsibility and pouring \nout of energy was very bad for father, and I begged of him to \ntake absolute rest. I realised that such rest might not be pos- \nsible for him in India, for his mind would always be occupied \nwith the ups and downs of our struggle and, inevitably, people \nwould go to him for advice. So I suggested to him to go for a \nshort sea voyage towards Rangoon, Singapore, and the Dutch \nIndies, and he rather liked the idea. It was arranged that a \ndoctor friend might accompany him on the voyage. With this \nobject in view he went to Calcutta, but his condition grew \nslowly worse and he was unable to go far. In a Calcutta suburb \nhe remained for seven weeks, and the whole family joined him \nthere, except Kamala, who remained in Allahabad for most of \nthe time, doing Congress work. \n\nMy re-arrest had probably been hastened because of my \nactivities in connection with the no-tax campaign. As a matter \nof fact few things could have been better for that campaign \nthan my arrest on that particular day, immediately after the \nkisan conference, while the peasant delegates were still in Alla- \nhabad. Their enthusiasm grew because of it, and they carried \nthe decisions of the conference to almost every village in the \ndistrict. Within a couple of days the whole district laiew that \nthe no-tax campaign had been maugurated, and everywhere \nthere was a joyml response to it. \n\nOur Aief difficulty in those days was one of communication, \nof getting people to know what we were doing or what we \nwanted them to do. Newspapers would not publish our news for \nfear of being penalised and suppressed by Government; print- \nmg presses would not print our leaflets and notices; letters and \ntelemams were censored and often stopped. The only reliable \nmethod of communication open to us was to send couriers with \ndespat^es, and even so oin: messengers were sometimes \narrested. T^e method was an expensive one and required a \ngreat deal of organisation. It was organised with some success, \nand the provmcial centres were in constant touch with hcad- \nquartera as well as with their principal district centres. It was \nnot difficult to spread any information in the cities. Many of \n\n\n\nTHE NO-TAX CAMPAIGN  \n\nthese issued unauthorised news-sheets, usually cyclostyled, daily \nor weekly, and there was always a great demand for thenv \nFor our public notifications, one of the city methods was by \nbeat of drum; this resulted usually in the arrest of the drum- \nmer. This did not matter, as arrests were sought, not avoided. \nAll these methods suited the cities and were not easily appli- \ncable to the rural areas. Some kind of touch was kept up with \nprincipal village centres by means of messengers and cyclo- \nstyled notices, but this was not satisfactory, and it took time for \nour instructions to percolate to distant villages. \n\nThe kisan conference at Allahabad got over this difficulty. \nDelegates had come to it from practically every impoiTant vil- \nlage in the district and, when they dispersed, they carried the \nnews of the fresh decisions affecting the peasantry, and of my \narrest in connection with them, to every part of the district. \nThey became, sixteen hundred of them, effective and enthusi- \nastic propagandists for the no-tax campaign. The initial success \nof the movement thus became assured, and there was no doubt \nthat the peasantry as a whole in that area would not pay their \nrent to begin with, and not at all unless they were frightened \ninto doing so. No one, of course, could say what their powers \nof endurance would be in face of official or zamindari violence \nand terrorism. \n\nOur appeal had been addressed both to zamindars and tenants \nnot to pay; in theory it was not a class appeal. In practice most \nof the zamindars did pay their revenue, even some who sympa- \nthised with the national struggle. The pressure on them was \ngreat and they had more to lose. The tenantry, however, stood \nfirm and did not pay, and our campaign thus became prac- \ntically a no-rent campaign. From the Allahabad district it \nspread ta some other districts of the United Provinces. In \nmany districts it was not formally adopted or declared, but in \neffect tenants withheld their rents or, in many cases, were \nwholly unable to pay them owing to the fall in prices. As it \nhappened, neither Government nor the big zamindars took any \nwidespread action to terrorise the recalcitrant tenantry for \nseveral months. They were not sure of their ground, as they \nhad the political struggle with civil disobedience on the one \nside, and the economic slump, resultingTn agricultural distress, \non the other. The two merged into each other, and the Govern- \nment was alw^s afiraid of an agrarian upheaval. With the \nRound Table Gonference in session in London, they^ were not \nkeen on adding to their troubles in India or on giving a still \nmore striking demonstration of \u2018 strong \u2019 government. \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARI.AL NEHRU \n\nThe no-tax movement in the United Provinces had one im- \nportant result so far as this province was concerned. It shifted \nthe centre of gravity of our struggle from the urban to the \nrural areas, and it thereby revitalised the movement and put it \non a broader and more enduring basis. Though our city people \nbecame bored and tired, and our middle-class workers were \nobviously rather stale, the movement itself in the U.P. was as \nstrong, or even stronger, than it had been at any other time. \nIn the other provinces this change-over from urban to rural, \nfrom political to economic issues, did not take place to the same \nextent, and consequently they continued to be dominated by \nthe cities and to suffer increasingly from the weariness of the \nmiddle-class elements. Even the city of Bombay, which had all \nalong played a prominent part in the movement, began to grow \na little stale. Defiance of authority would go on there and else- \nwhere, and arrests would continue, but all this seemed some- \nwhat artificial. The organic element had gone. This was \nnatural enough, as it is impossible to keep the masses at a cer- \ntain revolutionary pitch for long periods. Ordinarily, this was a \nquestion of days, but civil disobedience had the remarkable \ncapacity for lengthening this period to many months, and even \nthen of carrying on at a lower pitch for an indefinite period. \n\nGovernment repression grew. Local Congress Committees, \nYouth Leagues, etc., which had rather surprisingly carried on \nso far, were declared illegal and suppressed. The treatment of \npolitical prisoners in gaols became worse. Government was \nespecially irritated when people retturned to gaol for a second \nsentence soon after their discharge. This failure to bend in \nspite of punishment hurt the morale of the rulers. In Novem- \nber or early December  there were some cases of flogging \nof political prisoners in U.P. prisons, apparently for offences \nagainst gaol discipline. News of this reached us in Naini Prison \nand upset us-\u2014 since then we have got used to this, as well as \nmany worse happenings in India\u2014 for flogging seemed to me to \nbe an undesirable infliction, even on hardened criminals of the \nworst type. For young, sensitive boys and for technical offences \nof disapline, it was barbarous. 'We four in our barrack wrote \nto the Government about it, and, not receiving any reply for \nabout two weeks, we decided to take some definite step to mark \nour protest at the floggings and our sympathy with the victims \nof this barbarity. We undertook a complete fast for three days \n\u2014 * hours. This was not much as fasts go, but none of us was \naccustomed to fasting, and did not know how we would stand \nit. My previous fasts had seldom exceeded  hours|. \n\n\n\nTHE NO-TAX CAMPAIGN  \n\nWe went through that fast without any great difficulty, and T \nwas glad to find out that it was not sucli an ordeal as I feared. \nVery foolishly I carried on my strenuous exercises \u2014 ^running, \njerks, etc.\u2014 -right through that fest. I do not think that did me \nmuch good, especially as I had been feeling a little unwell pre- \nviously. Each ope of us lost seven to eight pounds in weight \nduring those three days. This was in adffition to the fifteen to \ntwenty-six pounds that each had lost in the previous months in \nNaini. \n\nQuite apart from our fasting, there was a fair amount of \nagitation outside against the flogging, and I believe that the \nU.P. Government issued orders to its Gaol Department not to \nindulge in it in future. But these orders were not to remain un- \nchanged for long, and a little more than a ye.ar later there was \ngoing to be no lack of flogging in the gaols of the United \nProvinces and the other provinces. \n\nExcept for these occasional alarms, we lived a quiet life in \nprison. The weather was agreeable, for winter in Allahabad is \nvery pleasant. Ranjit Pandit was an acquisition to our barrack, \nfor he, knew much about gardening, and soon that dismal en- \nclosure of ours was full of flowers and was gay with colour. \nHe even arranged in that narrow, restricted space a miniature \ngolf course I \n\nOne of the welcome excitements of our prison existence at \nNaini was the passage of aeroplanes over oiu: heads. Allahabad \nis one of the ports of call for all the great air lines between \nEast and West, and the giant planes going to Australia, Java, \nand French Indo-China would pass almost directly above our \nheads at Naini. Most stately of all were the Dutch liners flying \nto and from Batavia. Sometimes, if we were lucky, we saw a \nplane in the early winter morning, when it was still dark and \nthe stars were visible. The great Bner was brightly lit up, and \nat both ends it had red lights. It was a beautiful sight, as it \nsailed by, against the dark background of the early morning \n\nPandit Madan Moh'an Malaviya was also transferred to Naini \nfrom some other gaol. He was kept separately, not in qur \nbarrack, but we met him daily, and perhaps I saw more of him \nthere than I had done outside. He was a delightful companion, \nfull of vitality and a youthful interest in things. He even \nstarted, with Ranjit\u2019s help, to learn German, and he showed \nquite a remarkable memory. He was in Naini when news of \nthe floggings came, and he was greatly upset and wrote to the \nActing-Governor of Ae Province. Soon afterwards he fell ill. \n\n\n\n\u25a0  \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nHe was unable to bear the cold in the conditions that prevailed \nin prison. His illness grew serious, and he had to be reniovcd \nto the city hospital, and later to be discharged before his term \nwas over. Happily, he recovered in hospital. \n\n\u2022 The New Year\u2019s Day, the first of January , brought us \nthe news of Kamala\u2019s arrest. I was pleased, for she had so \nlonged to follow many of her comrades to prison. Ordinarily, \nif they had been men, both she and my sister and many other \nwomen would have been arrested long ago. But at that time \nthe Government avoided, as far as possible, arresting women, \nand so they had escaped for so long. And now she had her \nheart\u2019s desire I How glad she must be, I thought. But I was \napprehensive, for she was always in weak health, and I feared \nthat prison conditions might cause her much suffering. \n\nAs she was arrested, a pressman who was present asked her \nfor a message, and, on the spur of the moment and almost un- \nconsciously, she gave a little message that was characteristic of \nher : \" I am happy beyond measure and proud to follow in the \nfootsteps of my husband. I hope the people will keep the flag \nflying.\u201d Probably she would not have said just that if she had \nthought over the matter, for she considers herself a champion \nof woman\u2019s right against the tyranny of man. But at that \nmoment the Hindu wife in her came uppermost and even man\u2019s \n\n\ntyranny was forgotten. \n\nMy father was in Calcutta and was far from well, but news \nof Kamala\u2019s arrest and conviction shook him up, and he de- \ncided to return to Allahabad. He sent on my sister Krishna \nimmediately to Allahabad, and fisllowed himself, with the rest \nof the family, a few days later. On the th of January he \ncame to see me in Naini. I saw him after nearly two months, \nand I had a shock which I could conceal with difficulty. He \nseemed to be unaware of the dismay that his appearance had \n\nE reduced in me, and told me that he was much better than he \nad lately been in Calcutta. His face was swollen up, and he \nseemed to think that this was due to some temporary cause. \n\nThat face of his haunted me. It was so utterly unlike him. \nFor the first time a fear began to creep in my mind that there \nwas real danger for him ahead. I had always associated him \nwith strength and health, and I could not think of death in \nconnection with him. He had always laughed at the idea of \ndeath, made fun of it, and told us that he proposed to live for \na further long term of years. Latterly I had noticed that when- \never an old friend of his youth died, he had a sense of lone- \n iness, of being left by himself in strange company, and even a \n\n\n\nTHE NO-TAX CAMPAIGN \n\n\n \n\nhint of an approaching end. But generally this mood passed \nand his overflowing vitality asserted itself, and we of his family \nhad grown so used to his rich personality and the all-embracing \nwarmth of his affection, that it was difiicult for us to think of \nthe world without him. \n\n was troubled by that look of his and my mind was full of \nforebodings. Yet I did not think that any danger to him lay in \nthe near fiiture. I was myself, for some imknown reason, keep- \ning poor health just then. \n\nThose were the last days of the first Round Table Confer- \nence, and we were a little amused \u2014 and I am afraid our amuse- \nment had a touch of disdain in it \u2014 at the final flourishes and \ngestures. Those speeches and platitudes and discussions seemed \nunreal and futile, but one reality stood out: that even in the \nhour of our country\u2019s sorest trial, and when our men and \nwomen had behaved so wonderfully, there were some of our \ncountrymen who were prepared to ignore our struggle and give \ntheir moral support to the other side. It became clearer to us \nthan it had been before how, under the deceptive cover of \nnationalism', conflicting economic interests were at work, and \nhow those with vested interests were trying to preserve them \nfor the future in the name of this very nationalism. The Round \nTable Conference was an obvious collection of these vested \ninterests. Many of them had opposed our struggle; some had \nsilently stood aside, reminding us, however, from time to time \nthat \" they also serve who only stand and wait.\u201d But the wait- \ning period came to a sudden end when London beckoned, and \nthey trooped up to ensure the safety of their own particular \ninterests and to share in such further spoils as might be forth- \ncoming. This general lining up in London was hastened by a \nrealisation that the Congress was going increasingly to the Left \nand the masses were influencing it more and more. Instinc- \ntively, it was felt that if a root and branch political change \ncame in India, it would mean the dominance, or at least the \nemergence into importance, of various mass elements, and these \nwould inevitably press towards radical social changes and thus \nendanger those vested interests. The Indian vested interests \ndrew back from this, to them, alarming prospect, and this led \nthem to oppose any far-reaching political change. They wanted \nthe British to remain in India as a deciding factor, to preserve \nthe existing social structure and the existing vested interestsf^ \nThis was the real thought that underlay the insistence on \nDominion Status. A well-known Indian Liberal leader once got \nrather\u201c'irritated with me fiar insistiiig j:hat, as an essential.part \n\u25a0 a \n\n\n\n JAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\nof a settlement with Great Britain, the British Army should \nwithdraw immediately from India and the Indian Army must \nbe put under Indian dcmociratic control. He went to the length \nof saying that even if the British Government agreed to do this, \nhe would oppose it with all his might. He opposed this obvious \nand essential preliminary to any Icind of national freedom, \ntherefore, not because it was difficult of achievement under \nexisting circumstances, but because he considered it undesirable. \nPartly, it may be thought, this was due to fear of external \ninvasion, and he wanted the British Army to protect us from \nthis. Quite apart from the possibility or otherwise of such an \ninvasion, it seems a humiliating thought for any Indian of \nspirit to ask for an outsider\u2019s protection. But I do not think this \nis the real reason behind the desire to keep the strong arm of \nthe British in India; the British are required to preserve Indian \nvested interests against Indians themselves, against undiluted \ndemocracy, against an upsurge of the masses. \n\nSo the Indian Round Table Delegates, not only the declared \nreacribnaries and communalists, but even those who called them- \nselves progressives and nationalists, found much in common \nbetween themselves and the British Government. Nationalistn in- \ndeed seemed to us a term of wide and varied reach, if it included \nin its embrace both those who went to gaol hi India in further- \nance of the struggle for freedom and those who shook hands and \nlined up with our gaolers and discussed a common policy with \nthem. There were others also in our country, brave nationalists, \nfluent of speech, who encouraged the Swadeshi movement in \neve:y way, telling us that therem lay the heart of Swaraj, and \ncalling upon their countrymen to further it even at a sacrifice. \nFortunately the movement brought no sacrifice to them; it in- \ncreased their busmesses and their dividends. And while many \nwent to prison or faced the lathi, they sat in their counting \nhouses counting out their money. Later, when aggressive \nnationalism became a little more risky, they toned down their \nspeeches, and condemned the \u2018extremists and made pacts and \nagreements with the other party. \n\nWe did not really mind or care what the Round Table Con- \nference did. It was far away, unreal and shadowy, and the \nstruggle lay here in our towns and villages. We had no illusions \nabout the speedy termination of our struggle or about the \ndangers ahead, and yet the events of  had given us a cer- \ntain confidence in our national strength and stamina, and with \nthat confidence we faced the future. \n\nOne incident in December or early January had pained us \n\n\n\nTHE NO-TAX CAMPAIGN \n\n\n \n\ngreatly. Mr. Srinivas Sastri, in a speech at Edinburgh (where, \nI think, the freedom of the city was firesented to him), referred \nwith some contempt to those who were going to prison in India \nin the civil disobedience movement. That speech, and especi- \nally the occasion for it, hurt us to the quick. For though we \ndiffered from Mr. Sastri greatly in politics, we respected him. \n\nMr. Ramsay MacDonald had wound up the Round Table \nConference with one of his usual brotherly speeches, and this \nseemed to contain an implied appeal to the Congress to give up \nits evil ways and join the happy throng. Just about that time\u2014 \nthe middle of January  \u2014 ^the Congress Worldng Committee \nmet at Allahabad, and, among other matters, this speech and \nappeal were also considered. I was in Naini Prison then, and I \nheard of the proceedings on my release. Father had Just re- \nturned from Calcutta, and, though he was very ill, he insisted \non the members gathering round his bed and discussing this \nsubject there. Some one made a suggestion in favour of a \ngesture to Mr. MacDonald and toning down civil disobedience. \nThis excited father greatly, and he sat up in bed and declared \nthat he would not compromise till the national objective had \nbeen gained, and that he would cany on the struggle, even if \nhe was the sole person left to do so. This excitement was very \nbad for him, and as his temperature shot up, the doctors suc' \nceeded at last in removing the visitors and leaving him alone. \n\nLargely at his instance, the Working Committee passed an \nuncompromising resolution. Before this was published, a cable \ncame from Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Srinivas Sastri ad- \ndressed to father, requesting the Congress, through him, not to \ncome to any decision till they had had an opportunity of a \ndiscussion. They were already on their way home. A reply was \nsent to the effect that a resolution had already been passed by \nthe Working Committee, but this would be withheld fi'om the \nPress till Messrs. Sapru and Sastri had arrived and had a dis- \ncussion. \n\nInside the prison we did not know of these developments \noutside. But we knew that something was afoot and we were \nrather worried. What filled our minds much more was the \napproach of Januwy ath, the first anniversary of Indepen- \ndence Day, and we wondered how this would be celebrated. It \nwas observed, as we learnt subsequently, all over the country \nby the holding of mass meetings which confirmed the resolu- \ntion of independence, and passed an identical resolution called \nthe \u201c Resolution of Remenibrance The organisation of this \n' This resolution is given in Appendix C. (p. ). \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ncelebration was a remarkable feat, for newspapers and printing \npresses were not available, nor could the post or telegraph be \nutilised. And yet an identical resolution, in the particular lan- \nguage of the province concerned, was passed at large gatherings \nheld at more or less the same times at innumerable places, \nurban and rural, throughout the country. Most of these \ngatherings were held in defiance of the law and were, forcibly \ndi^ersed by the police. \n\nJanuary th found us in Naini Prison musing of the year \nthat was past and of the year that was to come. In the fore- \nnoon I was told suddenly that my father\u2019s condition was serious \nand that I must go home immediately. On enquiry, I was in- \nformed that I was being discharged. Ranjit also accompanied \nme. \n\nThat evening, many other persons were discharged from \nvarious prisons throughout India. These were the original and \nsubstitute members of the Congress Working Committee. The \nGovernment was giving us a chance to meet and consider the \nsituation. So, in any event, I would have been discharged that \nevening. Father\u2019s condition hastened my release by a few hours. \nKamala also was discharged that day from her Lucknow pri.son \nafter a brief gaol life of a days. She too was a substitute \nmember of the Working Committee.  KARACHI CONGRESS \n\nGandhiji learnt indirectly of my distress, and the next morning \nhe asked me to accompany him in his usual walk. We had a \nlong talk, and he tried to convince me that nothing vital had \nbeen lost, no surrender of principle made. He interpreted \nClause  of the agreement in a particular way so as to make it \nfit in with our demand for independence, relying chiefly on the \nwords in it: \u201cin the interests of India.\u201d The interpretation \nseemed to me to be a forced one, and I was not convinced, but \nI was somewhat soothed by his talk. The merits of the agree- \nment apart, I told him that his way of springing surprises upon \nus frightened me; there was something unknown about him \nwhich, in spite of the closest association for fourteen years, I \ncould not understand at all and which filled me with appre- \nhension. He admitted the presence of this unknown element \nin him, and said that he himself could not answer for it or \nforetell what it might lead to. \n\nFor a day or two I wobbled, not knowing what to do. There \nwas no question of opposing or preventing that agreement \nthen. That stage was past, and all I could do was to dissociate \nmyself theoretically from it, though accepting it as a matter \nof fact. That would have soothed my personal vanity, biit how \ndid it help the larger issue? Would it not be better to accept \ngracefully what had been done, and put the most favourable \ninterpretation upon it, as Gandhiji had done? In an interview \nto the Press immediately after the agreement he had stressed \nthat interpretation and that we stood completely by indepen- \ndence, He went to Lord Irwin and made this point quite clear, \nso that there might he no misapprehension then or in the \nfuture. In the event of the Congress sending any representative \nto the Round Table Conference, he told him, it could only be \non this basis and to advance this claim. Lord Irwin could not, \nof course, admit the claim, but he recognised the right of the \nCongress to advance it. \n\nSo I decided, not without great mental conflict and physical \ndistress, to accept the agreement and work for it whole- \n\u2019 heartedly. There appeared to me to be no middle way. \n\nIn the course of Gandhiji\u2019s interviews with Lord Irwin \nprior to the agreement, as well as after, he had pleaded for \n\n*  \n\n\n\nKARACHI CONGRESS \n\n\n \n\nthe release of political prisoners other than the civil disobedience \nprisoners. The latter were going to be discharged as part of \nthe agreement itself. But there were thousands of others, both \nthose convicted after trial and detenus kept without any charge, \ntrial or conviction. Many of these detenus had been kept so for \nyears, and there had always been a great deal of resentment \nall over India, and especially in Bengal which was most affected, \nat this method of imprisonment without trial. Like the Chief \nof the General Staff in Penguin Island (or was it in the Dreyfus \ncase?) the Government of India believed that no proo& are the \nbest proofs. No proofs cannot be disproved. The detenus were \nalleged by the Government to be actual or potential revolu- \ntionaries of the violent type. Gandhiji had pleaded for their \nrelease, not necessarily as part of the agreement, but as \neminently desirable in order to relieve political tension and \nestablish a more normal atmosphere in Bengal. But the Govern- \nment was not agreeable to this. \n\nNor did the Government agree to Gandhiji\u2019s hard pleading \nfor the commutation of Bhagat Singh\u2019s death sentence. This \nalso had nothing to do with the agreement, and Gandhiji \npressed for it separately because of the very^ strong feeling all \nover India on this subject. He pleaded in vain. \n\nI remember a curious incident about that time, which gave \nme an insight into the mind of the terrorist group in India. \nThis took place soon after my discharge fi-om prison, either a \nlittle before father\u2019s death or a few days after. A stranger came \nto see me at our house, and I was told that he was Chan- \ndrashekhar Azad. I had never seen him before, but I had \nheard of him ten years earlier, when he had non-co-operated \nfrom school and gone to prison during the N.C.O. movement \nin , A boy of fifteen or so then, he had been flogged in \nprison for some breach of gaol discipline. Later he had drifted \ntowards the terrorists, and he became one of their prominent \nmen in north India. All this I had heard vaguely, and I had \ntaken no interest in these rumours. I was surprised, therefore, \nto see him. He had been induced to visit me because of the \ngeneral expectation (owing to our release) that some negotia- \ntions between the Government and the Congress were likely. \nHe wanted to know if, in case of a settlemmt, his group of \npeople would have any peace. Would they still be coiwidered, \nand treated, as outlaws; hunted out ftom place to place, with \na price on their heads, and the prospect of the j^Uows ever \nbrfore them? Or was there a possibility of their being allowed \nto pursue peaceful vocations? He told me that as far as he was \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nconcerned, as well as many of his associates, they were con- \nvinced now that purely terrorist methods were futile and did no \ngood. He was not, however, prepared to believe that India \nwould gain her freedom wholly by peaceful methods. He \nthought that some time in the future a violent conflict might \ntake place, but this would not be terrorism. He ruled out \nterrorism as such, so far as the question of Indian freedom was \nconcerned. But then, he added. What was he to do when no \nchance was g^vcn him to settle down, as he was being hounded \nall the time? Many of the terroristic acts that had occurred \nrecently, according to him, were purely in self-defence. \n\nI was glad to leam from Azad, and I bad confirmation of \nthis subsequently, that the belief in terrorism was dying down. \nAs a group notion, indeed, it had practically gone, and indi- \nvidual and sporadic cases were probably due to some special \nreason, act of rmrisal, or individual aberration, and not to \na general idea. This ^d not mean, of course, that the old \nterrorists or their new associates had become .converts to non- \nviolence, or admirers of British rule. But they did not thinlf \nin terms of terrorism as they used to. Many of them, it seems \nto me, have definitely the fascist mentality. \n\nI tried to explain to Chandrashekhar Azad what my philo- \nsophy of political action was, and tried to convert him to my \nview-point. But I had no answer to his basic question: what \n' was he to do now? Nothing was likely to happen that would \nbring him, or his like, any relief or peace. All I could suggest \nwas that he should use his influence to prevent the occurrence \nof terrorist acts in the future, fer these could only injure the \n\u2022la^er cause as well as his own group. \n\nTwo or three weeks later, while the Gandhi\u2014 Irwin talks were \ngoing on, I heard at Delhi that Chandrashekhar Azad had \nbeen shot down and killed by the police in Allahabad. He was \nrecognised in the day-time in a park, and was surrounded by \na large force of police. He tried to defend himself from behind \na tree; ^ere was quite a shooting-match, and he injured one or \ntwo policemen before he was shot down. \n\nI left Delhi soon after the provisional settlement wafe arrived \nat, and went to Lucknow. We had taken immediate steps to \n.stop civil disobedience all over the country, and the whole \nCongress organisadon had reroonded to our new instructions . \nwith remarluble disdpline. 'We had many people in our ranks \nwho were ^ssatisfied, many fire-brands, and we had no means \nof compelling them to desist ftom the old activities. But with- \nout a single exception known to me, the' huge organisation \n\n\n\nKARACHI CONGRESS  \n\naccepted in practice the new r  e, though many criticised it. \nI was particularly interested in the reactions in our province, \nas the no-tax campaign was going strong in some areas there. \nOur first job was to see that the civil disobedience prisoners \nwere discharged. Thousands of these were discharged from day \nto day, and after some time only a number of disputed cases \nwere left in prison; apart, of course, from the thousands of \ndetenus and those convicted for violent activities, who were \nnot released. \n\nThese discharged prisoners, when they went home to their \ntown or villages, were naturally welcomed back by their people. \nThere were often decorations and buntings, and processions, \nand meetings, and speeches and addresses of welcome. It was \nall very natural and to be expected, but the change was sudden \nfrom the time when tlie police lathi was always in evidence, \nand meetings and processions were forcibly dispersed. The \npolice felt rather uncomfortable, and probably there was a feel- \ning of triumph among many of our people who came out of \ngaol. There was little enough reason to be triumphant, but a \ncoming out of gaol always brings a feeling of elation (unless the \nspirit has been crushed in gao^ and mass gaol deliveries add \nvery much to this exhilaration. \n\nI mention this fact here, because in later months great \nexception was taken by the Government to this \u2018air of \ntriumph\u2019, and it was made a charge against us I Brought up \nand living always in an authoritarian atmosphere, \u25a0 with a \nmilitary notion of government and with no roots or supports \nin the people, nothing is more painful to them than a weaken- \ning of what they consider their prestige. None of us, so far \nas I know, had given the least thought to the matter, and it \nwas with great surprise that we learnt latet that Government \nofficials, from the heights of Simla to the plains below, were \nsimmering with anger and wounded pride at this impudence \nof the people. The newspapers that echo their views have not \ngot over it yet; and even now, three and a half years later, they \nrefer with almost a visible shudder to those bold, bad days \nwhen, according to them. Congressmen went about in triumph \nas if they had won a great victory. These outbursts on me \npart of the Government and its friends in the Press, came as \na revelation to us. They showed what a state of nerves they \nhad been in, what suppressions they had put up with, resulting \nin aU manner of complexes. It was extraordinary that a few \nprocessions and a few speeches of our rank-and-file men should \nso upset them. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nAs a matter of fact there was in Congress ranks then, and \neven less in the leadership, no idea of having \u2018 defeated \u2019 the \nBritish Government. But there was a feeling of triumph \namongst us at our own people\u2019s sacrifices and courage. We \nwere a little proud of what the country had done in ; it \nraised us in our self-esteem, gave us confidence, and even our \nlittlest volunteer straightened himself and held up his head at \nthe thought of this. We also felt that this great effort, which had \nattracted world attention, had brought enormous pressure on \nthe British Government, and had taken us nearer our goal. \nAll this had nothing to do with defeating the Government, \nand indeed many of us were fully conscious of the fact that \nthe Government had done rather well in the Delhi Pact. Those \nof us who pointed out that we were far from our goal, and big \nand difficult struggles lay ahead, were accused by mends of the \nGovernment of war-mongering and going behind the spirit of \nthe Delhi Pact. \n\nIn the United Provinces we had now to face the agrarian \nproblem. Our policy now was one of co-operation, as far as \npossible, with the British Government and immediately we put \n' ourselves in touch with the U.P. Provincial Government. After \na long interval \u2014 for a dozen years we had had no official deal- \nings with them\u2014 I visited some of the high officials of the \nprovince to discuss the agrarian question. We also carried on \na lengthy correspondence on the subject. Our Provincial Con- \ngress Committee appointed one of our leading men, Govind \nBallabh Pant, as a special liaison officer to keep in continuous \ntouch with the Provincial Government, The facts of the \nagrarian crisis, of the tremendous fall in agricultural prices, \nand of the inability of the average peasant to pay the rent \ndemanded, were admitted. The question was, what remissions \nshould be given, and in this matter the initiative lay with the \nProvincial Government. Ordinarily the Government dealt with \nthe landlords alone, and not with their tenants direct, and it \nwas for the landlords to reduce or remit rents. \u2018But the land- \nlords refused to do any such thing, so long as the Government \ndid not remit part of their revenue demand; and in any event \nthey were not, as a mle, keen on giving remissions to their \ntenantry. So the decision rested with the Government. \n\nThe Provincial Congress Committee had told the peasantry \nthat the no-tax campaign was off, and they should pay as much \nof their rent as they could. But, as their representatives, they \nhad demanded heavy remissions. For a long Government \ntook no action. Probably it was handicapped by the absence \n\n\n\nKARACHI .CONGRESS \n\n\n \n\non leave or special duty of the Governor, Sir Malcolm Hailey. \nPrompt and far-reaching action was necessary, but the acting \nGovernor and his colleagues hesitated to commit themselves, \nand preferred to delay matters rill the return of Sir Malcolm \nHailey in the summer. This indecision and delay made a diffi- \ncult situation worse, and resulted in much suffering for the \ntenantry. \n\nI had a little breakdown in health soon after the Delhi Pact. \nEven in gaol I had been unwell, and then the shock of father\u2019s \ndeath, followed immediately by the long strain of the Delhi \nnegotiations, proved too much for my physical health. I re- \ncovered somewhat for the Karachi Congress. \n\nKarachi is far to the north-west of India, difficult of access, \nand partly cut off firom the rest of the country by desert \nregions. But it attracted a great gathering &om distant parts, \nand truly represented the temper of the country at the \nmoment. There was a feeling of quiet, but deep satisfaction \nat the growii^ strength of jhe national movement in India; \npride in the Congress organisation which had so far worthily \nresponded to the heavy calls made on it, and fully justified \nitself by its disciplined sacrifice; a confidence in our people, \nand a restrained enthusiasm. At the same time there was a heavy \nsense of responsibility at the tremendous problems and perils \nahead; our words and resolutions were now the preludes to \naction on a national scale, and could not be lightly uttered or \npassed. The Delhi Pact, though accepted by the great majority, \nwas not popular or liked, and there was a fear that it might \nlead us to all manner of compromising situations. Somehow it \nseemed to take away fi'om the clarity of the issues before the \ncountry. On the very eve of the Congress, a new element of \nresentment had crept in\u2014 the execution of Bhagat Singh. This \nfeeling was especially marked in North India, and Karachi, \nbeing itself in the north, had attracted large numbers of people \nfrom the Punjab. \n\nThe Karachi Congress was an even greater personal triumph \nfor Gandhiji than any previous Congress had been. The pre- \nsident, Sardar VaUabhbhai Patel, was one of the most popular \nand forceful men in India with the prestige of victorious \nleadership in Gmrat, but it was the Mahatma who dominated \nthe scene. The Cfongress also had a strong contingent of \u2018 Red- \nshirts ' from the Frontier Province under the leadership of \nAbdul Ghaffar Khan. These Redshirts were popular and drew \na cheer wherever they went, for India had been impressed by \ntheir extraordinary and peaceful courage in the face of great \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nprovocation from April  onwards. The name ' Redshirts \u2019 \nled some people to think, guite wrongly, that they were Com- \nmunists or left-wing labourites. As a matter of fact their name \nwas \"Khudai Khidmatgar \u201d, and this organisation had allied \nitself to the Congress (later in  they were to become \nintegral parts of the Congress organisation). They were called \nRedshirts simply because of their rather primitive uniforms, \nwhich were red. They had no economic policy in their pro- \ngramme, which was nationalistic and also dealt with social \nreform. \n\nThe principal resolution at Karachi dealt with the Delhi Pact \nand the Round Table Conference. I accepted it, of course, as \nit emerged from the Working Committee, but when I was \nasked by GandKiji to move it in the open Congress, I hesitated. \nIt went against the grain, and I refused at first, and then this \nseemed a weak and unsatisfactory position to take up. Either \nI was for it or against it, and it was not proper to prevaricate \nor leave people guessing in the matter. Almost at the last \nmoment, a few minutes before the resolution was taken up in \nthe open Congress, I decided to sponsor it. In my speech I tried \nto lay before the great gathering quite frankly what my feelings \nwere and why I had wholeheartedly accepted that resolution \nand pleaded with them to accept it That speech, made on the \nspur of the moment and coming from the heart, and with little \nof ornament or fine phrasing in it, was probably a greater \nsuccess than many of my other efforts, which had followed a \nmore carefrd preparation. \n\n. I spoke on other resolutions, too, notably on the Bhagat Singh \nresolution and the one on Fundamental Rights and Economic \nPolicy. The latter resolution interested me especially, partly \nbecause of what it contained, and even more so because it \nrepresented a new outlook in the Congress. So far the Congress \nhad thought along purely nationalist lines, and had avoided \nfacing economic issues, except in so far as it encouraged cottage \nindustries and swadeshi generally. lii the Karachi resolution it \ntook a step, a very short step, in a socialist direction by advo- \ncating nation^sation of key industries and services, and \nvarious other measures to lessen the burden on the poor and \nincrease it on the rich. This was not soc^ism at all, and \na capitalist state could easily accept almost everything con- \ntained in that resolution. \n\nThis very mild and prosaic resolution evidently made the big \npeople of the Qoveminent of India furiously to think. Perhaps \nthey even pictured, with their usual perspicacity, the red gold \n\n\n\nKARACHI CONGRESS \n\n\n\u2022 \n\nof the Bolsheviks stealing its way into Karachi and corrupting \nthe Congress leaders. Living in a kind of political harem, cut \noff from the outer world, and surrounded by an atmosphere of \nsecrecy, their receptive minds love to hear tales of mystery and \nimagination. And then these stories are given out in little bits \nin a mysterious manner, through favoured newspapers, with \na hint that much more could be seen if only the veil were \nlifted. In this approved and well-practised manner, frequent \nreferences have been made to the Karachi resolution on Fun- \ndamental Rights, etc., and I can only conclude that they \nrepresent the Government view of this resolution. The story \ngoes that a certain mysterious individual with communist \nafEliations drew up this resolution, or the greater part of it, \nand thrust it dovm upon me at Karachi; that thereupon I -issued \nan ultimatum to Mr. Gandhi to accept this or to face my \nopposition on the Delhi Pact issue, and Mr. Gandhi accepted \nit as i sop to me, and frtrced it down on a tired Subjects \nCommittee and Congress on the concluding day. \n\nThe name of the \u2018mysterious individual\u2019 has, so far as I \nknow, not been direcdy mentioned, but numerous hints make \nit quite clear who is meant. Not being myself used to ways of \nmystery and roundabout methods of expression, I might as \nw^ state that this person seems to be M. N. Roy. It woxdd be \ninteresting to know, and instructive to the big ones of Simla \nand Delhi to find out, what M. N. Roy or any other person \n\u2018 communisdcally inclined \u2019 thinks of that very iimocent Karachi \nresolution. It may surprise them to discover that any such \nperson is rather contemptuous of the resolution because, \naccording to him, it is a typical product of a bourgeois re- \nformist mentality. \n\nSo for as Mr. Gandhi is concerned, I have had the privilege \nof knowing him pretty intimately for the last seventeen years, \nand the idea of my presenting ultimatums to him or bar- \ngaining with him seems to ine monstrous. We may accommo; \ndate ourselves to each other; or we may, on a particular issue, \npart company, hut the methods of the market-place can never \naffect bur mutual dealings. \n\nThe idea of getting the Congress to pass a resolution of this \nkind was an old one. For some years the U.P. Provincial \nCongress Committee had been agitating in the matter, and \ntr^g to get the A.I.C.C. to accept a socudist resolution. In \n it succeeded to some extent in getting the AJ.C.C. tb\u2019 \naccept the principle. Then followed civil disobe^ence. During \nmy early morning talks in Delhi with Gandhiji in February \n\n\n\nj jawaharlal kehru \n\nand March , I had referred to this matter, and he had \nwelcomed the idea of having a resolution on economic matters. \nHe asked me to bring the matter up at Karachi, and to draft \na resolution and show it to him there. I did so at Karachi, \nand he made various changes and suggestions. He wanted both \nof us to agree on the wording, before we asked the Working \nCommittee to consider it. I had to make several drafts, and \nthis delayed matters for a few days, and we were otherwise \nvery much occupied with other matters. Ultimately Gandhiji \nand I agreed on a draft, and this was placed before the Working \nCommittee, and later before the Subjects Committee. It is \nperfectly true that it was a new subject for the Subjects Com- \nmittee and some members were surprised. However, it was \neasily passed by the Committee and the Congress, and was \nreferred to the A.I.C.C. for further elucidation and enlargement \non the lines laid down. \n\nWhile I was drafting this resolution various people, who used \nto come to ray tent, were sometimes consulted by me about it. \nBut M. N. Roy had absolutely nothing to do with it, and I \nknew well enough that he would disapprove of it and laugh \nat it. \n\nI had come across M. N. Roy in Allahabad some days before \ncoming to Karachi. He turned up suddenly one evening at \nour house, and though I had no notion that he was in India, \nI recognised him immediately, having seen him in Moscow \nin . He saw me at Karachi also, but that was probably for \nnot more than five minutes. Dtuing the past few years Roy \nhad written a great deal in condemnation of me politically, \nand -le had often succeeded in hurting me a little. There was \na great deal of diiference between us, and yet I felt attracted \ntowards him, and when later he had been arrested and was in \ntrouble, I wanted to do what little I could (and that was little \nenough) to help him. I was attracted to him by his remarkable \nintellectual capacity; I was also attracted to him because he \nseemed such a lonely figure, deserted by everybody. The British \nGovernment was naturally after him; nationalist India was not \ninterested in him; and those who called themselves Communists \nin India condemned him as a traitor to the cause. I knew that \nafter many years\u2019 residence in Russia and close co-operation \nwith the Comintern, he had parted with them or, perhaps, \nbeen made to part. Why this happened I did not know, nor \ndo I know still, except very vaguely, what his present views \nor his differences with the orthodox Communists are. But this \ndesertion of a man -like him by almost everybody pained me. \n\n\n\nKARACHI CONGRESS \n\n\n \n\nand, against my usual habit, I joined the Defence Committee. \nSince that summer in  over three years ago now, he has \nbeen in prison, unwell and practically in solirary confinement. \n\nOne of the final acts of the Congress session at Karachi was \nto elect a new Working Committee. This is elected by the All- \nIndia Congress Committee, but a convention has grown up \nthat the suggestions of the President for the year (made in \nconsultation with Gandhiji and sometimes other colleagues) are \naccepted by the A.I.C.C. The Karachi election of the Working \nCommittee led to an imtoward result, which none of us anti- \ncipated then. Some Muslim members of the A.I.C.C. objected \nto this election, in particular to one (Muslim) name in it. Per- \nhaps they also felt slighted because no one of their group had \nbeen chosen. In an all-India committee of fifteen it was mani- \nfestly impossible to have all interests represented, and the real \ndispute, about which we knew nothing, was an entirely personal \nand local one in the Punjab. The result was that the protestant \ngroup gradually drifted away from the Congress in the Punjab, \nand joined others in an \u2018Ahrar Party\u2019 or \u2018 MaJlis-e-Ahrar \nSome of the most active and popular Muslim Congress workers \nin the Punjab joined this, and it attracted large numbers of \nPunjab Muslims to it. It represented chiefly the lower middle- \nclass elements and it had numerous contacts with the Muslim \nmasses. It thus became a powerful organisation, far stronger \nthan the decrepit Muslim communal organisations of upper- \nclass folk, which functioned in the air or, rather, in drawing- \nrooms and committee rooms. Inevitably, the Ahrars drifted \ntowards communalism, but because of their touch with the \nMuslim masses they remained a live body with a vague \neconomic outlook. They played an important part later in \nMuslim agitations in Indian States, notably Kashmir, where \neconomic ills and communalism were strangely and unhappily \nmixed together. The defecdon of some of the leaders of the \nAhrar Party from the Congress was a serious loss for the Con- \ngress in the Punjab. But we did not know of this at Karachi; \nthe realisation came slowly in later months. This defection did \nnot, of course, come because of resentment at the election of \nthe Congress Working Committee. That was just a straw show- \ning the drifi: of the wind; the real causes lay deeper. \n\nWhile we were all at Karachi news had come of the Hindu- \nMuslim riots at Cawnpore, to be followed, soon after, by the \nreport of the murder of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi by a \nfrenzied mob of persons whom he was trying to help. Those \nterrible and brutal riots were bad enough, but Ganeshji's death \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nbrought them home to U as nothing else could have done. \nHe was known to thousands in that Congress camp, and to all \nof us of the U.P. he was the dearest of comrades and friend, \nbrave and intrepid, far-sighted and full of wise counsel, never \ndownhearted, quiedy working away and scorning publicity and \noffice and the limelight. In me pride of his youth he willingly \noffered his life for the cause he loved and served, and foolish \nhands struck him down, and deprived Cawnpore and the pro- \nvince of the brightest of their jewels. There was gloom over \nour UJP. camp in Karachi when this news came; the glory \nseemed to have departed. And yet there was pride in him, \nthat he had faced death so un&lteringly and died so gloriously.  FRICTION DURING TRUCE PERIOD \n\nShould Gandhiji go to London for the Round Table Confer- \nence or not? Again and again the question arose, and there \nwas no definite answer. No one knew till the last moment \u2014 ^not \neven the Congress Working Committee or Gandhiji hinaself. \nFor the answer depended on many things, and new happenings \nwere constantly giving a fresh turn to the situation. Behind \nthat question and answer lay real and difficult problems. \n\nWe were told repeatedly, on behalf of the British Govern- \nment and their firiends, that the Round Table Conference had \nalready laid down the ficamework of the constitution, that the \nprincipal lines of the picture had been drawn, and all that re- \nmained was the filling of this picture. But the Congress did \nnot t hink so, and so far as it was concerned, the picture had to \nbe drawn or painted firom the very beginning on an almost \nblank canvas. It was true that by the Delhi agreement the \nfederal basis had been approved and the idea of safeguards \naccepted. But a federation had long seemed to many of us the \nbest solution of the Indian constitutional problem, and our \napproval of this idea did not mean our acceptance of the par- \nticular type of federation envisaged by the first Round Table \nConference, A federation was perfecdy compatible with political \nindependence and social change. It was far more difficult to fit \nin the idea of safeguards and, ordinarily, they would mean a \nsubstantial diminution of sovereignty, but the qualifying phrase \n\u201c in the interests of India \u201d helped us to get over this mmculty \nto some extent at least, though not perhaps very successfully. \nIn any event, the Karachi Congress had made it clear that an \nacceptable constitution must provide for full control of defence, \nforeign aifiiirs, and financim and economic policy, and an \nexamination of the question of India\u2019s indebtedness to foreign ' \n(meaning largely British) interests before liabilities were under- \ntaken; and the Wdamental rights resolution had also indicated \nsome of the political and economic changes desired. All this \nwas incompatible with many of the Roimd Table Conference \ndecisions, as well as with the existing firamework of administra- \ntion in India. \n\nThe gulf between the Congress view-point and that of the \nBritish Government was immense, and it seemed exceedingly \u2022\u2022 \n\n* \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nunlikely that it could be bridged at that stage. Very few Con- \ngressmen expected any measure of agreement between the \nCongress and the Government at the Round Table Conference, \nand even Gandhiji, optimistic as he always is, could not look \nforward to much. And yet he was never hopeless and was deter- \nmined to try to the very end. All of us felt that whether success \nramp or not, the effort had to be made, in continuation of the \nDelhi agreement. But there were two vital considerations which \nmight have barred our participation in the second Round Table \nConference. We could only go if we had full freedom to place \nour view-point in its entirety before the Round Table Confer- \nence, and were not prevented from doing so by being told that \nthe matter had already been decided, or for any other reason. \nWe could also be prevented from being represented at the \nRound Table Conference by conditions in India. A situation \nmight have developed here which precipitated a conflict with \nGovernment, or in which we had to face severe repression. If \nthis took place in India and our very house was on fire, it would \nhave been singularly out of place for any representative of ours \nto ignore the fire and talk academically of constitutions and the \nlike.in London. \n\nThe situation was developing svnftly in India. This was \nnoticeable aU over the country, and especially so in Bengal, the \nUnited Provinces, and the Frontier Province. In Bengal the \nDelhi agreement had made little difference, and the tension con- \ntinued and grew worse. Some civil disobedience prisoners were \ndischarged, but thousands of politicals, who were technically \nnot civil disobedience prisoners, remained in prison. The \ndetenus also continued in gaol or detention camps. Fresh arrests \nwere frequently made for \u2018 seditious \u2019 speeches or other political \nactivities, and generally it was felt that the Government offen- \nsive had continued without any abatement. For the Congress, \nthe Bengal problem has been an extraordinarily difficult one \nbecause of the existence of terrorism. Compared to the normal \nCongress activities and civil disobedience, these terroristic activi- \nties were, in extent and importance, very little. But they made \na loud noise and attracted great attention. They also helped in \nmaking it difficult fer Congress work to function as in most \nother provinces, for terrorism produced an atmosphere which \nwas not favourable to peaceful direct action. Inevitably they \ninvited the severest repression from the Government, and this \nfell vrith considerable impartiality on terrorist and non-terrorist \nalike. \n\nIt was difficult for the police and the local executive \n\n\n\nFRICTION DURING TRUCE PERIOD  \n\nauthorities not to make use of the special laws and ordinances \n(meant for the terrorists) for Congressmen, labour and peasant \nworkers and others whose activities they disapproved of. It is \npossible than the real offence of many of the detenus, kept now \nfor years without charge or trial or conviction, was not terror- \nistic activity but other effective political activity. Thejt have \nbeen given no chance of proving or di^roving anything, or \neven of knowing what their sins are. They are hot tried in \ncourt, presumabfy because the police have not sufficient evi- \ndence against them to secure a conviction, although it is well \nknown that the British-Indian laws for offences against the State \nare amazingly thorough and comprehensive, and it is difficult \nto escape from their close meshes. It often happens that a person \nis acquitted by the law courts and is immediately arrested again \nand thereafter treated as a detenu. \n\nThe Congress Working Committee felt very helpless before \nthis intricate problem of Bengal. They were continually op- \npressed by it, and some Bengal matter was always coming up \nbefore them in different forms. They dealt with it as best they \ncould, but they knew well that they were not really tackling the \nproblem. So, rather weakly, they simply allowed matters to \ndrift there; it is a little difficult to say what else they could \nhave done, placed as they were. This attitude of the Working \nCommittee was much resented in Bengal, and an impression \ngrew up there that the Congress executive, as well as the other \nprovinces, were ignoring Bengal. In the hour of her trial \nBengal seemed to be deserted. This impression was entirely \nwrong, for the whole of India was full of sympathy for the \npeople of Bengal, but it did not know how to trtinslate this \nsympathy into effective help. And, besides, every part of India \nhad to face its own troubles. \n\nIn the United Provinces the agrarian situation was becoming \nworse. The Provincial Government temporised with the prob- \nlem and delayed a decision about rent and revenue remissions, \nand forcible collections were begun. There were wholesale eject- \nments and attachments. While we were in Ceylon there had \ntaken place two or three agrarian riots when forcible attempts \nwere made to collect rents. The riots were jpetty in themsdves, \nbut unhappily they resulted in the death of the lantllord or his \n^ent. Gandniji had gone to Naini Tal (also when I was in \nCeylon) to discuss the agrarian situation with the Governor of \nthe U.P., Sir Malcolm Hailey, without much result. When the \nGovernment announced its remissions, they fell for short of ex- \npertations, and in the rural areas there was a continuous and an \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\never-growing uproar. As the pressure of landlord plus govern- \nment grew on the peasantry, and thousands of tenants were \nejected from their holdings and had their little property seized, \na situation developed which in most other countries would have \nresulted in a big peasant rising. I think it was very largely due \nto the efforts of the Congress which kept the tenants from in- \ndulging in violent activity. But there was an abundance of \nviolence against them. \n\nThere was one bright side to this agrarian upheaval and dis- \ntress. Owing to the very low prices of agricultural produce, the \npoorer classes, including the peasants, unless they were dis- \npossessed, had more to eat than they had had for a long time. \n\nIn the Frontier Province, as in Bengal, the Delhi Pact brought \nno peace. There was a permanent state of tension there, and \ngovernment was a military affair, with special laws and ordi- \nnances and heavy punishments \u00a3}r trivial offences. To oppose \nthis state of affairs, Abdul Ghaffar Khan led a great agitation, \nand he soon became a bugbear to the Government. From village \nto viUagh he went striding along, carrying his six-feet-three of \nPathan manhood, and establishmg centres of the ' Redshirts *. \nWherever he or his principal lieutenants went, they left a trail \nof their \u2018 Redshirts \u2019 behind, and the whole province was soon \ncovered by branches of the \u2018Khudai Khidmatgar They were \nthoroughly peaceful and, in spite of vague allegations, not a \nsingle definite charge of violence against them has been estab- \nlished. But whether they were peaceful or not, they had the \ntradition of war and violence behind them, and they lived near \nthe turbulent frontier, and this rapid growth of a disdplmed \nmovement, closely allied to the Indian national movement, \nthoroughly upset the Government. I do not suppose they ever \nbelieved in its professions of peace and non-violence. But even \nif they had done so, their reactions to it would only have been \nof fright and annoyance. It represented too much of actual \nand potential power for them to view it with equanimity. \n\nOf this great movement the unquestioned head was Khan \nAbdul Gbaffar Khan\u2014 \u201c Fakhr-e-Afghan \u201d, \u201d Fakr-e-Pathan \u201d, \nthe \u2018Pride of the Pathans\u2019, \u2018 Gandln-e-Sarhad \u2019, the \u2018Frontier \nGandhi as he came to be known. He had attained an amazing \npopularity in the Frontier Province by sheer dint of quiet, \npersevering work, undaunted by difficulties or Government \naction. He was, and is, no politidan as politidans go; he knows \nnothing of the tactics and manoeuvres of polirics. A tall, \nstraight mian, straight in body and mind, hating fuss and too \nmuch talk, looking forward to freedom for his Frontier Province \n\n\n\nFRICTION DURING TRUCE PERIOD  \n\npeople within the framework of Indian freedom, but vague \nabout, and uninterested in, constitutions and legal talk. Action \nwas necessary to achieve anything, and Mahatma Gandhi had \ntaught a remarkable way of peaceful action which appealed to \nhim. For action, organisation was necessary; therefore, without \nfurther argument or much drafting of rules for his organisation, \nhe started organising\u2014 and with remarkable success. \n\nHe was especially attracted to Gandhiji. At first his shyness \nand desire to keep in the background mafie him keep away \nfrom him. Later they had to meet to discuss various matters, \nand their contacts grew. It was surprising how this Pathan \naccepted the idea of non-violence, far more so in theory than \nmany of us. And it was because he believed in it tW he \nmanaged to impress his people with the importance of remain- \ning peaceful in spite of provocation. It would be absurd to say \nthat the people of the Frontier Province have given up aU \nthoughts of ever indulging in violence, just as it would be \nabsurd to say this of the people generally in any province. The \nmasses are moved by waves of emotion, and no one can predict \nwhat they might do when so moved. But the self discipline that \nthe frontier people showed in  and subsequent years has \nbeen something amazing. \n\nGovernment officials and some of our very timid countrymen \nlook askance at the \u2018 Frontier Gandhi They cannot take him \nat his word, and can only think in terms of deep intrigue. But \nthe past years have brought him and other frontier comrades \nvery near to Congress workers in other parts of India, and \nbetween them there has grown up a close comradeship and \nmutual appreciation and regard. Abdul Ghafiar Khan has been \nknown and liked for many years in Congress circles. But he has \ngrown to be. something more than an individual comrade; more \nand more he has come to be, in the eyes of the rest of India, \nthe symbol of the courage and sacrifice of a gallant and indo- \nmitable people, comrades of ours in a common struggle. \n\nLong before I had heard of Abdul Ghaffor Khan,  knew his \nbrother. Dr. \u00a3[han Sahib. He was a student at St. Thomas\u2019s \nHospital in London when I was at Cambridge, and later, when \nI was eating my Bar dinners at the Inner Temple he and  \nbecame dose friends, and hardly a day went by, when I was in \nLondon, when we did not meet. I returned to India, leaving \nhim in England, and he stayed on for many more Kars, serving \nas a doctor in war-time. I saw him next in Naini Prison. \n\nThe frontier \u2018Redshirts\u2019 co-operated with the Congress, but \nthey were an organisation apart. It was a peculiar position. \n\n\n\naSo JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nThe real connecting link was Abdul GhafFar Khan. This \nquestion was fuUy considered by the Working Committee in \nconsultation with the Frontier Province leaders in the summer \nof    and it was decided to absorb the \u2018Redshirts\u2019 into the \nCongress. The \u2018 Redshirt \u2019 movement thus became part of the \nCongress organisation. \n\nIt was Gandhiji\u2019s wish to go to the Frontier Province immedi- \nately after the Karachi Congress, but the Government did not \nencourage this at all. Repeatedly, in later months, when \nGovernment officials complained of the doings of the \u2018Red- \nshirts\u2019, he pressed to be allowed to go there to find out for \nhimself, but to no purpose. Nor was my going there approved. \nIn view of the Delhi agreement, it was not considered desirable \nby us to enter the Frontier Province against the declared wish \nof the Government. \n\nYet another of the problems before the Working Committee \nwas the communal problem. There was nothing new about this, \nalthough it had a way of reappearing in novel and fantastic \nattire. The Round Table Conference gave it an added impor- \ntance at the time, as it was obvious that the British Government \nwould keep it in the forefiront and subordinate all other issues \nto it. The members of the Conference, all nominees of the \nGovernment, had been mainly chosen in order to give impor- \ntance to the communal and sectional interests, and to lay stress \non these divergences rather than on the common interests. The \nGovernment had even refused, pointedly and aggressively, to \nnominate any leader of the Nationalist Muslims. Gandhiji fdt \nthat if the Conference, at the instance of the British Govern- \nment, became entangled in the communal issue right at the \nbeginning, the real political and economic issues womd not get \nproper consideration. Under these circtunstances, his going to \nthe Conference would be of litde use. He put it to the Working \nCommittee, therefore, that he should only go to London if some \nunderstanding on the communal issue was previously arrived \nat between the parties concerned. His instinct was perfectly \njustified, but nevertheless the Committee overruled him and \ndecided that he must not refuse to go merely on the ground \nthat we had failed to solve the communal problem. An attempt \nwas made hj the Committee, in consultation with representa- \ntives of' various communities, to put forward a proposed solu- \ntion. This had no great success. \n\nThese were some of the major problems before us during that \nsummer of , besides a large number of minor issues. From \nall over the country we were continually receiving complaints \n\n\n\nFRICTION DURING TRUCE PERIOD  \n\nfrom local Congress Committees pointing out breaches of the \nDelhi Pact by local ofScials. The more important of these were \nforwarded by us to the Government, which, in its turn, brought \ncharges against Congressmen of violation of the Pact. So \ncharges and counter<harges were made, and later they were \npublished in the Press. Needless to say, this did not result in \nthe improvement of the relations between the Congress and \nthe Government. \n\nAnd yet this friction on petty matters was hy itself of no \ngreat importance. Its importance lay in its revealing the \ndevelopment of a more fundamental conflict, something which \ndid not depend on individuals but arose from the very namre \nof our national struggle and the want of equilibrium of our \nagrarian economy, something that could not be liquidated or \ncompromised away without a basic change. Our national move- \nment had originally begun because of the desire of our upper \nmiddle classes to find means of self expression and self-growth, \nand behind it there was the political and economic urge. It \nspread to the lower middle classes and became a power in the \nland; and then it began to stir the rural masses who were find- \ning it more and more difficult to keep up, as a whole, even \ntheir miserable rock-bottom standard of living. The old self- \nsufficient village economy had long ceased to exist. Auxiliary \ncottage industries, ancillary to agriculture, which had relieved \nsomewhat the burden on the land, had died off, partly because \nof State policy, but largely because, they could not compete with \nthe rising machine industry. The bmden on land grew and the \ngrowth of Indian industry was too slow to make much differ- \nence to this. Ill-equipped and almost unawares, the overbur- \ndened village was thrown into the world market and was tossed \nabout hither and thither. It could not compete on even terms. \nIt was backward in its methods of production, and its land \nsystem, resulting in a progressive fragmentation of holdings, \nmade radical improvement impossible. So the agricultural \nclasses, both landlords and tenants, went downhill, except \nduring brief periods of boom. The landlords tried to pass on \nthe burden to their tenantry, and the growing pauperisation of \nthe peasantry\u2014 both the petty landholders and the tenants \u2014 \ndrew them to the national movement. The agricultural prole- \ntariat, the large numbers of landless labourers in rural areas, \nwere also attracted; and for all these rural classes ' nationalism ' \nor ' swaraj \u2019 meant fundamental changes in the land system, \nwhich would relieve or lessen their burdens and provide land \nfor the landless. These desires 'ffiund no clear expression eithd: \n\n\n\na JAWAHASLAL NEHRU \n\nin the peasantry or in the middle-class leaders of the national \nmovement. \n\nThe Civil Disobedience movement of  happened to fit in \nunbeknown to its own leaders at first, with the great world \nslump in industry and agriculture. The rural masses were \npowerfully affected by this sIuim, and they turned to the Con- \ngress and civil disobedience. For them it was not a matter \nof a fine constitution drawn up in London or elsewhere, \nbut of a basic change in the land system, especially in the \nzamindari areas. The zamindari system, indeed, seemed to \nhave outlived its day and had no stability left in it. But the \nBritish Government, situated as it was, could not venture to \nundertake a radical change of this land system. Even when \nit had appointed the Royal Agricultural Commission, the terms \nof reference to it barred a discussion of the question of owner- \nship of land or the system of land tenure. \n\nThus the conflict lay in tihe very nature of things in India \nthen, and it could not be charmed away by phrases or com- \npromises. Only a solution of the basic problem of land (not to \nmention other vital national issues) could resolve that conflict. \nAnd of this solution through the instrumentality of the British \nGovernment there was no possibility. Temporary measures \nmight alleviate the distress for a while; severe repression might \nfrighten and prevent public expression of it; but neither helped \nin the solution of the problem. \n\nThe British Government, like most governments I suppose, \nhas an idea that much of the trouble in India is due to '^agita- \ntors It is a singularly inept notion. India has had a great \nleader during the past fifteen years who has won the affection \nand even adoration of her miuions, and has seemed to impose \nhis will on her in many ways. He has played a vitally impor- \ntant part in her recent history, and yet more important than \nhe were the people themselves who seemed to follow blindly \nhis behests. The people were the principal actors, and behind \nthem, pushing them on, were great historical urges which pre- \npared them and made them ready to listen to their leader\u2019s \npiping. But for that historical setting and political and social \nurges, no leaders or agitatom could have inspired them to \naction. It was Gandhiji\u2019s chief virtue as a leader that he could \ninstinctively feel the pulse of the people and know when con- \nditions were ripe for growth and action. \n\nIn  the nation^ movement in India fitted in fiir a while \nwith the growing social forces of the country, and because of \nthis a great power came to it, a sense of reality, as if it was \n\n\n\nFRICTION DURING TRUCE PERIOD  \n\nindeed marching step by step with history- The Congress \nrepresented that national movement, and this power and \nstrength were reflected in the growth of Congress prestige. \nThis was something vague, incalculable, indefinable, but never- \ntheless very much present. The peasantry, of course, turned to \nthe Congress and gave it its real strength; the lower middle<lass \nformed the backbone of its fighting ranks. Even the upper \nbourgeoisie, troubled by this new atmosphere, thought it safer \nto be friendly with the Congress. The great majority of the \ntextile mills in India signed undertakings prescribed by the \nCongress, and were afraid of doing things which might bring on \nthem the displeasure of the Congress. Wiile people argued fine \nlegal points in London at the first R.T.C., the reality of power \nseemed to be slowly and imperceptibly flowing towards the \nCongress as representing the people. This illusion grew even \nafter the Delhi Pact, not because of vainglorious speeches, but \nbecause of the events of ^ and after, indeed, probably the \npersons who were most conscious of the difficulties and dangers \nahead were the Congress leaders, and they took every care not \nto minimise them. \n\nThis vague sense of a dual authority growing in the country \nwas naturally most irritating to the Government. It had no \nreal basis in fact, as physical power rested completely with the \nauthorities, but that it existed psychologically there was no \ndoubt. For an authoritarian, irremovable government this was \nan impossible situation, and it was this subde atmosphere that \nreally got on their nerves, and not a few odd village speeches or \nprocessions of which they conrolained later. A dash, therefore, \nseemed inevitable; for the Congress could hardly commit \nvoluntary hara-kiri, and the Government could not tolerate this \natmosphere of duality, and was bent on crushing the Coimress. \nThis dash was deferred because of the second Round Table \nConference. For some reason or other the British Government \nwas very^een on having Gandhiji in London, and avoided, as \nfar as possible, doing anything to prevent this. \n\nAnd yet the sense of conflict grew, and we could fed the \nhardening on the side of Government. Soon after the Delhi \nPact, Lord Irwin had left India and Lord WiUingdon had come \nin his place as Viceroy. A legend grew up that the new Viceroy \nwas a hard and stem person and not so amenable to compromise \nas his predecessor. Many of our polilidans have inherited a \n\u2018 liberal' habit of thinking of politics in terms of persons rather \nthan of prindples. They do not realise that the broad imperial \npolicy of the British Government does not depend , on the \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\npersonal views of the Viceroys. The change of Viceroys, \ntherefore, did not and could not make any difference, but, \nas it happened, the policy of Government ^adually changed \nowing to the development of the situation. The Civil Service \nhierarchy had not approved of pacts and dealings with the \nCongress; all their training and authoritarian conceptions of \ngovernment were opposed to this. They had an idea that they \nhad added to the Congress influence and Gandhiji\u2019s prestige by \ndealing with him almost as an equal and it was about time \nthat he was brought down a pe^ or two. The notion was a \nvery foolish one, but then the Indian Civil Service is not known \nfor the originality of its conceptions. Whatever the reason, the \nGovernment stiffened its back and tightened its hold, and it \nseemed to tell us, in the words of the old prophet: My little \nfinger is thicker than my father\u2019s loins. Where^ he chastised \nyou with whips, I will chastise you with scorpions. \n\nBut the time for chastisement was not yet. If possible the \nCongress was to be represented at the second Round Table Con- \nference. Twice Gandhiji went to Simla to have long conversa- \ntions with the Viceroy and other officials. They discussed many \nof the points at issue, especially the \u2018 Redshirt \u2019 movement in \nthe Frontier and U.P. Agrarian situation, the two prob- \nlems, apart from Bengal, which seemed to be worrying the \nGovernment most. \n\nGandhiji had sent for me from Simla, and I had occasion to \nmeet some of the Government of India officials also. My talks \nwere limited to the U.P. They were frank talks, and the real \nconflicts, which lay behind the petty charges and counter- \ncharges, were discussed. I remember being told that the \nGovernment had been in a position in February  to crush \nthe Civil Disobedience movement absolutely within three \nmonths at the most. They had perfected their machinery of \nrepression and only a push had to be given to it; a button \npressed. But preferring, if possible, a settlement by agreement \nto one imposed by force, they had decided to try the experi- \nment of mutual talks which had led to the Delhi agreement. \nIf the agreement had not come off, the button was always \nthere, and could have been pressed at a moment\u2019s notice. And \nthere seemed to be a hint that the button might have to be \npressed in the not distant future if we did not behave. It was \nall said very courteously and very frankly, and both of us knew \nthat, quite apart from us and whatever we might say or do, \nconff ct was ineidtable. \n\nAnother high official paid a compliment to the Congress. We \n\n\n\nFRICTION DURING TRUCE PERIOD  \n\nwere for the moment discussing wider problems of a non- \npolitical nature, and he told me that, politics apart, the Con- \ngress had done a great service to India. The usual charge \nDrought against Indians was that they were not good organisers, \nbut during  the Congress had done a wonderful bit of \norganising, despite enormous difficulties and opposition. \n\nGandhiji\u2019s first visit to Simla was inconclusive in so far as the \nquestion of going to the Round Table Conference was con- \ncerned. The second visit took place in the last week of August. \nA final decision had to be taken one way or the other, but still \nhe found it difficult to make up his mind to leave India. In \nBengal, in the Frontier Province, and in the U.P., he saw \ntrouble ahead, and he did not want to go unless he had some \nassurance of peace in India. At last some kind of an agree- \nment was arrived at with the Government embodied in a \nstatement and some letters that were exchanged. This was \ndone at the very last moment to enable him to travel by the \nliner that was carrying the delegates to the R.T.C. Indeed, it \nwas after the last moment, in a sense, as the last train had gone. \nA special train firom Simla to Kalka was arranged, and other \ntrains were delayed to make the connections. \n\nI accompanied him from Simla to Bombay, and there, one \nbright morning towards the end of August, I waved goodbye \nto him as he was carried away to the Arabian Sea and the \nfar West. That was my last glimpse of him for two years.  BALLYHOO \n\nThose early months of  were remarkable, among other \nthings, for an extraordinary exhibition of ballyhoo on the part \nof the British authorities. Officials, high and low, shouted out \nhow virtuous and peaceful they were, and how sinful and pug- \nnacious was the Congress. They stood for democracy w'hile the \nCongress favoured dictatorships. Was not its President called a \ndictator? In their enthusiasm for a righteous cause they forgot \ntrifles like Ordinances, and suppression of all liberties, and muz- \nzling of newspapers and presses, imprisonment of people \nwithout trial, seizure of properties and monies, and the \nmany other odd things that were happening from day to day. \nThey forgot also the basic character of British rule in India. \nMinisters of Government (our own countrymen) grew eloquent \non how Congressmen were \u2018 grinding their axes \u2019\u2014in jjrison\u2014 \nwhile they lamoured for the public good on paltry salaries of a \nfew thousand rupees per month. The lower magistracy not only \nsentenced us to heavy terms but lectured to us in tire process, \nand sometimes abused the Congress and individuals connected \nwith it. Even' Sir Samuel Hoare, from the serene dignity of his \nhigh office as Secretary of State for India, announced that \nthough dogs barked the caravan moved on. He forgot for the \nmoment that the dogs were in gaol and could not easily bark \nthere, and those left outside were effectively muzzled. \n\nMost surprising of all, the Cawnpore Communal Riots were \nlaid at the door of the Congress. The horrors of these truly \nhorrible riots were laid bare, and it was repeatedly stated that \nthe Congress was responsible for them. As it happened, the \nCongress had played the only decent part in them, and one of \nits noblest sons lay dead, mourned by every group and com- \nmunity in Cawnpore. The Karachi session of the Congress, \nimmemately on hearing of the riots, appointed an Enquiry \nCommittee, and this Committee made a most exhaustive en- \nquiry. After many months of labour, it issued a voluminous \nreport, which was promptly proscribed by the Government, and \nprinted copies were seized and, I suppose, destroyed. This at- \ntempt to suppress the results of an enquiry has not prevented \nour official critics and the British-owned Press from repeating \nfrom time to time that the riots were due to Congress work. \n\n* \n\n\n\n* JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nNo doiibtj in this and other matters, the truth will prevail in \nthe end, but sometimes the lie has a long start. \n\n\u201c When all its work is done, the lie shall rot; \n\nThe truth is great and shall prevail. \n\nWhen none cares whether it prevails or not.\u201d \n\nIt was all very natural, I suppose, this exhibition of a hys- \nterical war mentality, and no one could expect truth or restraint \nunder the circumstances. But it did seem to go beyond expec- \ntation, and was surprising in its intensity and abandon. It was \nsome indication of the state of nerves of the ruling group in \nIndia, and of how they had been repressing themselves in the \npast. Probably the anger was not caused by anything we had \ndone or said, but by the realisation of their own previous fear \nof losing their empire. Rulers who are confident of their ovra \nstrength do not give way in this manner. The contrast between \nthis picture and the other was very marked. For on the other \nside silence reigned, not the silence of voluntary and dignified \nrestraint, but the silence of prison and of &ar and an all- \npervasive censorship. But for this enforced gagging, no doubt \nthe other side would have also excelled in hysterical outbursts \nand exaggeration and abuse. One outlet, however, there was \u2014 \nunauthorised news sheets whidh were issued in various towns \nfrom time to time. \n\nThe British-owned Anglo-In(fian newspapers in India joined \nin this game of ballyhoo with p;usto, and gave utterance and \npublicity to many a mought wl^h perhaps they had mutured \nand repressed in secret tor long. Ordinarily they have to be \na little careful of what they say, for many of their readers are \nIndians, but the crisis in India swept away these restraints and \ngave ys a glimpse of the minds of all, English and Indian \nalike. There are few Anglo-Indian newspapers left in India; \none by one they have dropped out. Several of those that remain \nare high-class journals, both in the news they supply and thdr \ngeneral get-up. Their leading articles on world anairs, though \nalways representing the conservative view-point, are able and \nshow knowledge and grasp. Undoubtedly as newspapers they \nare probably the best in India. But on Indian political problems \nthere is a sudden fall, and their treatment of them is amazingly \none-sided; and, in times of crisis, this partiality often becomes \nhysteria and vulgarity. They represent faithfully the Govern- \nment of India, and the continuous propaganda they do for it \nhas not the merit of being imobtrusive. \n\n\n\nuALLi HUU \n\n\n^ \n\nCompared to these selected few Anglo-Indian newspapers, the \nIndian newspapers are usually poor stuff. Their financial re- \nsources are limited, and there is litde attempt on the part of \ntheir owners to improve them. They carry on their day-to-day \nlife with difficulty, and the unhappy editorial staff has no easy \ntime. Their get-up is poor, their advertisements often of the \nmost objectionable kind, and their general attitude to life and \npolitics sentimental and hysterical. Partly, I suppose, this is \ndue to the fact that vft are a sentimental race; partly because \nthe medium (of the English newspapers) is a foreign tongue \nand it is not easy to write simply and, at the same time, force- \nfully. But the real reason is mat all of us suffer from any \nnumber of complexes due to long repression and subjection, \nand every outlet is apt to be surcharged with emotion. \n\nAmong the Indian-owned English newspapers. The Hindu of \nMadras is probably the best, so far as get-up and news service \nare concerned. It always reminds me of an old maiden lady, \nvery prim and proper, who is shocked if. a naughty word is \nused in her presence. It is eminently the paper of the Bourgeois, \ncomfortably settled in life. Not for it is the shady side of \nexistence, me rough and tumble and conflict of life. Several \nother newspapers of moderate views have also this 'old maiden \nlady \u2019 stan(urd. They achieve it, but without the distinction of \nThe Hindu and, as a result, they become astonishingly dull in \nevery respect. \n\nIt was evident that the Government had long prepared its \nblow, and it wanted it to be as ffiorough and staggering as \npossible right at the beginning. In  it was always at- \ntempting, by fresh Ordinances, to catch up an ever-worsening \nsituation. The initiaiive remained then with the Congress. The \n methods were ffifferent, and Government began with an \noffensive all along ffie line. Every conceivable power was given \nand take under a batdi of all-India and provincial Ordinances ; \norganisations were outlawed; buildings, property, automobiles, \nbs^ accounts were seized; public gatherings and processions \nforbidden, and newspapers and printing presses fuUy controlled. \nOn the other hand, unlike , Gandhiji was definitely desirous \nof avoiding civil ffisobedience just then, and most of the mem- \nbers of the Working Committee thought likewise. Some of \nthem, including myself, thought mat a struggle was inevitable, \nhowever much we disliked it, and should merefore be prepared \nfor, and m the United Provinces and the Frontier Province \na growii^ tension had directed people's minds to me approadi- \ning conffict. But, on ffie whole, the middle classes and me \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nintelligentsia were not thinking then in terms of struggle \nalthough they could not wholly ignore the possibility. Some- \nhow, they hoped that this struggle would be avoided on \nGandhiji\u2019s return; the wish was obviously father to the thought. \n\nThus the initiative early in  was definitely with the \nGovernment, and Congress was always on the defensive. Local \nCongress leaders in many places were taken by surprise by the \nrapid devolpments leading to the Ordinances and civil diso- \nbedience. In spite of this there was a remarkable response to \nthe Congress call, and there was no lack of civil resisiers. \nIndeed I think that there can be litde doubt that the resistance \noffered to the British Government in  was far greater than \nin , although in  there was more show and publicity, \nespecially in the big cities. In spite of this greater endurance \nshown by the people in , and their remaining overwhelm- \ningly peaceful, the initial push of inspiration was far less than \nin . It was as if we entered unwillingly to battle. There \nwas a glory about it in  which had faded a little two years \nlater. The Government countered Congress with every resource \nat its command; India lived pracdcally under martial law, and \nCongress never really got back the initiative or any fi'eedom \nof action. The first blows stunned it, and most of its bourgeois \nsympathisers who had been its principal supporters in the past. \nTheir pockets were hit, and it became obvious that those who \njoined the civil disobedience movement, or were known to help \nit in any way, stood to lose not only their liberty, but perhaps \nall their property. This did not matter so much to us in the \nU.P., where the Congress was a poor man\u2019s concern; but in the \nbig cities, like Bombay, it made a great deal of difference. It \nmeant absolute ruin lor the merefa^t class and great loss to \nprofessional people. The mere threat of this (and it was some- \ntimes carried out) paralysed these well-to-do city classes. I \nlearnt later of a timid but prosperous merchant, who had little \nto do with politics, except perhaps to give an occasional dona- \ntion, being threatened by the police with a fine of five lakhs of \nrupees, besides a long term of imprisonment. Such threats \nwere fairly common, and were by no means empty talk, for the \npolice were all-powerful then and instances occurred daily of \nthreats being translated into action. \n\nI do not think any Congressman has a right to object to the \nprocedure adopted by the Government, although the violence \nand coercion used by the Government against an overwhelm- \ningly non-violent movement was certainly most objectionable \nfirom any civilised standards. If we choose to adopt revolu- \n\n\n\nBALLYHOO \n\n\n \n\ntionary direct action methods, however non-violent they might \nbe, we must expect every resistance. We cannot play at revolu- \ntion in a drawing-room, but many people want to have the \nadvantage of both. For a person to dabble in revolutionary \nmethods, he must be prepared to lose everything he possesses. \nThe prosperous and the well-to-do are therefore seldom revolu- \ntionaries, though individuals may play the fool in the eyes \nof dte worldly-wise and he dubbed traitors to their own class. \n\nOther methods had to be adopted, of course, to deal with \nthe masses, who had no cars or banking accounts or other \nproperty worth seizing, and on whom the real burden of the \nstruggle lay. One interesting result of the ruthlcssness of \nGovernment action in all directions was to whip up that crowd \nof people, who might be called (to borrow a word from a recent \nbook) \u2018 Governmentarians into activity. Some of them had \nrecently begun to flirt with the Congress, not knowing what \nthe future might bring. But Government could not tolerate \nthis, and no passive loyalty was enough. In the words of \nFrederick Cooper of Mutiny fame the authorities \u201c would brook \nnothing short of absolute, active, and positive loyalty. Govern- \nment could not condescend to exist upon the moral sufferance \nof its subjects.\u201d A year ago Mr. Lloyd George referred to his \nold colleagues, the leaders of the British Lmeral Party who \nhad joined the National Government, as \u201c specimens or those \nchangeable reptiles who adapt their hue to their environments.\u201d \nThe new environment in India tolerated no neutral hues, and \nso some of our countrymen appeared in the brightest of ap- \nproved colours and, with song and feasting, they declared their \nlove and admiration for our rulers. They had nothing to fear \nfrom the Ordinances and the numerous prohibitions and inhi- \nbitions and curfew orders and sunset laws; for had it not been \nofficially stated that all this was meant for the disloyal and \nthe seditious, and the loyal need have no cause for alarm? And \nso they could view the turmoil and conflict all round them \nwith a measure of equanimity, devoid of that fear that gripped \nmany of their countrymen. With Chloe (in The Faithful Shep- \nherdess) they might perhaps have agreed when she said: \n\n\u201c For from one cause of fear I am most free, \n\nIt is impossible to ravish me, \n\nI am so willing.\u201d \n\nThe Government had somehow got hold of the idea that \nCongress was going to exploit women in the stru^le by filling \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NjiJHRU \n\n\n \n\nthe gaols with them, in the hope that women would be well \ntreated or would get light sentences. It was a fantastic notion, \nas if any one likes to push his womenfolk into prison. Usually \nwhen girls or women took an active part in the campaign, it \nwas in spite of their fathers or brothers or husbands, or at any \nrate not with their full co-operation. Government, however, \ndecided to discourage women by long sentences and bad treat- \nment in prison. Soon after my sisters\u2019 arrest and conviction, a \nnumber of young girls, mostly  or  years old, met in Alla- \nhabad to discuss what they could do. They had no experience, \nbut were full of enthusiasm and wanted advice. They were \narrested as they were meeting in a private house, and ea'ch of \nthem was sentenced to two years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment. This \nwas a minor incident, one of many that were occurring all over \nIndia ftom day to day. Most of the girls and women who were \nsentenced had a very bad time in prison, even worse than the \nmen had. I heard of many painful instances, but the most extra- \nordinary account that I saw was one prepared by Miraben \n(Madeleine Slade) giving her experiences, together with those of \nother civil disobedience prisoners, in a Bombay gaoL \n\nIn the United Provinces our struggle was centred in the rural \nareas. Owing to the unceasing pressure of the Congress, as repre- \nsenting the pet^antry, ftiirly substantial remissions had been \npromised, though we did not think them enough.\u2019 Immediately \nafter our arrest additional remissions were announced. It was \ncurious that this announcement did not come earlier, for it could \nhave made a great deal of difference. It would have been difficult \nfor us to reject it offhand. But then Government was very \nanxious that the Congress should not get the credit for these \nremissions, and so on the one side they wanted to crush the \nCongress, and on the other to give as much as possible remissions \nto the peasants to keep them quiet. It was noticeable that the \nremissions were highest wherever the Congress pressure had been \ngreatest. \n\nThese remissions, considerable as they were, did not solve the \nagrarian problem, but -they did ease the situation greatly. They \ntook the edge off the peasantry\u2019s resistance, and from the point \nof view of our larger struggle, weakened us at the moment, ^at \nstruggle brought suffering to scores of thousands of peasants in \nthe U.P., and many were completely ruined by it. But the pres- \nsure of that struggle brought millions of peasants almost the \nhighest possible remissions under the existing system, and saved \nthem (the consequences of civil disobedience and its offihoots \napart) ftom a tremendous amount of harassment. These petty \n\n\n\nBALLYHOO \n\n\n \n\nseasonal gains for the peasants do not amount to much, but I \nhave no doubt that, such as they were, they were largely due to \nthe persistent eiForts of the U.P. Congress Committee on behalf \nof the peasantry. The general body of the peasantry benefited \ntemporarily, but the bravest of them were among the casualties \nin that struggle. \n\nWhen the U.P. Special Ordinance was issued in December  \nan explanatory statement accompanied it. This statement, as \nwell as the statements accompanying other Ordinances, contained \nmany half-truths and untruths which were to serve as propa- \nganda. It was all part of the initial ballyhoo, and we had no \nchance to answer them or even contradict their glaring errors. \nOne particularly glaring attempt, in which a falsehood was \nsought to be fastened on Sherwani, was corrected by him just \nbefore his arrest. These various statements and apologies of \nGovernment made curious reading. They showed how rattled \nGovernment was, how its nerve was shaken. Reading the other \nday of a decree issued by the Bourbon Charles HI of Spain, \nbanishing the Jesuits from his realm, I was forcibly reminded of \nthese decrees and ordinances of the British Government in \nIndia and of the reasons given fer them. In this decree, issued \nin February , the King justified his action by \u201cextremely \ngrave reasons relative to my duty to maintain subordination, \ntranquillity, and justice among my subjects, and other urgent, \njust, and necessary reasons which  reserve in my royal breast.\u201d \n\nSo the real reasons fijr the Ordinances remained locked up in \nthe Viceregal breast or in the imperialist breasts of his coun- \nsellors, though they were obvious enough. The reasons given \nout officially helped us to understand the new technique of \npropaganda which the British Government in India was per- \nfecting. Some months later we learnt of semi-official \npamphlets and leaflets being widdy distributed all over the \nrural areas containing quite an astonishing number of mis- \nrepresentations and, in particular, hinting at the fiict that the \nCongress had caused the fall in agricultural prices which had \nhurt the peasantry so much. This was a remarkable tribute to \nthe power of the Congress, which could bring about a world \ndepression! But the lie was spread persistently and assiduously, \nin the hope that the prestige of the Congress might suffer. \n\nIn spite of aU this, the response of the peasantry in some of \nthe principal districts of the\u2019 U.P. to the call for civil diso- \nbedience, which inevitably got mixed up with the dispute about \nfair rent and remissions, was very fine. It was a far bigger and \nmore disciplihcd response than in . To begin whn there \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwas good humour about it too. A delightful story came to us \nof a visit of a police party to the village Bakulia in Rae Bareli \ndistrict. They had gone to attach goods for non-payment of \nrent. The village was relatively prosperous, and its residents \nwere men of some spirit. They received the revenue and police \nofficials with all courtesy and, leaving the doors of all the \nhouses open, invited them to go wherever they wanted to. Some \nattachments of cattle, etc., were made. The villagers then \noffered pan supari to the police and revenue officials, who \nretired looking very small and rather shamefaced! But this \nwas a rare and unusual occurrence, and very soon there was \nlittle of humour or charity or human kindness to be seen. \nPoor Bakulia could not escape pimishment for its spirit because \nof its humour. \n\nFor many months in these particular districts rent was vrith- \nheld by the tenantry, and it was only early in summer probably \nthat collections began to dribble in. Large numbers of arrests \nwere of course made, but this was almost in spite of Govern- \nment\u2019s policy. Generally arrests were confined to special workers \nand village leaders. The others were merely beaten. Beating \nwas found to be superior to prison as well as shooting. It could \nbe repeated whenever necessary and, taking place in remote \nrural areas, attracted little outside attention; nor did it add to \nthe swelling number of prisoners. There were of course large \nnumbers of ejectments, attachments and sale of cattle and \nproperty. With terrible anguish, the peasants watched the \nlittle they possessed being taken away and disposed of for \nridiculous prices. \n\nSwaraj Bhawan had been seized by the Government, in com- \nmon with numerous other buildings all over the country. All \nthe valuable equipment and materm belonging to the Congress \nHospital, whidh was functioning in Swaraj Bhawan, was also \nseized. For a few days the hospital ceased functioning alto- \ngether, but then an open-air dispensary was established in a \npark near by. Later the ho^ital, or rather dispensary, moved \nto a small house adjoining Swaraj Bhawan, and there it func- \ntioned &r nearly two and a half years. \n\nThere was some talk of our dwelling-house, Anand Bhawan, \nalso being taken possession of by the Government, for I had \nrefused to pay a large amount due as inepme tax. This tax had \nbeen assessed on father\u2019s income in , and he had not paid \nit that year because of civil disobedience. In , after the \nDelhi Pact, I had an argument with the income tax authorities \nabout it, but ultimately I agreed to pay and did pay an instal- \n\n\n\nBALLYHOO \n\n\n \n\nment. Just tlien came the Ordinances, and I decided to pay no \nmore. It seemed to me utterly wrong, and even immoral, for \nme to ask the peasants to withhold payment of rent and \nrevenue and to pay income fax myself. I expected, therefore, \nthat our house would he attached by the Goventment. I dis- \nliked this idea intensely, as it would have meant my mother \nbeing turned out: our books, papers, goods and chattels and \nmany things that we valued for personal and sentimental \nreasons going into strange hands and perhaps being lost; and \nour National Flag being pulled down and the Union Jack put \nup instead. At the same time I was attracted to the idea of \nlosing the house. I felt that this would bring me nearer to the \npeasantry, who were being dispossessed, and would hearten \nthem. From the point of view of our movement it was cer- \ntainly a desirable thing. But the Government decided otherwise \nand did not touch the house, perhaps because of consideration \nfor my mother, perhaps because they judged rightly that it \nwould give an impetus to civil disobedience. Many months \nafterwards some odd railway shares of mine were discovered \nand attached, for non-payment of income tax. My motor-car, \nas well as my brother-in-law's, had been previously attached \nand sold. \n\nOne feature of these early months pained me greatly. This \nwas the hauling down of our National Flag by various muni- \ncipalities and public bodies, and especially by the Calcutta \nCorporation which was said to have a majority of Congress \nmembers. The flag was taken down under pressure from the \npolice and the Government, which threatened severe action in \ncase of non-compliance. This action would have probably \nmeant a suspension of the municipality or punishment of its \nmembers. Organisations with vested interests are apt to be \ntimid, and perhaps it was inevitable that they should act as \nthey did, but nevertheless it hurt. That flag had become a \nsymbol to us of much that we held dear, and under its shadow \nwe had taken many a pledge to protect its honour. To pull \nit down with our own hands, or to have it pulled down at our \nbehest, seemed not only a breaking of that pledge but almost \na sacrilege. It was a submission of the spirit, a denial of the \ntruth in one; an affirmation, in the face of superior physical \nmight, of the false. And those who submitted in this way low- \nered the morale of the nation, and injured its self-respect. \n\nIt was not that they were expected to behave a& heroes, and \nrush into the fire. It was wrong and absurd to blame any one \nfor not being in the front rank and courting prison, or oth<:r \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nsuffering or loss. Each one had many duties and responsi* \nbilities to shoulder, and no one else had a right to sit in \njudgment on him. But to sit or work in the background is \none thing; to deny the truth, or what one conceives to be the \ntruth, is a more serious matter. It was open to members of \nmunicipalities, when called upon to do anything against the \nnational interest, to resign from their seats. As a rule they \npreferred to remain in those seats. \n\n\u201c But bees, on flowers alighting, cease their hum \u2014 \n\nSo, settling upon places, Whigs grow dumb  \u201d ^ \n\nPerhaps it is unjust to criticise any one for his behaviour \nduring a sudden crisis which threatens to overwhelm him. The \nnerve of the bravest fails them sometimes, as the World War \ndemonstrated over and again. Earlier still, in the great Titanic \ndisaster of a, famous people, who could never have been \nassociated with cowardice, escaped by bribing the crew, leaving \nothers to drown. Very recen^ the fire on the Morro Castle \nrevealed a shameful state of afrairs. No one knows how he will \nbehave in a similar crisis when the primeval instincts over- \npower reason and restraint. So we may not blame. But that \nshould not prevent us from noting that falling away from right \nconduct, and from taking care in future that the steering-wheel \nof the ship of the nation is not put in hands that tremble and \nfail when the need is greatest. Worse still is the attempt to \njustify this failure and call it right conduct. That, surely, is \na greater offence than the failure itself. \n\nAll struggles between rival forces depend greatly on morale \nand nerve. Even the bloodiest war depends upon them : \u201c In \nthe final event battles are won by nerves,\u201d said Marshal Foch. \nMuch more so are nerve and morale necessary in a non-violent \nstruggle, and any one who, by his conduct, impairs that morale \nand shakes the nation\u2019s nerve, does a serious disservice to the \ncause. \n\nThe months went by bringing their daily toll of good news \nand bad, and we adapted ourselves in our respective prisons, to \nour dull and monotonous routine. The National Week came\u2014 \nApril th to th\u2014 and we knew that this would witness many \nan unusual happening. Much, indeed, happened then; but for \nme everything else paled before one occurrence. In Allahabad \nmy mother was in a procession which was stopped by the police \n\n* Thomas Moore. \n\n\n\nBALLYHOO \n\n\n \n\nand later charged with lathis. When the procession had been \nhalted some one brought her a chair, and she was sitting on \nthis on the road at the head of the procession. Some people \nwho were especially looking after her, including my secretary, \nwere arrested and removed, and then came the police charge. \nMy mother was knocked down from her chair, and was hit \nrepeatedly on the head with canes. Blood came out of an open \nwound in the head; she fainted, and lay on the roadside, which \nhad now been cleared of the processionists and public. After \nsome time she was picked up and brought by a police officer \nin his car to Anand Bhawan. \n\nThat night a false rumour spread in Allahabad that my \nmother had died. Angry crowds gathered together, forgot \nabout peace and non-violence, and attacked the police. There \nwas firing by the police, resulting in the death of some people. \n\nWhen the news of all this came to me some days after the \noccurrence (for we had a weekly paper), the thought of my frail \nold mother lying bleeding on the dusty road obsessed me, and \nI wondered how I would have behaved if I had been there. \nHow far would my non-violence have carried me? Not very \nfar, I fear, for that sight would have made me forget the long \nlesson I had tried to learn for more than a dozen years; and \nI would have recked little of the consequences, personal or \nnational. \n\nSlowly she recovered, and when she came to see me next \nmonth m Bareilly Gaol she tvas still bandaged up. But she was \nfull of joy and pride at having shared with our volunteer boys \nand girls the privilege of reedving cane and lathi blows. Her \nrecovery, however, was more apparent than real, and it seems \nthat the tremendous shaking that she received at her age upset \nher system entirely and brought into prominence deep-seated \ntroubles, which a year later assumed dangerous proportions.'  STRUGGLE \n\nOutside, the struggle went on, and brave men and women \ncontinued to defy peacefully a powerful and entrenched govern- \nment, though they knew that it was not for them to achieve in \nthe present or the near future. And repression without break \nand with ever-increasing intensity, demonstrated the basis of \nBritish rule in India. There was no camouflage about it now, \nand this at least was some satisfaction to us. Bayonets were \ntriumphant, but a great warrior had once said that \u201c you can \ndo everything with bayonets save sit on them.\u201d It was better \nthat we should be governed thus, we thought, than that we \nshould sell our souls and submit to spiritual prostitution. We \nwere physically helpless in prison, but we felt we served our \ncause even there, and served it better than many outside. \nShould we, because of our weakness, sacrifice the future of \nIndia to save ourselves? It was true that the limits of human \nvitality and human strength were narrow, and many an indi- \nvidual was physically disabled, or died, or fell out of the ranks, \nor even betrayed the cause. But the cause went on despite set- \nbacks; there could be no failure if ideals remained undimmed \nand spirits undaunted. Real failure was a desertion of principle, \na denial of our right, and an ignoble submission to wrong. \nSelf-made wounds always took longer to heal than those caused \nby an adversary. \n\nThere was often a weariness at our weaknesses and at a world \ngone awry, and yet there was a measure of pride for our \nachievement. For our people had indeed behaved splendidly, \nand it was good to feel oneself to be a member of a gallant \nband. \n\nDuring those years of dvil disobedience two attempts were \nmade to hold open Congress sessions, one at Delhi and the \nother at Calcutta. It was obvious that an illegal organisation \ncould not meet normally and in peace, and any attempt at an \nopen session meant conflict with the police. The meetings were \nin fact dispersed forcibly with the help of the lathi by the \npolice, and large numbers of people were arrested. The extra- \nordinary thing about these gatherings was the fact that \nthousands came firom all parts of India as delegates to these il- \nlegal gatherings. I was glad to learn that people from the United \n\n\n\nSTRUGGLE \n\n\n \n\nProvinces played a prominent part in both of them. My \nmother also insisted on^ going to the Calcutta session at the \nend of March . She was 'arrested, however, together with \nPandit Malaviya and others, and detained in prison for a few \ndays at Asansol, on the way to Calcutta. I was amazed at the \nenergy and vitality she showed, frail and ailing as she was. \nPrison was really of little consequence to her; she had gone \nthrough a harder ordeal. Her son and both her daughters \nand others whom she loved spent long periods in prison, \nand the empty house where she lived had become a nightmare \nto her. \n\nAs our struggle toned down and stabilised itself at a low \nlevel there was little of excitement in it, except at long inter- \nvals. My thoughts travelled more to other countries, and I \nwatched and studied, as far as I could in gaol, the world \nsituation in the grip of the great depression. I read as many \nbooks as I could find on the subject, and the more I read the \nmore fascinated I grew. India with her problems and struggles \nbecame just a part of this mighty w'orld drama, of the great-- \nstruggle of political and economic forces that was going on \neverywhere, nationally and internationally. In that struggle \nmy own syifipathies went increasingly towards the communist \nside. \n\nI had long been drawn to socialism and communism, and \nRussia had appealed to me. Much in Soviet Russia I dislike \u2014 \nthe ruthless suppression of all contrary opinion, the wholesale \nregimentation, the unnecessary violence (as I thought) in carry- \ning out various policies. But there was no lack of violence and \nsuppression in the capitalist world, and I realised more and \nmore how the very basis and foundation of our acquisitive \nsociety and property was violence. Without violence it could \nnot continue fer many days. A measure of political liberty \nmeant little indeed when the fear of starvation was always \ncompelling the vast majority of people everywhere to submit \nto the will of the few, to the greater glory and advantage of \nthe latter. \n\nViolence was common in both places, but the violence \nof the capitalist order seemed inherent in it; whilst the \nviolence of Russia, bad though it was, aimed at a new \norder based on peace and co-operation and real freedom fer the \nmasses. With all her blunders, Soviet Russia had triumphed \nover enormous difficulties and taken great strides towards this \nnew order.. While the rest of the world was in the grip of the \ndepression and going backward in some ways, in the Soviet \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ncountry a great new world was being built up before our eyes. \nRussia, following the great Lenin, looked into the future and \nthought only of what was to be, while other countries lay \nnumbed under the dead hand of the past and spent their \nenergy in preserving the useless relics of a bygone age. In \nparticular, I was impressed by the reports of the great progress \nmade by the backward regions of Central Asia under the \nSoviet regime. In the balance, therefore, I was all in favour of \nRussia, and the presence and example of the Soviets was a \nbright and heartening phenonaenon in a dark and dismal \nworld. \n\nBut Soviet Russia\u2019s success or failure, vastly important as it \nwas as a practical, experiment in establishing a communist \nstate, did not affect the soundness of the theory of communism. \nThe Bolsheviks may blunder or even fail because of national \nor international reasons, and yet the communist theory may \nbe correct. On the basis of that very theory it was absurd to \ncopy blindly what had taken place in Russia, for its application \ndepended on the particular conditions prevailing in the country \nin question and the stage of its historical development. Besides, \nIndia, or any other country, could profit by the triumphs as well \nas the inevitable mistakes of the Bolsheviks. Perhaps the Bol- \nsheviks had tried to go too fast because, surrounded as they \nwere by a world of enemies, they feared external aggression. \nA slower tempo might avoid much of the misery caused in \nthe rural areas. But then the question arose if really radical \nresults could be obtained by slowing down the rate of change. \nReformism was an impossible solution of any vital problem at \na critical moment when the basic structure had to be changed, \nand however slow the progress might be later on, the initial \nstep must be a complete break with the existing order, which \nhad fulfilled its purpose and was now only a drag on future \nprogress. \n\nIn India, only a revolutionary plan could solve the two \nrelated questions of the land and industry as weU as almost \nevery other major problem before the country. \u201cThere is no \ngraver mistake,\u201d as Mr. Lloyd George says in his War Memoirs, \n\u201c than to leap the abyss in two Jumps.\u201d \n\nRussia apart, the theory and philosophy of Marxism \nlightened up many a dark corner of my mind. History came to \nhave a new meaning for me. The Marxist interpretation threw \na flood of light on it, and it became an unfolding drama with \nsome order and purpose, howsoever unconscious, behind it. In \nspite of the appalling waste and misery of the past and the \n\n\n\nSTRUGGLE \n\n\n \n\npresent, the future was bright tYi^h hope, though many dangers \nintervened. It was the essential freedom from dogma and the \nscientific outlook of Marxism that appealed to me. It was \ntrue that there was plenty of dogma in official communism in \nRussia and elsewhere, and frequently heresy hunts were or- \nganised. That seemed to be deplorable, though it was not \ndifficult to understand in view of the tremendous changes \ntaking place rapidly in the Soviet countries when effective oppo- \nsition might have resulted in catastrophic failure. \n\nThe great world crisis and slump seemed to justify the \nMarxist analysis. While all odier systems and theories were \ngroping about in the dark, Marxism alone explained it more or \nless satisfactorily and offered a real solution. \n\nAs this conviction grew upon me, I was filled with a new \nexcitement and my depression at the non-success of civil diso- \nbedience grew much less. Was not the world marching rapidly \ntowards the desired consummation? There were grave dangers \nof wars and catastrophes, but at any rate we were moving. \nThere was no stagnation. Our national struggle became a stage \nin the longer journey, and it was as w'cll that repression and \nsuffering were tempering our people for future struggles and \nforcing them to consider the new ideas that were stirring the \nworld. We would be the stronger and the more disciplined and \nhardened by the elimination of the weaker elements. Time was \nin our favour. \n\nAnd so I studied carefully what was happening in Russia, \nGermany, England, America, Japan, China, France, Spain, Italy \nand Central Europe, and tried to understand the tangled web \nof current affairs. I followed with interest the attempts of each \ncountry separately, and of all of them together, to weather \nthe storm. The repeated failures of international conferences \nto find a solution for political and economic ills and the \nproblem of disarmament reminded me forcibly of a little, but \nsufficiently troublesome, problem of our own\u2014 the communal \nproblem. With all the goodwill in the world, we have so far \nnot solved the problem; and, in spite of a widespread belief \nthat failure would lead to world catastrophe, the great states- \nmen of Europe and America have failed to pull together. In \neither case the approach was wrong, and the people concerned \ndid not dare to go the right way. \n\nIn thinking over the troubles and conflicts of the world, I \nforgot to some extent my own personal and national troubles. \nI would even feel b uoyant occasionally at the fact that I was \nalive at this great revolutionary period of the world's history. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nPerhaps I might also have to play some little part in my own \ncorner of the world in the great changes that were to come. \nAt other times I would find the atmosphere of conflict and \nviolence all over the world very depressing. Worse still was the \nsight of intelligent men and women who had become so accus- \ntomed to human degradation and slavery that their minds were \ntoo coarsened to resent suffering and poverty and inhumanity. \nNoisy vulgarity and organised humbug flourished in this stifling \nmoral atmosphere, and good men were silent. The triumph \nof Hitler and the Brown Terror that followed was a great \nshock, though I consoled myself that it could only be tem- \nporary. Almost one had the feeling of the futility of human \nendeavour. The machine went on blindly, what could a little \ncog in it do? \n\nBut still the communist philosophy of life gave me comfort \nand hope. How was it to be applied to India? We had not \nsolved yet the problem of political freedom, and the national- \nistic outlook filled our minds. Were we to jump to economic \nfreedom at the same time or take them in turn, however short \nthe interval might be? World events as well as happenings \nin India were foi-cing the social issue to the front, and it \nseemed that political freedom could no longer be separated \nfrom it \n\nThe policy of the British Government in India had resulted in \nranging the socially reactionary classes in opposition to political \nindependence. That was inevitable, and I welcomed the clearer \ndemarcation of the various classes and groups in India. But \nwas this fact appreciated by others? Apparently not by many. \nIt was true that there were a handful of orthodox Commuiusts \nin some of the big cities and they were hostile to, and bitterly \ncritical of, the national movement. The organised Labour \nmovement, especially in Bombay and, to a lesser extent, in \nCalcutta, was also socialistic in a loose kind of way, but it was \nbroken up into bits and suffering from the depression. Vague \ncommunistic and socialistic ideas had spread among the intel- \nligentsia, even among intelligent Government officials. The \nyounger men and women of the Congress, who used to read \nBryce on Democracies and Morley and Keith and Mazzini, \nwere now reading, when they could get them, books on social- \nism and communism and Russia. The Meerut Conspiracy \nCase had helped greatly in directing people\u2019s minds to these \nnew ideas, and the world crisis had compelled attention. Every- \nwhere there was in evidence a new spirit of enquiry, a \nquestioning, and a challenge to existing institutions. The \n\n\n\nSTRUGGLE \n\n\n \n\ngeneral direction of the mental wind was obvious, but still it \nwas a gentle breeze, unsure of itself. Some people flirted with \nFascist ideas. A clear and definite ideology was lacking. \nNationalism still was the dominating thought. \n\nIt seemed clear to me that nationalism would remain the \noutstanding urge, till some measure of political freedom was \nattained. Because of this the Congress had been, and was still \n(apart from certain Labour circles), the most advanced organisa- \ntion in India, as it was far the most powerful. During the past \nthirteen years, under Gandhiji\u2019s leadership, it had produced \na wonderful awakening of the masses and, in spite of its vague \nbourgeois ideology, it had served a revolutionary purpose. It \nhad not exhausted its utility yet, and was not likely to do so till \nthe nationalist urge gave place to a social one. Future progress, \nboth ideological and in action, must therefore be largely asso- \nciated with the Congress, though other avenues could also be \nused. \n\nTo desert the Congress seemed to me thus to cut oneself \nadrift from the vital urge of the nation, to blunt the most \npowerful weapon we had, and perhaps to waste energy in \nineffective adventurism. And yet, was the Congress, constimted \nas it was, ever likely to adopt a really radical social solution? \nIf such an issue was placed before it, the result was bound to \nbe to split it into two or more parts, or at least to drive away \nlarge sections from it. That in itself was not undesirable or \nunwelcome if the issues became clearer and a strongly-knit \ngroup, either a majority or minority in the Congress, stood for \na radical social programme. \n\nBut Congress at present meant Gandhiji. What would he \ndo? Ideologically he was sometimes amazingly backward, and \nyet in action he had been the greatest revolutionary of recent \ntimes in India. He was a unique personality, and it was im- \npossible to judge him by the usual standards, or even to apply \nthe ordinary canons of logic to him. But because he was a \nrevolutionary at bottom and was pledged to political inde- \npendence for India, he was bound to play an uncompromising \nre till that independence was achieved. And in this very \nprocess he would release tremendous mass energies and would \nnimselfj I half hoped, advance step by step towards the social \ngoal. \n\nThe orthodox Communists in India and outside have fi>r \nmany years past attacked Gandhiji and the Congress bitterly, \nand imputed all manner of base motives to the Congress \n.leaders. , Many of their theoretical criticisms of Congress, \n\n\n\n JAWAI-IARLAL NEHRU \n\nideology were able and pointed, and subsequent events partly \njustified them. Some of the earlier Communist analyses of the \ngeneral Indian political situation turned out to be remarkably \ncorrect. But as soon as they leave their general principles and \nenter into details, and especially when they consider the role \nof the Congress, they go hopelessly astray. One of the reasons \nfor the weakness in numbers as well as influence of the Com- \nmunists in India is that, instead of spreading a scientific know- \nledge of communism and trying to convert people\u2019s minds to \nit, they have largely concentrated on abuse of others. This \nhas reacted on them and done them great injury. Most of \nthem are used to working in labour areas, where a few slogans \nare usually enough to win over the workers. But mere slogans \nare- not enough for the intellectual, and they have not realised \nthat in India to-day the middle-class intellectual is the most \nrevolutionary force. Almost in spite of the orthodox Com- \nmunists, many intellectuals have been drawn to communism, \nbut even so there is a gulf between them. \n\nAccording to the Communists, the objective of the Congress \nleaders has been to bring mass pressure on the Government in \norder to obtain industrial and commercial concessions in the \ninterests of Indian capitalists and zamindars. The task of the \nCongress is \"to harness the economic and political discontent \nof the peasantry, the lower middle-class and the industrial \nworking-class to the chariot of the mill-owners and financiers \nof Bombay, Ahmedabad and Calcutta.\u201d The Indian capitalists \nare supposed to sit behind the scenes and issue orders to the \nCongress Working Committee first to organise a mass move- \nment and, when it becomes too vast and dangerous, to suspend \nit or side-track it. Further, that the Congress leaders really do \nnot want the British to go away, as they are retjuired to control \nand exploit a starving population, and the Indian middle class \ndo not feel themselves equal to this. \n\nIt is surprising that able Communists should believe this \nfantastic analysis, but believing this as they apparently do, it \nis not surprising that they should fail so remarkably in \nIndia. Their basic error seems to be that they judge the Indian \nNational Movement fi:om European Labour standards, and \nused as they are to the repeated betrayals of the labour move- \nment by the labour leaders, they apply the analogy to India. \nThe Indian National Movement is obviously not a labour or \nproletarian movement. It is a bourgeois movement, as its very \nname implies, and its objective so far has been, not a change \nof the social order, but political independence. This objective \n\n\n\nSTRUGGLE \n\n\n \n\nmay be criticised as not far-reaching enough, and nationalism \nitself may be condemned as out of date. But accepting the \nfundamental basis of the movement, it is absurd to say that \nthe leaders betray the masses because tliey do not try to \nupset the land system or the capitalist system. They never \nclaimed to do so. Some people in the Congress, and they are \na growing number, want to change the land system and the \ncapitalist system, but they cannot speak in the name of the \nCongress. \n\nIt is true that the Indian capitalist classes (not the big zamin- \ndars and taluqadars) have profited greatly by the national \nmovement because of British and other foreign boycotts, and \nthe push given to swadeshi. This was inevitable, as every \nnational movement encourages home industries and preaches \nboycotts. As a matter of fact the Bombay mill industry in a \nbody, during tlic continuance of civil disobedience and when \nwe were preaching the boycott of British goods, had the \ntemerity to conclude a pact wdth Lancashire. From the point \nof view of the Congress, this was a gross betrayal of the \nnational cause, and it was characterised as such. The repre- \nsentative of the Bombay mill-owners in the Assembly also \nconsistently ran down the Congress and \u2018 extremists \u2019 while most \nof us were in gaol. \n\nThe part that many capitalist elements have played in India \nduring the past few years has been scandalous, even from the \nCongress and nationalist view-point. Ottawa may have benefited \ntemporarily some small groups, but it was bad in the interest \nof Indian industry as a whole, and made it even more sub- \nservient to British capital and industry. It was harmful to the \nmasses, and it was negotiated while our struggle was being \ncarried on, and many thousands were in prison. Every \nDominion wrung out the hardest terms firom England, but \nIndia had the privilege of making almost a gift to her. During \nthe last few years also financial adventurers have trafficked in \ngold and silver at India\u2019s expense. \n\nAs for the big zamindars and taluqadars, they ranged them- \nselves completdy against the Congress in the Round Table \nConference, and they openly and aggressively declared them- \nselves on the side of the Government right through civil diso- \nbedience. It was with their help that Government passed \nrepressive legislation in various provinces embodying the \nOrdinances. And in the United Provinces Council the great \nmajority of the zamindar members voted against the release of \ncivil disobedience prisoners. ' \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nThe idea that Gandhiji was forced to launch seemingly \naggressive movements in  and  because of mass pres- \nsure, is also absolutely wrong. Mass stirrings there were, of \ncourse, but on both occasions it was Gandhiji who forced \nthe pace. In  he carried the Congress almost single- \nhanded, and plunged it into non-co-operation. In  it \nwould have been ^uite impossible to have any aggressive and \neffective direct action movement if he had resisted it in any \nway. \n\nIt is very unfortunate that foolish and ill-informed criticisms \nof a personal nature are made, because they divert attention \nfrom the real issues. To attack Gandhiji\u2019s hona fides is to injure \nonself and one\u2019s own cause, for to the millions of India he \nstands as the embodiment of truth, and any one who know.s \nhim at all realises the passionate earnestness with which he is \nalways seeking to do right. \n\nCommunists in India have associated with the industrial \nworkers of the big towns. They have little knowledge of, or \ncontact with, the rural areas. The industrial workers, important \nas they are, and likely to be more so in the future, must take \nsecond place before the peasants, for the problem of to-day in \nIndia is the problem of the peasantry. Congress workers, on \nthe other hand, have spread all over these rural areas and, \nin the ordinary course, the Congress must develop into a \nvast peasant organisation. Peasants are seldom revolutionary \nafter their immediate objective is attained, and it is likely \nthat some time in the future the usual problem of city versus \nvillage and industrial worker versus peasant will rise in India \nalso. \n\nIt has been my privilege to be associated very closely with \na large number of Congress leaders and workers, and I could \nnot wish for a finer set of men and women. And yet I have \ndiffered from them on vital issues, and often I have felt a little \nweary at finding that they do not appreciate or understand \nsomething that seems to me quite obvious. It was not due to \nwant of intelligence, somehow we moved in different ideo- \nlogical grooves. I realised how difficult it is to cross these \nboundaries suddenly. They constitute different philosophies of \nlife, and we grow into them gradually and unconsciously. It \nis fiitile to blame the other pariy. Socialism involves a certain \npsychological outlook on life and its problems. It is more than \nmere logic. So also are the other outlooks based on heredity, \nupbringing, the unseen influences of the past and our present \nenvironments. Only life itself with its bitter lessons forces, us \n\n\n\nSTRUGGLE \n\n\n \n\nalong new paths and ultimately, which is far harder, makes us \nthink differently. Perhaps we may help a little in this process. \nAnd perhaps \n\n\" On rencontre sa destinde \nSouvent par les chemins q\u2019on prend pour I\u2019eviier.\"  RETURN TO INDIA AND PLUNGE BACK \nINTO POLITICS \n\nI WAS returning from Europe in good physical and mental con- \ndition. My wife was not yet wholly recovered, but she was far \nbetter, and that relieved me of anxiety on her score. I felt full \nof energy and vitality, and the sense of inner conflict and \nfrustration that had oppressed me so often previously was, for \nthe time being, absent. My outlook was wider, and nationalism \nby itself seemed to me definitely a narrow and insufficient creed. \nPolitical freedom, independence, were no doubt essential, but \nthey were steps only in the right direction; without social free- \ndom and a socialistic structure of society and the State, neither \nthe coimtry nor the individual could develop much. I felt I had \na clearer perception of world affairs, more grip on the present- \nday world, ever changing as it was. I had read largely, not only \non current affairs and politics, but on many other subjects that \ninterested me, cultural and scientific. I found the vast political, \neconomic, and cultural changes going on in Europe and \nAmerica a fascinating study, ^viet Russia, despite certain un- \npleasant aspects, attracted me greatly, and seemed to hold forth \na message of hope to the world. Europe, in the middle \u2019twenties, \nwas trying to settle down in a way; the great depression was yet \nto come. But I came back with the conviction that this settling \ndown was superficial only, and big eruptions and mighty changes \nwere in store for Europe and the world in the near future, \n\n.To train and prepare our country for these world events \u2014 ^to \nkeep in readiness for them, as far ^ we could\u2014 seemed to be the \ninunediate task. The preparation was largely an ideological one. \nEiist of all, there should be no doubt about the objective of \npolitiral independence. This should be clearly understood as the \nonly possible political goal for us; something radically difi^ent \nfirom the vague and confusing talk of Dommion Status. Then \nthere was the so^ goal. It would he too much, I felt, to expect \nthe Congress to go far in this direction just then. The Congress \nwas a purely political and nationalistic body, unused to thinking \non other toes. But a beginning might be made. Outside the \nCongr^s, in labour darcjes and among the young, the idea could \nbe pushed on much further. For this purpose I wanted to keep \nmyself fiee froin Congress office, and I had a vague idea also of \nspending some months in remote rural areas to study their con- \n\n\n\nRETURN TO INDIA  \n\nditlons. But this was not to be, and events were to drag me \nagain into the heart of Congress politics. \n\nImmediately on our arrival in Madras I was caught in the \nwhirl. I presented a bunch of resolutions to the Working Com- \nmittee \u2014 ^resolutions on Independence, War Danger, association \nwith the League against Imperialism, etc. \u2014 and nearly all of \nthese were accepted and made into official Working Committee \nresolutions. I had to put them forward at the open session of \nthe Congress, and, to my surprise, they were all almost unani- \nmously adopted. The Independence resolution was supported \neven by Mrs. Annie Besant. This all-round support was very \ngratifying, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that the resolu- \ntions were either not imderstood for what they were, or were \ndistorted to mean something else. That this was so became \napparent soon after the Congress, when a controversy arose on \nthe meaning of the Independence resolution. \n\nThese resolutions of mine were somewhat different from the \nusual Congress resolutions; they represented a new outlook. \nMany Congressmen no doubt liked them, some had a vague dis- \nlike for them, but not enough to make them oppose. Probably \nthe latter thought that they were academic resolutions, making \nlitde difference either way, and the best way to get rid of them \nwas to pass them and move on to something more important. \nThe Independence resolution thus did not represent then, as it \ndid a year or two later* a vital and irrepressible urge on the part \nof the Congress; it represented a widespread and growing \nsentiment. \n\nGandhiji was in Madras and he attended the open Congress \nsessions, but he did not take any part in the shaping of policy. \nHe did not attend the meetings of the Working Committee of \nwhich he was a member. That had been his general political \nattitude in the Congress since the dominance of the Swaraj \nParty. But he was frequently consulted, and little of importance \nwas done without his knowledge. I do not know how far the \nresolutions I put before the Congress met with his approval. I \nam inclined to think that he disliked them, not so much because \nof what they said, but because of their general trend and out- \nlook. He did not, however, critidse them on any occasion. My \nfather was, of course, away in Europe at the time. \n\nThe umreality of the Independence resolution came out in that \nvery session of the Congress, when another resolution con- \ndemning the Simon Commission and appealing ft>r its boycott \nwas considered. As a corollaiy tc this it was proposed to convene \nan All-Parties Conference, which was to draw up a constitution \n\n\n\ni \n\n\nJAAVAHAHLAL NEHRU \n\n\nfor India. It was manifest that the moderate groups, with whom \nco-operation was sought, could never think in terms of Inde- \npendence. The A'ery utmost they could go to was some form of \nDominion Status. \n\nI stepped back into the Congress secretaryship. There were \npersonal considerations \u2014 the desire of the President for the year. \nDr. M. A. Ansari, who was an old and dear friend \u2014 and the \nfact that, as many of my resolutions had been passed, I ought \nto see them through. It was true that the resolution on the \nAll-Parties Conference had partly neutralised the effect of my \nresolutions. Still, much remained. The real reason for my \naccepting office again was my fear that the Congress might, \nthrough the instrumentality of the All-Parties Conference, or \nbecause of other reasons, slide back to a more moderate and \n\n\ncompromising position. It seemed to be in a hesitant mood, \nswinging alternately from one extreme to another. I wanted to \nprevent, as far as I could, the swing back to Moderation and to \nhold on to the Independence objecuve. \n\nThe National Congress always attracts a large number of \nside-shows at its annual sessions. One of the side-shows at \n\n\nMadras was a Republican Conference which held its first (and \nlast) sessions that year. I was asked to preside. The idea appealed \nto me, as I considered myself a republican. But I hesitated, as \nI did not know who was at the back of the new venture, and I \ndid not want to associate myself with mushroom growths. I \npresided, eventually, but later I repented of this, for the Re- \npublican Conference turned out to be, like so many others, a \nstill-bom affair. For several months I tried, and tried in vain, \nto get the text of the resolutions passed by it. It is amazing how \nmany of our people love to sponsor new undertakings and then \nignore them and leave them to shift for themselves. There is \nmuch in the criticism diat we are not a persevering lot. \u2022 \nBefore we had dispersed from Madras after the Congress, news \ncame of the death of Hakim Ajmal Khan at Delhi. As an \nex-president of the Congress he was one of its elder statesmen; \nbut he was something more also, and he occupied a unique place \nin the Congress leadership. Brought up as he was, entirely in the \nold conservative way, with no touch of modernism in it, and \nsteeped in the culture of imperial Delhi of Mog^al days, it was \na delight to watch his fine courtesy and hear his unhurried voice \nand listen to his dry humour. He was, in his manners, a typical \naristocrat of the old order, with prinedy look and princely ways, \nand even his face bore a marked resemblance to the miniatures \nof the Moghal sovereigns. Such a person would not ordinarily \n\n\n\nRETURN TO INDIA \n\n\nig \n\ntake to the rough-and-tumble of politics; and Britishers in India \nhave often sighed for persons of this old type when the new \nbreed of agitators has troubled them. Hakim Sahab had also \nlittle to do with politics in his early days. As the head of a \nfamous family of physicians, he was busy with his eAormous \npractice. But even during the latter part of the War events, \nand the influence of his old friend and colleague, Dr. M. A. \nAnsari, were driving him to the Congress; and subsequent hap- \npenings \u2014 ^Martial Law in the Punjab and the Khilafat question \u2014 \nmoved him deeply, and he turned with approval to the new \nGandhian technique of non-co-operation. He brought a rare \nquality and precious gifts to the Congress\u2014 he became a link \nbetween the old order and the new, and gave the support of the \nformer to the national movement; and thus he produced \na harmony between the two, and gave strength and a certain \nstolidity to the advance guard of the movement. He brought \nthe Hindus and Muslims much nearer to each other, for both \nhonoured him and were influenced by his example. To Gandhiji \nhe became a trusted friend, whose advice in regard to Hindu- \nMuslim matters was the final word for him. My father and \nHakimji had naturally taken to each other. \n\nLast year I was accused by some leaders of the Hindu \nMahasabha of my ignorance of Hindu sentiments because of \nmy defective education and general background of \u2018 Persian ' \nculture. What culture I possess, or whether I possess any at all, \nis a little difficult for me to say. Persian, as a language, un- \nhappily, I do not even know. But it is true that my father had \ngrown up in an Indo-Persian cultural atmosphere, which was \nthe legacy in north India of the old Delhi court, and of which, \neven in these degenerate days, Delhi and Lucknow are the two \nchief centres. Kashmiri Brahmans had a remarkable capacity \nfor adaptation, and coming down to the Indian plains and find- \ning that this Indo-Persian culture was predominant at the time, \nthey took to it, and produced, a number of fine scholars in \nPersian and Urdu. Later they adapted themselves with equal \nrapidity to the changing order, when a knowledge of English \nand the elements of European culture became necessary. But \neven now there are many distinguished scholars in Persian \namong the Kashmiris in India \u2014 Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and \nRaja Narendra Nath, to mention two of them. \n\nHakim Sahab and my ffither had thus much in common, and \nthey even discovered old family connections. They became great \nfiiends and addressed each other as Bhai Sahab\u2014 brother. \nPolitics was the least of their many bonds. In his domestic \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nhabits Hakimji was extraordinarily conservative; he could not, \nor his family people could not, get out of old habits, I have \nnever seen such amazingly strict purdah, or seclusion of women, \nas existed in his family. And yet Hakimji was firmly convinced \nthat no nation advanced unless the women of that country freed \nthemselves. He impressed this upon me, and told me how much \nhe admired the part Turkish women had played in their free- \ndom struggle. It was chiefly because of Turkish women, he said, \nthat Kemal Pasha had succeeded. \n\nThe death of Hakim Ajmal Khan was a great blow to the \nCongress; it meant the removal of one of its stoutest supports. \nFor all of us there has been since then something lacking in a \nvisit to Delhi, for Delhi was so closely associated with Hakimji \nand his house in Billimaran. \n\n' Tile year  was, politically, a full year, with plenty of \nactivity all over the country. There seemed to be a new impulse \nmoving the people forward, a new stir that was equally present \nin the most varied groups. Probably the change had been going \non gradually during my long absence firom the country; it struck \nme as very considerable on my return. Early in  India was \nstill quiescent, passive, perhaps not fully recovered firom the \neffort of -; in  she seemed firesh, active, and full \nof suppressed energy. Everywhere there was evidence of this : \namong the industrial workers, the peasantry, middle-class youth, \nand the intelligentsia generally. \n\nThe Trade ^nion movement had grown greatly, and the \nAll-India Trade Union Congress, established seven or eight \nyears previously, was already a strong and representative body. \nIt had not only grown in numbers and in organisation, but its \nideology was becoming more militant and extreme. Strikes \nwere firequent, and class-consciousness was growing. The textile \nindustry and the railways were the best organised, and of these \nthe strongest and moat advanced unions were the Girtu Kamgar \nUnion of Bombay and the G,I.P. Bailway Union. The growth \nof labour organisation had inevitably brought the seeds of in- \nternal conflict and disruption from the West, and hardly had \nthe Indian Trade Union Movement established itself when it \nthreatened to split up into rival and hostile camps. There were \nthose who adhered to the Second International, and those who \nfavoured the Third; those who were moderately reformist in \ntheir outlook, and those who were firarikly revolutionary and \nout for radical changes. In between the two there were various \nshadra and degrees of opinion and, as is unfortunately the case \nm all mass organisations, of opportunism. \n\n\n\nRETURN TO INDIA \n\n\n!I \n\nThe peas^try was also astir. This was noticeable in the \nUnited Provinces and especially in Oudh, where large gatherings \nof protesting tenants became common. It was realised that the \nnew Oudh tenancy law, which gave a life-tenure and had \npromised a great deal, made little difference to the hard lot of \nthe peasant. In .Gujrat a conflict on a big scale developed be- \ntween the peasantry and the Government because of the attempt \nof the latter to increase revenue \u2014 Gujrat being an area of \npeasant-proprietors where Government deals directly with the \npeasants. This struggle was the Bardoli Satyagraha under the \nleadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It was gallantly carried \nthrough to the admiration of the rest of India. The Bardoli \npeasantry met with a considerable measure of success; the real \nsuccess of their campaign, however, lay in the. effect it produced \namongst the peasantry all over India. Bardoli became a sign \nand a symbol of hope and strength and victory to the Indian \npeasant. \n\nAnother very noticeable feature of the India of  was the \ngrowjltJaf. the Yo uth M ovement. Everywhere youth leagues \nwere being established, youth conferences were being held, \"niey \nwere a very varied, lot, from semi-religious ^oups to others dis- \ncussing revolutionary ideology and technique; but whatever \ntheir origin and auspices, such gathering of youth always began \nto discuss the vital social and economic problems of the axj, \nand generally, their tendency was for roqt-and-branch change. \n\nFrom the purely political point of view the year was noted for \nthe boycott of the Sim^ Commission and ^what was called the \nconstructive side of the boycott) the AU-Parties Conference. The \nmoderate groups co-operated with the Congress in this boj^cott> \nand it was remarkably successful. Wherever the Commission \nwent it was greeted by hostile crowds and the cry of \u201c Simon go \nback\u201d, and thus vast numbers of the Indian masses became \nacquainted not only with Sir John Simon\u2019s name but with two \nwords of the English language, the only two they knew. These \nwords must have become a hated obsession for the members of \nthe Commission. The story is related that once, when they were \nstaying at the Western Hostd in New Delhi, the refrain seemed \nto come to them in the night out of the darkness. They were \ngreatly irritated at being pursued in this way, even at night. \nAs a matter of fact, the noise that disturbed them came from \nthejackals that infest the waste places of the iinperial capital. \n\nThe All-Parties Conference had no difficulty at all in settling \nthe main principles of the constitution; they were to be of the \ndemqcsatic paruamentary variety, and almost any one could \n\n\n\n JAWAHABLAL NEHKU \n\ndraw them up. The real difficulty, and the only difficulty, came \nfrom the communal or minorities issue, and as the Conference \nhad within its fold the representatives of all the extreme com- \nmunal organisations, an agreement became extraordinarily \ndifficult. It was a repetition of the old infructuous Unity Con- \nferences. My father, who had returned from Europe m the \nspring, took great interest in the Conference. Ultimately, as a \nlast resource, a small committee was appointed, with my father \n'as chairman, to draft the constitution and make a full report on \nthe communal issue. This Committee came to be known as the \nNehru Committee, and their subsequent report, as the Nehru \nReport. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru was also a member of this Com- \nmittee, and was responsible for part of the Report. \n\nJ, was not a member of this Committee, but as- Congress \nSecretary I had much to do with it. It was an awkward situation \nfor me, for I thought it wholly futile to draw up detailed paper \nconstitutions when the real problem was the conquest of power. \nAnother difficulty for me was the inevitable limitaiions by this \nmixed Committee of our goal to what was called Dominion \nStatus and was, in fact, even less. For me the real importance \nof the Committee lay in the possibility of its finding a way out \nof the communal impasse. I did not expect a final solution of \nthis question by some pact or agreement \u2014 that solution would \nonly come by a divertion of interest to social and economic issues \n\u2014but there was the possibility that even a temporary pact, if \naccepted by a sufficient number of people, would help to ease \nthe situation and thus succeed in mverting interest to other \nissues. So I did not wish to obstruct the work of the Committee \nand I gave such help as I co'uld. \n\nSuccess seemed almost within grasp. Only two or three points \nremained to settle, and of these the really important one was \nthe Punjab, where there was the Hindu-Muslim-Sikh triangle. \nThe Committee in their report considered the question of the \nPunjab from a novel point of view, and supported their recom- \nmendation with the help of some revealing figures of the dis- \ntribution of population. But all this was in vain. Fear and \nmistrust remained on either side, and the little step to cross the \nshort distance that remained was not taken. \n\nThe AD-Parties Conference met at Lucknow to consider the \nr^ort of their Committee. Again some of us were in a \ndilemma, for we did not wish to come in the way of a commimal \nsettlement, if ihat was possible, and yet we were not prepared \nto yield on the question of independence. We begged thw the \nconference leave this question open so that each constituent part \n\n\n\nRETURN TO INDIA \n\n\nm \n\ncould have liberty of action on this issue \u2014 ^the Congress adhering \nto independence and the more moderate groups to Dominion \nStatus. But my father had set his heart on the Report and he \nwould not yield, nor perhaps could he under the circumstances. \nI was thereupon asked by our Independence group in the \nconference \u2014 and this was a large one \u2014 ^to make a statement to \nthe Conference on its behalf, dissociating ourselves completely \nfrom everything that lowered the objective of independence. \nBut we made it further clear that we would not be obstructive, \nas we did not wish to come in the way of the communal state- \nment. \n\nThis was not a very effective line to adopt on such a major \nissue; at best it was a negative gesture. A positive side was given \nto our attitude by our founding that very day the Independence \nfor India League. \n\nThe All-Parties Conference gave me another and a greater \nshock by adding to the Fundai nenta l Rights in the proposed \nconstitution, at the instance of theOudh taluqadars, a clause \nguaranteeing their vested rights in their taluqas. The whole \nconstitution was, of course, based on the idea of private prop- \nerty, but it <lid seem to me an outrage to make the property \nrignts in the huge semi-feudal estates one of the irremovable \nfoundations of the constitution. This made it clear that the \nCongress leadership, and much more so the non-Congress people, \nprefered the company of the landed magnates to that of the \nsociaRy advanced groups in their own ranks. It was obvious that a \nwide gulf separated us from many of our leaders, and it seemed a \nlittle absurd for me to carry on as General Secretary of the Con- \ngress imder these circumstances. I offered my resignation on the \nground of having been one of the foxmders of the Independence \nfor India League. But the Working Committee would not agree \nto it and told me (as weU as Subhas Bose, who had also offered \nto resign on the same ground) that we could carry on with the \nLeague without any con^ct with the Congress policy. Indeed, \nthe Congress had already declared for independence. And again \nI.agreed. It was surprising how easy it was to win me over to \na withdrawal of my resignation. This happened on many \noccasions, and as neither party really liked the idea of a break, \nwe clung to every pretext to avoid it. \n\nGandhiji took no part in these All-Party Conference or Com- \nmittee meetings. He was not even present at the Lucknow \nConference. \n\nMeanwhile the Simon Commission had been moving about, \npursued by bladt flags and hostile crowds shouting, \" Go back.\u201d \n\n\n\n \u2022 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nOccasionally there .were minor conflicts between the police and \nthe crowds. Lahore brought matters to a head and suddenly \nsent a thrill of indignation throughout the country. The anti- \nSimon Commission demonstration there was headed by Lala \nLajpat Rai, and as he stood by the road-side in &ont of the \nthousands of demonstrators he was assaulted and beaten on his \nchest with a baton by a young English police officer. There had \nbeen no attempt whatever on the part of the crowd, much less \non the part of Lalaji, to indulge in any methods of violence. \nEven so, as he stood peacefully by, he and many of his com- \npanions were severely beaten by the police. Any one who takes \npart in street demonstrations runs the risk of a conflict with the \npolice, and, though. our demonstrations were almost always per- \nfectly peaceful, Lalaji must have known of this risk and taken \nit consciously. But still, the manner of the assault, the needless \nbiutality of it, came as a shock to vast numbers of people in \nIndia. Those were the days when we were not used to lathi \ncharges by the police; our sensitiveness had not been blunted \nby repeated brutality. To find that even the greatest of our \nleaders, the foremost and most popular man in the Punjab, \ncould be so treated seemed little short of monstrous, and a dull \nanger spread all over the country, especially in north India. \nHow hdpless we were, how despicable when we could not even \nprotect the honour of our chosen leaders I \n\nThe physical injury to Lalaji had been serious enough, as he \nhad been hit on the chest and he had long suffered from heart \n^ease. Probably, in the case of a healthy young man the \ninjury would not have been great, but Lalaji was neither young \nnor healthy. What effect this physical injury had on his death a \nfew weeks later it is hardly possible to say definitely, though his \ndoctors were of opinion that it hastened the end. But I tbinlf \nthat there can be no doubt that the mental shock which accom- \np^ed the physical injury had a tremendous effect on Lalaji. \nHe felt angry and bitter, not so much at the personal humilia- \ntion, as at the national humiliation involved in the assault on \nhim. \n\nIt was this sense of national humiliation that weighed on the \nmind^of India, and when Lalaji\u2019s death came soon after, inevit- \nably it was connected with the assault, and sorrow itself gave \npride of place to anger and indignation. It is well to appreciate \nthis, for only so can we have some understanding of subsequent \nevents, of the phenoinenon of Bhagat Singh, and of his sudden \nand amaing popularity in north India. It is very easy and very \nfetuous to condemn persons or acts without seeking to tmder- \n\n\n\nRETURN TO INDIA \n\n\n \n\nStand the springs of action, the causes that underlie them. \nBhagat Singh was not previously well known; he did not become \npopular because of an act of violence, an act of terrorism. Ter- \nrorists have flourished in India, off and on, for nearly thirty \nyears, and at no time, except in the early days in Bengal, did any \nof them attain a fraction of that popularity which came to \nBhagat Singh. This is a patent fact which cannot be denied; it \nhas to be admitted. And another fact, which is equally obvious, \nis that terrorism, in spite of occasional recrudescence, has no \nlonger any real appeal for the youth of India. Fifteen years\u2019 \nstress on non-violence has changed the whole background in \nIndia and made the masses much more indifferent to, and even \nhostile to, the idea of terrorism as a method of political action. \nEven the classes from which the terrorists are usually drawn, the \nlower middle-classes and intelligentsia, have been powerfully \naffected by the Congress propaganda against methods of \nviolence. 'Their active and impatient elements, who think in \nterms of revolutionary action, also realise fully now that revolu- \ntion does not come through terrorism, and that terrorism is an \noutworn and profitless method which comes in the way of real \nrevolutionary action. Terrorism is a dying thing in India and \nelsewhere, not because of Government coercion, which can only \nsuppress and bottle up, not eradicate, but because of basic causes \nand world events. Terrorism usually represents the infancy of \na revolutionary turge in a country, \"niat stage passes, and with \nit passes terrorism as an important phenomenon. Occasional \noutbursts may continue because of local causes or individual \n\nS ressions. India has undoubtedly passed that stage, and no \nt even the occasional outbursts will gradually die out. But \nthis does not mean that all people in India have ceased to believe \nin methods of violence. They have, very largely, ceased to be- \nlieve in individual violence and terrorism but many, no doubt, \nstiU think that a time may come when organised, violent \nmethods may be necessary for gaining fieedom, as they have \noften been necessary in other countries. That is to-day an \nacademic issue- which time alone will put to the test; it has \nnothing to do with terroristic methods. \n\nBhagat Singh thus did not become popular because of his act \nof terrorism, but because he seemed to vindicate, for the \nmoment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him at \nthe nation. He became a symbol; the act was flirgotten, the \nsymbol remained, and witlun a few months each town and \nvillage of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of \nnorthern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ngrew up about him, and the popularity that the man achieved \nwas something amazing. \n\nA short time after the Simon Commission beating, Lala Rajpat \nRai attended a meeting of the All-India Congress Committee \nin Delhi. He bore marks of injuries, and was still suftering \nfrom the after-effects. The meeting was held after the Lucknow \nAll-Parties Conference, and the question of Independence came \nup for discussion in some form or otlier. I forget the exact point \nthat was in issue, but I remember speaking at some length, and \npointing out that the time had come for the Congress to choose \nbetween a revolutionary outlook, which involved radical changes \nin our political and social structure, and a reformist objective \nand method. The speech had no importance, and I would have \nforgotten it but for the fact that Lalaji replied to it in the Com- \nmittee, and criticised some parts of it. One of his warnings was \nto the effect that we should expect nothing from the British \nLabour Party. That warning was not necessary so far as I was \nconcerned, for I was not an admirer of the official leadership \nof British Labour; the only thing that could surprise me in \nregard to it would have been to find it supporting the struggle \nfor India\u2019s fireedom, or doing anrthing effectively anti-imperialist \nor likely to lead to socialism. \n\nOn returning to Lahore, Lalaji reverted to the subject of my \nspeech at the A.I.C.C. meeting, and began a series of articles \non various issues connected with it in his weekly journal The \nPeople. Only the first article appeared; before the second could \ncome out in the next week\u2019s issue, he was dead. That first un- \nfinished article of his, perhaps his last writing for publication, \nhas had a melancholy interest for me.  EXPERIENCE OF LATHI CHARGES \n\nThe assault on Lala Lajpat Rai, and his subsequent death, \nincreased the vigour of the demonstrations against the Simon \nCommission in the places which it subsequently visited. It was \ndue in Lucknow, and the local Congress Committee made \nextensive preparations for its \u2018reception\u2019. Huge processions, \nmeetings, and demonstrations were organised many days in \nadvance, both as propaganda and as rehearsals for the actual \nshow. I went to Lucknow, and was present at some of these. \nThe success of these preliminary demonstrations, which were \nperfecdy orderly and peaceful, evidently nettled the authorities, \nand they began to obstruct and issue orders against the taking \nout of processions in certain areas. It was in this connection \nthat I had a new experience, and my body felt the baton and \nlathi blows of the police. \n\nProcessions had been prohibited, ostensibly to avoid any inter- \nference vidth the traffic. We decided to give no cause for com- \nplaint on this score, and arranged for small groups of sixteen, \nas far as I can remember, to go separately, along unfeequoited \nroutes to the meeting place. Technically, this was no doubt a \nbreach of the order, for sixteen with a Sag were a procession. \nI led one of the groups of sixteen and, after a big gap, came \nanother such group under the leadership of my colleague, \nGovind BaUabh Pant. My group had gone perhaps about two \nhundred yards, the road was a deserted one, when we heard \nthe datter of horses\u2019 hoofs behind us. We looked back to find \na bunch of mounted police, probably two or three dozen in \nnumber, bearing down upon us at a rapid pace. They were soon \nright upon us, and the impact of the horses broke up our little \ncwumn of sixteen. The moimted polic^en then started \nbelabouring our volunteers with huge batons or truncheons and, \ninsfmctivdy, the volunteers sought refuge on the side-walks, and \nsome even entered the petty shops. 'They were pursued and \nbeaten down. My own instinct had urged me to seek safety when \nI saw the horses charging down upon us; it was a discouraging \nsight. But then, I suppose, some other instinct held me to my \nplace and I survived the first charge, which had been chedcra \nby the volunteers behind me. Suddenly I ffiund myself alone in \nthe middle of the road; a few yards away from me, in various \n\nN m \n\n\n\niy JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ndireaions, were the policemen beating down our volunteers. \nAutomatically, I began moving slowly to the side of the road \nto be less conspicuous, but again I stopped and had a little argu- \nment vvith myself, and decided that it would be unbecoming \nfor me to move away. All this was a matter of a few seconds \nonly, but I have the clearest recollections of that conflict within \nme and the decision, prompted by my pride, I suppose, which \ncould not tolerate the idea of my behaving like a coward. Yet \nthe line between cowardice and courage was a thin one, and I \nmight well have been on the other side. Hardly had I so decided, \nwhen I looked round to find that a mounted policeman was \ntrotting up to me, brandishing his long new baton. I told him \nto go ahead, and turned my head away\u2014 -again an instinctive \neffort to save the head and face. He gave me two resounding \nblows on the back. I felt stunned, and my body quivered all \nover but, to my surprise and satisfaction, I found that I. was still \nstanding. The police force was withdrawn soon after, and made \nto block the road in front of us. Our volunteers gathered \ntogether again, many of them bleeding and with split skulls, \nand we were joined by Pant and his lot, who had also been \nbelaboured, and all of us sat down facing the police. So we sat \nfor an hour or so, and it became dark. On the one side, various \nhigh officials gathered; on the other, large crowds began to \nassemble as the news spread. Ultimately, the officials agreed to \nallow us to go by our original route, and we went that way \nwith the mounted policemen, who had charged us and belab- \noured us, going ahead of us as a kind of escort. \n\nI have written about this petty incident in some detail because \nof its effect on me. The bodily pain I felt was quite forgotten \nin a feeling of exhilaration that I was physically strong enough \nto foce and bear lathi blows. And a thing that surprised me was \nthat right through the incident, even when I was being beaten, \nmy mind was quite dear and I was consdously analysing my \nfeelings. This rehearsal stood me in good stead the next \nmorning, when a stiffer trial was in store for us. For the next \nmorning was the time when the Simon Commission was due \nto arrive, and our great demonstration was going' to take place. \n\nMy fother was at Allahabad at the time, and I was afraid \nthat the news of the assault on me, when he read about it in \nthe next morning's papers, would upset, him and the rest of \nthe family. So I telephoned to him late in the evening to assure \nhim that all was well, and that he should not worjy. But ^ \ndid worrjr and, finding it difficult to sleep over it, he dedded at \nabout midnight to come over to Lucknow. The last train had \n\n\n\nEXPERIENCE OP -LATHI CHARGES  \n\ngone, and so he started by motor-car. He had some bad luck \non the way, and it was nearly five in the morning by the time \nhe had covered the journey of  miles and reached Lucknow, \ntired out and exhausted. \n\nThat was about the time when we were getting ready to go \nin procession to the station. The previous evening\u2019s incidents \nhad the effect of rousing up Lucknow more than anything that \nwe could have done, and even before the sun was out, vast \nnumbers of people made their way to the station. Innumerable \nlittle processions came from various parts of the city, and from \nthe Congress office started the main procession, consisting of \nseveral thousands, marching in fours. We were in this main \nprocession. We were stopped by the police as we approached \nthe station. There was a huge open space, about half a mile \nsquare, in front of the station (this has now been built over by \nthe new station) and we were made to line up on one side of \nthis maidan, and there our procession remained, making no \nattempt to push our way forward. The place was full of foot \nand mounted police, as well as the military. The crowd of \nsympathetic onlookers swelled up, and many of these persons \nmanaged to spread out in twos and threes in the open space. \nSuddenly we saw in the far distance a moving mass. They \nwere two or three long lines of cavalry or mounted police, \ncovering the entire area, galloping dotvn towards us, and \nstriking and riding down the numerous stragglers that dotted \nthe maidan. That charge of galloping horsemen was a fine \nsight, but for the tragedies that were being enacted on the \nway, as harmless and very much surprised sightseers went \nunder the horses\u2019 hoofs. Beliind the charging lines these people \nlay on the ground, some still unable to move, others wnthing \nin pain, and the whole appearance of that maidan was that of \na battlefield. But we did not have much time for gazing on \nthat scene or for reflections; the horsemen were soon upon us, \nand their front line clashed almost at a gallop with the massed \nranks of our processionists. We held our ground, and, as we \nappeared to be unyielding, the horses had to pull up at the \nlast moment and reared up on their hind legs with their front \nhoofs quivering in the air over our heads. And then began \na beating of us, and battering with lathis and long batons \nboth by the mounted and the foot police. It was a tremendous \nhammering, and the dearness of vision that I had had the \nevening before left me. All I knew was that I had to stay \nwhere I was, and must not yield or go back. I felt half blinded \nwith the blows, and sometimes a oull anger seized me and a \n\n\n\nlo JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ndesire to hit out. I thought how easy it would be to pull down \nthe police officer in front of me from his horse and to mount \nup myself, but long training and discipline held and I did not \nraise a hand, except to protect my face from a blow. Besides, \nI knew well enough that any aggression on our part would \nresult in a ghastly tragedy, the firing and shooting down of \nlarge numbers of our men. \n\nAfter what seemed a tremendous length of time, but was \nprobably only a few minutes, our line began to yield slowly, \nstep by step, without breaking up. This left me somewhat \nisolated, and more exposed at the sides. More blows came, and \nthen I was suddenly lifted off iny feet from behind and carried \noff, to my great annoyance. Some of my young colleagues, \nthinking that a dead-set was being made at me, had decided to \nprotect me in this summary fashion. \n\nOur processionists lined up again about a hundred feet behind \nour original line. The police also withdrew and stood in a line, \nfifty feet apart from us. So we remained, when the cause of \nall this trouble, the Simon Commission, secretly crept away \nfirom the station in the far distance, more than half a mile \naway. But, even so, they did not escape the back flags or demon- \nstrators. Soon after, we came back in full procession to the \nCongress office, and there dispersed, and I went on to father, \nwho was anxiously waiting for us. \n\nNow that the excitement of the moment had passed, I felt \npains all over my body and great fatigue. Almost every part \nof me seemed to ache, and I was covered with contused wounds \nand marks of blows. But fortunately I was not injured in any \nvital spot. M^y of our companions were less fortunate, and \nwere badly injured. Govind Ballabh Pant, who stood by me, \noffered a much biggw target, being six foot odd in height, and \nthe injuries he received then have resulted in a painful at<d \npersistent malady which prevented him for a long tirop firom \nstraightening his back or leading an active life. I emerged with \na somewhat peater conceit or my physical conditton and \npowers of endurance. But the memory that endures with me, \nmr more than that of the beating itself, is that of many of \nthe feces of those policemen, and especially of the officers, who \nwere attacking us. Most of the real beating and battering was \ndone by European sergeants, the Indian rank and file were \nmilder in their methods. And those faces, full of hate and \nblood-liMt, almost mad, with no trace of sympathy or touch of \nhumamtyl Probably the feces on our side just then were \nequally hateful to look at, and the feet that we were mostly \n\n\n\nEXPERIENCE OF LATHI CHARGES ll \n\npassive did not fill our minds and hearts with love for our \nopponents, or add to the beauty of our countenances. And yet, \nwe had no grievance against each other; no quarrel that was \npersonal, no ill-will. We happened to represent, for the time \nbeing, strange and powerful forces which held us in thrall and \ncast us hither and thither, and, subtly gripping our minds and \nhearts, roused our desires and passions and made us their blind \ntools. Blindly we struggled, not knowing what we struggled for \nand whither we went. The excitement of action held us; but, \nas it passed, immediately the question arose : To what end was \nall this? To what end?  THUNDER IN THE AIR \n\nThe  Congress was going to be held in Lahore. After ten \nyears it had come back to the Punjab, and people\u2019s minds leapt \nover that decade and went back to the events of ipig-Jallian- \nwala Bagh, martial law with all its humiliations, the Congress \nsessions at Amritsar, to be followed by the beginnings of non- \nco-operation. Much had happened during this decade and \nIndia's face had changed, but there was no lack of parallels. \nPolitical tension was growing; the atmosphere of struggle was \ndeveloping fast. The long shadow of the conflict to come lay \nover the land. \n\nThe Legislative Assembly and the Provincial Councils had \nlong ceased to interest any one, except the handful who moved \nin their sacred orbits. They carried on in their humdrum way, \nproviding some kind of a cloak \u2014 a torn and tattered affair \u2014 \nto the authoritarian and despotic nature of the Government, \nan excuse to some people to talk of India\u2019s parliament, and \nallowances to their members. The last successful effort of the \nAssembly to draw attention to itself was when it passed a \nresolution in  refusing its co-operation to the Simon Com- \nmission. \n\nThere had also been subseq^uently a conflict between the \nChair and the Government. Vithalbhai Patel, the Swarajist \nPresident of the Assembly, had become a thorn in the tender \nside of the Government on account of his independence (of \nthem) and attempts were made to clip his wings. Such hap- \npenings attracted attention but, on the whole, the public mind \nwas now concentrated on events outside. My father was \nthoroughly disillusioned with Council work, and often expressed \nhis opinion that nothing more could be got out of the legis- \nlatures at that stage. He wanted to get out of them himself \nif an opportunity presented itself. Constitutionally minded as \nhe was and used to legal methods and procedure, force of cir- \ncumstances had driven him to the painful conclusion that the \nsoolled constitutional methods were ineffective and futile in \nIndia. He would justify this to his own legalist mind by saying \nthat there was no constitution in India, 'nor was there any retd \nrule of law when laws, in the shape of ordinances and the like, \nappeared suddenly, like rabbits from a conjurer\u2019s hat, at the \n\nIQO \n\n\n\nTHUNDER IN THE AIR igt \n\nwill of an indi\\'idual or a dictating group. In temperament and \nhabit he was far from being a revolutionary, and if there had \nbeen anything like bourgeois democracy, he would undoubtedly \nhave been a pillar of the constitution. But, as it was, talk of \nconstitutional agitation in India, with a parade of a sham \nparliament, began to irritate him more and more. \n\nGandhiji was still keeping away from politics, except for the \npart he played at the Calcutta Congress. He ivas, however, in \nfull touch with developments and was often consulted by the \nCongress leaders. His main activity for some years had been \nKhadi propaganda, and with this object he had undertaken \nextensive tours all over India. He took each province by turn \nand visited every district and almost every town of any conse- \nquence, as well as remote rural areas. Everywhere he attracted \nenormous crowds, and it required a great deal of previous \nstaff-work to carry through his programme. In this manner \nhe has repeatedly toured India and got to know every bit of \nthe vast country from the north to the far south, from the \neastern mountains to the western sea. I do not think any other \nhuman being has ever travelled about India as much as he has \ndone. \n\nIn the past there were great wanderers who were continually \non the move, pilgrim souls with the wanderlust, but their means \nof locomotion were slow, and a life-time of such wandering \ncould hardly compete with a year by railway and motor-car. \nGandhiji went by railway and automobile, but he did not con- \nfine himself to them; he tramped also. In this way he gathered \nhis unique knowledge of India and her people, and in this way \nalso scores of millions saw him and came into personal touch \nwith him. ' \n\nHe came to the United Provinces in  on his khadi tour, \nand spent many weeks in these provinces during the hottest \npart of the year. I accompanied him occasionally for a few \ndays at a time and, despite previous experience, could not help \nmarvelling at the vast crowds he attracted. This was especially \nnoticeable in our eastern districts, like Gorakhpur, where the \nswarms of human beings reminded one of hordes of locusts. \nAs we motored through the rural areas, we would have gather- \nings of firom ten thousand to twenty-five thousand every few \nmiles, and the principal meeting of the day might even exceed \na hundred thousand. There were no hroadcasting facilities, \nexcept rarely in a few big cities, and it was manifestly impos- \nsible to be heard by these crowds. Probably they did not expect \nto hear anything; they were satisfied if they saw the Mahatma. \n\n\n\nigZ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nGandhiji usually addressed them brlelly, avoiding undue strain; \nit would have been quite impossible to carry on otherwise in \nthis fashion horn hour to hour and day to day. \n\nI did not accompany him throughout his U.P. tour as I could \nbe of no special use to him, and there was no point in my \nadding to the number of the touring party. I had no objection \nto crowds, but there was not sufficient inducement to get pushed \nand knocked about and my feet crushed\u2014 the usual fate of \npeople accompanying Gandhiji. I had plenty of other work to \ndo, and had no desire to confine myself to Ichadi propaganda, \nwhich seemed to me a relatively minor activity in view of the \ndeveloping political situation. To some extent I resented Gand- \nhiji\u2019s pre-occupation with non-political issues,, and I could never \nunderstand the background of his thought. In those days he \nwas collecting funds for khadi work, and he would say fre- \nquently that he Avanted money for Daridranarayan, the \u2018 Lord \nof the Poor\u2019, or \u2018God that resides in the Poor'; meaning \nthereby, presumably, that he wanted it to help the poor to find \nemployment and work in cottage industries. But behind that \nword there seemed to be a glorification of poverty; God Avas \nespecially the Lord of the poor; they were His chosen people. \nThat, I suppose, is the usual religious attitude everywhere. I \ncould not appreciate it, for poverty seemed to me a hateful \nthing, to be fought and rooted out and not to be encouraged \nin any way. This inevitably led to an attack on a system which \ntolerated and produced poverty, and those who shrunk firom \nthis had of necessity to jtistify poverty in some way. They \ncould only think in terms of scarcity and could not picture a \nworld abundantly supplied with the necessaries of IbFe; prob- \nably, according to them, the rich and the poor would always \nhe with us. \n\nWhenever I had occasion to discuss this with Gandhiji, \nhe would lay stress on the rich treating their riches as a \ntrust for the people; it was a vicAV-point of considerable \nantiquity, and one comes across it frequently in India as well \nas medieval Europe. I confess that I have always been wholly \nunable to understand how any person can reasonably expect \nthis to happen, ot imagine that 'therein lies the solution of the \nsocial problem. \n\nThe Legislative Assembly, as I have said above, was becoming \na somnolent affair and few people took interest in its dreary \nactivities. A rude awakening came to it one day when Bhagat \nSingh and B. K. Dutt threw two bombs from the visitors* gallery \non to the floor of the bouse. No one was seriously hurt, and \n\n\n\nTHUNDER IN THE AIR I \n\nprobably the bombs were intended, as was stated by the \naccused later, to make a noise and create a stir, and not to \ninjure. \n\nThey did create a stir both in the Assembly and outside. Other \nactivities of Terrorists were not so innocuous. A young English \npolice officer, who was alleged to have hit Lala Lajpat Rai, \nwas shot down and killed in Lahore. In Bengal and elsewhere \nthere seemed to be a recrudescence of terrorist activity. A \nnumber of conspiracy cases were launched, and the number of \ndetenus \u2014 people kept in prison or otherwise detained without \ntrial or conviction \u2014 rapidly increased. \n\nIn the Lahore conspiracy case some extraordinary scenes were \nenacted in the court by the police, and a great deal of public \nattention was drawn to the case because of this. As a protest \nagainst the treatment given to them in court and in prison, \nthere was a hunger-strike on the part of most of the prisoners. \nI forget the exact reason why it began, but ultimately the \nquestion involved became the larger one of treatment of \nprisoners, especially Politicals. This hunger-strike went on from \nweek to week and created a stir in the country. Owing to the \nphysical weakness of the accused, they could not be taken to \ncourt, and the proceedings had to be adjourned repeatedly. \nThe Government of India thereupon initiated legislation to \nallow court proceedings to continue even in the absence of the \naccused or their counsel. The question of prison treatment had \nalso to be considered by them. \n\nI happened to be in Lahore when the hunger-strike was \nalready a month old. I was given permission to visit some of \nthe prisoners in the prison, and I availed myself of this. I \nsaw Bhagat Singh for the first time, and Jatindranath Das and \na few others. They were all very weak and bed-ridden, and it \nwas hardly possible to talk to them much. Bhagat Singh had \nan attractive, intellectual face, remarkably calm and peaceful. \nThere seemed to be no anger in it. He looked and talked with \ngreat gentleness, but then I suppose that any one who has been \nfasting for a month wiU look spiritual and gentle. Jatin Das \nlooked milder still, soft; and gentle like a young girl. He was in \nconsiderable pain when I saw him. He died later, as a result of \nfesting, on the sixty-first day of the hunger-strike, \n\nBhagat Singh\u2019s chief ambidon seemed to be to see, or at least \nto have news of, his uncle, Sardar Ajit Singh, who had been \ndeported, together with Lala Lajpat Rai, in- . For many \nyears he had been an exile abroad. There were some vague \nreports that he had settled in South America, but I do not \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nfhinlf anything definite is known about him. I do not even \nknow if he is alive or dead. \n\nJatin Das's death created a sensation all over the country. It \nbrought the question of the treatment of political prisoners to \nthe front, and Government appointed a committee on the sub- \nject. As a result of the deliberations of this committee, new \nrules were issued creating tliree classes of prisoners. No special \nclass of political prisoners was created. These new rules, which \nseemed to promise a change for the better, as a matter of fact \nmade little difference, and the position remained, and still \nremains, highly unsatisfactory. \n\nAs the summer and monsoon months gradually shaded off \ninto the autumn, the Provincial Coi^ress Committees busied \nthemselves with the election of the President for the Lahore \nsession of the Congress. This election is a lengthy process, and \nused to go on from August to October. Iij  there was \nalmost unanimity in favour of Gandhiji. This desire to have \nhim as President for a second time did not, of course, push him \nany higher in the Congress hierarchy, for he had been a kind \nof super-president for many years. It was generally felt, how- \never, that as a struggle was impending, and he was bound to be \nthe de facto leader of it, he might as well be the de jure head \nof the Congress for the occasion. Besides, there was really no \nother person outstanding enough and obvious enough for the \npresidentship. \n\nSo Gandhiji was recommended for the presidentship by \nthe Provincial Committees. But he would have none of \nit. His refusal, though emphatic, seemed to leave some room \nfor argument, and it was hoped that he would reconsider it. A \nmeeting of the All-India Congress Committee was held in \nLucknow to decide finally, and almost to the last hour all of us \nthought that he would agree. But he would not do so, and at \nthe last moment he pressed my name forward. The A.I.C.C. \nwas somewhat taken aback by his final refusal, and a little \nirritated at being placed in a difficult and invidious position. \nFor want of any other person, and in a spirit of resignation, \nthey finally elected me. \n\nI have seldom felt quite so annoyed and humiliated as I did \nat that election. It was not that I was not sensible of the \nhonour, for it was a great honour, and I would have rejoiced if \nI had been elected in the ordinary way*. But I did not come to \nit by the mmn entrance or even a side entrance; I appeared \nsuddenly by a trap-door and bewildered the audience into \nacceptance. They put a brave face on it, and, like a necessary \n\n\n\nTHUNDER IN THE AIR I \n\npill, swallowed me. My pride was hurt, and almost I felt like \nhanding back the honour. Fortunately I restrained myself from \nmaking an exhibition of myself, and stole away with a heavy \nheart. \n\nProbably the person who was happiest about this decision \nwas my father. He did not wholly like my politics, but he liked \nme well enough, and any good thing that came my way pleased \nhim. Often he would criticise me and speak a little curtly to \nme, but no person who cared to retain lus goodwill could run \nme down in his presence. \n\nMy election was indeed a great honour and a great responsi- \nbility for me; it was unique in that a son was immediately \nfollowing his father in' the presidential chair. It was often said \nthat I was the youngest President of the Congress \u2014 I was just \nforty when I presided. This was not tme. I think Gokhale was \nabout the same age, and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (though \nhe is a little older than me) was probably just under forty when \nhe presided. But Gokhale was considered one of the elder \nstatesmen even when he was in his late thirties, and Abul \nKalam Azad has especially cultivated a look of venerable age \nto give a suitable background to his great learning. As states- \nmanship has seldom been considered one of my virtues, and \nno one has accused me of possessing an excess of learning, I \nhave escaped so far the accusation of age, though my hair has \nturned grey and my looks betray me. \n\nThe Lahore Congress drew near. Meanwhile events were \nmarching, step by step, inevitably, pushed onward, so it seemed, \nby some motive force of their own. Individuals, for all the \nbrave show they put up, played a very minor re. One had the \nfeeling of being a cog in a great machine which swept on \nrelentlessly. \n\nHoping perhaps to check this onward march of destiny, the \nBritish Government took a forward step, and the Viceroy, Lord \nIrwin, made an announcement about a forthcoming Round \nTable Conference. It was an ingeijiously worded announcement, \nwhich could mean much or veiy little, and it seemed to many of \nus obvious that the latter was the more likely contingency. And \nin any event, even if there was more in the announcement, it \ncould not be anywhere near what we wanted. Hardly had this \nViceregal announcement been made when, almost with indecent \nhaste, so it seemed, a \" Leaders' Conference \u201d was arranged at \nDelhi, and people foom various groups were in'vited to it. \nGandhiji was there, so was my fiidier; Vithalbhai Patel (still \nPresident of the Assembly) was also there, and Moderate leaders. \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nlike Sir Tcj Bahadur Sapru and others. A joint resolution or \nmanifesto was agreed to, accepting the Viceroy\u2019s declaration \nsubject to some conditions, which, it was stated, were vital and \nmust be fulfilled. If these conditions were accepted by Govern- \nment, then co-operation was to be offered. These conditions^ \nwere solid enough and would have made a difference. \n\nIt was a triumph to get such a resolution agreed to by repre- \nsentatives of all the groups, moderate and advanced. For the \nCongress it was a come-down; as a common measure of agree- \nment it was high. But there was a fatal catch in it. The condi- \ntions were looked upon from at least two different view-points. \nThe Congress people considered them to be essential, the sine \nqua non, without which there could be no co-OTeration. For \nthem they represented the minimum required. This was made \nclear by a subsequent meeting of the Congress Working Com- \nmittee, which further stated that this offer was limited to the date \nof the next Congress. For the Moderate groups they were a \ndesirable maximum which should be stated, but which could \nnot be insisted on to the point of refusal of co-operation. For \nthem the conditions, though called vital, were not really condi- \ntions. \n\nAnd so it happened that later on, though none of these \nconditions were satisfied and most of us lay in gaol, together \nwith scores of thousands of others, our Moderate and Respon- \nsivist friends, who had signed that manifesto with us, gave their \nfull co-operation to our gaolers. \n\nMost of us suspected that this would happen\u2014 though hardly \nto the extent it did happen \u2014 ^but there was some hope that this \njoint action, whereby the Congress people had to some extent \ncurbed themselves, would also result in curbing the propensities \nof the Liberals and others to indiscriminate and almost invari- \nable co-(meration with the British Government. A more powerfiil \nmotive for some of us, who heartily disliked the compromising \nresolution, was to keep our own Congress ranks well knit to- \n\n\u2018 The condidons were : \n\n(i) All discussions at the proposed conference to be on the basis \nof full Dominion Status for India. \n\n(a) There should be a predominant representation of Congress- \nmen at the conference. \n\n() A general amnesty of polidcal prisoners. \n\n() The Government of India to be carried on from now onwards, \nas, far as is possible under existing conditions, on the lines of a \nDominion government. \n\n\n\nTHUNDER IN THE AIR  \n\ngether. On the eve of a big struggle we could not afford to split \nup the Congress. It was well known that Government was not \nlikely to accept the conditions laid down by us, and our position \nwould thus be stronger and we could easily carry our Right Wing \nwith us. It was only a question of a few weeks; December and \nthe Lahore Congress were near. \n\nAnd yet that joint manifesto was a bitter pill for some of us. \nTo give up the demand for independence, even in theory and \neven for a short while, was wrong and dangerous: it meant that \nit was just a tactical affair, something to bargain with, not some- \nthing which was essential and without which xve could never be \ncontent. So I hesitated and refused to sign the manifesto (Subhas \nBose had definitely refused to sign it), but, as was not unusual \nwith me, I allowed myself to be talked into signing. Even so, I \ncame away in great distress, and the very next day I thought of \nwithdrawing from the Congress presidentship, and wrote accord- \ningly to Gandhiji. I do not suppose that I meant this seriously, \nthough I was sufficiently upset. A soothing letter from Gandhiji \nand three days of reflection calmed me. \n\nJust prior to the Lahore Congress, a final attempt was made \nto find some basis of agreement between Congress and the \nGovernment. An interview with Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, was \narranged. I do not know who took the initiative in arranging \nthis interview, but I ima^ne that Vithalbhai Patel was the \nprime mover. Gandhiji and my father were present at the inter- \nview, representing the Congress view-point, and I think also \npresent were Mr. Jinnah, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapni and President \nPatel. The interview came to nothing; there was no common \nground, and the two main parties \u2014 ^the Government and Con- \ngress \u2014 ^were far apart from each other. So now nothing remained \nbut for the Congress to go ahead. The year of grace given at \nCalcutta was ending; independence was to be declared once for \nall the objective of the Congress, and the necessary steps taken \nto carry on the struggle to attain it. \n\nDuring these final weeks prior to the Lahore Congress I had \nto attend to important work in another field. The AU-India \nTrade Union Congress was meeting at Nagpur, and, as Presidrait \nfor the year, I had to preside over it. It was very unusual for the \nsame person to preside over both the National Congress and the \nTrade Union Congress within a few weeks of each other. I had \nhoped that I might be a link between the two and bring them \ncloser to eadi other \u2014 ^the National Congress to become more \nsocialistic, more proletarian, and organised Labour to join the \nnational struggle. \n\n\n\nIp JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nIt was, perhaps, a vain hope, for nationalism can only \ngo far in a socialistic or proletarian direction by ceasing to \nbe nationalism. Yet I felt that, bourgeois as the outlook of the \nNational Congress was, it did represent the only effective revolu- \ntionary force in the country. Ai such, Labour ought to help it \nand co-operate with it and influence it, keeping, however, its own \nidentity and ideology distinct and intact. And I hoped that the \ncourse of events and the participation in direct action would \ninevitably drive the Congress to a more radical ideology and to \nface social and economic issues. The development of the Con- \ngress during recent years had been in the direction of the peasant \nand the village. If this development continued, it might in \ncourse of time become a vast peasant organisation, or, at \nany rate, an organisation in which the peasant element \npredominated. Already in many of our U.P. District \nCongress Committees the peasantiy were strorfgly represented, \nthough the middle-class intelligentsia held the leadership in \ntheir hands. \u2022 \n\nThere was thus a possibility of the eternal conflict between \nthe village and the city influencing the relations of the National \nCongress with the T.U.C. The contingency was remote, as the \npresent National Congress is run by middle-class people and is \ncontrolled by the city, and, so long as the question of national \nfreedom is not solved, its nation^sm will dominate the field \nand be the most powerful sentiment in the country. Still it \nseemed to me obviously desirable to bring the Congress nearer \nto organised labour, and in the U.P. we even invited delegates \nto our Provincial Congress Committee from the provincial \nbranch of the T.U.C. Many Congressmen also took prominent \npart in Labour activities. \n\nThe advanced sections of Labour, however, fought shy of the \nNational Congress. They mistrusted its leaders, and considered \nits ideology bourgeois and reactionary, which indeed it was, firom \nthe Labour point of view. The Congress was, as its very name \ninmlied, a nationalist organisation. \n\nThroughout igag Trade Unions in India were agitated over a \nnew issue\u2014 -the appointment of a Royal Commission on Labour \nin India, known as the Whitley Commission. The Left Wing was \nin fevour of a boycott of the Commission, the Right Wing in \nfavouf of co-operation, and the personal factor came in, as some \nof the Right Wing leaders were offered membership of the Com- \nmission. In this matter, as in many others, my sympathies were \nwith the Left,' especially as this was also the policy of the \nNational Congress. It seemed absurd to co-operate with official \n\n\n\nTHUNDER IN THE AIR  \n\nCommissions when we were carrying on, or going to carry on, a \ndirect action struggle. \n\nAt the Nagpur T.U. Congress, this question of the boycott of \nthe Whitley Commission became a major issue, and on this, as \nwell as on several other matters in dispute, the Left Wing \ntriumphed. I played a very undistinguished role at this Con- \ngress. Being a netvcomer in the Labour field and still feeling \nmy way, I was a little hesitant. Generally, I expressed my views \nin favour of the more advanced groups, but I avoided acting \nwith any gi'oup, and played the part more of an impartial \nspeaker than a directing president. I was thus an almost passive \nspectator of the breaking-up of the T.U.C. and the formation of \na new moderate organisation. Personally, I felt that the Righr \ngroups were not justified in breaking away, and yet some of the \nleaders of the Left had forced the pace and given them every \npretext to depart. Between the quarrels of the Right and Left, a \nlarge Centre group felt a litde helpless. Perhaps given a right \nlead, it could have curbed the two and avoided the break-up of \nthe T.U.C., and, even if the break came, it would not have had \nthe unfortunate consequences which resulted. \n\nAs it was, the Trade Union Movement in India suffered a \ntremendous blow from which it has not yet recovered. The \nGovernment had already started its campaign against the \nadvanced wings of the Labour movement, and die Meerut case \nwas among the first fruits thereof. This campaign continued. \nThe employers also thought the moment opportune to push their \nadvantage home. The world depression had already begun in \nthat winter of -, and buffeted by this, and attacked on \nevery side, and with their own trade union organisations at \ntheir lowest ebb, the Indian working class had a very hard time, \nand were the helpless witnesses of ajprogressive deterioration in \ntheir owa condition. The Trade Union Congress experienced \nanother split in the course of the next year or two, when a Com- \nmunist faction broke off. Thus there were in theory three federa- \ntions of Trade Unions in India \u2014 a Moderate group, the main \nT.U.C., and a Communist group. In practice they were all weak \nand inefiective, and their mumal quarrels disgusted the rank- \nand-file workers. I was out of all tfiis from  onwards, as I \nwas mostly in prison. During my short periods outside I learnt \nthat attempte at unity were being made. They were not success- \nful.* The Moderate group of unions gained strength by the \n\n* Subsequent efforts to bring about Trade Union unity have been \nmore successful, and the various groups are now working in some \nco-operation with each other. \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAVVAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nadhesion of railway workers to them. They had one advantage \nover the other groups, as Government recognised them and \naccepted their recommendations for the Labour Conferences at \nGeneva. The lure of a visit to Geneva pulled some Labour \nleaders to them, and they brought their unions with them.  THE DELHI PACT \n\nOn the day and almost at the very hour of my father\u2019s death, \na large group of the Indian members of the Round Table Con- \nference landed in Bombay. Mr. Srinivasa Sastri and Sir Tej \nBahadur Sapru, and perhaps some others whom I do not re- \nmember, came direct to Allahabad. Gandhiji and some mem- \nbers of the Congress Working Committee were already there. \nThere were some private meetings at our house at which an \naccount ivas given of what the R.T.C. had done. At the very \ncommencement, however, there was a little incident. Mr. Sastri, \nentirely of his own accord, expressed regret for what he had \nsaid at Edinburgh. He added that he was much influenced \nalways by his surroundings and his \u2018 exuberant verbosity \u2019 was \napt to run away with him. \n\nThe Round Table Delegates.did not tell us anything of impor- \ntance about the R.T.C. that we did not know already. They did \ntell us of various intrigues behind the scenes, of what Lord So- \nand-So said or Sir Somebody did in private. Our Liberal friends \nin India have always seemed to me to attach more importance \nto private talks and gossip with and about high officials than \nto principles or to the realities of the Indian situation. Our \ninformal discussions with the Liberal leaders did not lead to \nanything, and our previous opinions were only confirmed that \nthe R.T.C. decisions had not the least value. Some one then \nsuggested \u2014 forget who he was \u2014 ^that Gandhiji should write to \nthe Viceroy and ask for an interview and have a frank talk \nwith him. He agreed to do so, although I do not think that he \nexpected much in the way of result. But, on principle, he was \nalways willing to go out of his way to meet and discuss any- \nthing with his opponents. Being absolutely convinced of the \nrightness of his own position he hoped to convince the other \nparly; but it was jperhaps something more than intellectual con- \nviction that he aimed at. He was always after a psychological \nchange, a breaking of the barriers of anger and distrust, an \napproach to the other\u2019s goodwill and fine feelings. He knew \nthat if this change took place, conviction became far easier, or \neven if there was no conviction, opposition was toned down \nand the sting was taken out of the conflict. In his personal \ndealings with .individuals hostile to him, he had gained many \n\n\n\n JAVVAHARLAL NEHRU \n\na victory; it was remarkable how, by sheer force of personality, \nhe would win over an opponent. Many a critic and a scoffer \nhad been overwhelmed by this personality and became an \nadmirer, and even though the criticism continued, it could \nnever again have a trace of mockery. \n\nConscious of this power, Gandhiji always welcomed a meet- \ning with those who disagreed with him. But it was one thijig \nto deal with individuals on personal or minor issues; it was \n<^uite another matter to come up against an impersonal thing \nlike the British Government representing triumphant imperial- \nism. Realising this, Gandhiji went to the interview with \nLord Irwin with no high expectation. The Civil Disobedience \nmovement was still going on. though it had toned down because \nthere was much talk of pourparlers with Government. \n\nThe interview was arranged without delay, and Gandhiji \nwent oflf to Delhi, telling us that if there were any serious \nconversations with the Viceroy regarding a provisional settle- \nment, he would send for the members of the Working Com- \nmittee. A few days later we were all summoned to Delhi. For \nthree weeks we remained there, meeting daily and having long \nand exhausting discussions. Gandhiji had frequent interviews \nwith Lord Irwin, but sometimes there was a gap of three or \nfour da^s, probably because the Government of India was \ncommunicatmg with the India Office in London. Sometimes \napparently small matters or even certain words would hold up \nprogress. One such word was \u2018 suspension \u2019 of civil disobedience. \nGandhiji had all along made it clear that civil disobedience \ncould not be finally stopped or given up, as it was the only \nweapon in the hands of uie people. It could, however, be sus- \npended. Lord Irwin objected to this word and wanted finality \nab()ut the word, to which Gandhiji would not agree. Ultimately \nthe word \u2018discontinued\u2019 was used. There were also prolonged \ndiscussions about the picketing of foreign cloth and liquor \nshops. Most of our time was spent on considering pro- \nvisional arrangements for a pact, and little attention was given \nto fundamental matters. Probably it was thought that these \nbasw matters could be considered later under more favourable \nconditions when a provisional settlement had been made and \nthe day-to-day struggle discontinued. We looked upon those \ntalks M Iwding up to an armistice, which might then be fol- \nlowed by further conversations on the real matters in issue. \n\nDelhi attracted in those days all manner of people. There \nwere many foreign journalists, especially Americans, and they \nwere somewhat annoyed with us for our reticence. They would \n\n\n\n\u25a0I\u2019nE DELHI PACT \n\n\n \n\ntell US that they got much more news about the Gandhiji-Irwin \nconversations from the New Delhi Secretariat than from us, \nwhich was a fact. Then there were many people of high degree \nwho hurried to pay their respects to Gandhiji, for was not the \nMahatma\u2019s star in the ascendant? It was very amusing to see \nthese people, who had kept far away from Gandhiji and the \nCongress and often condemned them, now hastening to make \namends. The Congress seemed to have made good, and.no one \nknew what the future might hold. Anyway, it was safer to keep \non good terms with the Congress and its leaders. A year later \nyet another change was wimessed in them, and they were \nshouting their deep abhorrence of the Congress and all its \nworks and their utter dissociation from it. \n\nEven the communalists were stirred by events, and sensed \nwith some apprehension that they might not occupy a very \nprominent place in the coming order. And so, many of them \ncame to the Mahatma and assured him that they were per- \nfectly willing to come to terms on the communal issue ana, if \nonly he would take the initiative, there would be no difficulty \nabout a settlement. \n\nA ceaseless stream of people, of high and low degree, came \nto Dr. Ansari\u2019s house, where Gandhjji and most of us were \nstaying, and in our leisure moments wc watched them with \ninterest and profit. For some years our chief contacts had been \nwith the poor in towns and villages and those who were down \nand out in gaols. The very prosperous gentlemen who came \nto visit Gan&iji showed us another side of human nature, and \na vciy adaptable side, for wherever they sensed power and \nsuccess, they turned to it and welcomed it with the sunshine \nof their smiles. Many of them were staunch pillars of the \nBritish Government in India. It was comforting to know that \nthey would become equally staunch pillars of any other \ngovernment that might flourish in India. \n\nOften in those days I used to accompany Gandhiji in his \nearly morning walks in New Delhi. That was usually the only \ntime one had a chance of talking to him, for the rest of the \nday was cut up into little bits, each minute allotted to some- \nbody or something. Even the early morning walk was some- \ntimes given over to an interviewer, usually firom abroad, or \nto a friend, come for a personal consultation. We talked of \nmany matters, of the past, of the present, and especially of the \nfuture. I remember how he surprised me with one of his ideas \nabout the foture of the Congress. I had imag^ed that the \nCongress, as such, would automatically cease to exist with the \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARtAL NEHRU \n\ncoming of freedom. He thought that the Congress should \ncontinue, hut on one condition : that it passed a self-denying \nordinance, laying it down that none of its members could \naccept a paid job under the State, and if any one wanted such \na post of authority in the State, he would have to leave the \nCongress. I do not at present remember how he worked this \nout, but the whole idea underlying it was that the Congress \nby its detachment and having no axe to grind, could exercise \ntremendous moral pressure on the Executive as well as other \ndepartments of the Government, and thus keep them on the \nright track. \n\nNow this is ait extraordinary idea which I find it difficult \nto grasp, and innumerable difficulties present themselves. It \nseems to me that such an assembly, if it could be conceived, \nwould be exploited by some vested interest. But practicality \napart, it does help one to understand a little the background of \nGandhiji\u2019s thought. It is the very opposite of the modern idea \nof a party which is built up to seize the State power in order \nto refashion the political and economic structure according to \ncertain pre-conceived ideas; or that kind of party, found often \nenough nowadays, whose function seems to be (to quote \nMr. R. H. Tawney) to offer the largest possible number of \ncarrots to the largest number of donkeys. \n\nGandhiji\u2019s conception of democracy is definitely a meta- \nphysical one. It has nothing to do with numbers or majority \nor representation in the ordinary sense. It is based on service \nand sacrifice, and it uses moral pressure. In a recent statement ^ \nhe defines a democrat. He claims to be \u2018a born democrat\u2019. \n\u201cI make that claim, if complete identification with the poorest \nof mankind, longing to live no better than they, and a cor- \nresponding conscious effort to approach that level to the best \nof one\u2019s ability, can entitle one to make it.\u201d He fiirther dis- \ncusses democracy: \n\n\u201cLet U recognise the fact that the Congress enjoys the \nprestige of a democratic character and influence not by the \nnumber of delegates and visitors it has drawn to its annual \nfunction, but by an ever-increasing amount of service it has \nrendered. Western democracy is on its trial, if it has not al- \nready proved a failure. May it be reserved to Indja to evolve \nthe true science of democracy by giving a visible demonstration \nof its success, \n\n\u201cCorruption and hypocrisy ought not to be the inevitable \nproducts of democracy, as they undoubtedly are to-day. Nor \n' Dated September , iq'. , \n\n\n\nTHE DELHI PACT \n\n\n \n\n\nis bulk a true test of democracy. True democracy is not in- \nconsistent with a few persons representing the spirit, the hope \nand the aspirations of those whom they claim to represent. \nI hold that democracy cannot be evolved by forcible methods. \nThe spirit of democracy cannot be imposed &om without; it \nhas to come from within.\u201d \n\nThis is certainly not Western democracy, as he himself says; \nbut, curiously enough, there is some similarity to the com- \nmunist conception of democracy, for that, too, has a meta- \nphysical touch. A few communists will claim to represent the \nreal needs and desires of the masses, even though the latter \nmay themselves be unaware of them. The mass will become \na metaphysical conception with them, and it is this that they \nclaim to represent. The similarity, however, is slight and does \nnot take us far; the differences in outlook and approach are far \ngreater, notably in regard to methods and force. \n\nWhether Gandhiji is a democrat or not, he does represent the \npeasant inasscs of India; he is the quintessence of the conscious \nand\u2019suhcbnsdous will of those millions. It is perhaps something \nmore than representation; for he is the idealised personification \nof those vast millions. Of course, he is not the average peasant. \nA man of the keenest intellect, of fine feeling and good taste, \nwide vision; very human, and yet essentially the ascetic who \nhas suppressed his passions and emotions, sublimated them \nand directed them in spiritual channels; a tremendous person- \nality, drawing people to himself like a magnet, and calling out \nfierce loyalties and attachments \u2014 all this so utterly unlike and \nbeyond a peasant. And yet withal he is the great peasant, with \na peasant\u2019s outlook on arairs, and with a peasant\u2019s blindness to \nsome aspects of life. But India is peasant India, and so he \nknows his India well and reacts to her lightest tremors, and \ngauges a situation accurately and almost instinctively, and has \na knack of acting at the psychological moment. \n\nWhat a problem and a puzzle he has been not only to the \nBritish Government but to his own people and his closest \nassociates! Perhaps in every other country he would be out of \nplace to-day, but India still seems to understand, or at least \nappreciate, the prophetic-religious type of man, talking of sin \nand salvation and non-violence. Indian mythology is full of \nstories of great ascetics, who, by the rigour of their sacrifices \nand .self-imposed penance, built up a \u2018 mountain of merit \u2019 which \nthreatened the dominion of some of the lesser gods and upset \nthe established order. > These myths have often come to my \nmind when I have watched the amazing energy and inner \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\npower of Gandhiji, coming out of some inexhaustible spiritual \nreservoir. He was obviously not of the world\u2019s ordinary coin- \nage; he was minted of a difterent and rare variety, and often \nthe ui^nown stared at us through his eyes. \n\nIndia, even urban India, even the new industrial India, had \nthe impress of the peasant upon her, and it was natural enough \nfor her to make this son of hers, so like her and yet so unlike, \nan idol and a beloved leader. He revived ancient and half- \nforgotten memories, and gave her glimpses of her own soul. \nCrushed in the dark misery of the present, she had tried to find \nrelief in helpless muttering and in vague dreams of the past \nand the future, but he came and gave hope to her mind and \nstrength to her much-battered body, and the future became \nan alluring vision. Two-faced like Janus, she looked both back- \nwards into the past and forward into the future, and tried to \ncombine the two. \n\nMany of us had cut adrift from this peasant outlook, and \nthe old ways of thought and custom and religion had become \nalien to us. We called ourselves moderns, and thought in terms \nof \u2018 progress \u2019, and industrialisation and a higher standard of \nliving and collectivisation. We considered the peasant\u2019s view- \npoint reactionary, and some, and a growing number, looked with \nfavour towards socialism and communism. How came we to \nassociate ourselves with Gandhiji political^, and to become, in \nmany instances, his devoted followers? The question is hard \nto answer, and to one who docs not know Gandhiji, no answer \nis likely to satisfy. Personality is an indefinable thing, a strange \nforce that has power over the souls of men, and he possesses \nthis in ample measure, and to all who come to him he often \napj^ears in a different aspect. He attracted people, but it was \nultimately intellectual conviction that brought them to him and \nkept them there. They did not agree with his philosophy of \nlife, or even with many of his ideals. Often they did not \nunderstand him. But the action that he proposed was some- \nthing tangible which could be understood and appreciated \ninteflectuaUj. Any action would have been welcome after the \nlong tradition of inaction which our spineless politics had \nnurtured; brave and effective action with an ethical halo about \nit had an irresistible appeal, botli to the intellect and the \nemotions. Step by step he convinced us of the rightness of the \n^.-action, and we went with him, although we did not accept his \nphilosophy. To divorce action from the thought underlying it \nwas not perhaps a proper procedure and was bound to lead to \nmental conflict and trouble later. Vaguely wc hoped that \n\n\n\nTHE DELHI PACT \n\n\n \n\nGandhiji, being essentially a man of action and very sensitive \nto changing conditions, would advance along the line that \nseemed to us to be right. And in any event the road he was \nfollowing was the right one thus far, and if the future meant \na parting it would be folly to anticipate it. \n\nAll this shows that we were by no means dear or certain in \nour minds. Always we had the feeling that while we might \nbe more logical, Gandhiji knew India far better than we did, \nand a man who could command such tremendous devotion and \nloyalty must have something in him that corresponded to the \nneeds and aspirations of the masses. If we could convince him, \nwe felt that we could also convert these masses. And it seemed \n\nK ossible to convince him for, in spite of his peasant outlook, \ne was the born rebel, a revolutionary out for big changes, \nwhom no fear of consequences could stop. \n\nHow he disciplined our lazy and demoralised people and \nmade them woA: \u2014 ^not by force or any material inducement, \nbut by a gentle look and a soft word and, above all, by personal \nexample! In the early days of Satyagraha in India, as long \nago as , I remember how Umar Sobani of Bombay called \nhim the 'beloved slave-driver*. Much had happened in the \ndozen years since then. Umar had not lived to see these \nchanges, but we who had been more fortunate looked back \nfrom those early months of  with joy and elation. Nine- \nteen-thirty had, indeed, been a wonder year for us, and Gandhiji \nseemed to have changed the face of our country with his magic \ntouch. No one was foolish enough to think that we had \ntriumphed finally over the British Government. Our feeling \nof elation had little to do with the Government. We were \nproud of our people, of our women folk, of our youth, of our \nchildren for the part they had played in the movement. It was \na spiritual gain, valuable at any time and to any people, but \ndoubly so to us, a subject and down-trodden people. And we \nwere anxious that nothing should happen to take this away \nfrom us, \n\nTo me, personally, Gandhiji had always shown extraordinary \nkindness and consideration, and my father's death had brought \nhim particularly near to me. He had always listened patiently \nto whatever I had to say, and had made every effort to meet my \nwishes. This had, indeed, led me to think that perhaps some \ncolleagues and I could influence him continuously in a socialist \ndirecdon, and he had himself said that he was prepared to go \nstep by step as he saw his way to do so. It se^ed to me almost \ninevitable then that he would accept the fundamental socialist \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLJiL NEHRU \n\nposition, ns I saw no other way out from the violence and in- \njustice and waste and misery of the existing order. He might \ndisagree about the methods but not about the ideal. So I \nthought then, but I realise now that there are basic differences \nbetween Gandhiji\u2019s ideals and the socialist objective. \n\nTo go back to Delhi in February , The Gandhi-Irwin \ntalks went on from time to time, and then they came to a \nsudden stop. For several days Gandhiji was not sent for by \nthe Viceroy, and it seemed to us that the break had come. The \nmembers of the Working Committee prepared to leave Delhi \nfor their respective provinces. Before leaving we conferred to- \ngether about our future plans and civil disobedience (which \nwas in theory still going on). We felt certain that as soon as \nthe break was defintely announced we would have no further \nopportunity of meeting and conferring together. We expected \narrest, and we had been told, and it seemed likely, that the \nGovernment would launch a fierce offensive against the Con- \ngress; something much fiercer than we had so far had. So we \nmet together at what we thought was our final meeting, and \nwe passed various resolutions to guide the movement in the \nfuture. One resolution had a certain significance. So far, the \npractice had been for each Acting-President to nominate his \nsuccessor in case of arrest, and also to fill by nomination the \nvacancies in the Working Committee. The substitute Working \nCommittees hardly functioned and had little authority to take \nthe initiative in any matter. They could only go to prison. \nThere was always a risk, however, that this continuous process \nof substitution might place the Congress in a false position. \nThere were obvious dangers to it. The Working Committee in- \nDelhi, therefore, decided that in future there should be no \nnominations of acting-Presidents or substitute members. So \nlong as any members (or member) of the original Committee \nwere out of gaol they would fimetion as the full Committee. \nWhen all of them were in prison, then there would be no \nCommittee functioning, but, we said rather grandiloquently, \nthe powers of the Working Committee would then vest in each \nman and woman in the country, and we called upon them to \ncarry on the struggle uncompromisingly. \n\nThis resolution was a brave lead for a continuance of the \nfight, and it left no loophole for compromise. It was also a \nrecognition of the fact that it was becoming increasingly dif- \nficult for our headquarters to keep in touch with all parts of \ncountry and to issue instructions regularly. This was \ninevitable, as most of our workers were well-known men and \n\n\n\nTH*; DELHI PACT \n\n\n \n\nwomen, and they worked openly. They could always be arrested. \nDuring  a secret courier service had been built up to carry \ninstructions, bring reports, and do inspection work. This \nworked well, and it demonstrated to us that we could organise \nsecret information work of this kind with great success. But \nto some extent it did not fit in with our open movement, and \nCandhiji was averse to it. In the absence of instructions from \nheadquarters we had to place the responsibility for carrying \non the work on local people, as otherwise they would simply \nwait helplessly for directions from above and do nothing. When \npossible, of course, instructions were sent. \n\nSo we passed this resolution and other resolutions (none of \nthem were published or became cfiective because of subsequent \nevents) and packed up to go. Just then another summons came \nfrom Lord Irwin, and the conversations were resumed. \n\nOn the night of the th of March we waited till midnight \nfor Gandhiji^ return from the Viceroy\u2019s house. He came back \nabout a a.m., and we were woken up and told that an agree- \nment had been reached. We saw the draft. I knew most of the \nclauses, for they had been often discussed, but, at the very top, \nclause a * with its reference to safeguards, etc., gave me a tre- \nmendous shock. I was wholly unprepared for it. I said nothing \nthen, and we all retired. \n\nThere was nothing more to be said. The thing had been \ndone, our leader had committed himself ; and even if we dis- \nagreed with him, what could we do? Throw him over? Break \nfrom him? Announce our disagreement? That might bring \nsome personal satisfaction to an individual, but it made no \ndifference to the final decision. The Civil Disobedience move- \nment was ended for the time being at least, and not even the \nWorking Committee could push it on now, when the Govern- \nment could declare that Mr. Gandhi had already agreed to a \nsettlement. I was perfectly willing, as were our other colleagues, \nto suspend civil disobedience and to come to a temporary settle- \n\n^ Clause a of the Delhi Settlement (dated March , ): \"As \nregards constitudonal questions, the scope of future discussion is \nstated, with the assent of His Majesty\u2019s Government, to be with \nthe object of considering further the scheme for the constitutional \nGovernment of India discussed at the Round Table Conference. Of \nthe scheme there outlined. Federation is an essential part; so also \nare Indian responsibility and reservations or safeguards in the in- \nterests of India, for such matters as, for instance, defence; external \naffairs; the position of minorities; the ISnandal credit of Ihdia, and \nthe discharge of . obligations.\" \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nment with the Government. It was not an easy matter for any \nof us to send our comrades back to gaol, or to be instrumental \nin keeping many thousands in prison who were already there. \nPrison is not a pleasant place to spend our days and nights, \nthough many Of us may train ourselves for it and talk light- \nheartedly of its crushing routine. Besides, three weeks or more \nof conversations between Gandhiji and Lord Irwin had led the \ncountry to expect that a settlement was coming, and a final \nbreak would have been a disappointment. So all of us in the \nWorl^g Committee were decidedly in favour of a provisional \nsettlement (for obviously it could be nothing more), provided \nthat thereby we did not surrender any vital position. \n\nSo far as I was concerned I was not very much concerned \nwith many of the pqints that had given rise to great argument. \nTwo matters interested me above all others. One was that our \nobjective of independence should in no way be toned down, \n.and the second was the effect of the settlement on our U.P. \nagrarian situation. Our no-tax or no-rent campaign- had so far \nbeen a great success, and in certain areas hardly any collections \nhad been made. The peasantry were in fine mettle, and world \nagricultural conditions and prices were worse than ever, making \nt difficult for them to pay. Out no-tax campai^ had been \nboth political and economic. If there was a provisional settle-, \nment with the Government, civil disobedience would be \u2018'with- \ndrawn and the political basis for the no-tax campaign would \ngo. But what of the economic side, of the terrible fall m prices, \nand of the inability of most of the peasants to pay anything \nlike the demand? Gandhiji had made this point quite clear to \nLord Irwin. He had stated that while the no-tax campaign \nwould be withdrawn, we could not advise the peasantry to pay \nbeyond their capacity. This matter could not be discussed in \ndetail with the Government of India as it was a provincial \nmatter. We were assured that the Provincial Government would \ngladly confer with us on the subject and would do everything \nin its power to relieve the distress of the peasantry. It was a \nvague assurance, but, under the circumstances, it was difficult \nto have anything more definite. This matter was thus, for the \ntime being, disposed of. \n\nThe other and vital question of our objective, of indepen- \ndence, remained. And now I saw in that Clause a of the settle- \nment that even this seemed to be jeopardised. Was it for this \nthat our people had behaved so gallantly ffir a year? Were all \nour. brave words and deeds to end in this? The independence \n'resolution of the Congress, the pledge of January a, so often \n\n\n\nTJtilS iJjiLjal PACT \n\n\n \n\nrepeated? So I lay and pondered on that March night, and in \nmy heart there was a great emptiness as of something precious \ngone, almost heyond recall. \n\n\" This is the way the world ends, \n\nNot with a bang, but a whimper.\u201d \n THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE \n\nIn a recent book an English journalist, who claims to have \nseen a great deal of Mr. Gandhi both in India and at the \nRound Table Conference in London, writes as follows ; \n\n\u201cThe leaders on board the Mooltan knew that there was a \nconspiracy against Mr. Gandhi within the Congress Working \nCommittee. They knew that, when the time was ripe. Congress \nmight expel him. But Congress, by expelling Mr. Gandhi, would \nexpel in all probability half its members; and that was the half \nSir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar wished to attach to the \nLiberal cause. They never disguised the fact that Mr. Gandhi \nwas, in their own words, \u2018muddle-headed\u2019. It was worth \nwinning a \u2018 muddle-headed \u2019 leader when he could bring with \nhim a million \u2018 muddle-headed \u2019 followers.\u201d * \n\nI do not know how far this quotation represents the views \nof Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Mr. Jayakar, or the other members of \nthe R.T.C. on their way to London in . But it does seem \nto me an astonishing thing that any person, journalist or \n'leader', with the least acquaintance with Indian politics, \ncould have made such a statement. I was astounded to read it; \nI had not heard of it previously even as a suggestion, though \nthat is not difficult to understand, as I have been in prison ffir \nmost of the time since then. \n\nWho were the conspirators and what were they after? It was \nsometimes stated that the President, Vallabhbhai Patel, and I \n\n^ From Glorney Bolton\u2019s The Tragedy of Gandhi. I have taken \nthis extract from a review of the book, as I have had no opportunity \nso far of reading the book itself. I hope that  am not doing an \ninjustice thereW to the author or to the persons mentioned in the \nquotation. . . . Since writing the above I have read the book. Many \nof the statements of Mr. Bolton and the inferences he draws are, to \nmy thinking, wholly unjustified. There are also a number of errors \nof fact, especially in re^d to what the Working Committee did or \ndid not do during the Delhi Pact negotiations and after. There is \nalso a curious assumption that Mr. \\^labhbhai Patel got the Con- \n\ng ess presidentship m , and thereby the leadership of the \nmgress, in rivalry with Mr. Gandhi. As a matter of fact, during \nthe last fifteen years Mr. Gandhi has been a far bigger person in the \nCongress (and, of course, in the country) than any Congress Presi- \n\n\n\nTHE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE  \n\nwere among the extremists of the Working Committee, and, \ntherefore, I suppose, we must have been numbered among the \nleaders of the conspiracy. Perhaps in the whole of India \nGandhiji has had no more loyal colleague than Vallabhbhai, a \nman strong and unbending in his work, and yet devoted to \nhim personally and to his ideals and policy. I could not claim \nto have accepted these ideals in the same way, but I had had \nthe privilege of working with Gandhiji in the closest associa- \ntion, and the idea of intriguing against him in any way is \na monstrous one. Indeed, that applied to the whole Working \nCommittee. That Committee was practically his creation; he \nhad nominated it, in consultation with a few colleagues, and \nthe election itself was a formal matter. The backbone of the \nCommittee consisted of members who had served on it for \nmany years and had come to be considered almost as per- \nmanent members. There were political dififerences amongst \nthem, differences in outlook and in temper; but years of associa- \ntion, the joint shouldering of burdens and the facing of com- \nmon perils, had welded them together. Between diem had \n\n\ndent could posably be. He has been the president-maker, and \ninvariably his suggestions have been followed. Repeatedly he refused \nto preside and preferred that some of his colleagues and lieutenants \nshould do so. I became president of the Congress entirely because \nof him. He had acmally been elected, but he withdrew and forced \nmy election. Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel\u2019s election was not normal. We \nhad just come out of prison, and the Congress Committees were sdll \nillegal bodies, and could not function in the ordinary way. The \nWorking Committee, therefore, took it upon itself to elect the Presi- \ndent of the Karachi Congress. The whole Committee, including \nMr. Vallabhbhai Patel, begged Mr. Gandhi to accept the president- \nship and thus to be the titular head, as he was the real head, of the \nCongress dunng the coming critical year. He would not agree, and \ninusted on Mr. Vallabhbhm Patd accepting it. I remember that it \nwas pointed out to him at the time that he wanted to be Mussolini \nall me time while others were made by him temporary kings and \nfigureheads. \n\nIt is not possible to deal with various other misapprehensions of \nMr. Bolton in a footnote. One somewhat personal matter I should, \nhowev\u00ab, like to refer to. He seems to be convinced that the turning- \npoint in my father\u2019s political career was his non-election by a \nEuropean dub, and that this led him not only to radical ways but \nto an avoidance of English sodety. This story, though often re- \n\nf eated, is wholly untrue. The real facts have litde importance, but \nam giving them here to dear up this mystery.- In his early days \nat the Bar, he became a favourite of Sir John Edge, who was then \n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nf rown Up firiendship and camaraderie and regard for each other. \n\n\u2019hey formed not a coalition but an organic unity, and it was \ninconceivable for any one to intrigue against the other. \nGandhiji dominated the Committee, and every one looked to \nhim for guidance. That had been so for many years; it was \neven more marked in  after the great success that had \nattended our struggle in . \n\nWhat could have been the purpose of the \u2018 extremists \u2019 in the \nWorking Committee to try to ^ expel\u2019 him? Perhaps it was \nthought that he was considered too compromising a person \nand was, therefore, an encumbrance. But without mm where \nwas the struggle, where was Civil Disobedience and Satyagraha? \nHe was part of the living movementr indeed, he was the move- \nment itself. So far as that struggle was concerned everything \ndepended on him. The nation^ struggle, of course, was not \nhis creation, nor did it depend on any individual; it had deeper \nroots. But that particular phase of the struggle, of which avil \ndisobedience was the symbol, was singularly dependent on \nhim. Parting with him meant winding up that movement and \nbuilding anew on &esh foimdations. That would have been a \ndifficult enough proposition at any time; in  it was im- \nthinkable for any one. \n\nIt is amusing to think how, according to some people, some of \n\nthe Chief Jusdce of the Allahabad High Court. Sir John suggested \nto him that he should join the Allahabad (European) Club, and \nwanted to propose his name himself. My father manked him for \nhis kindly suggesdon, but pointed out that there was bound to be \ntrouble, as many English people would object to him as an Indian \nand might vote against him. Any subaltern could bladtball him, \nand he would rather not offer himself for election under these cir- \ncumstances. Sir John even suggested that he would get the Brigadier- \nGeneral commanding the AQahabad area to second my mther's \nname. Ultimately, however, the matter dropped, and my father\u2019s \nname was not proposed, as he made it dear that he was not prepared \nto risk an insint. This inddent, far from embittering him against \nEnglish people, drew him to Sir John Edge, and most of his En ^sh \nfriendships and connections grew up in subsequent years. This \noccurred in the \u2019nineties, and it was nearly a quarter of a century \nlater that he became the radical poliddan and non-co-operator. The \nchange was not sudden, but the Punjab Martial Law hiuried up \nthe process, and Mr. Gandhi\u2019s influence at the right moment made \na difference. Even then he had no deliberate intention of giving up \nsocial contacts with Englishmen. But where Engjlishmen are largely \noffidals, non-co-operadon and dvil disobedience inevitably prevent \n\nistirh \n\n\n\nTHE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE  \n\nUS were conspiring to drive him out of the Congress in . \nWhy should we conspire when a gentle hint to him was \nsufficient? A mere suggestion from him that he would retire \nhas always been enough to upset the Working Committee as \nwell as the country. He was so much part of our struggle that \nthe very thought that he might leave us was unbearable. We \nhesitated to send him to London, because in his absence the \nburden in India would fall on us, and we did not welcome the \nprospect. We were so used to shifting it on to his shoulders. \nFor many of us, in the Working Committee and outside, the \nbonds that tied us to Gandhiji were such that even failure with \nhim seemed preferable to the winning of some temporary ad- \nvantage without him. \n\nWhether Gandhiji is \u2018 muddle-headed * or not we can leave to \nour Liberal friends to decide. It is undoubtedly true that his \npolitics are sometimes very metaphysical and difficult to imder- \nstand. But he had shown himself a man of action, a man of \nwonderful courage, and a man who could often deliver the \ngoods: and if ' muddle-hcadedness \u2019 yields such practical results \nperhaps it compares not unfavourably with the \u2018practical \n\n? olitics \u2019 that begin and end in the study and in select circles. \n\nrue, his millions of followers were \u2018muddle-headed\u2019. They \nknew nothing of politics and constitutions; they could think \nonly in terms of their human needs, of food and shelter and \nclothing and land. \n\nIt has always seemed to me very remarkable how eminent \nforeign journalists, trained in the observation of human nature, \ngo wrong in India. Is it because of the ineradicable impression \n\u2018of their childhood that the East is utterly difrerent and cannot \nbe judged by ordinary standards? Or is it, in the case of Eng- \nlishmen, the kink of empire that governs their vision and \ndistorts their view? They wiU believe almost anything, however \nunlikely it might be, without any surprise, for everything is \ndeemed to be possible in the mysterious East. They publish \nbooks sometimes containing able surveys and acute bits of \nobservation and, in between, amazing lapses. \n\nI remember reading, just on the eve of Gandhiji\u2019s departure \nfor Europe in , an article by a well-known Paris correspon- \ndent (at the time) of a London newspaper. The article was about \nIndia, and in the course of it he referred to an incident which, \naccording to him, took place in  during the non-co-operation \ndays when the Prince of Wales visited India. It was stated that \nin some place (probably it was Delhi) Mahatma Gandhi burst in \ndramatically and unannounced on the Prince, fell on his knees \nu \n\n\n\nago \u2018JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nclasped the Prince\u2019s feet and, weeping copiously, begged him to \ngive peace to this unhappy land. None of us, not even Gandhiji, \nhad heard of this remarkable story, and I wrote to the journalist \npointing this out to him. He expressed regret, but added that \nhe had got it from a reliable source. What astonished me was \nthat he should have given credence, without any attempt at \nan enquiry, to a story on the face of it highly improbable, and \nwhich no one who knew anything about Mr. Gandhi, the Con- \ngress, or India could believe. It is, unhappily, true that there \nare many Englishmen in India who, in spite of long residence, \nknow nothing about the country or about the Congress or about \nGandhiji. The story was an incredible and ridiculous one, com- \nparable perhaps to a fanciful account of the Archbishop \nof Canterbury suddenly\" bursting in upon Mussolini, stand- \ning on his head, and waving his legs in the air in token of \ngreeting. \n\nA recent report in a newspaper gives another type of \nstory. It is stated that Gandhiji has got huge funds, running \ninto millions of\" pounds, secretly deposited with friends, and \nthe Congress is after this money. It (the Congress) is afraid that \nif Ganmiiji retires from its membership it might lose these \nhoards. The story is on the face of it absurd, for he never keeps \nfunds personally or secretly, and whatever he has collected he \nhands over to a public organisation. He has the harm\u2019s instinct \nfor careful accounting, and all his collections are publicly \naudited. \n\nThis rumour is probably based on the sto^ of the famous \ncrore of rupees which were collected by the Congress in ipai. \nThis sum, which sounds big but was not much if spread out \nall over India, was utilised for national universities and schools, \npromotion of cottage industries and especially khaddar, un- \ntouchability work and a variety of other constructive schemes. \nMuch of it was tied up in ear-marked funds, which still exist, \nand are used for their special purposes. The rest of the col- \nlections were left with the local committees, and spent for \nCongress organisational and political work. The non-co- \noperation movement was financed by it, as weU as Congress \nwork for a few years after. We have been taught by Ganmiiji, \nas wdl as by the poverty of the country, to carry on our \npolitical movement with exceedingly limited means. Most of \nour work has been wholly voluntary, and where payment has \nbeen made ,it .has been on a starvation scale. The best of our \n\u2022workers; uilivetsity graduates with families to support, have been \npaid less than the unemployment allowance in England. I \n\n\n\nTHE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE Spi \n\ndoubt if any political or labour movement on a la^e scale \nhas been run anywhere with so little money as the Congress \nmovement during the last fifteen years. And all Congress \nfunds and accounts have been publicly audited from year to \nyear, no part of them being secret, except during the civil \ndisobedience periods, when the Congress was an illegal organisa- \ntion. \n\nGandhiji had gone to London as the sole representative of \nthe Congress to the Round Table Conference. We had decided, \nafter long debate, not to have additional representatives. Partly \nthis was due to our desire to have our best men in India at \na very critical time, when the most tactful handling of the \nsituation was necessary. We felt that, in spite of the R.T.C. \nmeeting in London, die centre of gravity lay in India, and \ndevelopments in India would inevitably have their reactions in \nLondon. We wanted to check xmtoward developments, and to \nkeep our organisation in proper condition. This was, however, \nnot the real reason for our sending only one representative. If \nwe had thought it necessary and advisable, we would certainly \nhave sent omers also. Deliberately we refrained ftom doing \nso. \n\nWe were not joining the Round Table Conference to talk \ninterminably about the petty details of a constitution. We \nwere not interested in those details at that stage, and they could \nonly be considered when some agreement on fundamental \nmatters had been arrived at with the British Government. The \nreal question was how much power was to be transferred to \na democratic India. Any solicitor almost could do the drafting \nand the settlemmt of details afterwards. The Congress position \nwas a fairly simple one on these basic matters, and there was \nno great room for argument over it. It seemed to us that the \ndignified course would be for one representative, and that one \nour leader, to go and explain that position, to show the essential \nreasonableness of it and the inevitability of it, and to try to \nwin over, if he could, the British Government to it. That was \nvery difBcult, we knew; hardly possible as matters stood then, \nbut then we had no other alternative. We could not give up \nthat position and our principles and ideals, to which we were \npledged and in which we firmly believed. If by a strange \nchance a basis of agreement was found on those fundamentals, \nthe rest followed easily enough. Indeed, it had been settled \nbetween us that, in case of sum an agreement, Gandhiji would \nimmediately summon to London some or even all the members \nof the Working Committee, so that we could then share the \n\n\n\napa JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwork of detailed negotiation. We were to keep ourselves in \nreadiness for that summons, and even. travel by air if necessary. \nWe could thus be with him within ten days of the call. \n\nBut if there was no initial agreement on fundamentals, then \nthe question of further and detailed negotiations did not arise, \nnor was it necessary for additional Congress representatives to \ngo to the R.T.C, So we decided to send Gandhiji only. One \nother member of the Working Committee, Mrs. Sarojini \nNaidu, also attended the R.T.C. , but she did not do so as a \nCongress representative. She was invited as a representative of \nIndian womanhood, and the Working Committee permitted \nher to go as such. \n\nThe British Government had, however, no intention of falling \nin with our wishes in the matter. Their policy was to postpone \nthe consideration of fundamental questions and to make the \nConference exhaust itself, more or less, on minor and immaterial \nmatters. Even when major matters were considered, the \nGovernment held its hand, refused to commit itself, and \n\nf )romised to express its opinion after mature consideration \nater on. Their trump card was, of course, the communal issue \nand they played it for all it was worth. It dominated the Con- \nference. \n\nThe great majority of the Indian members of the Conference \nfell in, most of them vdllingly, some unwillingly, with this \nofficial manoeuvring. They were a motley assembly. Few of \nthem represented any but themselves. Some were able and \nrespected; of many others this could not be said. As a whole \nthey represented, politically and socially, the most reactionary \nelements in India. So backward and reactionary were they that \nthe Indian Liberals, so very moderate and cautious in India, \nshone as progressives in their company. They represented \n\nf roups of vested interests in India who were tied up with \nritish i^erialism, and looked to it for advancement or pro- \ntection. The most prominent representation came from various \n' minority \u2019 and \u2018majority \u2019 groups on the communal issue. This \nconsisted of a number of upper-class irreconcilaliles who, it was \nnotorious, could never agree amongst themselves. PoUtically \nthey were thorough reactionaries, and their sole interest seemed \nto be to gain a communal advantage, even though that might \ninvolve a surrender of political advance. Indeed they pro- \nclaimed that they would not agree to having any greater \nmeasure of political freedom unless and \u25a0until their communal \ndemands were satisfied. That was an extraordinary sight, and \nit revealed with painful clarity the depths to which a subject \n\n\n\nTj ROVNU TABLE CONi-EKENCE \n\n\n \n\npeople could fall, and how they could be made pawns in the \nimperialist game. It was true that the Indian people could not \nbe said to be represented by that crowd of highnesses, lords, \nknights and others of high degree. The members of the Round \nTable Conference had been nominated by the British Govern- \nment, and, from its own point of view', the Government had \nchosen well. And yet the mere fact that the British authorities \ncould use and exploit us so, showed the weakness of our people, \nand the strange facility with which they could be side-tracked \nand made to undo each other\u2019s efforts. Our upper classes were \nstill wrapped up in the ideology of our imperialist rulers, and \nplayed their game. Was it because they did not see through \nit? Or did they, knowing its real significance, accept it \nknowingly because of their fear of democracy and freedom in \nIndia? \n\nIt was fitting that in this assembly of vested interests\u2014 im- \nperialist, feudal, financial, industrial, religious, communal \u2014 ^the \nleadership of the British Indian delegation should usually fall \nto the Aga Khan, who in his own person happened to combine \nan these interests in some degree. Closely associated as he has \nbeen with British imperialism and the British ruling class for \nover a generation, residing chiefly in England, he could \nthoroughly appreciate and represent our rulers\u2019 interests and \nview-point. He would have been an able representative of \nImperialist England at that Round Table Conference. The \nirony of it was that he was supposed to represent India. \n\nThe scales were terribly loaded against us at that Conference \nand, little as we expected from it, we watched its proceedii^s \nwith amazement and ever-growing disgust. We saw the pitiml \nand absurdly inadequate attempts to scratch the surface of \nnational and economic problems, the pacts and intrigues and \nmanceuvres, the joining of hands of some of our own country- \nmen with the most reactionary elements of the British Conser- \nvative Party, the endless talk over petty issues, the deliberate \nshelving of all that really mattered, the continuous playing into \nthe hands of the big vested interests and especially British \nimperialism, the mutual squabbles, varied by feasting and \nmutual admiration. It was ail jobbery-big jobs, little jobs, \njobs and seats for the Hindus, for the Muslims, for the Sikhs, \nfor the Anglo-Indians, for the Europeans; but all jobs for the \nupper classes, the masses had no look-in. Opportunism was \nrampant, and different groups seemed to prowl about like \nhungry wolves waiting for their prey\u2014 the spoils under the new \nconstitution. The very conception of freedom had taken the \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nform of large-scale jobbery \u2014 ' indianisation \u2019 it was called \u2014 more \njobs for Indians in the army, in the civil services, etc. No one \nthought in terms of independence, of real freedom, of a trans- \nfer of power to a democratic India, of the solution of any \nof the vital and urgent economic problems facing the Indian \npeople. Was it for this that India had struggled so manfully? \nMust we exchange this murky air for the rare atmosphere of \nfine idealism and sacrifice? \n\nIn that gilded and crowded hall Gandhiji sat, a very lonely \nfigure. His dress, or absence of it, distinguished him from all \nothers, but there was an even vaster difference between his \nthought and outlook and that of the well-dressed folk around \nhim. His was an extraordinarily difficult position in that Con- \nference, and we wondered from afar how he could tolerate it. \nBut with amazing patience he carried on, and made attempt \nafter attempt to find some basis of agreement. One charac- \nteristic gesture he made, which suddenly showed- up how com- \nmunalism really covered political reaction. He did not like \nmany of the communal demands put forward on behalf of the \nMuslim delegates to the Conference: he thought,' and his own \nMuslim Nationalist colleagues thought so, that some of these \ndemands were a bar to freedom and democracy. But still he \noffered to accept the whole lot of them, without question or \nargument, if the Muslim delegates there joined forces with him \nand the Congress on the political issue, that is, oh indepen- \ndence. \n\nThat offer was a personal offer because he could not, situ- \nated as he was, bind down the Congress. But he promised \nto urge Congress to agree to it, and no one who knew his \nposition in the Congress could doubt that he would succeed in \ngetting Congress approval. The offer, however, was not \naccepted, and indeed it is a little difficult to imagine the Aga \nKhan standing for Indian independence. This demonstrated \nthat the real trouble was not communal, although the com- \nmunal issue loomed large before the Conference. It was political \nreaction that barred all progress and sheltered itself behind \nthe communal issue. Bjr careful selection of its nominees for \nthe Conference, the British Government had collected these \nreactionary elements, and by controlling the procedure, they \nhad made the communal issue the major issue, and an. issue \non which no agreement was possible between the irreconcilables \ngathered there. \n\nThe British Government succeeded in its oideavour, and \nthereby demonstrated that it still has, not only the physical \n\n\n\nTHE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE  \n\nStrength to uphold its Empire, but also the cunning and state- \ncraft to carry on the imperial tradition for a while longer. The \npeople of India failed, although the Round Table Conference \nneither represented them nor was it a measure of their strength. \nThey failed because they had no ideological background of \nwhat they were striving for, and could be easily misled and \nside-tracked. They failed because they did not feel themselves \nstrong enough to discard the vested interests that encumbered \ntheir progress. They failed because of an excess of religiosity, \nand the ease with which communal feelings could be roused. \nThey failed, in short, because they were not advanced enough \nand strong enough to succeed. \n\nThere was no question of iailure or success at this Round \nTable Conference itself. Little was expected of it, and yet it \nmade a difference. The previous conference, the first of its \nkind, had attracted very little attention in India or elsewhere \nfor the Civil Disobedience movement absorbed attention. The \nnominees of the British Government who went to the Con- \nference of  often went to the accompaniment of black \nflags and imcomplimentary slogans. But in  all was \ndifferent, and it was different because Gandhiji went as the \nrepresentative of the Congress, and as a leader whom millions \nfollowed. This gave prestige to the Conference, and India fol- \nlowed its career with far greater interest; and any failure, what- \never the cause, redounded now to the discredit of India. We \nunderstood then why the British Government had attached so \nmuch importance to Gandhiji\u2019s participation in it. \n\nThe Conference itself, with all its scheming and opportunism \nand futile meandering, was no feilure for India. It vras consti- \ntuted so as to fail, and the people of India could hardly be \nmade responsible for its failing. But it succeeded in diverting \nworld attention ftom real issues in India, and, in India itself \nit produced disillusion and depression and a sense of humi- \nliation. It gave a' handle to reactionary forces to raise their \nheads again. \n\nSuccess or failure was to come to the people of the country \nby events in India itself. The powerful nationalist movement \ncould not fade away, because of distant manoeuvring in \nLondon. Nationalism represented a real and immediate need \nof the middle classes and peasantry, and by its means they \nsought to solve their problems. Ihe movement could thus \neither succeed, fulfil its function, and give place to some other \nmovement, which would carry the people further on the road \nto progress and fireedom, or else it could be forcibly suppressed \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nfor rlie rime being. That struggle was to come in India \nsoon after, and was to result in temporary disablement. The \nsecond Round Table Conference could not affect this struggle \nmuch, but it did create an atmosphere somewhat unfavourable \n\n\n AGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE \nUNITED PROVINCES \n\nAs one of the General Secretaries of the Congress and a mem- \nber of the Working Committee, I was in touch with All-India \npolitics and occasionally had to do some touring also, though \nI avoided this as far as possible. As our burdens and respon- \nsibilities grew, the meetings of the Working Committee became \nlonger and longer, till they developed into a regular sessions of \ntwo weeks at a time, It was no longer a question of merely \npassing resolutions of criticism, but of controlling numerous \ndifferent kinds of constructive activities of a vast and many- \nsided organisation, and of tackling, from day to day, difficult \nproblems on whose handling depended conflict or otherwise \non a nation-wide scale. \n\nMy chief activities, however, lay in the United Provinces \nwhere the agrarian situation absorbed Congress attention. The \nU.P. Provincial Congress Committee consisted of over a \nhundred and fifty members, and met every two or three \nmonths. Its Executive Council, consisting of about fifteen \nmembers, met frequently and was in charge of its agrarian \ndepartment. \n\nIn the second half of the year , a special Agrarian Com- \nmittee was appointed by this Coimcil. It is interesting to find \nthat several zamindars were prominently associated with the \nCouncil and this Committee throughout, and all steps were \ntaken with their approval. Indeed, the President of our Pro- \nvincial Committee for the year (and consequently the ex-officio \nhead of the Executive Council and the Agrarian Committee) was \nTasadduq Ahmad Khan Sherwani, who belong to a well-known \nzamindari family. The General Secretary, Sri Prakasa, as well \nas several leading members of the Council were also zamiridars, \nor were members of zamindari families. The remaining mem- \nbers were middle-class professional people. There was not a \nsingle tenant or poor peasant representative in our provincial \nexecutive. Peasants were to be found in our District Com- \nmittees, but they seldom sxywived the various elections which \nultimately resulted in the formation of the Executive Council \nfor the province, which was a body entirely dominated by the \nmiddle-class intelligentsia with a strong zamindari leaven in it. \n\n* \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nIt was thus far from being an extreme body in any sense of the \nword, and certainly not so on the agrarian issue. \n\nMy own position in the province was that of a member of \nthe Executive Council and its Agrarian Committee, and \nnothing more. I took a prominent part in our consultations \nand our other work, but in no sense did I take the leading \npart. Indeed no one can be said to have played the leading \npart in our province, as we had long accustomed ourselves to \ncorporate and joint action, stress being always laid on the \norganisation and not on the individual. The president for the \nyear was our temporary head, and represented us, but even he \nhad no special authority. \n\nI also functioned locally as a member of the Allahabad \nDistrict Congress Committee. This Committee, under the \nleadership of its president, Purushottan Das Tandon, played an \nimportant part in the development of the agrarian situation. \nIn  it had given the lead in starting the no-tax campaign \nin the province. This was not because Allahabad district was \nthe area affected most by the agricultural depression; the \nTaluqadari districts of Oudh were much worse 'off. But Alla- \nhabad district was better organised and more politically con- \nscious, because Allahabad city was a centre of political activity \nand many prominent workers were frequently visiting the sur- \nrounding villages. \n\nImmediately after the Delhi Pact of March , we had \nhastened to send workers and notices to the rural areas, inform- \ning the peasantry that civil disobediepce and the movement \nwere off. On political grounds there was no bar to their pay- \nment of rent, and we advised them to pay. But we added that \nin view of the tremendous fall in prices we were of opinion that \nbig remissions should be given to them, and we proposed that \nwe should jointly try to obtain these. Even in normal times the \nrent was often an almost unbearable burden; with the slump \nin prices it was im|)ossible to make full payment or even any- \nthing approaching it. We held conferences with representatives \nof the peasantry and, as a tentative proposal, suggested a \ngeneral remission of fifty per cent., and in some cases more \nman that. \n\nWe tried to separate the agrarian issue entirely from the \ngeneral question of civil disobedience. We wanted, at any rate \nm , to consider it from the eeonomic plane only, divorced \nfrom the political. This was difficult, as the two were anyhow \nintimate^ connected, and in the past had been closely asso- \nciated. We, as a Congress organisation, were also definitely \n\n\n\nAGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE UNITED PROVINCES gg \n\npolitical. For the moment we tried to function as a kind of \npeasants' Union (with non-peasants and even zamindars in con- \ntroll) but we could not and did not desire to give up our \npolitical character, and the Government looked upon everything \nwe did as political. The shadow of future civil disobedience \nalso lay ahead of us, and if this materialised there could be \nno doubt that economics and politics would march together, \nhand in hand. \n\nIn spite of all these obvious hindrances, it was our effort \nthroughout, fi:om the time of the Delhi Pact onwards, to keep \nthe agrarian question apart from the political struggle. The \nreal reason for this was mat the Delhi Pact did not put an end \nto it, and we wanted to make this perfectly clear to the Govern- \nment as well as the people. In the course of the Delhi con- \nversations, Gandhiji had, I believe, assured Lord Irwin that \neven if he did not go to the Round Table Conference he would \nnot resume civil disobedience while the Conference was sitting. \nHe would ask the Congress to give the Conference every chance, \nand to a'wait its result. But even then Gandhiji made it clear \nthat this assurance did not apply to any local economic struggle \nthat might be forced on us. The U.P. agrarian situation was \nbefore us all then, because organised action had been taken in \nthe U.P.; as a matter of fact the peasantry all over India had \nbeen similarljr affected. During Ae Simla talks Gandhiji re- \npeated this point, and mention was made of it in the published \ncorrespondence.^ On the very eve of sailing for Europe, he \n\n\n^ The following letters were integral parts of the Simla Agree- \nment of August ,  : \n\n\nMr, Gandhi to Mr. \nGovernment of India. \n\n\nEmerson, Secretary, Home Department, \nSimla, \n\nAugust , . \n\n\n\u201c Dear Mr. JSmerson, \n\n\" I have to acknowledge with thanks your letter of even date, \nenclosing a new , draft. Sir Cowasji has also communicated to me \nthe amendments suggested by you. My colleagues and I have care- \nfully considered the amended draft, which we are prepared to \naccept, subject to the following remarks : \n\n\u201cIn paragraph , it is not possible for me on behalf of the \nCongress to subscribe to the position taken up by the Government, \nFor we feel that where, in the opinion of the Congress, a grievance \narising out of the working of me Setdeifient is not redressed, an \ninquiry is a necessity of the case, because of the fact that rivil \ndisobedience remains under suspension during the pendency of the \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nmade it clear that, quite apart from the Round Table Confer- \nence and the political issues, it might be necessary for \n\u2022the Congress to protect the people\u2019s, and especially the \npeasantry\u2019s, rights in economic struggles. He had no desire to \n\n\nDelhi Pact. But if the Government of India and Local Govern- \nments are not prepared to grant an inquiry, my colleagues and I \nhave no objection to the clause remaining. The result will be that, \nwhilst the Congress will not press for an inquiry in regard to \u2018 the \nother matters hitherto raised* on its behalf, if unfortunately any \ngrievance is so acutely felt that it becomes the paramount duty \nof the Congress to seek some method of relief, in the absence of \nan inquiry, in the shape of defensive riirect action, the Congress \nshould be held free to adopt such remedy, notwithstanding the \nsuspension of dvil disobedience. \n\n\u201cI need hardly assure the Government that it would be the \nconstant endeavour of the Congress to avoid direct action and to \ngain relief by discussion, persuasion, and the like. The statement \nof the Congress position given here has become necessary in order \nto avoid any possible misunderatandhig in the future or a charge \nof breach of faith on the part of the Congress. In the event of a \nsuccessful issue to the present discussions, I assume that the \ncommunique, this letter, and your reply would be simultaneously \npublished. \n\n\" Yours sincerely, \n\n\" M. K. Gandhi.\u201d \n\nMr, Emerson to Mr. Gandhi. \n\nSimla, \n\nAugust , . \n\n\" Dear Mr. Gandhi, \n\n\" I write to thank you for your letter of to-day\u2019s date, in which \nyou accept the draft communique, subject to the observations con- \ntained in your letter. The Govemor-General-in-Coundl has noted \nthat it is not the intention of the Congress to press for any inquiry \ninto those matters hitherto raised by them, but that while you give \nan assurance that it will be the constant endeavour of the Congress \nto avoid direct action, and to gain relief by discussion, persuasion, \nand the like, you wish to make dear the position of the Congress \nin regard to any future action that they may decide to take. I am \nto say that the Governor-General-in-Coundl shares your hope that \nno resort to direct action will be taken. In regard to the general \nposition of Government, I am to refer you to the letter of His \nExcellency the Viceroy dated August  to your address. I am to \nsay that the communique, your letter of to-day\u2019s date, and this \nreply \u25a0will be published simultaneously by Government. \n\n\u201c Yours sincerely, \n\n\u00abH. W Pm- --on\u201d \n\n\n\nAGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE UNITED PROVINCES OI \n\nindulge in such a struggle; he wanted to avoid it; but, if it \nbecame inevitable, it must be undertaken. We could not desert \nthe masses. His point was that the Delhi Pact, which applied \nto general and political civil disobedience, did not bar this. \n\nI mention this because the charge has been repeatedly brought \nagainst the U.P. Provincial Congress Committee and its leaders \nthat they broke the Delhi Pact by re-starting a no-tax campaign. \nConveniently for its makers, this charge was brought when \nthose who were charged and could have answered it were all \nlocked up in gaol and every newspaper and press was strictly \ncensored. Quite apart from the tact that the U.P. Committee \nnever started a no-tax campaign in , the point which I wish \nto make clear is that even such a campaign for an economic \npurpose, and apart firom civil disobedience, would have been \nno breach of the Delhi Pact. Whether it was justified or not \non the merits was another matter; but the peasantry were as \nmuch entitled to start it as the workers of a factory are to strike \nfor an economic grievance. This was our posidon throughout \nfrom Delhi to Simla, and it was not only understood but appre- \nciated by the Government. \n\nThe agricultural slump of  and onwards came as a climax \nto a steadily worsening situadon. For many years past world \nagricultural prices had tended to go up, and Indian agriculture, \ntacked on to the world market, had shared in this tendency. \nThe disproportion in the development of industry and agricul- \nture aU over the world had everywhere sent up agricultural \nprices. As these prices went up in India, the Government \nrevenue and the landlord\u2019s rent went up also, so that the actual \ncultivator hardly profited by this upward tendency. On the \nwhole, the peasantry, except in some favoured areas, deterio- \nrated. In the United Provinces rent went up much faster than \nrevenue, the proportion of relative increase of these two during \nthe first thirty years of this century being nearly (to quote \nfirom memory) five to one. Thus while the Government\u2019s \nincome from land increased substantially, the landlord\u2019s income \nincreased far more, and the tenant remained, as ever, at starva- \ntion level. Even where prices fell or there were local natural \ncalamities\u2014 drought, floods, locusts, haU, etc. \u2014 ^the rent and \nrevenue remained at the original figures, some remissions being \ngranted very hesitatingly, for the season only. The level of the \nrents was at the best of times much too high; at other times it \nbecame xmbearable without recourse to the money-lender. Agri- \ncultural .debt grew. \n\nAll the agncultural classes\u2014 landlords, peasant proprietors, \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ntenants \u2014 ^became the victims of the money-lender, who fulfilled, \nunder existing conditions, an indispensable function in the \nprimitive village economy. He exploited that function very \nmuch to his own advantage, and his stranglehold grew on the \nland and those connected with it. There were few checks on \nhim. The law helped him, and he stuck to the letter of his \nbond and claimed, and received, his pound of flesh. Gradually \nland passed to him both from many of the smaller landlords \nand the peasant proprietors, and the money-lender blossomed \nout himself as a proprietor of land on a large scale, a big \nzamindar, one of the landed gentry. The peasant proprietor, \nwho had so far cultivated his own land, now became almost a \nserf of the bania-zamindar or sahukar. The tenant\u2019s position \nwas even worse. He was also a sahukar^s serf or he joined the \nincreasing army of the dispossessed landless proletariat. The \nfinancier or banker who thus developed into a landowner had \nno living contacts with the soil or the tenantry. He was usually \na city dweller, where he carried on his banking business, and he \ndelegated the collection of rent to agents who did the work \nwith the callousness and inhumanity of machines. \n\nThe progressive growth of agricultural indebtedness was in \nitself evidence of the unsoundness and instability of the land \nsystem. The vast majority of the population had no reserves \nof any kind, physical or material, no power of resistance, and \nlived on the verge of starvation. They could not stand any \nunusual occurrence of an unfavourable character. An epidemic \nwould sweep away millions. In  and  it was estimated \nby the officially-appointed Provincial BanMng Inquiry Com- \nmittee that the agricultural indebtedness of India (including \nBurma) was  crores of rupees. This figure included the debts \nof landlords, peasant proprietors and tenants, but it was mainly \nthe debt of actual cultivators. Government currency policy has \nentirely favoured the creditor classes, and this has added to the \nheavy burden of the debt. Thus the fixing of the rupee ratio \nat one shilling and sixpence, instead of sixteen pence, in spite \nof vehement Indian opposition, meant increasing the agricultural \ndebt by  j  per cent., or by about  crores.^ \n\n* The figure of  crores for \u2019the agricultural indebtedness of \nIndia is probably a gross under-estimate, and, in any event, it must \nhave gone up considerably during the last four or five years. The \nPunjab part of the figure, estimated by the Punjab Provincial Bank- \ning Inquiry Committee in , was , crores. The report of the \nSelect Committee on the Punjab Relief from Indebtedness Bill \n(presented in October ) states that \u201cthe debt burden of the \n\n\n\nAGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE UNITED PROVINCES  \n\nAfter the post-war spurt in prices there was a gradual but \ncontinuing decline, and agrarian conditions worsened. On top \nof this came the catastrophe of  and after. \n\nOur contention in the United Provinces in  was that rents \nshould correspond with prices; that is to say, that rent should \nbe reduced to a figure which prevailed in the past when prices \nwere as low as in . Approximately this was so thirty years \nearlier, about . This was a rough test and its application \nwas not easy as there were many classes of tenants \u2014 occupancy, \nnon-occupancy, sub-tenants, etc. \u2014 and the worst sufferers were \nthe lowest grade of tenants. The only other test\u2014 and this was \nundoubtedly the fairest\u2014 was to find out the capacity of the \ntenant to pay after making allowances for his cost of produc- \ntion and living wage. But according to this latter test, however \nlow the living expenses are kept, a very large number of hold- \nings in India become wholly uneconomic, and, as we showed \nby some instances in the U.P. in , many could not pay any \nrent at aU without selling property (if there was any to be sold) \nor borrowing money at a high rate of interest. \n\nOur U.P. Congress Committee\u2019s first and tentative proposal \nwas a general remission of  per cent, for all occupancy tenants \nand a higher percentage for ^e other tenants who were worse \noff. When Gandhi ji came to the U.P. in May  and visited \nthe Governor, Sir Malcolm Hailey, there was some difference \nof opinion between them and they could not agree. Soon \nafterwards he (Gandhiji) issued appeals to the zamindars and \ntenants of the U.P. In the latter appeal he asked the tenants \nto pay as much as they could and suggested some figure, which\u2019 \nwas a somewhat higher figure than the one we had previously \n\nf iven. Our Provincial Committee accepted Gandhiji\u2019s figure, \nut that did not help matters much, as Government would not \nagree to it. \n\nThe Provindal Government was in a difficult position. The \nland tax was its chief source of income, and it could not permit \nthis to vanish away or reduce it very greatly without facing \nbankruptcy. On the other hand, it had a wholesome. fear of \nan agrarian upheaval and wanted to soothe the tenantry, as ftir \n\n\nagriculturists is stupendous, being modestly estimated at Rs.aoo \ncrores.\u201d This new figure is almost  per cent, in excess of the \nBanking Inquiry Committee\u2019s estimate. If tiiis rate of increare \nholds good for the other provinces also, the present () all-India \nfigure for agricultural indebtedness should be over  crores of \nrupees (a crore=>ten Bullions). \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nas it could, by substantial rent remissions. It was not easy to \nhave it both w^s. Between the State and the cultivator stood \nthe zamindar, from the economic point of view a useless and \nunnecessary addition, and it might have been possible to pro- \ntect and help both the State and the cultivator at his expense. \nBut the British Government, constituted as it is, could not for \npolitical reasons alienate one of the few classes which clung on \nto it. \n\nAt last the Provincial Government announced the remissions \nboth for the landlords and the tenants, These were based on \nsome complicated system, and it was not easy at first to make \nout what they were. It was clear, however, that they were far \nfirom enough. Besides, they related to the current demand and \nsaid nothing at all about the arrears due from the tenant or his \ndebts. It was obvious that if the tenant was not in a position to \npay the rent for the current half-year, much less could he pay \narrears for past years or old debts. As a rule, it was the land- \nlord\u2019s custom to credit all realisations to past arrears. This pro- \ncedure was dangerous from the tenant\u2019s point, of view, for he \ncould always be proceeded against and dispossessed of his land \non the ground of non-payment of some part of the amount due \nfrom him. \n\nThe Provincial Congress Executive was put in an extraordi- \nnarily difficult position. We were convinced that the tenants \nwere being treated very unfeirly and yet we were helpless in \nthe matter. We did not want to take the responsibility of advis- \ning the tenants not to pay. We went on repeating that they \nshould pay as much as they could and generally sympathising \nwith them in their misfortunes and trying to hearten them. We \nagreed with them that the demand, even after the remissions, \nwas too much for them. \n\nThe machinery of coercion, legal as well as illegal, began to \nmove. Ejectment suits brought against thousands, attachments \nof cows, bullocks, personal property, beatings by agents of \nlandlords. Large numbers of tenants paid part of the demand; \naccording to them, this was as much as they could pay then. \nVery probably in some instances they could have paid more, \nbut it was quite obvious that for the great majority this was a \nheavy burden. These part payments did not save them. The \nsteam-roller of the law went on advancing, pitilessly crushing \naU that came in its way. Ejectment suits were decreed, even \nthough part payment had taken place; attachments and sale of \ncattle and personal property continued. The tenants could not \nhave been worse off if they had not paid at all. Indeed, they \n\n\n\nAGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE UNITED PROVINCES  \n\nwould have been slightly better off, for they would have saved \nthat much money at least. \n\nThey came to us in large numbers, complaining bitterly, tell- \ning us that they had followed our advice and paid what they \ncould, and this was the consequence. In Allahabad district \nalone many thousands had been dispossessed, and some pro- \nceeding or other had been launched against many thousands of \nothers. The District Congress Committee office was surrounded \nall day by a distraught crowd. My own house was equally be- \nsieged, and often I felt like running away and hiding myself \nsomewhere, anywhere, to escape this dreadful predicament. \nMany tenants who came to us bore marks of injury, said to \nhave been inflicted by aamindars\u2019 agents. We had them treated \nin hospital. What could they do? What could we do? We sent \nlong letters to the U.P. Government. Our Committee had ap- \npointed Govind BaUabh Pant as our liaison officer to keep in \ntouch with the Provincial Government at Naini Tal or Luck- \nnow. He was constantly writing to the Government. Our pro- \nvincial President, Tasadduq A. K. Sherwani, also wrote ftom \ntime to time, and so did . \n\nAnother c^culty arose with the ^proach of the monsoon \nin June-July. That was the tilling an<i sowing season. Were the \ntenants, who had been dispossessed, to sit idle and watch their \nland lie fallow in front of them? This was very difficult for a \npeasant; it went against the grain. The dispossession in many \ncases was legal and technical and not an actual moving away. \nA court decree had been passed and nothing else had been \ndone. Or were they to plough the land and thereby commit an \noffence of criminal trespass, perhaps leading to a petty riot? To \nwatch others till their old land was also very difficult for the \npeasants to tolerate. They came to us for advice. What advice \ncould we give? \n\nI put this difficulty to a high official in the Government of \nIndia, when I visited Simla with Gandhiji during that summer, \nand I asked him what advice he would give if he was in our \nposition. His answer was a revealing one. He said that if a \npeasant who had been dispossessed asked him this question he \nwould simply refuse to answer him! Even he was' not prepared \nto tell the peasant straight off not to till his land, although he \nhad been legally dispossessed. It was easy for hint, sitting on \nthe Simla heights, to pass orders on files as if he was dealing \nwith an abtract problem in mathematics. He, or the provincim \nbosses at Naini Tal, were not brought into touch with the \nhuman factor, nor did they see the human misery involved. \n\n\n\no jaavaharlal nemrv \n\nWe were also told at Simla that we should give only one \nadvice to the peasantry : that they should pay the lull demand \nor as much as they could. We should in fact act almost as the \nagents of the landlords. As a matter of fact we had said some- \nthing like it when we asked them to pay as much as they \ncould. We had added no doubt that they should not sell up \ntheir cattle or incur additional debt. And we had seen the \nresult. \n\nIt was a terrible summer for all of us, and the strain of it \nwas great. The Indian peasant has an amazing capacity to bear \nmisfortune, and he has always had more than his share of it \u2014 \nfamine, flood, disease, and continuous grinding poverty\u2014 and \nwhen he could endure it no longer, he would quietly and almost \nuncomplainingly lie down in his thousands or millions and die. \nThat was his way of escape. Nothii^ happened in  to \ncompare with the periodical great misrortunes that had visited \nhim. But, somehow, the events of  did not seem to him \npart of Nature\u2019s inscrutable plans, and, therefore, to be patiently \nendured; they were the work of man, he thought, and so he \nresented them. His new political education was bearing fruit. \nFor us, too, these happenings of  were especially painful \nbecause we held ourselves partly responsible for them. Had not \nthe peasants largely followed our advice in the matter? And \nyet I am quite convmced that, but for our constant help, the con- \ndition of the peasantry would have been far worse. We held \nthem together and they remained a force to be reckoned with, \nand because of this they obtained greater remissions than they \notherwise would have done. Even the coercion and ill-treatment \nto which they were subjected, bad as it was, was not unusual for \nthese unhappy people. The ^fference was partly one of degree \n(as there was much more of it now) and partly a question of \npublicity. Ordinarily, ill-treatment and even torture of a tenant \nby a zamindar\u2019s agent in a village is almost taken for granted, \nand few persons outside that area hear of it, unless the victim \ndies. It was difierent now because of our organisation and the \nnew consciousness of the peasantry which made them hang \ntogether and report aU mishaps to the Congress- offices. \n\nAs the summer advanced, the attempts at forcible collections \ntoned down and coercive proceedings lessened. What troubled \nus now was the question of the great number of the ejected \ntenants. What was to be done to them? We were pressing the \nGovernment to help them to get back their holdings, whidi, in \nthe majority of cases, were lying vacant. More important still \nwas the question of ^e future. The remissions that had been \n\n\n\nAGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE UNITED PROVINCES  \n\nSO far granted were for the. past season only, and nothing had \nyet been decided about the future. From October onwards the \nseason for the next collections would begin. What would \nhappen then? Would we have to go through the same terrible \nround again? The Provincial Government appointed a small \ncommittee, consisting of its own officials and some zamindar \nmembers of the local Council, to consider this. There tvas no \nrepresentative of the peasantry on it. At the last moment, when \nthe Committee had actually begun its work, Govind Ballabh \nPant was asked by Government to join it on our behalf. He did \nnot think it worth while to join at that late stage, when impor- \ntant decisions had already been made. \n\nThe U.P. Provincial Congress Committee had also appointed \na small committee to collect various agrarian data, past and \npresent, and to report on the existing situation. This committee \nsubmitted a long report containing an able survey of agrarian \nconditions in the U.P. and an analysis of the havoc caused by \nthe agricultural slump in prices. Their recommendations were \nfar-reaching. The report, which was published in book form, \nwas signed Govind Ballabh Pant, Rafi Ahmad Kidwai, and \nVenkatesh Narayan Tewary. \n\nLong before this report came out, Gandhiji had gone to \nLondon for the Round Table Conference. He had gone with \n\ng reat hesitation, and one of the reasons for this hesitation was \nle U.P. agrarian situation. He had in fact almost decided that, \nin the event of not going to London for the Round Table \nConference, he would come to the U.P, and devote himself to \nthis complex problem. The last Simla conversations with the \nGovernment dealt, inter alia, with the UJP. After his departure \nfor England we kept him folly informed of developments. I \nused to write to him, during the first month or two, every week \nboth by tile air mail and the ordinary mail. During the latter \npart of his stay I was not so regular, as we expected him to \nreturn soon. He had given us to understand that, at the very \nlatest, he would be back within three months, tiiat is, some \ntime in November, and we had hoped that no crisis would arise \nin India till then. Above all, we wanted to avoid crises and \nconflicts with Government in his absence. When, however, his \nreturn was delayed and the agrarian situation began to develop \nrapidly, we sent him a long cablegram informing him of the \nlatest develtmments and pointing out to him how our hands \nwere being forced. He replied by cable that he was helpless in \nthe matter and could not do anything for us then, and told us \nto go ahead according to our lights. \n\n\n\no jawaharlal nehru \n\nThe Working Committee was also kept fully informed by the \nProvincial Congress Executive. I was always there to give them \nfirst-hand information, but, as matters were taking a serious \nturn, the Committee also conferred with our Provincial Presi- \ndent, Tasadduq Sherwani, and the Allahabad District President, \nPurushottam Das Tandon. \n\nThe Government Agrarian Committee issued its report and \nmade certain recommendations, which were both complicated \nand vague, and left a great deal to local officers. On the whole, \nthe proposed remissions were bigger than in the past season, but \nwe felt that they were not enough. We objected to the prin- \nciples underlying the recommendations as well as to their appli- \ncation. Also, the report dealt with the future only and ignored \npast arrears, debt, and the question of the large number of dis- \npossessed tenants. What were we to do? Just advise the \npeasantry to pay as much as they could, as we had done in the \nspring and summer, and face the same consequences? That \nadvice, we had seen, was the most foolish of all and could not \nbe repeated. Either the peasants should make a great effort and \npay the revised demand in fuU, if they could at all do so, or \nthey should not pay at all for the present and await develop- \nments. To pay part of the rent demanded was neither here nor \nthere; the tenants exhausted their financial resources and, at \nthe same time, lost their land. \n\nOur Provincial Congress Executive considered the position \nlong and earnestly and decided that the Government proposals \nwere not fevourable enough to be accepted as they were, al- \nthough they were an improvement on the summer\u2019s remissions. \nThere was still a possibility of their being varied to the \npeasantry\u2019s advantage, and we pressed Government accordingly. \nBut we felt that there was little hope, and the conflict we had \ntried to avoid seemed to approach with some rapidity. The \nattitude of the Provincial Government as well as the Govern- \nment of India towards the Congress organisation had been pro- \ngressively changing and becoming more frigid. To our loi^ \nletters we received brief replies referring us to local officials, fi \nwas obvious that the pohcy of Government was not to en- \ncourage us in any way. One grievance and difficulty of the \nGovernment was the possibility of Congress prestige going up \nbecause of the grant of remissions to the peasantry. Through \nlong habit, it could only think in terms of prestige, and the idea \nthat the masses might give the credit for the remissions to the \nCongress irritated it, and it wanted to avoid this as fer as pos- \nsihlft \n\n\n\nAGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE UNITED PROVINCES  \n\nMeanwhile, reports were coming to us from Delhi and else- \nwhere that the Government of India were on the point of \nlaunching a big offensive against the whole Congress movement. \nThe little finger was going to function more vigorously now \nand the scorpions were going to chastise us. We even received \nmany details of the proposed action. Some time in November, \nI think. Dr. Ansari sent me (as well as separately to Vallabhbhai \nPatel, the Congress President) a message confirming many of \nthe previous reports received by us, and especially giving details \nof the proposed ordinances for the Frontier and the United \nProvinces. Bengal had, I believe, already received the gift of a \nnew ordinance or, perhaps, was about to receive it. Dr. Ansari\u2019s \nmessage was amply confirmed even in its details many weeks \nlater, when the new ordinances appeared as if to meet a \nnew situation. It was generally supposed that Government \nhad delayed action because of the unforeseen prolongation of \nthe Round Table Conference. They wished to avoid whole- \nsale repression in India while the members of the Round \nTable Conference whispered sweet nothings into each other's \nears. \n\nSo tension grew, and aU of us had a feeling that events were \nmarching ahead despite our little selves, ana none could stop \nthem from their predestined course. All we could do was to \nprepare ourselves to face them and to play our parts, individu- \ndly and together, in the drama \u2014 ^more likely the tragedy \u2014 of \nlife. But we hoped still that Gandhiji would be back before the \ncurtain went up on this clash of forces, and would take the \nresponsibility on his shoulders for peace or war. None of us \nwas prepared to shoulder that burden in his absence. \n\nIn the United Provinces, the Government took another step \nwhich produced a commotion in the rural areas. Remission \nslips were distributed to the tenants, stating how much remis- \nsion had been allowed, and containing a threat that unless the \namount now due was paid up within a month (sometimes the \nperiod mentioned was shorter), the remission would be cancelled \nand the full sum realised by legal process, which meant eject- \nment, attachment of property, etc. In normal years the tenants \nusually paid up iheir rent in instalments in the course of two \nor three months. Even this usual period was thus, not allowed. \nThe whole countryside was suddenly friced by a crisis, and, slip in \nhand, the tenant.xushed about protesring- and complaining and \nasking for advice. It was a very foolish threat on the part of \nthe Government or their local officials, and it was not, we were \ntold later, meant seriously. But it lessened the chances of a \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\npeaceful settlement very greatly and led inevitably, step by step, \nto conflict. \n\nThe choice had to be made very soon now by the peasants \nand by the Congress; we could not postpone our decision till \nGandhiji\u2019s return. What were we to do? What advice to give? \nCould we reasonably ask the peasants to pay up the sum de- \nmanded within the short period allowed when we knew that \nmany of them could not possibly do so? And then what of the \narrears due from them? Would they not run the risk of dis- \npossession even if they paid a large part of the sum demanded, \nor even the full current demand, which might be credited to \narrears? \n\nThe Allahabad District Congress Committee, with its strong \npeasant contingent, showed fight. It decided that it could not \npossibly advise the peasants to pay. It was told, however, that \nit could not take any aggressive step without the formal permis- \nsion of \u2019the Provincial Executive as well as of the All-India \nWorking Committee. The matter was, therefore, referred to the \nWorking Committee, and both Tasadduq Sherw^ni and Puru- \nshottam Das Tandon were present to place the case for the \nprovince and the district. The quesdon befiire us related to \nAllahabad district only and it was a purely economic issue, but \nwe realised that, in the state of political tension then existing, \nit might have far-reaching consequences. Should the Allahabad \nDistrict Committee be permitted to advise the peasants in the \ndistrict to withhold payment of rent or revenue for the time \nbeing and pending further negotiation and better terms? This \nwas the narrow issue and we wanted to confine ourselves to it, \nbut could we do so? The Working Committee wanted to strain \nevery nerve to prevent a break with Government before Gand- \nhiji\u2019s return, and, in particular, it wanted to avoid a break on an \neconomic issue which might develop into a class issue. The \nCommittee, though politically advanced, was not so socially, and \nit disliked , the raising of the tenant versus zamindar question. \n\nBeing socialistically inclined, I was not considered a veiy safe \nperson to advise on economic and social matters. I myself felt \nthat tile Working Committee should realise that the U.P. situa- \ntion was such mat even our more moderate and right wing \nmembers were being forced by events to take action, in spite of \nall their disinclination for it. I welcomed, therefore, the pre- \nsence of Sherwani and others firom our province at our Com- \nmittee meeting, for Sherwani (our Provincial President) was by \nno means a fire-brand. Constitutionally he was a right winger \nin the Congress, both politically and socially, and, at tile be^- \n\n\n\nAGRARIAN TROUBLES IN THE UNITED PROVINCES II \n\nning of the year, he had been prejudiced against the agrarian \npolicy of the U.P. Congress Committee. But when he became \nthe head of that Committee himself and had to shoulder the \nburden, he realised that there was no other alternative for us. \nEvery subsequent step taken by the Provincial Committee was \nin the closest co-operation with him and, indeed, often through \nhim, as President. \n\nTasadduq Sherwani\u2019s pleading before the Working Commit- \ntee, therefore, produced great effect on the members \u2014 a much \ngreater effect than mine would have done. With great hesita- \ntion, but feeling that they could not refuse it, they gave the \nU.P. Committee authority to permit in any area the suspension \nof payment of rent and revenue. But, at the same time, they \npressed the U.P. people to avoid this step if they could and to \ncarry on negotiations with the Provincial Government. \n\nThese negotiations were carried on for a while with little \nresult. Some improvement was made, I believe, in the Allaha- \nbad district figures for remissions. It might have been possible, \nunder ordiiiary circumstances, to arrive at a settlement or at \nleast to avoid open conflict. The differences were being nar- \nrowed down. But the circumstances were very imusual, and on \nboth sides \u2014 ^the Government and the Congress \u2014 there was the \nfeeling of the inevitability of an approaching conflict, and there \nwas no reality behind our negotiations. Every step taken by \neither party seemed to indicate a desire to manoeuvre for a posi- \ntion. The Government's preparations for this could be and were \nin fact carried on and perfected in secret. Our strength lay \nentirely in the morale of the people, and this could not be pre- \npared or raised by secret activiries. Some of us \u2014 and I was one \nof the guilty ones\u2014 had often repeated in our public speeches \nthat the struggle for fireedom was far from over, and that we \nwould have to face many trials and difficulties in the near \nfuture. We had asked our peirole to keep themselves in readi- \nness for them, and because of this we had been criticised as \nwar-mongers. As a matter of fact, there was a marked reluc- \ntance on the part of our middle-class Congress workers to face \nfacts, and thw hoped that somehow or omer a conflict would \nbe avoided. Gandhiji\u2019s presence in London also distracted the \nattention of the newspaper-reading classes. And yet in spite of \nthis passivity of the intelligentsia, events marched ahead, \nespecially in Bengal, the Frontier Province and the U.P., and in \nNovember it began to dawn on many people that a crisis was \napproaching. \n\nThe U.P. Provincial Congress Committee, afraid of being \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nforestalled by events, made some domestic arrangements in the \nevent of conflict taking place. The Allahabad Committee held \na big Peasant Conference, which passed a tentative resolution \nstating that, in case better terms were not obtained, they would \nhave to advise the peasants to withhold payment of rent and \nrevenue. This resolution irritated the Provincial Government \ngreatly, and, treating it as a casus belli, it refused to have any \nfurther dealings with us. That attitude again produced its re- \nactions on the Provincial Congress, which interpreted it as a \nsign of the coming storm and hastened its own preparations. \nIn Allahabad there was yet another Peasant Conference, when \na stronger and more definite resolution asking the peasantry to \nwithhold payment pending further negotiations and better \nterms, was passed. The attitude taken up even then, and to the \nend, was not one of a * no-rent\u2019 campaign but a \u2018 fair-rent \u2019 \ncampaign, and we went on asking for negotiations, though the \nother party had ostentatiously walked away. The Allahabad \nresolution applied to zamindar and tenant alike, but we knew \nthat in effect it applied to tenants and some petty zamindars \nonly. \n\nThis was the position in the U.P. towards the en'd of Novem- \nber and the beginning of December . Meanwhile in Bengal \nand the Frontier Province matters had also marched to a head, \nand in Bengal a new and terribly comprehensive ordinance had \nbeen applied. All these were signs of war, not of peace, and the \nquestion arose: when would Gandhiji return? Would he reach \nIndia before the Government started its great offensive, for \nwhich it had prepared so long? Or would he return to find \nmany of his colleagues in prison and the struggle launched? \nWe learnt that he was on his way back and would reach Bom- \nbay in the last week of the year. Each one of us, every \nprominent worker in the Congress at headquarters or in the \nprovinces, wanted to avoid that struggle till his return. Even \nfirom the point of view of the struggle itself it was desirable for \nus to meet him, to have his advice and his directions. It was a \nrace in which we were helpless. The initiative lay with the \nBritish Government. \n\n\n\n THE END OF THE TRUCE \n\n\nIn spite of my preoccupation in the United Provinces, I had \nlong been anxious to visit the two other storm centres, the \nFrontier Province and Bengal. I wanted to study the situation \non the spot and to meet old colleagues, many or whom I had \nnot seen for nearly two years. But, above all, I wanted to pay \nmy homage to the spirit and courage of the people of these \nprovinces and their sacrifices in tlie national struggle. The \nFrontier Province was beyond reach for the time being, for the \nGovernment of India did not approve of any prominent Con- \ngressman visiting it, and we had no desire to go in view of this \ndisapproval, and thus create an impasse. \n\nIn Bengal the situation was deteriorating and, much as I was \nattracted to the province, I hesitated before going. I realised \nthat I would be helpless there and could do little good. A \ndeplorable and long-standing dispute between two groups of \nCongressmen in the province had long frightened outside Con- \ngressmen and kept them away, for they were afraid of getting \ninvolved in it on one side or the other. This was a feeble and \nostrich-like policy, and did not help either in soothing Bengal \nor in Solving her problems. Some time after Gandhiji had gone \nto London two incidents suddenly concentrated all-India atten- \ntion on the situation in Bengal. These two took place in Hijli \nand Chittagong. \n\nHijli was a special detention camp gaol for detenus. It was \nofficially announced that a riot had taken place inside the \ncamp, the detenus had attacked the staff, and the latter had \nbeen forced to fire on them. One detenu was killed by this firing \nand many were wounded. A local official enquiry, held im- \nmediately after, absolved the staff from all blame for this firing \nand its consequences. But there were many curious features, \nand some fticts leaked out which did not fit m with the official \nversion, and vehement demands were made for a fuller enquiry. \nContrary to the usual official practice in India, the Government \nof Bengal appointed an Enqmry Committee consisting of high \njudicial officers. It was a purely official committee, but it \ntook evidence and considered the matter fully, and its findings \nwere against the staff of the Detention Camp Gaol. It was held \nthat the feult was largely that of the staff, and the firing was \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nunjustified. The previous Government communiques issued on \nthe subject were thus entirely falsified. \n\nThere was nothing very extraordinary about the Hijli occur- \nrence. Unhappily such incidents or accidents are not rare in \nIndia, and one frequently reads of ' gaol riots \u2019 and of the \ng allan t suppression of unarmed and helpless prisoners within \nthe gaol by armed warders and others. Hijli was unusual in \nso far as it exposed, and exposed officially, the utter one-sided- \nness, and even the falsity of Government communiques on such \noccurrences. Little credence had been attached to these \ncommuniques in the past, but now they were completely found \nout. \n\nSince the Hijli affair a large number of gaol \u2018 occurrences ' \ninvolving sometimes firing, sometimes the use of other kinds \nof force ny the staff, have taken place all over India. Strangely \nenough in these \u2018gaol riots' only the prisoners seem to get hurt. \nAlmost invariably an official communiqu has been issued \naccusing the prisoners of various misdeed and absolving the \nstaff. Very rarely some departmental punishments have been \nawarded to the staff. All demands for a fiill enquiry have been \ncurdy refused, a departmental enquiry being deemed sufficient. \nEvidently the lesson of Hijli was well learnt by Government, that \nit is imsafe to have proper and impartial enquiries, and the best \njudge is the accuser himself. Is it surprising that the people \nalso should learn the lesson of Hijli, that Government com- \nmuniques tell us what the Government wants them to believe \nand not what actually happens? \n\nThe Chittagong affair was much more serious. A terrorist \nshot down and killed a Muslim police inspector. This was &- \nlowed by a BBndu-Muslim riot, or so it was called. It was \npatent, however, that it was something much more than that; \nsomething different from the usual communal riot. It was \nobvious mat the terrorist\u2019s act had nothing to do with com- \nmunalism; it was directed against a police officer, regardless \nof whether he was a Hindu or Muslim. Yet it is true \nthat there was some Hindu-Muslim rioting afterwards. How \nthis started, what was the occasion for it, has not been cleared \nup, although very serious charges have been made by respon- \nsible public men. Another feature of the rioting was the part \ntaken by definite groups of other people, Anglo-Indians, chiefly \nrailway employees, and other Government employees, who are \nalleged to have indulged in reprisals on a large scale. J. M. Sen- \nGupta and other noted leaders of Bengal made specific allega- \ntions in regard to the occurrences in Chittagong, and challenged \n\n\n\nTHE END OF THE TRUCE  \n\nan enquiry or even a suit for defamation, but the Government \npreferred to take no such step. \n\nThese somewhat unusual occurrences in Chittagong drew \npointed attention to two dangerous possibilities. Terrorism had \nbeen condemned from many points of view; even modem \nrevolutionary technique condemned it. But one of its possible \nconsequences had always especially frightened me, and mat was \nthe danger of sporadic and communal violence spreading in \nIndia. I am not enough of a \u2018 timi d Hindu \u2019 to be afraid of \nviolence as such, although I certainly dislike it. But I do feel \nthat the disruptive forces in India are still very great, and \nsporadic violence would certainly give them strength and make \nthe process of building up a united and disciplined nation a \nmuch harder task than it is. When people murder in the name \nof religion, or to reserve a place for themselves in Paradise, it \nis a dangerous thing to accustom them to the idea of terroristic \nviolence. Political murder is bad. And yet the political terrorist \ncan be reasoned with and won over to other ways, because pre- \nsumably the end he is striving for is an earthly one, not per- \nsonal but national. Religious murder is worse, for it deals with \nthings of the other world, and one cannot even attempt to \nreason about such matters. Sometimes the dividing line between \nthe two is very thin and almost disappears, and political mur- \nder, by a metaphysical process, becomes semi-religious. \n\nThe Chittagong murder of a police official by a terrorist, and \nits consequences, made one realise very vividly the dangerous \npossibilities of terroristic activity and the enormous harm it \nmight do to the cause of Indian unity and freedom. The re- \nprisals that followed also showed us that fascist methods had \nappeared in India. Since then there have been many instances, \nnotably in Bengal, of such reprisals, and the fascist spirit has \nundoubtedly spread in the European and Anglo-Indian com- \nmunity. Some of the Indian hangers-on of Brinsh imperialism \nhave also imbibed it. \n\nIt is a curious thing, but the Terrorists themselves, or many \nof them, also have this fascist oudook, but it looks in a different \ndirection. Their nationalist-fescism faces the imperialist-fascism \nof the Europeans, Anglo-Indians, and some upper-class Indians. \n\nI went to Calcutta for a few days in November . I had \na very crowded programme, and, apart from meeting individuals \nand groups privately, addressed a number of mass meetings. In \nall these meetings I discussed the question of terrorism, and \ntried to show how wrong and futile and harmful it was for \nIndian freedom. I did not abuse the Terrorists, nor did  call \n\n\n\ni jawaharlal nehru \n\nthem ' dastardly \u2019 or \u2018 cowardly after the fashion of some of \nour countrymen who have themselves seldom, if ever, yielded \nto the temptation of doing anything brave or involving risk. \nIt has always seemed to me a singularly stupid thing to call a \nman or woman, who is constantly risking his life, a coward. \nAnd the reaction of it on that man is to make him a little more \ncontemptuous of his timid critics who shout from a distance \nand are incapable of doing anything. \n\nOn my last evening in Calcutta, a little before I was due to go \nto the station for my departure, two young men called on me. \nThey were very young, about twenty, with pale, nervous faces, \nand hrilliant eyes. I did not know who they were, but soon I \nguessed their errand. They were very angry with me for my \npropaganda against terroristic violence. They said that it was \nproducing a bad effect on young men, and\u2018 they could not \ntolerate my intrusion in this way. We had a little argument; \nit was a hurried one, for the time for my departure was at hand. \nI am afraid our voices and our tempers rose, and I told them \nsome hard things; and as I left them, they warned me finally \nthat if I continued to misbehave in the future they would deal \nwith me as they had dealt with others. \n\nAnd so I' left Calcutta, and as I lay in my berth in the train \nthat night I was long haunted by the excited faces of these \ntwo boys. Full of life and nervous energy they were; what good \nmaterial if only they turned the right way! I was sorry that \nI had dealt with them hurriedly and rather brusquely, and \nwished I had had the chance of long conversation with them. \nPerhaps I could have convinced them to apply their bright \nyoung lives to other ways, ways of serving India and freedom, \nin which there was no lack of opportunity for daring and self- \nsacrifice. Often I have thought of them in these after years, I \nnever found out their names, nor did I have any other trace of \nthem; and I wonder, sometimes, if they are dead or in some \ncell in the Andaman Islands. \n\nIt was December. The second Peasant Conference took place \nin Allahabad, and then I hurried south to the Karnataka to \nfulfiOl a long promise made to my old comrade of the Hindu- \nstani Seva Dal, Doctor N. S. Hardiker. The Seva Dal, the \nvolunteer wing of the national movement, had all along been \nan auxiliary of the Congress, though its organisation was quite \nseparate. In the summer of , however, the Working \nCommittee decided to absorb it completely into the Congress \norganisation, and to make it the Volunteer Department of the \nCongress. This was done, and Hardiker and I were put in charge \n\n\n\nTHE ENU Or' iHE 'iRUCE  \n\nof it. The headquarters of the Dal continued in the Karnataka \nprovince at Hubli, and Hardiker induced me to visit the place \nfor various functions connected with the Dal. He then took \nme about on tour tor a few days in Karnataka, and I was \namazed at the tremendous enthusiasm of the people every- \nwhere. On my way back I visited Sholapur of Martial Law \nfame. \n\nThat tour in the Karnataka assumed the character of a fare- \nwell performance for me; my speeches became swan-songs, \nthough they were rather aggressive and, I am afraid, not \nmusical. News from the U.P. was definite and clear, the Govern- \nment had struck, and struck hard. On my way to the Karnataka \nfrom Allahabad I had gone to Bombay with Kamala. She was \nagain ill, and I arranged for her treatment in Bombay. It was \nin Bombay, almost immediately after our arrival from Allaha- \nbad, that we learnt that the Government of India had pro- \nmulgated a special Ordinance for the United Provinces. TTiey \nhad decided not to wait for Gandhiji\u2019s arrival, although he was \nalready on the high seas, and was due in Bombay soon. The \nOrdinance was supposed to deal with the agrarian agitation, \nbut it was so extraordinarily wide-flun^ and far-reaching that \nit made aU political or public activity impossible. It provided \neven for the punishment of parents and guardians for the sins \nof their children and wards \u2014 a reversal of the old Biblical \npractice. \n\nIt was about this time that we read the report of the inter- \nview alleged to have been given by Gandhiji in Rome to the \nGiomale d\u2019ltalia. This came as a surprise, as it was unlike him \nto give an interview of this kind casually in Rome. On closer \nexamination we foimd many words and phrases in it which \nwere quite foreign to him, and it was patent to us, even before \nthe denial came, that the interview could not have been given \nas published. We thought that there had been a great deal of \ndistortion of something that he had said. Then came his \nemphatic contradiction of it, and his statement that he had \nnever given any interview at all in Rome. It was evident to us \nthat some one had played a trick on him. But to our amaze- \nment British newspapers and public men refused to believe him, \nand contemptuously referred to him as a liar. This hurt and \nangered. \n\nI was eager to go back to Allahabad and to give up the \nKarnataka tour. I felt that my place was with my comrades in \nthe U.P., and to be far away when so much was happening at \nhome was an ordeal. I decided, however, in fevour of adhering \n\n\n\ni jawaharlal nehru \n\nto the Karnataka programme. On my return to Bombay some \nfriends advised me to stay on for Gandhiji\u2019s arrival, which was \ndue exactly a week later. But this was impossible. From \nAllahabad came news of Purushottam Das Tandon\u2019s arrest and \nother arrests. There was, besides, our Provincial Conference \nwhich had been fixed at Etawah for that week. And so I \ndecided to go to Allahabad and to return to Bombay six days \nlater, if I was free, to meet Gandhiji and to attend a meeting \nof the Working Committee. I left Kamala bed-ridden in \nBombay. \n\nEven before I had reached Allahabad, at Chheoki station, an \norder under the new Ordinance was served on me. At Allaha- \nbad station another attempt was made to serve a duplicate of \nthat order on me; at my iiouse a third attempt was made by \na third person. Evidently no risks were being taken. The order \ninterned me within the municipal limits of Allahabad, and I \nwas told that I must not attend any public meeting or function, \nor speak in public, or write anything in a newspaper or leaflet. \nThere were many other restrictions. I found that a similar order \nhad been served on many of my colleagues, including Tasadduq \nSherwani. The next morning  wrote to the District Magistrate \n(who had issued the order) acknowledging receipt of it and \ninforming him that I did not propose to take my orders from \nhim as to what I was to do or not to do. I would carry on with \nmy ordinary work in the ordinary way, and in the course of \nthis work I proposed to return to Bombay soon to meet \nMr. Gandhi, and take part in the meeting of the Working \nCommittee, of which I was the secretary. \n\nA new problem confronted us. Our U.P. Provincial Con- \nference had been fixed to meet at Etawah that week, I had \ncome from Bombay with the intention of Ug|esting a post- \nponement, as it clashed somewhat with Gandhiji's arrival, and \nin order to avoid conflict with the Government. But before my \nreturn to Allahabad a peremptory message had come from the \nU.P, Govermnent to cur President, Sherwani, enquiring if our \nconference would consider the agrarian question, for if so, they \nwould prohibit the conference itself. It was patent that the \nmain purpose of the conference was to discuss the agrarian \nquestion which was agitating the whole province; to meet and \nnot to discuss it would be the height of absurdity and s elf - \nsj^]^\u00a7gaiaon. And in any event our President or any one else \nhad no aicLthority to tie down the conference. Quite apart from \nthe Govemmmt\u2019s threat it was the intention of some of us to \npostpone the conference, but this threat made a difference. \n\n\n\n \n\nJawaharlal and Mr. Sherwanij before they were \narrested on their way to meet Mahatma Gandhi \n\n\n\nTHE END OF THE TRUCE \n\n\n \n\nMany of us were rather obstinate in such matters, and the \nidea of being dictated to by Government was not pleasant. \nAfter long argument we decided to swallow our pride and to \npostpone the conference. We did so because almost at any cost \nwe wanted still to avoid the development of the conflict, which \nhad already beg^n, till Gandhiji\u2019s arrival. We did not want \nhim to be confronted with a situation in which he was power- \nless to take the helm. In spite of our postponement of our \nProvincial Conference there was a great display of the police \nand military at Etawah, some stray delegates were arrested, \nand the Swadeshi Exhibition there was seized by the military. \n\nSherwani and I decided to leave Allahabad for Bombay on \nthe morning of December th. Sherwani had been especially \ninvited to me Working Committee meeting to confer on the \nU.P. situation. Both of us had been served with orders under \nthe Ordinance not to leave Allahabad city. The Ordinance \nwas said to be directed against the suspension of rent activities \nin the rural areas of Allahabad and some other U.P. districts. \nIt was easy to understand that the Government should prevent \nus from visiting these rural areas. But it was obvious that we \ncould not carry on this agrarian agitation in the city of Bom- \nbay; and the Ordinance, if it was really meant for the agrarian \nsituation only, should have welcomed our departure from the \nprovince. Ever since the promulgation of the Ordinance our \ngeneral policy had been a defensive one, and we had avoided \ncoming to grips with it, although there had been individual \ncases of disobedience of orders. So far as the U.P. Cbngress \nwas concerned, it was clear that they wanted to avoid or post- \npone conflict with the Government for the present at least. \nSherwani and I were going to Bombay where Gandhiji and the \nWorking Committee would consider these matters, and no one \nknew\u2014 certainly I was by no means sure\u2014 what their ultimate \ndecisions might be. \n\nAll these considerations made me think that we would be \npermitted to go to Bombay, and the technical breach of the \norder of internment would, for the moment at least, be tolerated \nby Government. And yet in my bones I felt otherwise. \n\nAs' we got into the train we read in the morning\u2019s papers \nof the new Frontier Province Ordinance and the arrest of \nAbdul GhafFar Khan and Doctor Khan Sahib and others. Very \nsoon our train, the Bombay Mail, came to a sudden halt at a \nwayside station, Iradatganj, which is not one of its usual \nstopping places, and police officials mounted up to arrest us. A \nBlack Maria waited by the railway line, and Sherwani and I \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NkHRU \n\nmounted this closed prisoners\u2019 van and were bumped away to \nNaini. The Superintendent of Police, an Englishman, who had \narrested us on that morning of Boxing Day looked glum and \nunhappy. I am afraid we had spoiled his Christmas. \n\nAnd so to prison! \n\n\u201c Absent thee from felicity a while. \n\nAnd for a season draw thy breath in pain.\u201d \n\n\n\n A CIVIL MARRIAGE AND A QUESTION \nOF SCRIPT ' \n\nAfter spending about a week in Poona and Bombay in the \nmiddle of September , ^ returned to Lucknow, My mother \nwas still in hospital there, and was improving very slowly. \nKamala was also in Lucknow, trying to attend on her, although \nshe v<ras not very well herself. My^ sisters used to come over \nfirom Allahabad for the week-ends. I remained in Lucknow for \ntwo or three weeks, and I had more leisure there than I was \nlikely to have in Allahabad, my chief occupation being visits \nto the hospital twice daily. I utilised my spare hours in viuiting \nsome articles for the Press, and these were widely published all \nover the country. , A series of articles entitled \u201c Whither India? \u201d, \nin which I had surveyed world affairs in relation to the Indian \nsituation, attracted considerable attention. I learnt later that \nthese articles were even reproduced in Persian translations in \nTeheran and Kabul. There was nothing novel or original in \nthese articles for any one in touch with recent developments \nand modern Western thought But in India our people had \nbeen too engrossed in their domestic troubles to pay much \nattention to what was happening elsewhere. The reception \ngiven to my articles, as well as many other indications, showed \nthat they were developing a wider outlook. \n\nMy mother was getting very tired of being in hospital, and \nwe decided to take her back to Allahabad. One of the reasons \nfor this was my sister Krishna\u2019s engagement, which had just \nthen been announced. We wanted to have the marriage as soon \nas possible, before I was suddenly removed to prison again. I \nhad no notion how long I would be allowed to remain out, as \nCivil Disobedience was still the official programme of the Con- \ngress, and the Congress itself and scores of other organisations \nwere illegal. \n\nWe fixed the marriage for the third week of October in \nAllahabad. It was to be a civil ceremony. I was glad of this, \nthough as a matter of fact we had no choice in the matter. \nThe marriage was between two different castes, a Brahman and \na non*Brahman, and under jpresent British Indian Law no \nreli^ous ceremony had validity for such a marriage. Fortu- \nnately a recently passed Civil Marriage Act came to our rescue. \n\n \n\n\n\nCIVIL MARRIAGE AND A QUESTION OF SCRIPT I \n\nThere were two such Acts, the second one, under which my \nsister\u2019s marriage took place, being confined to Hindus and those \nbelonging to allied faiths \u2014 ^Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs. But if either \nparty does not belong to one of these faiths, by birth or con- \nversion, then this second Act does not apply and the first Civil \nMarriage Act has to be resorted to. This first Act requires from \nboth the parties a denunciation of all the leading religions, or \nat any rate a statement that they do not belong to them. This \nwholly unnecessary denunciation is a great nuisance. Many \npeople, even though they are not religiously inclined, object to \nthis statement and thus cannot take advantage of the Act. The \northodox of various faiths oppose all changes which would \nfacilitate inter-marriages. The result is that they drive people \neither to make that statement of denunciation or to a patently \nsuperficial conversion to get within the law. Personally I should \nlike to encourage inter-marriages, but whether they are en- \ncouraged or not, it is very necessary to have a permissive general \ncivil marriage Act, applicable to persons of all religions, per- \nmitting them to marry without any denunciation or change of \nfaith. \n\nThere was no fuss about my sister\u2019s wedding; it, was a very \nsimple affair. Ordinarily I dislike the fiiss attendant on Indian \nmarriages. In view of my .mother\u2019s illness and, even more so, \nthe fact that civil disobedience was still going on and many of \nour colleagues were in prison, anything m the nature of show \nwas singularly out of place. Only a few relatives and local \nfriends were invited. Many old friends of my father\u2019s were hurt \nbecause they felt, quite wrongly, that I had purposely ignored \nthem. \n\nThe little invitation we issued for the wedding was written in \nHindustani in the Latin script. This was an innovation, as \nsuch invitations are always either in the nagri or the Persian \nscript, and the idea of writing Hindustani in the Latin script \nis almost unknown, except in army and missionary circles. I \nused the Latin script as an experiment, and I wanted to see the \nreactions of various people. It had a mixed reception, mostly \nunfavourable. The recipients were few: if a larger circle had \nbeen approached the reaction would have been still more un- \nfavourable. Gandhiji did not approve of what I had done. \n\nI did not use the Latin script because I had become a convert \nto it, although it had long attracted me. Its success in Turkey \nand Central Asia had impressed me, and the obvious arguments \nin its favour were weighty. But even so I was not convinced, \nand even if T had been convinced, I knew well that it did not \n\n\n\n jawaharlal nehru \n\nstand the faintest chance of being adopted in present-day India. \nThere would be the most violent opposition to it from all groups, \nnationalist, religious, Hindu, Muslim, old and new. And I feel \nthat the opposition would not be merely based on emotion. A \nchange of script is a very vital change for any language with a \nrich past, for a script is a most intimate part of its literature. \nChange the script and different word-pictures arise, different \nsounds, different ideas. An almost insurmountable barrier is put \nup between the old literature and the new, and the former be- \ncomes almost a foreign language that is dead. Where there is no \nliterature worth preserving this risk should be taken. In India I \ncan hardly conceive of the change, for our literature is not only \nrich and valuable but is bound up with our history and our \nthought, and is intimately connected with the lives of our \nmasses. It would be cruel vivisection to force such a change, and \nit would retard our progress in popular education. \n\nBut this question is not even an academic one in India to-day. \nThe irext step in script reform for us seems to me the adoption \nof a common script for the daughter languages of Sanskrit \u2014 \nHindi, Bengali, Marathi and Gujrati. As it is, their scripts have \na common origin and do not differ greatly, and it should not \nbe difficult to strike a common mean. This would bring these \nfour great sister languages much nearer to each other. \n\nOne of the legends about India which our English rulers \nhave persistently circulated all over the world is that India has \nseveral hundred languages \u2014  forget the exact number. For \nproof there is the census. Of these several hundred, it is an \nextraordinary fact that very few Englishmen know even one \nmoderately well, in spite of a life-long residence in this country. \nThey class the lot of these together and call them the 'Verna- \ncular the slave language (from the Latin verna, a home-born \nslave), and many of our people have, unknowingly, accepted \nthis nomenclature. It is astonishing how English people spend \na life-time in India without taking the trouble to learn the \nlanguage well. They have evolved, with the help of their \nkhansamahs and ayahs, an extraordinary jargon, a kind of \npidgin-Hindustani, which thw imagine is the real article. Just \nas they take their facts about Indian life from their subordinates \nand sycophants, they take their ideas about Hindustani from \ntheir domestic servants, who make a point of speaking their \npic^n language to the sahib-log for fear that they would not \nunoCTStand anything else. They seem to be wholly ignorant of \nthe fact that Hindustani, as well as the other Indian languages, \nhave high literary merit and extensive literatures. \n\n\n\nCIVIL MARRIAGE AND A QUESTION OF SCRIPT  \n\nIf the census tells us that India has two or three hundred \nlanguages, it also tells us, I believe, that Germany has about \nfifty or sixty languages. I do not remember any one pointing \nout this fact in proof of the disunity or disparity of Germany. \nAs a matter of fact, a census mentions all manner of petty \nlanguages, sometimes spoken by a few thousand persons only; \nand often dialects are classed, for scientific purposes, as different \nlanguages. India seems to me to have surprisingly few lan- \nguages, considering its area. Compared to the same area in \nEurope, it is far more closely allied in regard to language, but \nbecause of widespread illiteracy, common standards have not \ndeveloped and dialects have formed. The principal languages \nof India (excluding Burma) are Hindustani (of the two varieties, \nHindi and Urdu), Bengali, Gujrati, Marathi, Tamil, Telegu, \nMalayalam and Canarese. If Assamese, Oriya, Sindhi, Pushtu \nand Punjabi are added, the whole country is covered, except for \nsome hill and forest tribes. Of these, the Indo-Aryan languages, \nwhich cover the whole north, centre and west of India, are \nclosely allied; and the southern Dra vidian languages, though \ndifferent, have been greatly influenced by Sanskrit and are full \nof Sanskrit words. \n\nThe eight principal languages mentioned above have all old \nand valuable literatures, and each of them is spoken to-day over \na vast area, which is definite and clearly marked. Thus from \nthe point of view of numbers speaking a language, these lan- \nguages are among the major languages of the world. Fifty \nmillion people speak Bengali. As for Hindustani, with its varia- \ntions, it is spoken, I imagine (I have no figures here), by about \na hundred and forty millions in India, and it is partly under- \nstood by a vast number of others all over the country.* Such a \nlanguage has obviously enormous possibilities. It rests on the \nsolid foundation of Sanskrit and it is closely allied to Persian. \nThus it can draw from two rich sources, and of course, in recent \nyears, it has drawn from English. The Dravidian country in \nthe south is the only part where Hindustani comes as almost a \nforeign tongue, but the people there are making a great effort \nto learn it. Two years ago (in a) I saw some figures of a \nprivate voluntary society which had undertaken the teaching of \nHindi in the south. During the previous fourteen years, since \nits formation, it was stated that , persons had learnt Hindi \nthrough its efforts in the Madras Presidency alone. For a yolun- \n\n* The following figures have been given by the advocates of Hin- \ndustani. I do not know if they are based on the last census . \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ntary effort, which is supported in no way by the State, this is \nremarkable, and most of the persons who learn Hindi them- \nselves become missionaries in the cause. \n\nI have no doubt whatever that Hindustani is going to be the \ncommon language of India. Indeed it is largely so to-day for \nordinary purposes. Its progress has been hampered by foolish \ncontroversies about the script, ngn or Persian, and by the mis- \ndirected efforts of the two factions to use language which is \neither too Sanskritised or too Persianised. There is no way out \nof the script difficulty, for it arouses great heat and passion, \nexcept to adopt both officially, and allow people to use either. \nBut an effort must be made to discourage the extreme tenden- \ncies' and develop a middle literary language, on the lines of the \nspoken language in common use. With mass education this will \ninevitably take place. At present the small middle-class groups, \nthat are supposed to be the arbiters of literary taste and style, \nare terribly narrow-minded and conservative, each in its own \nway. They cling tt? antique forms that have no life in them and \nhave few contacts with their own masses or with world \nliterature. \n\nThe development and spread of Hindustani must not and \nwill not con&ct with the continued use and enrichment of the \nother great languages of India \u2014 ^Bengali, Gujrati, Marathi, \nOriya and the Dravidian languages of the south. Some of these \nlanguages are already more wide-awake and intellectually alert \nthan Hindustani, and they must remain the official languages \nfor educational and other purposes in their respective areas. \n\n*or the previous one of . I imagine they refer to the latter, and \nup-to-date figures would show a considerable increase under each \nhead. \n\n\nHindustani (including western Hindi, Pun- \n\n\njabi and Rajasthani) \n\n- - \n\nmillions \n\nBengali \n\n- - \n\nt> \n\nTelcgu \n\n... . \n\nit \n\nMarariii \n\n... i. \n\nit \n\nTamil - \n\n... . \n\n\nCanarese \n\n... . \n\ntt \n\nOriya \n\nro.i \n\ntt \n\nGujrati \n\n. \n\n i \n\n\n.

It is \nessential for many of us to know foreign languages in order to \nkeep in touch with world thought and activities, and I should \nlike our universities to encourage the learning of other lan- \nguages besides English\u2014 French, German, Russian, Spanish, \nItalian. This does not mean that English should be neglected, \nbut if we are to have a balanced view of the world we must not \nconfine ourselves to English spectacles. We have already become \nsufficiently lop-sided in our mental outlook because of this con- \ncentration on one aspect and ideology, and eyen the most rabid \nof our nationalists hardly realise how much they are cribbed \nand confined by the British outlook in relation to India. \n\nBut however much we may encourage the other foreign lan- \nguages, English is bound to remain our chief link with the out- \nside world. That is as it should be. For generations past we \nhave been trying to learn English, and we have achieved a fair \nmeasure of success in the endeavour. It would be folly to vidpe \nthe slate dean now and not to take full advantage of this long \ntraining. English also is to-day undoubtedly the most wide- \nspread and important world language, and it is gaining fast on \nthe other languages. It is likely to become more and mote the \nmedium of international intercourse and radio broadcasting, \nunless \u2018 American \u2019 takes its place. Therefore we must continue \nto spread the knowledge of English. It is desirable to learn it as \nwell as possible, but it does not seem to me worth while for us \nto spend too much time and energy in appreciating the finer \npoints of the language, as many of us do now. Individuals may \ndo that, but to set it as an id^ for large numbers is to put a \nneedless burden on them and prevent them firom progressing in \nother directions. \n\nI have been greatly attracted lately by \u2018 Basic English \u2019, and it \nseems to me that this extreme simplification of English -has a \ngreat future before it. It would be desirable for us to undertake \nthe teaching of Basic English on an extensive scale rather than \nStandard English, which can be left to specialists and particular \nstudents. \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nI would personally like to encourage Hindustani to adapt and \nassimilate many words from English and other foreign lan- \nguages. This is necessary, as we lack 'modern terms, and it is \nbetter to have well-known words rather than to evolve new and \ndifficult words from the Sanskrit or Persian or Arabic. Ptirists \nobject to the use of foreign words, but I think they make a \ngreat mistake, for the way to enrich our language is to make it \nflexible and capable of assimilating words and ideas from other \nlanguages. \n\nI happened to go, soon after my sister\u2019s wedding, to Benares \nto visit an old friend and colleague, Shiva Prasad Gupta, who \nhad been lying ill for over a year. He was in Lucknow Gaol \nwhen he had a sudden attack of paralysis, and he had been \nrecovering from it very slowly ever since. During my Benares \nvisit, a small Hindi literary society gave me an address and I \nhad a pleasant informal talk with its members. I told them that \nI hesitated to speak to experts on subjects I knew little about, \nbut still I made a few suggestions. I criticised the intricate and \nornate language that was customary in Hindi writing, full of \ndifficult Sanskrit words, artificial, and clinging to ancient forms, \nI ventured to suggest that this courtly style, addressed to a select \naudience, should be given up, and Hindi writers should deliber- \nately write for the masses and in language understood by \nthem. Mass contacts would give new life and sincerity to the \nlanguage, and the writers themselves would catch some of the \nemotional energy of the mass and do far better work. Further, \nI suggested that if Hindi authors paid more attention to \nWestern thought and literature, they would derive great benefit \nfrom it; it would be desirable to have translations from the \nclassics of the European languages as well as from books dealing \nwith modem ideas. I also mentioned that probably modern \nBengali, Gujrati and Marathi were a little more advanced \nin these matters than modem Hindi, and certainly more cre- \native work had been done in Bengali in recent years than in \nHindi. \n\nWe had a friendly talk about these matters and then I came \naway. I had no idea that my remarks would be sent to the \nPress, but some one present sent a report to the Hindi papers. \n\nAnd then there was a tremendous outcry in the Hindi Press \nagainst me and at my presumption in criticising Hindi and \ncomparing it, to its disadvantage, with Bengali, Gujrati and \nMarathi. I was called an ignoramus \u2014 ^which indeed I was in \nthat particular subject \u2014 and many harder words were used to \nsquash and suppress me. I had no time to follow the contro- \n\n\n\nCIVIL MARRIAGE AND A QUESTION OF SCRIPT  \n\nversy and it went on, I am told, for months, till I was again in \nprison. \n\nThis incident was a revelation to me. It revealed the extra- \nordinary sensitiveness of Hindi literary men and journalists, \nand their refusal to face a litde honest criticism from one who \nwished them well. The inferiority complex was evidently at \nwork. Self-criticism there was none at all, and critical standards \nwere poor. It was not unusual for an author and his critic to \nfall out and accuse each other of personal motives. The whole \noutlook was narrow, bourgeois and parochial, and both the jour- \nnalists and the authors seemed to write for each other and for a \nsmall circle, ignoring the vast public and its interests. It seemed \nto me an extraordinary pity and an unhappy waste of energy \nwhen the field was so vast and inviting. \n\nHindi literature has a fine past, but it cannot live for ever on \nits past. I feel sure that it has a great future, and that Plindi \njournalism will be a tremendous power in this country. But \nneither will progress much till it shakes itself firee of narrow \nconventions and boldly addresses the masses.  DESOLATION \n\n\u201c And I yearn to lay my head \n\nWhere the grass is cool and sweet. \n\nMother, all the dreams are fled \nFrom the tired child at thy feet.\u201d \n\nApril came. Rumours reached me in my cell in Alipore of \nhappenings outside, rumours that were unpleasant and disturb- \ning. The Superintendent of the gaol informed me casually one \nday that Mr. Gandhi had withdrawn Civil Disobedience. I \nknew no more. The news was not welcome, and I felt sad at \nthis winding-up of something that had meant so much to me \nfor many years. And yet I reasoned with myself that the end \nwas bound to come. I knew in my heart that some time or other \nCivil Disobedience would have to be wound up, for the time \nbeing at least. Individuals may hold out almost indefinitely, \nregardless of the consequences, but national organisations do \nnot behave in this manner. I had no doubt that Gandhiji had \ninterpreted correctly the mind of the country and of the great \nmajority of Congressmen, and I tried to reconcile myself to the \nnew development, unpleasant as it was. \n\nI heard also vaguely of the new move to revive the old Swaraj \nParty in order to enter the legislatures. Thar too seemed inevit- \nable, and I had long been of opinion that the Congress could \nnot keep aloof from future elections. During the five months \nof my freedom outside prison I had tried to discourage this \ntendency, for I thought it premature and likely to divert atten- \ntion both from direct action and from the development of new \nideas of social change which were fermenting in the Congress \nranks. The longer the crisis continued, I thought, the more \nwould these ideas spread among our masses and intelligentsia \nand the realities underlying our political and economic situa- \ntion be laid bare. As Lenin has said somewhere: \u201cAny and \nevery political crisis is useful bccaysc it brings to the light what \nwas hidden, reveals the actual forces involved in politics; it \nexposes lies and deceptive phrases and fictions; it demonstrates \ncomprehensively the facts, and forces on the people the under- \nstanding of what is the reality.\u201d I had hoped that this process \nwould result in making the Congress a clearer-minded and a \n\n \n\n\n\nDliSOLATION \n\n\nOJ \n\nmore compact body with a definite goal. Probably some of \nits weaker elements might drop out. That would be no loss. \nAnd when the time came for the ending of even theoretical \ndirect action and a reversion to so-called constitutional and \nlegal methods, the advanced and really active wing of the Con- \ngress would utilise even these methods from the larger point \nof view of our final objective. \n\nThat time apparently had come. But to my dismay I found \nthat the people who had been the backbone of Civil Dis- \nobedience and efltective work in the Congress were receding into \nthe background, and others, who had taken no such part, were \ntaking command. \n\nSome days later the weekly Statesman came to me, and I read \nin it the statement which Gandhiji had issued when withdraw- \ning Civil Disobedience. I read it with amazement and sinking \nof heart. Again and again I read it, and Civil Disobedience and \nmuch else vanished from my mind and other doubts and con- \nflicts filled it. \u201cThis statement,\" wrote Gandhiji, \u201cowes its \ninspiration to a personal chat with the inmates and associates \nof the Satyagraha Ashram. . . . More especially is it due to a \nrevealing information I got in the course of a conversation \nabout a valued companion of long standing who was found \nreluctant to perform the full prison task, preferring his private \nstudies to the allotted task. This was undoubtedly contrary \nto the rules of Satyagraha. More than the imperfection of \nthe friend whom I love, more tlian ever it brought home to me \nmy own imperfections. The fi'iend said he had thought that \nI was aware of his weakness. I was blind. Blindness in a \nleader is unpardonable. I saw at once that I must for the \ntime being remain the sole representative of civil resistance in \naction.\u201d \n\nThe imperfection or fault, if such it was, of the \u2018 friend \u2019 was \na very trivial aflair. I confess that I have often been guilty of it \nand I am wholly unrepentant. But even if it was a serious \nmatter, was a vast national movement involving scores of thou- \nsands directly and millions indirectly to be thrown out of gear \nbecause an individual had erred? This seemed to me a mon- \nstrous proposition and an immoral one. I cannot presume to \nspeak of what is and what is not Satyagraha, but in my own \nlittle way I have endeavoured to follow certain standards of \nconduct, and all those standards were shocked and upset by \nthis statement of Gandhiji\u2019s. I knew that Gandhiji usumly acts \non instinct (I prefer to call it that than the \u2018inner voice \u2019 or an \nanswer to prayer), and very often that instinct is right. He has \n\n\n\no jawaharlal nehru \n\nrepeatedly shown what a wonderful knack he has of sensing the \nmass mind and of acting at the psychological moment. The \nreasons which he afterwards adduces to justify his action are \nusually afterthoughts and seldom carry one very far. A leader \nor a man of action in a crisis almost always acts subconsciously \nand then thinks of the reasons for his action. I felt also that \nGandhiji had acted rightly in suspending civil resistance. But \nthe reason he had given seemed to me an insult to intelligence \nand an amazing performance for a leader of a national move- \nment. He was perfectly entitled to treat his ashram inmates \nin any manner he liked; they had taken all kinds of pledges \nand accepted a certain regime. But the Congress had not done \nso; I had not done so. Why should we he tossed hither and \nthither for, what seemed to me, metaphysical and mystical \nreasons in which I was not interested? Was it conceivable to \nhave any political movement on this basis? I had willingly \naccepted the moral aspect of Satyagraha as I understood it \n(within certain limits T admit). That basic aspect appealed \nto me and it seemed to raise politics to a higher and nobler \nlevel. I was prepared to agree that the end does not justify all \nkinds of means. But this new development or interpretation \nwas something much more far-reaching and it held forth some \npossibilities which frightened me. \n\nThe whole statement frightened and oppressed me tremen- \ndously. And then finally the advice he gave to Congressmen \nwas that \u201cthey must learn the art and beauty of self-denial \nand voluntary poverty. They must engage themselves in \nnation-building activities, the spread of khaddar through per- \nsonal hand-spinning and hand-weaving, the spread of com- \nmunal unity of hearts by irreproachable personal conduct \ntowards one another in every walk of life, the banishing of \nuntouchability in every shape or form in one\u2019s own person, the \nspread of total abstinence from intoxicating drinks and drugs \nby personal contact with individual addicts and generally by \ncultivating personal purity. These arc services which provide \nmaintenance on the poor man\u2019s scale. Those for whom the \npoor man\u2019s scale is not feasible should find a place in small \nunorganised industries of national importance which give a \nbetter wage.\u201d \n\nThis was the political programme that we were to follow. A \nvast distance seemed to separate him from me. With a stab \nof pain I felt that the chords of allegiance that had bound me \nto him for many years had snapped. For long a mental tussle \nhad been going on within me. I had not understood or ap- \n\n\n\nDESOLATION \n\n\n \n\n\npredated much that Gandhiji had done. His fasts and his con- \ncentration on other issues during the continuance of Civil \nDisobedience, when his comrades were in the grip of the \nstruggle, his personal and selPcreated entanglements, which led \nhim to the extraordinary position that, while out of prison, he \nwas yet pledged to himself not to take part in the political \nmovement, his new loyalties and pledges which put in the \nshade the old loyalty and pledge and job, undertaken together \nwith many colleagues, while yet that job was unfinished, had \nall oppressed me. During my short period out of prison I had \nfelt these and other differences more than ever. Gandhiji had \nstated that there were temperamental differences between us. \nThey were perhaps more than temperamental, and I realised \nthat I held clear and definite views about many matters which \nwere opposed to his. And yet in the past I had tried to sub- \nordinate them, as far as I could, to what I conceived to be the \nlarger loyalty \u2014 the cause of national freedom for which the \nCongress seemed to be working. I tried to be loyal and faithful \nto my leader and my colleagues, for in my spiritual make-up \nloyalty to a cause and to one\u2019s colleagues holds a high place. \nI fought many a battle within myself when I felt that T was \nbeing dragged away from the anchor of my spiritual faith. \nSomehow I managed to compromise. Perhaps I did wrong, for \nit can never be right for any one to let go of that anchor. But \nin the conflict of ideals I clung to my loyalty to my colleagues, \nand hoped that the rush of events and the development of our \nstruggle might dissolve the difficulties that troubled ire and \nbring my colleagues nearer to my view-point. \n\nAnd now? Suddenly I felt very lonely in that cell of Alipore \nGaol, Life seemed to be a dreary affair, a very wilderness of \ndesolation. Of the many hard lessons that I had learnt, the \nhardest and the most painful how faced me; that it is not \npossible in any vital matter to rely on any one. One .must \njourney through life alone; to rely on others is to invite heart- \nbreak. \n\nSome of my accumulated irritation turned to religion and \nthe religious outlook; What an enemy this was to clearness of \ntliought and fixity of purpose, I thought; for was it not based \non emotion and passion? Presuming to be spiritual, how far \nremoved it was from real spirituality and things of the spirit. \nThinking in terms of some other world, it had little conception \nof human values and social values and social justice. With its \npreconceived notions it deliberately shut its eyes to reality for \nfear that this might not fit in with them. It based itself on \n\n\n\no jawaharlal nehru \n\ntruth, and yet so sure was it of having discovered it, and the \nwhole of it, that it did not take the trouble to search for it; all \nthat concerned it was to tell others of it. The will to truth was \nnot the same thing as the will to believe. It talked of peace and \nyet supported systems and organisations that could not exist \nbut for violence. It condemned the violence of the sword, but \nwhat of the violence that comes quietly and often in peaceful \ngarb and starves and kills; or worse still, without doing any \noutward physical injury, outrages the mind and crushes the \nspirit and breaks the heart? \n\nAnd then I thought of him again who was the cause of this \ncommotion within me. What a wonderful man was Gandhiji \nafter all, with his amazing and almost irresistible charm and \nsubtle power over people. His writings and his sayings conveyed \nlittle enough impression of the man behind; his personality was \nfar bigger than they would lead one to think. And his services \nto India, how vast they had been. He had instilled courage and \nmanhood in her people, and discipline and endurance, and the \npower of joyful sacrifice for a cause, and, with all his humility, \npride. Courage is the one sure foundation of character, he had \nsaid, without courage there is no\" morality, no religion, no love. \n\u201c One cannot follow truth or love so long as one is subject to \nfear.\u201d With all his horror of violence, he had told us that \n\u201c cowardice is a thing even more hateful than violence \u201d. And \n\" discipline is the pledge and guarantee that a man means busi- \nness. There is no deliverance and no hope without sacrifice, \ndiscipline, and self-control. Mere sacrifice without discipline will \nbe unavailing.\u201d Words only and pious phrases perhaps, rather \nplatitudinous, but there was power behind the words, and India \nknew that this little man meant business.,.. \n\nHe came to represent India to an amazing degree and to ex- \npress the very spirit of that ancient and tortured land. Almost \nhe was India, and his very failings were Indian failings. A slight \nto him was hardly a personal matter, it was an insult to the \nnation; and \"Viceroys and others who indulged in these dis- \ndainful gestures little realised what a dangerous crop they were \nsowing, i remember how hurt I was when I first learnt that the \nPope had refused an interview to Gandhiji when he was retum- \n\u25a0'ing from the Round Table Conference in December . That \nremsal seemed to me an affront to India, and there can be no \ndoubt that the refusal was intentional, though the afifont was \nprobably not thought of. The Catholic Church does not ap- \nprove of saints or mahatmas outside its fold, and because some \nProtestant churchmen had called Gandhiji a great man of \n\n\n\nUbaULAl'luN \n\n\n \n\nreligion and a real- Christian, it became all the more necessary \nfor Rome to dissociate itself from this heresy. \n\nJust about that time in Aliporc Gaol, in April , I read \nBernard Shaw\u2019s new plays, and the preface to On the Rocks, \nwith its debate between Christ and Pilate, fascinated me. It \nseemed to have a modern significance, when another empire \nfaced another man of religion. \u201cI say to you,\u201d Jesus says to \nPilate in this preface, \" cast out fear. Speak no more vain things \nto me about the greatness of Rome. The greatness of Rome, \nas you call it, is nothing but fear; fear of the past and fear \nof the future, fear of the poor, fear of the rich, fear of the \nHigh Priests, fear of the Jews and Greeks, who are learned, \nfear of the Gauls and Goths and Hiins, who are barbarians, \nfear of the Carthage you destroyed to save you from fear of it, \nand now fear worse than ever, fear of Imperial Caesar, the idol \nyou have yourself created, and fear of me, the penniless vag- \nrant, buffeted and mocked, fear of everything except the rule \nof God; faith in nothing but blood and iron and gold. You, \nstanding for Rome, are the universal coward; I, standing for the \nKingdom of God, have braved everything, lost everything, and \nwon an eternal crown.\u201d \n\nBut Gandhiji\u2019s greatness or his services to India or the tre- \nmendous debt I personally owed to him were not in question. \nIn spite of all that, he might be hopelessly in the wrong in \nmany matters. What, after all, was he aiming at? In spite of \nthe closest association with him for many years I am not clear \nin my own mind about his objective. I doubt if he is clear \nhimself. One step enough for me, he says, and he does not \ntry to peep into the future or to have a clearly conceived end \nbefore him. Look after the means and the end will take care \nof itself, he is never tired of repeating. Be good in your per- \nsonal individual lives and all else will follow. That is not a \npolitical or scientific attitude, nor is it perhaps even an ethical \nattitude. It is narrowly moralist, and it begs the question ; What \nis goodness? Is it merely an individual affair or a social afl^ir? \nGandhiji lays all sfress on character and attaches little impor- \ntance to intellectual traming and deveropiricnt. Intellect without \ncharacter is likely to be dangerous, but what is character with- \nout intellect? How, indeed, docs character develop? Gandhiji \nhas been compared to the medieval Christain saints, and much \nthat he says seems to fit in with this. It does not fit in at all \nwith modem psychological experience and method. \n\nBut however this may be, vagueness in an objective seems \nto me deplorable. Action to be effective must be directed tq \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nJO \n\nclearly conceived ends. Life is not all logic, and those ends will \nhave to be varied from time to time to fit in with it, but soma \nend must always be clearly envisaged. \n\nI imagine that Gandhiji is not so vague about the objective \nas he sometimes appears to be. He is passionately desirous of \ngoing in a certain direction, but this is wholly at variance with \nmodern ideas and conditions, and he has so far been unable to, \nfit the two, or to chalk out all the intermediate steps leading \nto his goal. Hence, the appearance of vagueness and avoidance \nof clarity. But his general inclination has been clear enough \nfor a quarter of a century, ever since he started formulating \nhis philosophy in South Africa. I do not know if those early \nwritings still represent his views. I doubt if they do so in their \nentirety, but they do help us to understand the background of \nhis thought. \n\n\u201c India\u2019s salvation consists,\u201d he wrote in . \" in unlearning \nwhat she has learnt during the last fifty years. The railways, \ntelegraphs, hospitals, lawyers, doctors, and such-like have all to \ngo; and the so-called upper classes have to learn consciously, \nreligiously, and deliberately the simple peasant life, knowing \nit to be a life giving true happiness.\u201d And again : \" Every time \nI get into a railway car or use a motor-bus I know that I am \ndoing violence to my sense of what is right \u201c to attempt to \nreform the W'orld by means of highly artificial and speedy \nlocomotion is to attempt the impossible.\u201d \n\nAll this seems to me utterly wrong and harmful doctrine, and \nimpossible of achievement. Behind it lies Gandhiji\u2019s love and \npraise of poverty and sufl'ering and the ascetic life. For him \nprogress and civilisation consist not in the multiplication of \nwants, of higher standards of living, \u201cbut in the deliberate \nand voluntary restriction of wants, which promotes real happi- \nness and cqntentment, and increases the capacity for service.\u201d \nIf these premises are once accepted it becomes easy to follow \nthe rest of Gandhiji\u2019s thought and to have a better under- \nstanding of his activities. But most of us do not accept those \npremises and yet we complain later on when we find that his \nactivities are not to our liking. \n\nPersonally I dislike the praise of poverty and suffering. I do \nnot think they are at all d\u00abirable, and they ought to be \nabolished. Nor do I appreciate the ascetic life as a social ideal, \nthough it may suit individuals. I understand and appreciate \nsimplicity, equality, self-control, but not the mortification of \nthe flesh. Just as an athlete requires to train his body, I \nbelieve that the mind and h^hifo h^ve aho rn be trained and \n\n\n\nlJ^!,t>OLAilO^ \n\n\n \u201d \n\nbrought under control. It would be absurd to expect that a \nperson who is given to too much self-indulgence can endure \nmuch suffering or show unusual self-control or behave like a \nhero when the crisis comes. To be in good moral condition \nrequires at least as much training as to be in good physical \ncondition. But that certainly does not mean asceticism or self- \nmortification. \n\nNor do I appreciate in the least the idealisation of the \u2018 simple \npeasant life\u2019. I have almost a horror of it, and instead of \nsubmitting to it myself I want to drag out even the peasantry \nfrom it, not to urbanisation, but to the spread of urban cultural \nfacilities to rural areas. Far from this life giving me true happi- \nness, it would be almost as bad as imprisonment for me. What \nis there in the \" Man with the Hoe \u201d to idealise over? Crushed \nand exploited for innumerable generations he is only little \nremoved from the animals who keep him company. \n\n\u201c Who made him dead to rapture and despair, \n\nA thing that grieves not and that never hopes. \n\nStolid and stunned, a brother to the ox? \u201d \n\nThis desire to get away from the mind of man to primitive \nconditions where mind docs not count, seems to me quite incom- \nprehensible. The very thing that is the glory and triumph of \nman is decried and discouraged, and a physical environment \nwhich will oppress the mind and prevent its growth is con- \nsidered desirable. Present-day civilisation is full of evils, but it \nis also full of good; and it has the capacity in it to rid mself \nof those evils. To destroy it root and branch is to remove that \ncapacity from it and revert to a dull, sunless and miserable ex- \nistence. But even if that were desirable it is an impossible un- \ndertaking. We cannot stop the river of change or cut ourselves \nadrift from it, and psychologically we who have eaten of the \napple of Eden cannot forget that taste and go back to primi- \ntiveness. \n\nIt is difficult to argue this, for the two standpoints are utterly \ndifferent. Gandhiji is always thinking in terms of personal \nsalvation and of sin, while most of us have society\u2019s welfare \nuppermost in our minds. I find it difficult to grasp the idea of \nsin, and perhaps it is because of this that I cannot appreciate \nGandhijrs general outlook. He is not out to change, society or \nthe social structure, he devotes himself to the eradication of \nsin from individuals. \u201cThe follower of swadeshi,\u201d he has \nwritten, \" never takes upon himself the vain task of trying to \nreform the world, for he believes that the World is moved and \n\n\n\n\u00a3 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nalways will be moved according to the rules set by God.\u2019\u2019 And \nyet he is aggressive enough in his attempts to reform the world; \nbut the reform he aims at is individual reform, the conquest \nover the senses and the desire to indulge them, which is sin. \nProbably he will agree with the definition of liberty which an \nable Roman Cathdic writer on Fascism has given: \u201cLiberty \nis no more than freedom from the bondage of sin.\u201d How \nalmost identical this is with the words of the Bishop of London \nwritten, two hundred years ago: \u201cThe Freedom which Chris- \ntianity gives is Freedom from the Bondage of sin and Satan \nand mom the Dominion of Men\u2019s Lusts and Passions and \ninordinate Desires.\u201d ^ \n\nIf this standpoint is once appreciated then one begins to \nunderstand a little Gandhiji's attitude to sex, extraordinary as \nthat seems to the average person to-day. For him \u201c any union is \na crime when the desire for progeny is absent \u201d, and \u201c the adop- \ntion of artificial methods must result in imbecility and nervous \nprostration.\u201d \u201c It is wrong and immoral to seek to escape the \nconsequences of one\u2019s acts. ... It is bad for him to indulge \nhis appetite and then escape the consequences by taking tonics \nor other medicines. It is still worse for a person to indulge his \nanimal passions and escape the consequences of his acts.\u201d \n\nPersonally I find this altitude unnatural and shocking, and \nif he is right, then I am a criminal on the verge of imbecility \nand nervous prostration. The Roman Catholics have also \nvigorously opposed birth-control, but they have not carried their \nargument to the logical limit as Gandhiji has done. They have \ntemporised and compromised with what they considered to be \nhuman nature.^ But Gandhiji has gone to the extreme limit of \nhis argument and does not recognise the validity or necessity \nof the sexual act at any time except for the sake of children; \nhe refuses to recognise any natural sex attraction between man \nand woman. \"But I am told,\u201d he says, \"that this is an im- \npossible ideal, that I do not take account of the natural attrac- \ntion between man and woman. I refuse to believe that the \nsensual affinity, referred to here, can be at all regarded as \n\n^ Tins letter is quoted on page , ante. \n\n* Pope Pius XI in his Encyclical on ChrisUan Marriage, issued on \nDecember , , says: \u201c Nor must married people be considered \nto act against the order of nature if they make use of their rights \naccording to sound and natural reason, even though no new life \ncan thence arise on account of circumstance of time or the existence \nof some defect,\u201d The \u201c circumstance of time \u201d apparently refers to \nthe so-called \u201c safe period \u201d when conception is unlikely. \n\n\n\nDESOLATION \n\n\nSI \n\nnatural; in that case the deluge would soon be over us. The \nnatural affinity between man and woman is the attraction \nbetween brother and sister, mother and son, or father and \ndaughter. It is this natural attraction that sustains the world.\u201d \nAnd more emphatically stiU : \u201c No, I must declare with all the \npower I can command that sensual attraction, even between \nhusband and wife, is unnatural.\u201d \n\nIn these days of the Oedipus complex and Freud and the \nspread of psychoanalytical ideas this emphatic statement of \nbelief sounds strange and distant. One can accept it as an act \nof faith or reject it. There is no half-way house, for -it- is -a - \nquestion of faith, not of reason. For my part I think Gandhiji \nis absolutely wrong in this matter. His advice may fit in with \nsome cases, but as a general policy it can only lead to frustra- \ntion, inhibition, neurosis, and all manner of physical and \nnervous ills. Sexual restraint is certainly desirable, but I doubt \nif Gandhiji\u2019s doctrine is likely to result in this to any wide- \nspread extent. It is too extreme, and most people decide that \nit is beyond their capacity and go their usual ways, or there \nis friction between husband and wife. Evidently Gandhiji \nthinks that birth-control methods necessarily mean inordinate \nindulgence in the sex act, and that if the sexual affinity between \nman and woman is admitted, every man will run after every \nwoman, and vice versa. Neither inference is justified, and I do \nnot know why he is so obsessed by this problem of sex, im- \nportant as it is. For him it is a \u2018 soot or whitewash \u2019 question, \nthere are no intermediate shades. At either end he takes up an \nextreme position which seems to me most abnormal and un- \nnatural. Perhaps this is a reaction from the deluge of literature \non sexology that is descending on us in these days. I presume \nI am a normal individual and sex has played its part in my life, \nbut it has not obsessed me or diverted me firom my other \nactivities. It has been a subordinate part. \n\nEssentially, his attitude is that of the ascetic who has turned \nhis back to the world and its ways, who denies life and con- \nsiders it evil. For an ascetic that is natural, but it seems far, \nfetched to apply it to men and women of the world who \naccept life and try to make the most of it. And in avoiding one \nevil he puts up with many other and graver evils. \n\nI have drifted to other topics, but in those distressful days in \nAUpore Gaol all these ideas crowded in my mind, not in \nlogical order or sequence, but in a wild jumble which confused \nme and oppressed me. Above all there was the feeling of \nloneliness and desolation, heightened by the stifling atmosjrtiere \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nof the gaol and my lonely little cell. If I had been outside the \nshock would have been more momentary, and I would have \nadjusted myself sooner to new conditions, and found relief in \nexpression and action. Inside the prison there was no such \nrelief, and I spent some miserable days. Fortunately for myself \nI am resilient and recover soon from attacks of pessimism. I \nbegan to grow out of my depression, and then I had an inter- \nview in gaol with Kamala. That cheered me up tremendously, \nand my feeling of isolation left me. Whatever happened, I felt, \nwe had one another. ",
    "1932-1936": " NINETEEN TWENTY-ONE AND THE FIRST \nIMPRISONMENT \n\nNineteen twenty-one was an extraordinary year for us. There \nwas a strange mixture of nationalism and politics and religion \nand mysticism and fanaticism. Behind all this was agrarian \ntrouble and, in the big cities, a rising working-class movement. \nNationalism and a vague but intense country-wide idealism \nsought to bring together all these various, and sometimes mutu- \nally contradictory, discontents, and succeeded to a remarkable \ndegree. And yet this nationalism itself was a composite force, \nand behind it could be distinguished a Hindu nationalism, a \nMuslim nationalism partly looking beyond the frontiers of \nIndia, and, what was more in consonance with the spirit of the \ntimes, an Indian nationalism. For the time being they over- \nlapped and all pulled together. It was Hindu-Musalman hi Jai \neverywhere. It was remarkable how Gandhiji seemed to cast a \nspell on all classes and groups of people and drew them into \none motley crowd strug^ing in one direction. He became, in- \ndeed (to use a phrase which has been applied to another leader), \n\" a symbolic expression of the confused desires of the people \u201d. \n\nEven more remarkable was the fact that these desires and \npassions were relatively free from hatred of the alien rulers \nagainst whom they were directed. Nationalism is essentially an \nanti-feeling, and it feeds and fattens on hatred and anger against \nother national groups, and especially against the foreign rulers \nof a subject country. There was certainly this hatred and anger \nin India in  against the British but, in comparison with \nother countries similarly situated, it was extraordinarily litde. \nUndoubtedly this was due to Gandhiji\u2019s insistence on the impli- \ncations of non-violence. It was also due to the feeling of release \nand power that came to the whole country with the inaugura- \ntion of the movement and the wide^read belief in success in \nthe near fiiture. Why be angry and full of hate when we were \ndoing so well and were likely to win through' soon? We felt that \nwe could afford to be generous. \n\nWe were not so generous in our hearts, though our actions \nwere circumspect and proper, towards the handfel of our own \ncountrymen who took sides against us and opposed the national \nmovement. It was not a question of hatred or anger, for they \n\n.fi \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ncarried no weight whatever and we could ignore them. But deep \nwithin us was contempt for their weakness and opportunism and \nbetrayal of national honour and self-respect. \n\nSo we went on, vaguely hut intensely, the exhilaration of \naction holding us in its grip. But about our goal there was an \nentire absence of clear thinking. It seems surprising now, how \ncompletely we ignored the theoretical aspects, the philosophy of \nour movement as well as the definite objective that we should \nhave. Of course we all grew eloquent about Swaraj, but each one \nof us probably interpreted the word in his or her own way. To \nmost of the younger men it meant political independence, or \nsomething like it, and a democratic form of government, and \nwe said so in our public utterances. Many of us also thought \nthat inevitably this would result in a lessening of the burdens \nthat crushed the workers and the peasantry. But it was obvious \nthat to, most of our leaders Swaraj meant something much less \nthan independence. Gandhiji was delightfully vague on the \nsubject, and he did not encourage clear thinking about it either. \nBut he always spoke, vaguely but definitely, m terms of the \nunder-dog, and this brought great comfort to many of us, \nalthough, at the same time, he was full of assurances to the top- \ndog also. Gandhiji\u2019s stress was never on the intellectual approatm \nto a problem but on character and piety. He did succeed amaz- \ningly in giving backbone and character to the Indian people. \nThere were many, however, who developed neither much back- \nbone nor character, but who imagined that a limp body and a \nflabby look might be the outward semblance of piety. \n\nIt was this extraordinary stiffening-up of the masses that filled \nus with confidence. A demoralized, backward, and broken-up \npeople suddenly straightened their backs and lifted their heads \nand took part in disciplined, joint action on a country-wide scale. \nThis action itself, we felt, would give irresistahle power to the \nmasses. We ignored the necessity of thought behind the action; \nwe forgot that without a conscious ideology and objective the \nenergy and enthusiasm of the masses must end largely in smoke. \nTo some extent the revivalist element in our movement carried \nus on; a feeling that non-violence as concrived for political or \neconomic movements or for righting wrongs was a new message \nwhich our people were destined to mve to the world. We be- \ncame victims to the curious illusion of all peoples and all nations \nthat in some way they are a chosen race. Non-violence was the \nmoral equivalent of war and of aU violent struggle. It was not \nmerely ethical alternative, but it was efeitive also. Few of \nus, I think, accepted Gandhiji\u2019s old ideas about machinery \n\n\n\n\u25a0JIHE FIRS'i IMPRISONMENT  \n\nand modern civilization. We thought that even he looked upon \nthem as utopian and as largely mapplicable to modern con- \nditions. Certainly most of us were not prepared to reject the \nachievements of modern civilization, although we may have \nfelt that some variation to suit Indian conditions was possible. \nPersonally, I have always felt attracted towards big machinery \nand fast travelling. Still there can be no doubt that Gandhiji\u2019s \nideology influenced many people and made them critical of the \nmachine and all its consequences. So, while some looked to the \nfuture, others looked back to the past. And, curiously, both felt \nthat the joint action they were indulging in was worth while, \nand this made it easy to bear sacrifice and face self-denial. \n\nI became wholly absorbed and wrapt in the movement, and \nlarge numbers of other people did likewise. I gave up all my \nother associations and contacts, old friends, books, even news- \npapers, except in so far as they dealt with the work in hand. \nI had kept up till then some reading of current books and had \ntried to follow the developments of world affairs. But there \nwas no time for this now. In spite of the strength of my family \nbonds, I almost forgot my family, my wife, my daughter. It \nwas only long afterwards that I realised what a burden and a \ntrial I must have been to them in those days, and what amazing \npatience and tolerance my wife had shown towards me. I lived \nin offices and committee meetings and crowds. \u201cGo to the \nvillages \u201d was the slogan, and we trudged many a mile across \nfields and visited distant villages and addressed peasant meetings. \nI experienced the thrill of mass-feeling, the power of influencing \nthe mass. I began to understand a little the psychology of \nthe crowd, the difference between the city masses and the \npeasantry, and I felt at home in the dust and discomfort, the \npushing and jostling of large gatherings, though their want of \ndiscipline often irritated me. Since those days I have sometimes \nhad to face hostile and angry crowds, worked up to a state when \na spark would light a flame, and I found that that early ex- \nperience and the confidence it begot in me stood me in good \nstead. Always I went straight to the crowd and trusted it, and \nso far I have always had courtesy and appreciation ftom it, even \nthough there was no agreement. But crowds axe fickle, and the \nfuture may have different experiences in store for me. \n\n, I took to the crowd and the crowd took to me, and yet I never \nlost myself in it; always I felt apart from it. From my separate \nmental perch I looked at it critically, and I never ceased to \nwonder how I, who was so, different in every way from those \nthousands who surrounded me, different in -habits, in desires. \n\n\n\ny JAWAHAELAL NEHRU \n\nin mental and spiritual outlook, how I had managed to gain \ngoodwill and a measure of confidence from these people. Was \nit because they took me for something other than I was? \nWould they bear with me when they knew me better? Was I \ngaining their goodwill under false pretences? I tried to be frank \nand straightforward to them; I even spoke harshly to them \nsometimes and criticised many of their pet beliefs and customs, \nbut still they put up with me. And yet I could not get rid of \nthe idea that their affection was meant not for me as  was, but \nfor some fanciful image of me that they had formed. How long \ncould that false image endure? And why should it be allowed \nto endure? And when it fell down and they saw the reality, \nwhat then? \n\nI am vain enough in many ways, but there could be no question \nof vanity with these crowds of simple folk. There was no' posing \nabout them, no vulgarity, as in the case of many of us of the \nmiddle classes who consider ourselves their betters. They were \ndull certainly, uninteresting individually, but in the mass they \nproduced a feeling of overwhelming pity and a sense of ever- \nimpending tragedy. \n\n\u25a0very different were our conferences where our chosen workers, \nincluding myself, performed on the platform. There was suffi- \ncient posing there and no lack of vulgarity in our flamboyant \naddresses. All of us must have been to some extent guilty of \nthis, but some of the minor Khilafat leaders probably led the \nrest. It is not easy to behave naturally on a platform before \na large audience, and few of us had previous experience of such \npublicity. So we tried to look as, we imagined, leaders should \nlook, thoughtful and serious, with no trace of levity or frivolity. \n\"When we walked or talked or smiled we were conscious of \nthousands of eyes staring at us and we reacted accordingly. Our \nspeeches were often very eloquent but, equally often, singularly \npointless. It is difficult to see oneself as others see one. And so, \nunable to criticise myself, I took to watching carefully the ways \nof others, and I found considerable amusement in tnis occupa- \ntion. And then the terrible thought would strike me that I might \nperhaps appear equally ludicrous to others. \n\nRight through the year igai individual Congress workers were \nbeing arrested and sentenced, but there were no mass arrests. \nThe All Brothers had received long sentences for inciting the \nIndian Army to disaffection. Their words, for which they had \nbeen sentenced, were repeated at hundreds of platforms by \nthousands of persons. I was threatened in the summer with \nproceedings for sedition because of some speeches I had de- \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST IMPRISONMENT  \n\nlivered. No such step, however, was taken then. The end of the \nyear brought matters to a head. The Prince of Wales was \ncoming to India, and the Congress had proclaimed a boycott \nof all the functions in connection with his visit. Towards the \nend of November the Congress volunteers in Bengal were de' \ndared illegal and this was Allowed by a similar declaration for \nthe United Provinces. Deshbandhu Das gave a stirring message \nto Bengal : \u201c I feel the handcuffs on my wrists and the weight \nof iron chains on my body. It is the agony of bondage. The \nwhole of India is a vast prison. The work of the Congress must \nbe carried on. What matters it whether I am taken or left? \nWhat matters it whether I am dead or alive? \u201d In the U.P. we \ntook up the challenge and not only announced that our volun- \nteer organisation would continue to function, but published lists \nof names of volunteers in the daily newspapers. The first list \nwas headed by my father s name. He was not a volunteer but, \nsimply for the purpose of defying the Government order, he \njoined and gave his name. Early in December, a few days before \nthe Prince came to our province, mass arrests began. \n\nWe knew that matters had at last come to a head; the inevit- \nable conflict between the Congress and the Government was \nabout to break out. Prison was still an unknown place, the idea \nof going there still a novelty. I was sitting rather late one day \nin me Congress office at Allahabad trying to clear up arrears \nof work. An excited clerk told me that the police had come \nwith a search warrant and were surrounding the office building. \nI was, of course, a little excited also, for it was my first experience \nof the kind, but the desire to show off was strong, the wish to \nappear perfectly cool and collected, unaffected by the comings \nand goii^s of the police. So I asked a clerk to accompany the \npolice officer in his search round the office rooms, and insisted \non the rest of the staff carrying on their usual work and ignoring \nthe police. A little later a fiicnd and a colleague, who had been \narrested just outside the office, came to me, accompanied by \na policeman,\u2019 to bid me good-bye. I was so full of the conceit that \nI must treat these novel occurrences as everyday happenings \nthat I treated my colleague in a most unfeeling manner. Casu- \nally I asked him and the policeman to wait till I had finished \nthe letter I was writing. Soon news came of other arrests in \nthe city. I decided at last to go home and see what was happen- \ning there. I found tlie inevitable police searching part of the \nlarge house and learnt that they had come to arrest both father \nand me. \u2022 ^ \n\nNothing that we could have done would have fitted in so well \n\n\n\no \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nwith our programme of boycotting the Prince\u2019s visit. Where- \never he was taken he was met with hartals and deserted streets. \nAllahabad, when he came, seemed to be a city of the dead; \nCalcutta, a few days later, suddenly put a temporary stop to all \nthe activities of a great city. It was hard on the Prince of Wales; \nhe was not to blame, and ^ere was no feeling against him what- \never. But the Government of India had tried to exploit his \npersonality to prop up their decaying prestige. \n\nThere was an orgy of arrests and convictions, especially in the \nUnited Provinces and in Bengal. All the prominent Congress \nleaders and workers in these provinces were arrested, and or- \ndinary volunteers by the thousand went to prison. They were, \nat first, largely city men and there seemed to be an inexhaustible \nsupply of volunteers for prison. The U.P. Provincial Congress \nCommittee was arrested en bloc ( members) as they were actu- \nally holding a committee meeting. Many people, who had so far \ntaken no part in any Congress or political activity, were carried \naway by the wave of enthusiasm and insisted on being arrested. \nThere were cases of Government clerks, returning fiom thnr \nofiices in the evening, being swept away by this current and \nlanding in gaol instead of their homes. Young men and boys \nwould crowd inside the police lorries and refuse to come out. \nEvery evening we could near firom inside the gaol, lorry after \nlorry arriving outside heralded by our slogans and shouts. The \ngaols were crowded and the gaol officials were at their wits\u2019 ends \nat jhis extraordinary phenomenon. It happened sometimes that \na police lorry would bring, according to the warrant accom- \npanying it, a certain number of prisoners\u2014 no names were or \ncould be mentioned. Actually, a larger number than that men- \ntioned would emerge firom the lor^ and the gaol officials did \nnot know how to meet this novel situation. There was nothing \nin the Jail Manual about it. \n\nGradually the Government gave up the policy of indis- \ncriminate arrests; only noted workers were picked out. Gradu- \nally also the ffist flush of enthusiasm of the people cooled \ndown and, owing to the absence in prison of all the trusted \nworkers, a feeling of indecision and helplessness spread. But \nthe change was superflcial only, and there was stiU thunder in \nthe air ^d the atmosphere was tense and pregnant with \nrevolutionary possibilities. During the months of December a i \nand January igaa it is estimated that about thirty thousand \nperstjns were sentenced to imprisonment in connection with the \nnon-co-operation movement. W though most of the prominent \nmen and , workers were in prison, the leader of die whole \n\n\n\nTHE FIRST IMPRISONMENT \n\n\nl \n\nStruggle, Mahatma Gandhi, was still out, issuing from day to \nday messages and directions which inspired the people, as well \nas checking many an undesirable activity. The Government \nhad not touched him so far, for they feared the consequences, \nthe reactions on the Indian Army and the police. \n\nSuddenly, early in February , the whole scene shifted, \nand we in prison learnt, to our amazement and consternation, \nthat Gandhiji had stopped the aggressive aspects of our struggle, \nthat he had suspended civil resistance. We read that this was \nbecause of what had happened near the village of Chauri \nChaura where a mob of villagers had retaliated on some police- \nmen by setting fire to the police-station and burning half a \ndozen or so policemen in it. \n\nWe were angry when we learnt of this stoppage of our struggle \nat a time when we seemed to be consolidating our position and \nadvancing on all fronts. But our disappointment and anger in \nprison could do little good to any one, and civil resistance stopped \nand non-co-operation wilted away. After many months of strain \nand anxiety the Government breathed again, and for the first \ntime had the opportunity of taking the initiative. A few weeks \nlater they arrested Gandhiji and sentenced him for a long term \nof imprisonment. \n\n\n\n ARRESTS. ORDINANCES. PROSCRIPTIONS \n\n\nTwo days after our arrest Gandhiji landed in Bombay, and it \nwas only then that he learnt of the latest developments. He \nhad heard in London of the Bengal Ordinance, and had been \nmuch upset by it. He now found that fresh Christmas gifts \nawaited him in the shape of the U,P. and Frontier Ordinances, \nand some of his closest colleagues in the Frontier Province \nand the U-P. had been arrested. The die seemed to be cast \nand all hope of peace gone, but still he made an effort to find \na way out, and sought an interview with the Viceroy, Lord Wil- \nlingdon, for the purpose. The interview, he was informed from \nNew Delhi, could only take place on certain conditions\u2014 these \nconditions being that he must not discuss recent events in \nBengal, U.P. and the Frontier, the new Ordinances, and the \narrests under them. (I write from memory, and have not got \nthe text of the Viceregal reply before me.) What exactly \nGandhiji or any Congress leader was officially supposed to dis- \ncuss with tlie Viceroy, apart from these forbidden subjects \nwhich were agitating the country, passes one\u2019s comprehension. \nIt was absolutely dear now that the Government of India had \ndetermined to crush the Congress, and would have no dealings \nwith it. The Working Committee had no choice left but to \nresort to dvil disobedience. They expected arrest at any \nmoment, and they wanted to give a lead to the country before \ntheir enforced departure. Even so, the civil disobedience resolu- \ntion was passed tentatively, and another attempt was made by \nGandhiji to see the Viceroy, and he sent him a second telegram \nasking for an unconditional interview. The rg)ly of the Govern- \nment was to arrest Gandhiji as well as the Congress President, \nand to press the button which was to let loose fierce repression \nall over the country. It was dear that whoever else wanted or \ndid not want the struggle, the Government was eager and over- \nready for it. \n\nWe were in gaol, of course, and all this news came to us \nvaguely and disjointedly. Our trial was postponed to the New \nYear, and so we had, as under-trials, more interviews than a \nconvict could have. We heard of the great discussion that was \ngoing on as to whether the Viceroy should or should not have \nagreed to the interview, as if it really mattered either way. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU ' \n\nThis question of the interview shadowed all other matters. It \nwas stated that Lord Irwin would have agreed to the interview, \nand if he and Gandhiji had met all would have been well. I \nwas surmised at the extraordinarily superficial view that the \nIndian Press took of the situation and how they ignored \nrealities. Was the inevitable struggle between Indian National* \nism and British Imperialism \u2014 in the final analysis, two irrecon- \nciliables \u2014 ^to be reduced to the personal whims of individuals? \nCould the conflict of two historical forces be removed by \nsmiles and mutual courtesy? Gandhiji was driven to act in one \nway, because Indian Nationalism could not commit hara-kiri \nor submit willingly to foreign dictation in vital matters; the \nBritish Viceroy or India had to act in a particular way to meet \nthe challenge of this Nationalism and to endeavour to protect \nBritish interest, and it made not the slightest dif&rence who \nthe Viceroy was at the time. Lord Irwm would have acted \nexactly as Lord Willingdon did, for either of them was but the \ninstrument of British imperialist policy' and could only make \nsome minor deviations fi:om the line laid down. Lord Irwin, \nindeed, was subsequently a member of the British Govenunent, \nand he associated himself folly with the official steps taken in \nIndia. To praise or condemn individual Viceroys for British \npolicy in India seems to me a singularly inept thing to do, and \nour habit of indulging in this pastime can only be due to an \nignorance of the real issues or to a ddiberate evasion of them. \n\nJanuary th, a, was a notable day. It put a stop to argu- \nment and discussion. Early that morning Gandhiji and me \nCongress President, Vallabhbhai Patel, were arrested and con- \nfined without trial as State prisoners. Four new ordinances were \npromulgated giving the most far-reaching powers to magistrates \nand poUce of&ers. Civil liberty ceased to exist, and both person \nand property could be seizea by the authorities. It was a \ndeclaration of a kind of state of siege for the whole of India, \nthe extent and intensity of application being left to the dis- \ncretion of the local authorities.^ \n\nOn that th of January also our trial took place in Naini \nPrison under the UJP, Emergency Powers Ordinance, as it was \ncalled. Sherwani was sentenced to six months\u2019 rigorous im- \nprisonment and a fine of RB.; I was sentenced to two years\u2019 \nrigorous imprisonihent and a fine of Rs. (in default six \n\n^ Sir Samuel Hoare, Secretary of State for India, stated in the \nHouse of Commons on March , : \"I admit that the Ordi- \nnances that we have approved are drasdc and severe. They \ncover almost every activity of Indian lire.\u201d \n\n\n\nARRJtSJl'S, ORDINANCES, PROSCRIPTIONS  \n\nmonths more). Our offences were identical; we had been served \nwith identical orders of internment in Allahabad city; we had \ncommitted the same breach of them by attempting to go to- \ngether to Bombay; we had been arrested and tried together \nunder the same section, and yet our sentences were very dis- \nsimilar. There was, however, one difference: I had written to \nthe District Magistrate and informed him of my intendon to \ngo to Bombay in defiance of the order; Sherwani had given no \nsuch formal notice, but his proposed departure was equally well \nknown, and had been mentioned in the Press. Immecuately \nafter the sentence Sherwani asked the trying magistrate, to the \namusement of those present and the emb^arrassment of the \nmagistrate, if his smaller sentence was due to commimal con- \nslderadons. \n\nQuite a lot happened on that fateful day, January th, all \nover the country. Not far from where we were, in Allahabad \ncity, huge crowds came in conflict with the police and military, \nand there were the usual lathi charges involving deaths and \nother casualties. The gaols began to fill with civil disobedience \nprisoners. To begin virith, these prisoners went to the district \ngaols, and Naini and the other great central prisons received \nonly the overflows. Later, all the gaols filled up, and huge \ntempora^ camp gaols were established. \n\nVery few came to our little enclosure in Naini. My old \ncompanion, Narmada Prasad, joined us, and Banjit Pandit and \nmy cousin, Mohanlal Nehru. A surorising addition to our little \nbrotherhood of Barrack No.  was Bernard Aluvihare, a young \nfriend from Ceylon, who had just returned from England after \nbeing called to the Bar. He had been told by my sister not to \nget mixed up with our demonstrations; but, in a moment of \nenthusiasm, he joined a Congress procession \u2014 and a Black \nMaria carried him to prison. \n\nThe Congress had been declared illegal\u2014 the Working Com- \nmittee at the top, the Provindal Committees, and innumerable \nlocal committees. Together with the Congress all manner of \nallied or sympathetic or advanced organisations had been \ndeclared uJ^ti^l \u2014 ^kisan sabhas and peasant unions, youth \nleagues, students' associations, advanced political organisations, \nnational universities and schools, hospitals, swadeshi concerns, \nlibraries. The lists were indeed formidable, and contained \nmany hundreds of names for each major province. The all- \nIndia total must have run into several thousands, and this very \nnumber of outlawed organisations was in itself a tribute to the \nCongress and the National Movement. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NfcHRU \n\nMy wife lay in Bombay, ill in bed, fretting at her inability to \ntake part in civil disobedience. My mother and both my sisters \nthrew them.selves into the movement with vigour, and soon \nboth the sisters were in gaol with a sentence of a year each. Odd \nbits of news used to reach us through newcomers to prison or \nthrough the local weekly paper that we were permitted to read. \nWe could only guess much that was happening, for the press \ncensorship was strict, and the prospect of heavy penalties always \nfaced newspapers and news agencies. In some provinces it was \nan oflFence even to mention the name of a person arrested or \nsentenced. \n\nSo we sat in Naini Prison cut off from the strife outside, and \nyet wrapped up in it in a hundred ways; busying ourselves with \nspinning or reading or other activities, talking sometimes of \nother matters, but thinking always of what was happening \nbeyond the prison walls. We were out of it, and yet in it. \nSometimes the strain of expectation was veiy great; or there \nwas anger at something wrongly done; disgust at weakness or \nvulgarity. At other times we were strangely detached, and \ncould view the scene calmly and dispassionately, and feel that \npetty individual errors or weaknesses mattered little when vast \nforces were at play and the mills of the gods were grinding. \nWe would wonder what the morrow would bring of strife and \ntumult, and gallant enthusiasm and cruel repression and hate- \nful cowardice \u2014 and what was all this leading to? Whither were \nwe going? The future was hid firom us, and it was as well that \nit was hidden; even the present was partly covered by a veil, \nso far as we were concerned. But this we knew: that there \nwas strife and suflFering and sacrifice in the present and on the \nmorrow, \n\n\u201c Men will renew the battle in the plain \nTo-morrow; reel with blood will Xanthua be; \n\nHector and Ajax will be there again; \n\nHelen will come upon the wall to see. \n\n\u201c Then we shall rust in shade, or shine in strife, \n\nAnd fluctuate \u2019tween blind hopes and blind despairs. \n\nAnd fancy that we put forth all our life. \n\nAnd never know how with the soul it fares.\" \u2018 \n\n\n* Matthew Arnold.  DOUBT AND CONFLICT \n\nI OCCUPIED myself with many activities and sought thereby to \nkeep away from the problems that troubled me. But there was \nno escape from them, no getting away from the questions that \nwere always being formed in my mind and to which I could \nfind no satisfactory answer. Action now was partly an attempt to \nrun away from myself ; no longer was it a wholehearted expres- \nsion of the self as it had been in  and . I came out of the \nshell that had protected me then and looked round at the Indian \nscene as well as at the world outside. I found many changes that \nI had not so far noticed, new ideas, new conflicts, and instead of \nlight I saw a growing confusion. My faith in Gandhiji\u2019s leader- \nship remained, but I began to examine some parts of his pro- \ngramme more critically. But he was in prison and beyond our \nreach, and his advice could not be taken. Neither of the two \nCongress parties then functioning~the Council party and the \nNo-changers \u2014 attracted me. The former was obviously veering \ntowards reformism and constitutionalism, and these seemed to \nme to lead to a blind alley. The No-changers were supposed to \nhe the ardent followers of the Mahatma, but like most disciples \nof the great, they prized the letter of the teaching more than \nthe spirit. There was nothing dynamic about them, and in \npractice most of them were inoffensive and pious social re- \nformers. But they had one advantage. They kept in touch with \nthe peasant masses, while the Swarajists in the Councils were \nwholly occupied with parliamentary tactics. \n\nDeshbandhu Das tried, soon after my discharge from prison, \nto convert me to the Swarajist creed. I did not succumb to his \nadvocacy, though I was by no means clear as to what I should do. \nIt is curious and rather remarkable, but characteristic of him, \nthat my father, who was at the time very keen on the Swaraj \nParty, never tried to press me or influence me in that direction. \nIt was obvious that be would have been very pleased if I had \njoined him in his campaign, but with extraordinary considera- \ntion for me, he left me to myself so far as this subject was \nconcerned. \n\nDuring this period there grew up a close friendship between \nmy father and Mr. C. R. Das. It was something much more \nthan political camaraderie. There was a warmth and intimacy \n\n \n\n\n\nDOUBT AND CONFLICT IO \n\nin it that I was not a little surprised to notice, since intimate \nfriendships are perhaps rarely formed at advanced ages. My \nfather had a host of acquaintances, and. had the gift of laughing \nhis way through them, but he was chary of friendship, and \nin later years he had grown rather cynical. And yet between \nhim and Deshbandhu the barriers seemed to fall, and they took \neach other to heart. My father was nine years older, but was, \nphysically, probably the stronger and the healthier of the two. \nThough both had the same background of legal training and \nsuccess at the Bar, they differed in many ways. Mr. Das, in spite \nof being a lawyer, was a poet and had a poet\u2019s emotional \noutlook \u2014 believe he has written fine poetry in Bengali. He was \nan orator, and he had a religious temperament. My father was \nmore practical and prosaic; he was a great organiser, and he had \nlittle of religion in him. He had always been a fighter, reac^ to \nreceive and give hard blows. Those whom he considered mols \nhe suffered not at all, or at any rate not gladly ; and opposition \nhe could not tolerate. It seemed to him a challenge requiring \nthe use of a broom. The two, my fether and Deshbandhu, unlike \nin some ways as they were, fitted in and made a remarkable and \nefective combination for the leadership of a party, each in \nsome measure supplying the other\u2019s deficiencies. And between \nthe two of them there was absolute .confidence, so much so \nthat each had authorised the other to use his name for any \nstatement or declaration, even without previous referoice or \nconsultation. \n\nIt was this personal factor that went a long way to establish \nthe Swaraj Party firmly and give it strength and prestige in the \ncountry. From the earliest days there were fissiparous tendencies \nin it, for many careerists and opportunists had been drawn into \nit by the possibilities of personal advancement through the \nCouncils. There were also some genuine moderates in it who \nwere inclined to more co-operation with the Government. As \nsoon as these tendencies appeared on tlie surface after the \nelections, they were denounced by the Party leadership. My \nfather declared that he would not hesitate \u2018 to cut off a diseased \nlimb \u2019 firom the Party, he acted up to this declaration. \n\nFrom  onwards I found a great deal of solace and happi- \nness in family life, though I gave little time to it. I have been \nfortunate in my family relatitmships, and in times of strain and \ndifficulty they have soothed me and sheltered me. I realised, \nwith some shame at my own unworthiness in this respect, how \nmuch I owed to my wife for her splendid behaviour since ipao. \nProud and sensitive as she was, she had not only pat up with \n\n\n\nlo JAWAHARLAU NEHRU \n\nmy vagaries but brought me comfort and solace when I needed \nthem most. \n\nOur style of living had undergone some change since . \nIt was much simpler, and the number of servants had been \ngreatly reduced. Even so, it was not lacking in any essential \ncomfort. Partly to get rid of superfluities and partly to raise \nmoney for current expenditure, many things had been sold off- \nhorses and carriages, and household articles which did not fit in \nwith our new style of living. Part of our furniture had been \nseized and sold by the police. For lack of furniture and gar- \ndeners, our house lost its prim and clean appearance, and the \ngarden went wild. For nearly three years little attention had \nbeen paid to house or garden. Having become accustomed to a \nlavish scale of expenditure, father disliked many economies. He \ndecided therefore to go in for chamber practice in his spare time \nand thus earn some money. He had very little spare tune, but, \neven so, he managed to earn a fair amount. \n\nI felt uncomfortable and a little unhappy at having to depend \nfinancially on father. Ever since I had given up my legal practice \nI had practically no income of my own, except 'a trifle from \nsome dividends on shares. My wife and I did not spend much. \nIndeed, I was quite surprised to find how little we spent. This \nwas one of the discoveries made by me in  which brought \nme wear satisfaction. Khadi clothes and third-class railway \ntravdling demand little money. I did not fully realise then, living \nas we did with father, that tnere are innumerable other house- \nhold expenses which mount up to a considerable figure. Anyhow, \nthe fear of not having money has never troubled me ; I sup- \npose I could earn enough in case of necessity, and we can do \nwith relatively little. \n\nWe were not much of a burden on father, and even a hint of \nthis kind would have pained him greatly. Yet I disliked my \nposition, and for the next three years  thought over the problem \nwithout finding a solution. There was no great difficulty in my \nfinding paying work, but the acceptance of any such work \nnecessitated my giving up or, at any rate, my curtailing the \npublic work I was doing. So far I had given all my working time \nto Congress work and Municipal work. I did noc like to with- \ndraw from them for the sake of making money. So I refused \noffen, financially very advantageous, fi:om big industrial firms. \nProbably they were willing to pay heavily, not so much for \nmy competence as for the opportunity to exploit my name. I did \nnot lite the idea of being associated with big-industry in this \nway. To go back to the profession of law was also out of the \n\n\n\nDOUBT AKD CONFLICT IO \n\nquestion for me. My dislike for it had grown and kept on \ngrowing. \n\nA suggestion was made in the  Congress that the General \nSecretaries should be paid. I happened to be one of the secre- \ntaries then, and I welcomed the proposal. It seemed to me quite \nwrong to expect whole-time work from any one without paying \nhim a maintenance allowance at least. Otherwise some person \nwith private means has to be chosen, and such gentlemen of \nleisure are not perhaps always politically desirable, nor can they \nbe held responsible for the work. The Congress would not have \npaid much; our rates of payment were low enough. But there \nis in India an extraordinary and thoroughly unjustified preju- \ndice against receiving salaries from public funds (though not \nfrom the State), and my father strongly objected to my doing so. \nMy co-secretary, who was himself in great need of money, also \nconsidered it below his dignity to accept it from the Congress. \nAnd so I, who had no dignity in the matter and was perfectly \nprepared to accept a salary, had to do without it. \n\nOnce only I spoke to father on the subject and told him how \nI disliked the idea of my financial dependence, I put it to him \nas gently and indirectly as possible so as not to hurt him. He \npointed out to me how foolish it would be of me to spend my \ntinie, or most of it, in earning a little money, instead of doing \npublic work. It was far easier for him to earn with a few days\u2019 \nwork all that my wife and I would require for a year. The argu- \nment was weighty, but it left me unsatisfied. However, I con- \ntinued to act in consonance tvith it. \n\nThese family affairs and financial worries carried us from the \nbeginning of  to the end of . Meanwhile the political \nsituation had been changing and, almost against my will, I was \ndragged into various combinations and acceptance of responsible \noffice in the All-India Congress. The position in  was a \npeculiar one. Mr. C. R, Das had been the President of tire \npreceding Congress at Gaya. As such, he was the ex-officio \nChairman of me All-India Congress Committee for the year \n. But in this Committee there was a majority against him \nand the Swarajist policy, though the majority was a small one, \nand the two groups were pretty evenly balanced. Matters came \nto a head in the early summer of  at a meeting of the \nA,I.C,C. in Bombay, Mr. Das resigned from the chairmanship, \nand a small centre group emerged and formed the new Working \nCommittee. This centre group had no backing whatever in the \nA.I.C.C., and could only exist with the goodwill of one of the \ntwo main parties. Allied to either, it could just defeat the other. \n\n\n\nI JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nDr. Ansari was the new President, and I was one of the \nsecretaries. \n\nWe soon got into trouble on both sides. Gujrat, which was a \nno-change stronghold, refused to carry out some of the directions \nof the central oflBce. Late in the summer of the same year \nanother meeting of the A.I.C.C. was held, this time in Nagpur, \nwhere the National Flag Satyagraha was being carried on. \nOur Working Committee, representing the unfortunate Centre \nGroup, came to an end here after a brief and inglorious career. \nIt had to go because it repre.sented nobody in particular, and it \ntried to boss it over those who held the real power in the Con- \ngress organisation. The resignation was brought about by the \nfailure of an attempt to censure Gujrat for its indiscipline. I \nremember how gladly I sent in my resignation and how relieved \nI felt. Even a short experience of party manoeuvres had been too \nmuch for me, and I was quite shocked at the way some promi- \nnent Congressmen could intrigue. \n\nAt this meeting Mr. C. R. Das accused me of being 'cold- \nblooded \u2019. I suppose he was right ; it depends on the standard \nused for comparison. Compared to many of my friends and \ncolleagues I am cold-blooded. And yet I have always been afraid \nof being submerged in or swept away by too much sentiment \nor emotion or temper. For years I have tried my hardest to \nbecome 'cold-blooded\u2019, and I fear that the success that has \nattended me in this respect has been superficial only.  AN INTERLUDE AT NABHA \n\nThe tug-of-war between the Swarajists and the No-changers \nwent on, the former gradually gaining. Another stage, marking \na Swarajist advance, was reached at a special session of the \nCongress held at Delhi in the autumn of . It was \nimmediately after this Congress that I had a strange and un- \nexpected adventure. \n\nThe Sikhs, and especially the Akalis among them, had been \ncoming into repeated conflict with the Government in the Pun- \njab. A revivalist movement among them had taken it upon \nItself to purge their Gurdwaras by driving out corrupt Mahants \nand taking possession of the places of worship and the property \nbelonging to them.' The Government intervened and there was \nconflict. The Gurdwara movenient was partly due to the general \nawakening caused by non-co-operation, and the methods of the \nAkalis were modelled on non-violent Satyagraha. Many incidents \ntook place, but chief among them was the famous Guru-ka-Bagh \nstruggle, where scores of Sikhs, many of them eac-soldiers, \nallovired themselves to be brutally beaten by the police without \nraising their hands or turning back flom their mission. India \nwas startled by this amazing display of tenacity and courage. \u2018 \nThe Gurdwara Committee was declared illegal oy the Govern- \nment, and the struggle continued for some years and ended in \nthe victory of the Sikhs. The Congress was naturally sympa- \nthetic, and for some time it had a special liaison officer in \nAmritsar to keep in close touch with the Akali movement. \n\nThe incident to which I am going to refer had little to do with \nthis general Sikh movement, but there is no doubt that it \noccurred because of this Sikh upheaval. The rulers of two Sikh \nStates in the Punjab, Patiala, and Nabha, had a bitter, personal \nquarrel which resulted ultimately in the deposition of the \nMaharaja of Nabha by the Government of India. A British \nAdministrator was appointed to rule the Nabha State. This \ndeposition was resented by the Sikhs, and they agitated against \nit both in Nabha and outside. In the course of diis agitation, \na religious ceremony, at a place called Jaito in Nabha State, was \nstopped by the new Administrator. To protest against this, and \nwith the declared object of continuing the interrupted cere- \nmony, the Sikhs began sending jathas (batches of men) to Jaito; \n\nICO \n\n\n\nno JAWAHARLAL NEHBU \n\nThese jathas were stopped, beaten by the police, arrested, and \nusually carried to an out-oTthe-way place in the jungle and left \nthere. I had been reading accounts of these beatings from, time \nto time, and when I learnt at Delhi, immediately after the \nSpecial Congress, that another jatha was going and I was in- \nvited to come and see what happened, I gladly accepted the \ninvitation. It meant the loss of only a day to me, as Jaito was \nnear Delhi. Two of my Congre.ss colleagues \u2014 ^A. T. Gidwani and \nK, Santanum of Madras \u2014 accompanied me. The jatha marched \nmost of the way. It was arranged that we should go to the \nnearest railway station and then try to reach by road the Nabha \nboundary near Jaito just when the jatiin was due to arrive there. \nWe arrived in time, having come in a country cart, and followed \nthe jatha, keeping apart from it. On arrival at Jaito the jatha \nwas stopped by the police, and immediately an order was served \non me, signed by the English Administrator, calling upon me \nnot to enter Nabha territory, and if I had entered it, to leave it \nimmediately, A similar order was served on Gidwani and \nSantanum, but without their names being mentioned, as the \nNabha authorities did not know them. My colleagues and I told \nthe police officer that we were there not as part of the jatha but \nas spectators, and it was not our intention to break any of the \nNabha laws. Besides, when we were already in the Nabha ter- \nritories there could be no question of our not entering them, \nand obviously we could not vanish suddenly into thin air. \nProbably the next train from Jaito went many hours later. So \nfor the present, we told him, we proposed to remain there. We \nwere immediately arrested and taken to the lock-up. After our \nremoval the jatha was dealt with in the usual manner. \n\nWe were kept the whole day in the lock-up and in the evening \nwe were marched to the station. Santanum and I were hand- \ncuffed together, his left wrist to my right one, and a \nattached to the handcuff was held by the policeman leading us. \nGidwani, also handcuffed and chained, brought up the rear. \nThis march of ours down the streets of Jaito town reminded me \nforably of a dog being led on by a chain. We felt somewhat \nIrritated to begin with, but the humour of the situation dawned \nupon us, and on the whole we enjoyed the experience. We did \nnot OTjoy night that followed. This was partly spent in \ncrowded third-class compartments in slow-moving trains, with \nA \u00ab S\u2019 midnight, and partly in a lock-up at Nabha. \n\nthis ttme, till the forenoon of next day, when we were finally \ndelivered up at the Nabha Gaol, the joint handcuff and the \nheavy chain kept us company. Neither of us could move at all \n\nwithout the other\u2019s co-operation. To be bandcufi'ed to another \nperson for a whole night and part of a day is not an experience \nI should like to repeat. \n\nIn Nabha Gaol we were all three kept in a most unwholesome \nand insanitary cell. It was small and damp, with a low ceiling \nwhich we could almost touch. At night we slept on the floor, \nand I would wake up with a start, full of horror, to find that a \nrat or a mouse had just' passed over my face. \n\nTwo or three days later we were taken to court for our case, \nand the most extraordinary and Gilbertian proceedings went on \nthere from day to day. The magistrate or judge seemed to he \nwholly uneducated. He knew no English, of course, but I doubt \nif he knew how to write the court language, Urdu. We watched \nhim for over a week, and during all this time he never wrote a \nline. If he wanted to write anything he made the court reader \ndo it. We put in a number of small applications. He did not \npass any orders on them at the time. He kept them and pro- \nduced them the next day with a note written by somebody else \non them. We did not formally defend ourselves. We had got \nso used to not defending cases in court during the non-co- \noperation movement that the idea of defence, even when \nit was manifestly permissible, seemed almost indecent. But \nI gave the court a long statement containing the facts, as well \nas my own opinion about Nahha ways, especially under British \nadministration. \n\nOur case was dragging on firom day to day although it was a \nsimple enough affair. Suddenly there was a diversion. One after- \nnoon after the court had risen for the day we were kept waiting \nin the building; and late in the evening, at about  p.ra., we were \ntaken to another room where a person was sitting by a table \nand there were some other people about. One man, our old friend \nthe police officer who had arrested us at Jaito, was there, and he \ngot up and began making a statement, I inquired where we \nwere and what was happening. I was informed that it was a \ncourt-room .and we were being tried for conspiracy. This was an \nentirely different proceeding firom the one we had so for at- \ntended, which was for breadi of the order not to enter Nabha \nterritory. It was evidently thought that the maximum sentence \nfor this breach being only six months was not enough punish- \nment for us and a more serious charge was necessary. Apparently \nthree were not enough for conspiracy, and so a fourth man, who \nhad absolutely nothing to do with us, was arrested and put on his \ntrial with us. This unhapj^y man, a Sikh, was not known to us, \nbut we had just seen him m the fields on our Way to Jaito. \n\n\n\nII \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nThe lawyer in me was rather taken aback by the casu alness \nwith which a conspiracy trial had been started. The case t^s a \ntotally false oheTiJUt decency required that some formalities \nshould be observed. I pointedout to the judge that we had had \nno notice whatever and that we might have wanted to make \narrangements for our defence. This did not worry him at all. It \nwas the Nabha way. If we wanted to engage a lawyer for our \ndefence we could chose some one in Nabha. When I suggested \nthat I might want some lawyer from outside I was told that this \nwas not permitted under the Nabha rules. We were fiirther \nenlightened about the peculiarities of Nabha procedure. In \nsome disgust we told the judge to do what he liked, but so far \nas we were concerned we would take no part in the proceedings. \nI could not wholly adhere to this resolve. It was difficult to listen \nto the most astounding lies about us and remain silent, and so \noccasionally we expressed our opinion, briefly but pointedly, \nabout the witnesses. We also gave the court a statement in writ- \ning about the facts. This second judge, who tried the conspiracy \ncase, was more educated and intelligent than the other one. \n\nBoth these cases went on and we looked forward to our daily \nvisits to the two courts-rooms, for that meant a temporary escape \nfrom the foul cell in gaol. Meanwhile, we were approached, on \nbehalf of the Administrator, by the Superintendent of the'gaol, \nand told that if we would express our regret and give an under- \ntaking to go away from Nabha, the proceedings against us would \nbe dropped. We replied that there was nothing to express regret \nabout, so far as we were concerned; it was for the administra- \ntion to apologise to us. We were also not prepared to give any \nundertaking. \u00ae ^ \n\nAbout a fortnight after our arrest the two trials at last ended. \nAll this lime had been, taken up by the prosecution, for we were \nnot defending. Much of it had been wasted in long waits, for \nevery little difficulty that arose necessitated an adjournment or \na reference to^ some authority behind the scenes \u2014 ^probably the \nEnglish Administrator. On the last day when the prosecution \ncase was closed we handed in our written statements. The first \ncom adjourned and, to our surprise, returned a little later with \na bulky judgment written out in Urdu. Obviously this huge \npdgment could not have been written during the interval. It \nMd been prepared before our statements had been handed in. \nIhe judgment was not read out; we were merely told that we \nhad been awarded the maximum sentence of six months for \nbreach of the order to leave Nabha territory. \n\nIn the conspiracy case we were sentenced the same day to \n\n\n\nAN INTiHLUOJi, AT NABtlA  I  \n\neither eighteen months or two years, I forget which. This was to \nbe in addition to the sentence for six months. Thus we were \ngiven in all either two years or two and a half years. \n\nRight through our trial there had been any number of \nremarkable incidents which gave us some insight into the re- \nalities of Indian State administration, or rather the British \nadministration of an Indian State. TTie whole procedure was \nfarcical. Because of this I suppose no newspaperman or outsider \nwas allowed in court. The police did what they pleased, and \noften ignored the judge or magistrate and actually disobeyed \nhis directions. The poor magistrate meekly put up with this, \nbut we saw no reason why we should do so. On several occasions \nI had to stand up and insist on the police behaving and obeying \nthe magistrate. Sometimes there was an unseemly snatching of \npapers hy the police, and the magistrate, being incapable of \naction or of introducing order in his own court, we had partly \nto do his job ! The poor magistrate was in an imhappy position. \nHe was afraid of the police, and he seemed to be a little \nfrightened of us, too, for our arrest had been noised in the \npress. If this was the state of affairs when more or less pro- \nminent politicians like us w^e concerned, what, I wonder, would \nbe the fate of others less known? \n\nMy father knew something of Indian States, and so he was \ngreatly upset at my tmexpected arrest in Nabha. Only the fact \nof arrest was known; little else in the way of news could leak \nout. In his distress he even telegraphed to the Viceroy for news \nof me. Difficulties were put in the way of his visiting me in \nNabha, but he was\u2019 allowed at last to interview me in prison. He \ncould not be of any help to me, as I was not defending myself, \nand I begged him to go back to Allahabad and not to worry. He \nreturned, but he left a young lawyer colleague of ours, Kapil \nDev Malaviya, in Nabha to watch the proceedings. Kapil Dev\u2019s \nknowledge of law and procedure must have been considerably \naugmented by his brief experience of the Nabha Courts. The \npoHce tried to deprive him forcibly in open court of some papers \nthat he had. ' \n\nMost of the Indian States are well known for their, back- \nwardness and their semi-ffiudal conditions. They are personal \nautocracies, devoid even of competence or benevolence. Many \na strange thing occurs there whida never receives publidty. And \nyet their very inefficiency lessens the evil in some ways and \nlightens the burden, on. their unhappy people. For this is re- \nflected in a weak executive, and it results in making even tyranny \nand injustice inefficient. That does not make tyranny more \n\n\n\n  JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nbearable, but it does make it less far-reaching and widespread. \nIhe assumption of direct British control over an Indian State \nhas a curious result in changing this equilibrium. The semi- \nfeudal conditions are retained, autberaejr is kept, the old laws \nand procedure are still supposed to function, all the restrictions \non personal liberty and association and expression of opinion \n(and these are all-embracing) continue, but one change is made \nwhich alters the whole background. The executive becomes \nstronger and a measure of effiaency is introduced, and this leads \nto a tightening-up of all the feudal and autocratic bonds. In \ncourse of time the British administration would no doubt \nchange some of the archaic customs and methods, for they come \nin the way of efficient government as well as commercial pene- \ntration. But to begin with they take full advantage of them to \ntighten their hold on the people who have now to put up not \nonly with feudalism and autocracy, but with an efficient enforce- \nment of them by a strong executive. \n\nI saw something of this in Nabha. The State was under a \nBritish Administrator, a member of the Indian Civil Service, \nand he had the full powers of an autocrat, subject only to the \nGovernment of India. And yet at every turn we were referred \nto Nabha laws and procedure to justify the denial of the most \nordinary rights. We had to face a combination of feudalism \nand the modem bureaucratic machine with the disadvantages of \nof both and the advantages of neither. \n\nSo our trial was over and we had been sentenced. We did not \nknow what the judgments contained, but the solid fact of a long \nsentence had a sobering effect. We asked for copies of the \njud^ents, and were told to apply formally for them. \n\nTnat evening in gaol the Superintendent sent for us and \nshowed us an order of the Administrator under the Criminal \nProcedure Code suspending our sentences. There was no con- \ndition attached, and the legal result of that order was that the \nsentences ended so far as we were concerned. The Superintendent \nthen produced a separate order called an Executive Order, also \nissued by the Administrator, asking us to leave Nabha and not to \nreturn to the State without special permission. I asked for the \ncopies of the two orders, but they were refused. We were then \nescorted to the railway station and released there. We did not \nknow a soul in Nabha, and even the city gates had been closed \nfor the night. We found that a train was leaving soon for \nAmbala, and'we took this. From Ambala I went on to Delhi and \nAllahabad. \n\nFrom Allahabad I wrote to the Administrator requesting him \n\n\n\nAN INTERLUDE AT NABHA II \n\nto send me copies of his two orders, so that I might know exactly \nwhat they were, also copies of the two judgments. He refused \nto supply any of these copies. I pointed out that I might decide \nto file an ^peal, but he persisted in his refusal. In spite of \nrepeated efforts I have never had the opportunity to read these \njudgments, wrhich sentenced me and my two colleagues to two \nyears or two and a half years. For aught I know, these sentences \nmay still be hanging over me, and may take effect whenever \nthe Nabha authorities or the British Government so choose. \n\nThe three of us were discharged in this \u2018 suspended ' way, but \nI could never find out what had happened to the fourth mem- \nber of the alleged consjpiracy, the Sikh who had been tacked on \nto us for the second trial. Very likely he was not discharged. \nHe had no powerful friends or public interest to help him and, \nlike many another person, he sank into the oblivion of a State \nprison. He was not forgotten by us. We did what we could and \nthis was very little, and, I believe, the Gurdwara Committee \ninterested itself in his case also. We found out that he was one \nof the old \u2018 Komagata Maru \u2019 lot, and he had only recently come \nout of prison after a long period. The police do not believe in \nleaving such people out, and so they tacked him on to the \ntrumped-up charge against us. \n\nAll three of us \u2014 Gidwani, Samamim and I \u2014 ^brought an un- \npleasant companion with us firom our cell in Nabha Gaol. This \nwas the typhus germ, and each one of us had an attack of \ntyphoid. Mine was severe and for a while dangerous enough, \nbut it was the lightest of the three, and I was only bed-ridden \nfor about three or four weeks, but the other two were very \nseriously ill for long periods. \n\nThere was yet another sequel to this Nabha episode. Probably \nsix months, or more, later Gidwani was acting as the Congress \nrepresentative in Amritsar, keeping in touch with the Sikh \nGurdwara Committee. The Committee sent a special jatha of \nfive hundred persons to Jaito, and Gidwani decided to accom- \npany it as an observer to the Nabha border. He had no intention \nof entering Nabha territory. The jatha was fired on by the \npolice near the border, and many persons were, I believe, killed \nand wounded. Gidwani went to die help of the wounded when \nhe was pounced upon by the police and taken away. No pro- \nceedings in court were taken against him. He was simply kept \nin prison for the best part of a year when, utterly broken in \nhealth, he was discharged, \n\nGidwani\u2019s arrest and confinement seemed to me to be a mon- \nstrous abuse of executive authority. I wrote to , the Adminis- \n\n\n\nJAWAHARI.AL NEHRU \n\n\nIl \n\ntrator (who was still the same English member of the I.C.S.) \nand asked him why Gidwani had been treated in this way. He \nreplied that Gidwani had been imprisoned because he had \nbroken the order not to enter Nabha territory without per- \nmission. I challenged the legality of this as well as, of course, \nthe propriety of arresting a man who was giving succour to \nthe wounded, and I asked the Administrator to send me or pub- \nlish a copy of the order in question. He refused to do so. I felt \ninclined to go to Nabha myself and allow the Administrator \nto treat me as he had treated Gidwani. Loyalty to a colleague \nseemed to demand it. But many friends thought otherwise and \ndissuaded me. I took shelter behind the advice of friends, and \nmade of it a pretext to cover my own weakness. For, after all, \nit was my weakness and disinclination to go to Nabha Gaol again \nthat kept me away, and I have always felt a little ashamed of \nthus deserting a colleague. As often with us all, discretion was \npreferred to valour. \n\n IN EUROPE \n\nI was going back to Europe after more than thirteen years \u2014 \nyears of war, and revolution, and tremendous change. The old \nworld I knew had expired in the hlood and horror of the War \nand a new world awaited me. I expected to remain in Europe for \nsix or seven months or, at most, till the end of the year. Actually \nour stay lengthened out to a year and nine months. \n\nIt was a quiet and restful period for both my mind and body. \nWe spent it chiefly in Switzerland, in Geneva, and in a mountain \nsanatorium at Montana. My yoimger sister, Krishna, came from \nIndia and joined us early in Ae summer of , and remained \nwith us till the end of our stay in Europe. I could not leave my \nwife for long, and so I could only pay brief visits to other places. \nLater, when my wife was better, we travelled a little in France, \nEngland, and Germany. On our mountain-top, surrounded by \nthe winter snow, I felt completely cut off ftom India as well as \nthe European world. India, and Indian happenings, seemed \nespecially far away. I was a distant onlooker, reading, watching, \nfollowing events, gazing at the new Europe, its politics, eco- \nnomics, and the &r freer human relationships, and trying to \nunderstand them. When we were in Geneva I was naturally \ninterested in the activities of the I,eague of Nations and the \nInternational Labour Office. \n\nBut with the coming of winter, the winter sports absorbed \nmy attention ; for some months they were ray chief occupation \nand interest. I had done ice-skating previously, but sld-ing was \na new experimee, and I succumbed to its fascination. It was a \npainful experience for a long time, but I persisted bravely, in \nspite of innumerable falls, and I came to enjoy it. \n\nLife was very uneventful on the whole. The days went by and \nmy wife gradually gained strength and health. We saw few \nInffians ; indeed, we saw few people apart from the little colony \nhvmg in that mountain resort. But in the course of the year \n\nSpent in Europe, we came across some \nmdian exiles and old revolutionaries whosfe names had been \nfamiliar to me. \n\nThere was Shyamaji Krishnavarma living with his ailing wife \nhigh up the top floor of a house in Geneva. The aged couple \nlived by themselves with no whole-time servants, and their rooms \n\n\n\nIN EUROPE \n\n\n \n\nwere musty and suffocating, and everything had a thick layer \nof dust, Shyamaji had plenty of money, but he did not believe \nin spending it. He would even save a few centimes by walking \ninstead of taking the tram. He was suspicious of all comers, \npresuming them, until the contrary was proved, to be either \nBritish agents or after his money. His pockets bulged with \nancient copies of his old paper, the Indian Sociolo^t, and he \nwould pull them out and point with some excitement to some \narticle he had written a dozen years previously. His talk was \nof the old days, of India House at Hampstead, of the various \npersons that the British Government had sent to spy on him, and \nhow he had spotted them and outwitted them. The walls of his \nrooms were covered with shelves full of old books, dust-laden \nand neglected, looking down sorrowfully on the intruder. Books \nand papers also littered the floor; they seemed to have remained \nso for days and weeks, and even months past. Over the whole \nplace there hung an atmosphere -of gloom, an air of decay; \nlife seemed to be an unwelcome stranger there, and, as one \nwalked through the dark and silent corridors, one almost ex- \npected to come across, round the comer, the shadow of death. \nWith relief one came out , of that flat and breathed the air \noutside. \n\nShyamaji desired to make some arrangement about his money, \nto create some trust for a public purpose, preferably for the edu- \ncation of Indians in foreign countries. He suggested that I \nmight be one of the trustees, but I showed no keenness for \nshouldering this responsibility. I had no desire to get mixed up \nwith his financial affairs; and, besides, I felt that if I showed any \nundue interest he would immediately suspect me of coveting his \nmoney. No one knew how much he had. It was rumoured that \nhe had lost greatly in the German inflation. \n\nOccasionally prominent Indians used to pass through Geneva. \nThose who came to the League of Nations were of the official \nvariety, ^d Shyamaji would not, of coune, go anywhere near \nthem. But the Labour Office sometimes brought non-officiab \nof note, even prominent Congressmen, and Shyamaji would try \nto meet them. It was interesting to watch their reactions to him. \nInvariably they felt uncomfortable, and tried to avoid him in \npublic, and excused themselves, whenever they could, in private. \nHe was not considered a safo person with whom to be associated \nor seen \"with. \n\nAnd so Shyamaji and his wife lived their lonely life without \nchildren or relatives or friends, with hardly any associations, \nhardly any human contacts. He was a relic of the past, and had \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nreally outlived his day. He did not fit in with the present, and \nthe world passed him by, ignoring him. But there was still some \nof the old fire in his eyes, and though there was little in common \nbetween him and me, I could not withhold my sympathy and \nconsideration for him. \n\nRecently the newspapers reported his death, followed soon \nafter by the death of the gentle Gujrati old lady who had been \nhis life-long companion in exile in foreign lands. It was stated \nthat a large sum of money was left by her for the training of \nIndian women abroad. \n\nAnother well-known person whose name I had often heard, \nbut whom I met for the first time in Switzerland, was Raja \nMahendra Pratap. He was (and, I suppose, is still) a delightful \noptimist, living completely in the air and refusing to have any- \nthing to do with realities.  was a little taken aback when I first \nsaw him. He appeared in strange composite attire, which might \nhave been suit^le in the highlands of Tibet or in the Siberian \nplains, but was completely out of place at Montreux in the sum- \nmer. It was a kind of semi-military costume, with high Russian \nboots, and there were numerous large pockets, all biuring with \npapers, photographs, etc. There was a letter from Bethman- \nHoUweg, the German Chancellor, an autographed picture of* \nthe Kaiser, a fine scroll from the Dalai Lama of Tibet, and \ninnumerahle documents and pictures. It was amazing how much \nthose various pockets contained. He\u2019 told us that once he had \nlost a dispatch-box, containing valuable papers, in China, and \never since then he had considered it safer to carry his papers on \nhis person! Hence the numerous pockets. \n\nMahendra Pratap was full of stories of his wanderings and \nadventure in Japan, China, Tibet, and Afghanistan. He had \nled a varied life, and the record of it was an interesting one. \nHis latest enthusiasm was 'for a 'Happiness Society\u2019 which \nhe had himself founded, and which had for its motto : \u201d Be \nApparently this society had met with greatest success \nin Latvia (or was it Lithuania?). \n\nHis idea of propaganda was to send out periodically large \nnumbers of post cards containing a printed message from \nto members of various conferences that met in Geneva or else- \nwhere. These messages were signed by him, but the name given \nwas an extraordinary one\u2014 long and varied. * Mahendra Pratap \u2019 \nhad been reduced to initials,- but many other names had been \nadded, each addition representing apparently some favoured \ncountry he had visited. In this way he emphasized his inter- \nnational and cosmopolitan character, and, fittingly, the final \n\n\n\nIN EUROPE \n\n\n \n\ndescription below this unique name was \" Servant of Mankind \nIt was difficult to take Mahendra Pratap seriously. He seemed \nto be a character out of medieval -romance, a Don Quixote who \nhad strayed into the twentieth century. But he was absolutely \nstraight and thoroughly earnest. \n\nIn Paris we saw old Madame Cama, rather fierce and terri- \nfying as she came up to you and peered into your face, and, \npointing at you, asked abruptly who you were. The answer \nmade no difference (probably she was too deaf to hear it) for she \nformed her own impressions and stuck to them, despite facts to \nthe contrary. \n\nThen there was Moulvi Obeidulla, whom I met for a short \nwhile in Italy. He seemed to me to be clever, but rather in the \nsense of possessing an ability for old-style political manoeuvring. \nHe was not in touch with modern ideas. He had produced a \nscheme for the ' United States \u2019 or \u2018 United Republics of India \nwhich was quite an able attempt to solve the commvmal prob- \nlem. He tdld me of some of his pasi activities in Istanbul (it \nwas still called Constantinople then) and, not attaching mu^ \nimportance to them, I soon ffirgot about them. Some months \nlater he met Lala Lajpat Rai and, apparently, repeated the \nsame story to him. Lalaji was vastly impressed and exercised \nabout it, and that story, with many unjustifiable inferences \nand amazing deductions, played an important part in the \nIndian Council elections that year. Moulvi Obeidulla later went \nto the Hedjaz, and for years past no news of him has come my \nway. \n\nAnother Moulvi, but a different type entirely, was Barkatulla \nwhom I first met in Berlin. He was a ddightml old man, very \nenthusiastic and very likeable. He was ramer simple, not very \nintelligent, but still trying to imbibe new ideas and to under- \nstand the present-day world. He died in San Francisco in , \nwhile we were in Switzerland. I was grieved to learn of his \npassing away. \n\nIn Berlin there was quite a number of those who had ffirmed \nan Indian group in war-time, but the group had long gone to \npieces. They had feUen out and quarreUed amongst themselves, \neach suspecting the other of betrayal. That seems to be the \nfate of political exiles everywhere. Many of these Berlin Indians \nhad settled down to sedate middle-class occupations\u2014 when these \ncould be had, and that was not often in post-war Germany\u2014 -and \nhad ceased to be in any way revolutionary. They even avoided \npolitics. \n\nThe story of this old war-time group was interesting. Most of \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nthem were students in various German universities in that \nfeteful summer of . They lived a common life with the \nGerman students, sang their songs, joined in their games, drank \nbeer with them, and approached their culture with sympathy \nand consideration. The War was no concern of theirs, but they \ncould not help being moved to some extent by the wave, of \nnationalistic hysteria that swept over Germany. Their feeling \nwas really anti-British, and not pro-German, and their Indian \nnationalism inclined them to the enemies of Britain. Soon after \nthe outbreak of the War a few other Indians, more consciously \nrevolutionary, drifted into Germany through Switzerland. These \npeople formed themselves into a committee, and sent for Har- \ndayal, who was on the west coast of the United States at the \ntime. Hardayal came some months later, but meanwhile the \nCommittee had become quite important. This importance had \nbeen thrust upon them by the German Government, who were, \nnaturally, anxious to exploit all anti-British feelings to their \nown advantage. The Indians, on their part, wanted to take \nadvantage of the international simation for their own national- \nistic purposes, and had no intention of allowing themselves to \nbe exploited purely for Germany\u2019s advantage. They did not \nhave much choice in the matter, but they felt 'that they had \nsomething to give which the German authorities were keen on \nhaying, and this gave them a handle to bargain with. They \ninsist^ on assurances and pledges for Indian freedom. The \nGerman Foreign Office seems to have entered into a regular \ntreaty with them, in which it pledged itself to acknowledge \nIndian independence in case of victory, and it was on this pledge \nand condition, and many other minor conditions, that the Indian \n^oup promised support in the war. The Committee was offi- \ncially honoured in every way, md its representatives were treated \nalmost on the footing of foreign ambassadors. \n\nThis sudden importance, thrust on a small group consisting \nmainly of inexperienced young men, went to the heads of some \nof them. They felt that they were playing a historic rdle, that \nthey were involved in great and epoch-making undertaHngs. \nMany of them had exciting adventures, hair-breadth escapes. \nIn the later stages of the war, their importance visibly lessened, \nrad they began to be ignored. Hardayal, who had come over \nnrom America, had long been discarded. He did not fit in with \nthe Committee at all, and both the Committee and the German \nGoveanment considered him unreliable, and quietly pushed \nhim aside. Years later, when I was in Europe in ipafi and \ni  *  \u00bb I surprised to find with what bitterness and resent- \n\n\n\nIN EUROPE \n\n\n\u00ab \n\nmem most of the old Indian residents in Europe thought of \nHardayal. He lived at the time In Sweden. I did not meet \nhim. \n\nThe War ended, and with it ended finally the Indian Com- \nmittee in Berlin. Life became a dreary affair for them after the \nfailure of all their hopes. They had gambled for high stakes \nand lost. In any event, life would have seemed a humdrum \naffair after the nigh adventure and importance of those war- \ntime years. But even a secure, humdrum life was not to be had \nfor the asking. They could not return to India, and defeated \nGermany after the War was not an easy place to live in. It was \na hard struggle. A few of them were later allowed by the \nBritish Government to return to India, but many had to stay \non in Germany. Their position was peculiar. They were, \napparently, citizens of no State. They had no proper passports. \nTravel outside Germany was hardly possible, even residence in \nGermany was full of difficulties and was at the mercy of the \nlocal police. It was a life of insecurity and hardship, and day-to- \nday worry; of continual anxiety to find the wherewithal to eat \nand live. \n\nThe Nazi regime since early in  has added to their mis- \nfortunes, unless they fall in completely with the Nazi doctrine. \nNon-Nordic, and especially Asiatic, foreigners are not welcome \nin Germany; they are only suffered to exist so long as they \nbehave. Hitler has pointedly declared himself in favour of \nBritish imperialist rule in Inffia, no doubt because he wants to \ngain the goodwill of Britain, and he does not wish to encourage \nany Indians who may have displeased the British Government. \n\nOne of the exiles in Berlin whom we met, a prominent mem- \nber of the old war-time group, was Champakraman Pillai. He \nwas rather pompous, and young Indian students had given him \nan irreverent title. He could think in terms of nationalism only, \nand shrunk away from the social or economic approach to a \nquestion. With the German Nationalists, the Steelhelmets, he \nwas perfectly at home. He was one of the very few Indians in \nGermany who got on w:th the Nazis. A few months bade, in \ngaol, I read of his death in Berlin. \n\nAn entirely different type of person was Virendranath Chat - \ntopadhvava . member of a famous family in India. PopuIa:ff v \nknovm as Chatto . he was a very able and a very deliglit^l \nperson. He was always hard up, his dothes were very much \nthe worse for wear, and often he found it difficult to raise the \nwherewithal for a meal. But his humour and lightheartedness \nnever left him. He had been some years senior to me during my \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\neducational days in England. He was at Oxford when I went \nto Harrow. Since those days he had jiot returned to India, and, \nsometimes, a fit of homesickness came to him, when he longed \nto be back. All his home-ties had long been severed, and it is \nquite certain that if he came to India he would soon feel un- \nhappy and out of joint. But in spite of the passage of many \nyears and long wandering, the pull of the home remains. No \nexile can escape the malady of his tribe, that consumption of \nthe soul, as Mazzini called it. \n\nI must say that I was not greatly impressed by most of the \nIndian political exiles that I met abroad, although I admired \ntheir sacrifice, and sympathised with their sulferings and present \ndifficulties, which are very real. I did not meet many of them; \nthere are so many spread out all over the world. Only a few \nare known to us even by reputation, and the others have dropped \nout of the Indian world and been forgotten by thrir countrymen \nwhom they sought to serve. Of the few I met, the only persons \nwho impressed me intellectually were V. Chattopadhyaya and \nM. N. Roy. Roy I met for a brief half-hour in Moscow. He was \na leading Communist then, although, subsequently, his com- \nmunism drifted away from the orthodox Comintern brand, \nChatto was not, I believe, a regular Communist, but he was \ncommunistically inclined. Roy has been in an Indian prison \nfor more than three years now. \n\nThere were many other Indians floating about the face of \nEurope, talking a revolutionary language, making daring and \nfimtasdc suggestions, asking curious questions. They seemed \nto have the impress of the British Secret Service upon them. \n\nWe met, of course, many Europeans and Americans. From \nGeneva we went on a pilgrimage many a time (the first time \nwith a letter of introduction ftom Gandhijl) to the ViUa Olga \nat Villeneuve, to see Romain RoUand. Another precious \nmemory is that of Ernst Toller, the young German poet and \ndramatist, now, under Nazi rule, no longer a German; and of \nRoger Baldwin, of the Civil liberties Union of New York. In \nGeneva we also made fiiends with Dhan Gopal Mukerji, the \nauthor, who has settled down in America. \n\nBefore going to Europe I had met Frank Buchman, of the \nOxfmd Group Movement, in India. He had given me some of \nthe literature of his movement, and I had read it with amaze- \nment. Sudden conversions and confessions, and a reidvalist \natmosphere generally, seemed to me to go ill with intellectuality. \nI could not make out how some persons, who seemed obviouriy \nintelligent, should experience these strange emotions and be \n\n\n\nIN EUROPE \n\n\n \n\naffected by them to a great extent. I grew curious. I met Frank \nBuchman again, in Geneva, and he invited me to one of his \ninternational house-parties, somewhere in Rumania, I think, this \notie was. I was sorry I could not go and look at this new emo- \ntionalism at close quarters. My curiosity has thus remained \nunsatisfied, and the more I read of the growth of the Oxford \nGroup Movement, the more I wonder.  IN BAREILLY AND DEHRA DUN GAOLS \n\nAfter six weeks in Naini Prison I was transferred to the Bareilly \nDistrict Gaol. I was again keeping indifferent health and, much \nto my annoyance, I used to get a daily rise in temperature. \nAfter four months spent in Bareilly, when the summer tem- \nperature was almost at its highest, I was again transferred, this \ntime to a cooler place, Dehra Dun Gaol, at the foot of the \nHimalayas. There I remained, without a break, for fourteen \nand a half months, almost to the end of my two-year term. \nNews reached me, of course, from interviews and letters and \nselected newspapers, but I was wholly out of touch with much \nthat was happening and bad only a hazy notion of the principal \nevents. \n\nWhen I was discharged I was kept busy with personal affairs \nas well as the political situation as I found it then. After \na little more than five months of freedom I was brought back \nto prison, and here I am still. Thus, during the last three years \nI have been mostly in prison and out of touch with events, \nand I have had little opportunity of making myself acquainted \nin any detail with all that has happened during this period. \nI have still the vaguest of knowledge as to what took place \nbehind the scenes at the second Round Table Conference, which \nwas attended by Gandhiji. I have had no chance so far of a \ntalk with him on this subject, nor of discussing with him or \nothers much that has happened since. \n\nI do not know enough of those years a and  to \ntrace the development of our national struggle. But I knew \nthe stage and the background well and the actors also, and \nhad an instinctive appreciation of many a little thing that \nhappened. I could thus form a feir notion of the general com'se \nof the struggle. For the first four months or so civil diso- \nbedience functioned strongly and aggressively, and then there \nwas a gradual decline with occasional bursts. A direct action \nstruggle can only remain at a revolutionary pitch for a very \nshort time. It cannot remain static; it has to go up or down. \nCivil disobedience, after the first flush, went down slowly, but \nit could carry on at a lower levd &r long periods. In spite of \noutlawry, the All-India Congress orgamsation continued to \nfimetion with a fair measure of success. It kept in touch \n\n\n\nIN BAREILLY AND DEHKA DUN GAOLS  \n\nwith its provincial workers, sent instructions, received reports, \noccasionally gave financial assistance. \n\nThe provincial organisations also continued with more or less \nsuccess. I do not know much about other provinces during \nthose years when I was in prison, but I gathered some infor- \nmation about U.P. activities after my release. The U.P. Con- \ngress office functioned regularly right through a and till the \nmiddle of , when civil disobedience was first suspended by \nthe then acting Congress president, on the advice of Gandhiji. \nDuring this period frequent directions were sent to districts, \nprinted or cyclostyled bulletins issued regularly, district work \ninspected from time to time, and our National Service workers \npaid their allowances. Much of this work was necessarily secret \nwork; but the secretary of the Provincial Committee in charge \nof the office, etc., was always working as such, publicly, till he \nwas arrested and removed and another took his place. \n\nOur experience of  and a showed that it was easily \npossible mr us to organise a secret network of information all \nover India. Without much effort, and in spite of some oppo- \nsition, good results were produced. But many of us had the \nfeeling that secrecy did not fit in with the spirit of civil diso- \nbedience, and produced a damping effect on the mass conscious- \nness. As a small part of a big open mass-movement it was \nuseful, but there was always the danger, especially when the \nmovement was declining, of a few more or less inefi^tive secret \nactivities taking the place of the mass-movement. Gandhiji \ncondemned all secrecy in July . \n\nAgrarian no-tax movements flourished for some time in \nGujrat and the Kamatak, apart from the U.P. In both Gujrat \nand Karnatak there were peasant proprietors who refused to \npay their revenue to the Government, and suffered greatly \nbecause of this. Some effort, necessarily inadequate, was made \non behalf of the Congress to help the sufferers and relieve the \nmisery caused by the ejectments and confiscation of property. \nIn 'the U.P. no effort to help the dispossessed tenantry in this \nway was made by the Provincial Congress. The problem here \nwas a much vaster one (tenants are far more numerous than \npeasant proprietors), the area was much bigger, and the pro- \nvincial resources were very limited. It was quite impossible for \nus to help scores of thousands who had suffered because of \nthe campaign, and equally difficult for us to draw a line between \nthem and the vast numbers who were always on the starvation \nline. To help a, few thousands only would have led to trouble \nand bad blood. So we dedded not to give financial assis- \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ntance, and we broadcasted this fact right at the beginning, and \nour position was thoroughly appreciated by the peasantry. It \nwas wonderful how much they put up with without complaint \nor murmur. Of course, we tried to help individuals where we \ncould, especially the wives and children of workers who went \nto prison. Such is the poverty of this unhappy country that \neven one rupee per month was a godsend. \n\nRight through this period the U.P. Provincial Committee \n(which was, of course, a proscribed body) continued to pay the \nusual meagre allownances to its paid workers; and if they went \nto prison, as all of them did in turn, to support their families. \nThis was a major item in its budget. Then came the charge \nfor printing and duplicating leaflets and bulletins; this also \nwas a heavy charge. Travelling expenses formed another \nprincipal item, and some grants had to be given to the less \nprosperous districts. In spite of all these and other expenses \nduring a period of intensive mass-struggle against a powerful \nand entrenched government, the total expenditure of the U.P. \nProvincial Committee for twenty months from January a to \nthe end of August  were about Rs. ,, that is about \nRs. per month. (This figure does not include the separate \nexpenditure of some of the strong and more prosperous district \ncommittees like Allahabad, Agra, Cawnporc, Lucknow.) As a \nprovince, the U.P. kept in the very forefront of the struggle \nright through  and , and I think, considering the \nresults obtained, it is remarkable how little it spent. It would be \ninteresting to compare with this modest figure the provincial \nGovernment\u2019s special expenditure to crush civil disobedience. \nI imagine (though I have no knowledge) that some of the other \nmajor Congress provinces spent much more. But Behar was, \nfrom the Congress view-point, an even poorer province than its \nneighbour, the U.P., and yet its part in the struggle was a \nsplendid one. \n\nSo, gradually, the civil disobedience movement declined; but \nstill it carried on, not without distinction. Progressively it \nceased to be a mass movement. Apart from the severity of \nGovemment repression, the first severe blow to it came in Sep- \n,-tember  when Gandhi ji fasted for the first time on the \nHafijan issue. That fast roused mass consciousness, but it \ndirected it in another direction. Civil disobedience was finally \nkilled fisr all practical purposes by the suspension of it in May \n. It continued after that more in theory than in practice. \nIt is no doubt true that, even without that suspension, it would \nhave gradually petered out. India was numbed by the violence \n\n\n\nIN BAREILLY AND DEHRA DUN GAOLS  \n\nand harshness of repression. The nervous energy of the nation \nas a whole was for the moment exhausted, and it was not being \nre-charged. Individually there were still many who could cany \non civil resistance, but they functioned in a somewhat artificial \natmosphere. \n\nIt was not pleasant for us in prison to learn of this slow decay \nof a great movement. And yet very few of us had expected a \nflashing success. There was always an odd chance that some- \nthing flashing might happen if there was an irrepressible up- \nheaval of the masses. But that was not to be counted upon, \nand so we looked forward to a long struggle with ups and \ndowns and many a stalemate in between, and a progressive \nstrengthening of the masses in discipline and united action and \nideology. Sometimes in those early days of  I almost feared \na quick and spectacular success, for this seemed to lead inevit- \nably to a compromise leaving the \u2018 Governmentarians \u2019 and \nopportunists at the top. The experience of  had been \nrevealing. Success to be worth while should come when the \npeople generally were strong enough and clear enough in their \nideas to take advantage of it. Otherwise the masses would fight \nand sacrifice and, at the psychological moment, others would \nstep in gracefully and gather the spoils. There was grave \ndanger of this, because in the Congress itself there was a great \ndeal of loose thinking and no clear ideas as to what system of \ngovernment or society we were driving at. Some Congressmen, \nindeed, did not think of changing the existing system of \ngovernment much, but simply of replacing the British or alien \nelement in it by the swadeslii brand. \n\nThe ' Governmentarians \u2019 of the pure variety did not matter \nmuch, for their first article of fiiith was subservience to the \nState authority whatever it was. But even the Liberals and \nResponsivists accepted the ideology of the British Government \nalmost completely; and their occasional criticism, such as it was, \nwas thus wholly ineffective and valueless. It was well known \nthat they were legalists at any price, and as such they could not \nwelcome civil resistance. But they went much further, and \nmore or less ranged themselves on the side of the Government. \nThey were almost silent and rather frightened spectators of \nthe complete suppression of civil liberties of all kinds. It was \nnot merely a question of civil disobedience being countered and \nsuppressed by the Government, but of all political life and pubhc \nactivity being stopped, and hardly a voice was raised against \nthis. Those who usually stood for these liberties were involved \nin the struggle itself, and they took the penalties for refusing to \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nsubmit to the State\u2019s coercion. Others were cowed into abject \nsubmission, and hardly raised their voices in criticism. Mild \ncriticism, when it was indulged in, was apologetic in tone and \nwas accompanied by strong denunciation of the Congress and \nthose who were carrying on the struggle. \n\nIn Western countries a strong public opinion has been built \nup in favour of civil liberties, and any limitation of them is \nresented and opposed. (Perhaps this is past history now.) There \nare large numbers of people who, though not prepared to par- \nticipate in strong and direct action themselves, care enough for \nthe liberty of speech and writing. Assembly and Organisation, \nperson and Press, to agitate for diem ceaselessly and thus help \nto check the tendency of the State to encroach upon them. \nThe Indian Liberals claim to some extent to carry on the \ntraditions of British Liberalism (although they have nothing \nin common with them except the name), and might have been \nexpected to put up some intellectual opposition to the sup- \npression of these liberties, for they suffered from this also. But \nthey played no such part. It was not for them to say with \nVoltairej \u201c I disagree absolutely with what you say, but I will \ndefend to the death your right to say it.\u201d \n\nIt is hot perhaps fair to blame them for this, for they have \nnever stood out as the champions of democracy or liberty, and \nthey had to face a situation in which a loose word might have \ngot them into trouble. It is more pertinent to observe the \nreactions of those ancient lovers of liberty, the British Liberals, \nand the new socialists of the British Labour Party to repression \nin India. They managed to contemplate the Indian scene with \na certain measure of equanimity, painful as it was, and some- \ntimes their satisfaction at the success of the \"scientific appli- \ncation of repression,\u201d as a correspondent of the Manchester \nGuardian put it, was evident. Recently the National Govern- \nment of Great Britain has sought to pass a Sedition Bill, and \na great deal of criticism has been directed to it, especially from \nLiberals and Labourites on the ground, inter alia, that it \nrestricts free speech and gives magistrates the right of issuing \nwarrants for searches. Whenever I read this criticism I sym- \npathised with it, and I had at the same time the picture of \nIndia before me, where the actual laws in force to-day are \napproximately a hundred times worse than the British Sedition \nBiU seeks to enact. I wondered how it was that Britishers who \nstrain at a gnat in England could swallow a camel in India \nwithout turning a hair. Indeed I have always wondered at and \nadmired the astonishing knack of the British people of \n\n\n\nIN BAREILLY AND DEHRA DUN GAOLS I \n\nmaking their moral standards correspond with their material \ninterests, and of seeing virtue in everything that advances \ntheir imperial designs. Mussolini and Hitler are condemned by \nthem in perfect good faith and with righteous indignation for \ntheir attacks on liberty and democracy; and, in equal good \nfaith, similar attacks and deprivation of liberty in India seem \nto them as necessary, and the highest moral reasons are ad- \nvanced to show that true disinterested behaviour on their part \ndemands them. \n\nWhile fire raged all over India and men\u2019s and women\u2019s souls \nwere put to the test, far away in London the chosen ones \nforgathered to draw up a constitution for India. There was \nthe third Round Table Conference in a and numerous com- \nmittees, and large numbers of members of the Legislative \nAssembly angled for membership of these committees so that \nthey might thus combine public duty with private pleasure. \nQuite a crowd went at the public expense. Later, in , came \nthe Joint Committee with its Indian assessors, and again free \npassages were provided by a benevolent Government to those \nwho went as witnesses. Many people crossed the seas again at \npublic cost in their earnest desire to serve India, and some, it \nwas stated, even haggled for more passage money. \n\nIt was not surprising to see these representatives of vested \ninterests, frightened by the mass movements of India in action, \ngathering together in London under the aegis of British im- \nperialism. But it hurt the nationalism in us to sec any Indian \nbehave in this way when the mother country was involved in \na life-and-death struggle. And yet from one point of view it \nseemed to many of us a good thing, for it separated once and for \nall, as we thought (wrongly, it now appears), the reactionary \nfirom the progressive elements in India. This sifting would help \nin the political education of the masses, and make it clearer \nstiU to Si concerned, that only through independence could we \nhope to face social issues and raise the burdens firom the \nmasses. \n\nBut it was surprising to find how far these people had \nalienated themselves, not only in their day-to-day lives, but \nmorally and mentally, from the Indian masses. There were \nno links with them, no understanding of them or of that inner \nurge which was driving them to sacrifice and suffering. Reality \nfor these distinguished statesmen consisted of one thing\u2014 \nBritish imperial power, which could not be successfully chal- \nlenged and therefore should be accepted with good or bad \ngrace. It did not seem to strike them that it was quite im- \n\n\n\nJAWAIIARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\npossible for them to solve India's problem or draw up a real \nlive constitution without the goodwill of the masses. Mr. J. A. \nSpender, in his recent Short History of Our Times, refers to the \nfailure of the Irish Joint Conference of  which sought to \nend the constitutional crisis. He says that the political leaders \nwho were trying to find a constitution in the midst of a crisis \nwere like men trying to insure a house when it is on fire. The \nfire in India in  and  was far greater than in Ireland \nin , and even though the flames die down, the burning \nembers will remain for a long time, hot and unquenchable as \nIndia\u2019s will to freedom. \n\nIn India there was an amazing growth of the spirit of \nviolence in official circles. The tradition was an old one, and \nthe country had been governed by the British mainly as a \npolice State. The overriding outlook even of the civilian ruler \nhad been military: there was always a touch of a hostile army \noccupying alien and conquered soil. This mentality grew \nbecause of the serious challenge to the existing order. The \noccasional acta of terrorism in Bengal or elsewhere fed this \nofficial violence, and gave it some justification for its own acts. \nThe various ordinances and the Government policy gave such \ntremendous power to the executive and the police, that in \neffect India was under Police Raj and there were hardly any \nchecks. \n\nTo a greater or less degree all the provinces of India went \nthrough this fire of fierce repression, but the Frontier Province \nand Bengal suffered most. The Frontier Province had always \nbeen a predominantly military area, administered under semi- \nmilitary regulations. Its strategic position was important, and \nthe \u2018Redshirt\u2019 movement had thoroughly upset the Govern- \nment. Military columns were very much in evidence in the \n' pacification \u2019 of the province, and in dealing with \u2018 recalcitrant \nvillages \u2019. It was a common practice all over India to impose \nheavy collective fines on villages, and occasionally (in Bengal \nespecially) on towns. Punitive police were often stationed, and \npolice excesses were inevitable when they had enormous powers \nand no checks. We had typical instances of the lawlessness and \ndisorderliness of law and order. \n\nParts of Bengal presented the most extraordinary spectacle. \nGovernment treated the whole populations (or, to be exact, the \nHindu population) as hostile, and everyone \u2014 ^man, woman, \nboy or girl between  and  \u2014 ^had to carry identity cards. \nThere were extemments and internments in the mass, dress \nwas regulated, schools were regulated or closed, bicycles were \n\n\n\nIN BAREILLY AND DEHRA DUN GAOLS  \n\nnot allowed, movements had to be reported to the police, \ncurfew, sunset law, military marches, punitive police, collective \nfines, and a host of other rules and regulations. Large areas \nseemed to be in a continuous state of siege, and the inhabitants \nwere little better than ticket-of-leave men and women under \nthe strictest surveillance. Whetlicr, firom the point of view of \nthe British Government, all these amazing provisions and regu- \nlations were necessary or not, it is not for me to judge. If they \nwere not necessary, then that Government must be held guilty \nof a grave offence in oppressing and humiliating and causing \ngreat loss to the populations of whole areas. If they were \nnecessary then surely that is the final verdict on British rule in \nIndia. \n\nThe spirit of violence pursued our people even within the \ngaols. The class division of prisoners was a farce, and often \na torture for those who were put in an upper class. Very few \nwent to these upper classes, and many a sensitive man and \nwoman had to submit to conditions which were a continuing \nagony. The deliberate policy of Government seems to have \nbeen to make the lot of political prisoners worse than that of \nordinary convicts. An Inspector-General of Prisons went to the \nlength of issuing a confidential circular to all the prisons, point- \ning out that Civil Disobedience prisoners must be \u201c dealt with \ngrimly.\u201d * Whipping became a ftequent gaol punishment. On \nApril , , the Under Secretary for India stated in the House \nof Commons \u201c that Sir Samuel Hoare was aware that over  \npersons in India were whipped during  for offences in con- \nnection with the civil disobedience movement.\u201d It is not clear if \nthis figure includes the many whippings in prisons for breaches \nof gaol discipline. As news of firequent whippings came to us in \nprison in ,  remembered our protest and our three-day fast \nm December  against one or two odd instances of whip- \nping. I had felt shocked then at the brutality of it, and now \nI was still shocked and there was a dull pain inside me, but it \ndid not strike me that I should protest and fast again. I felt \nmuch more helpless in the matter. The mind gets blunted to \n\n\n^ This circular was dated June , , and it contained the \nfollowing : \u201c The Inspector-General impresses upon Superintendents \nand gaol subordinates the fact that there is no justification for \npreferential treatment in favour of Civil Disobedience Movement \nprisoners as such. This class require to be kept in their places and \ndealt with grimly.\u201d \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEIIRU \n\n\n \n\nbrutality after a while. A bad thing has only to continue for \nlong for the world to get used to it. \n\nThe hardest of labour tvas given to our men in prison \u2014 mills, \noil-presses, etc. \u2014 and their lot was made as unbearable as pos- \nsible in order to induce them to apologise and be released on an \nundertaking being given to Government. That was considered \na great triumph for the gaol authorities. \n\nMost of these gaol punishments fell to the lot of boys and \nyoung men, who resented coercion and humiliation. A fine and \nspirited lot of boys they were, full of self-respect and ' pep \u2019 and \nthe spirit of adventure, the kind that in an English public \nschool or university would have received every encouragement \nand praise. Here in India their youthful idealism and pride led \nthem to fetters and solitary confinement and whipping. \n\nThe lot of our womenfolk in prison was especially hard \nand painful to contemplate. They were mostly middle-class \nwomen, accustomed to a sheltered life, and suffering chiefly \nfrom the many repressions and customs produced by a society \ndominated to his own advantage, by man. The call of freedom \nhad always a double meaning for them, and the enthusiasm \nand energy with which they threw themselves into the struggle \nhad no doubt their springs in the vague and hardly conscious, \nbut nevertheless intense, desire to rid themselves of domestic \nslavery also. Excepting a very few, they were classed as \nordinary prisoners and placed with the most degraded of com- \npanions, and often under horrid conditions. I was once lodged \nm a barrack next to a female enclosure, a wall separating us. \nIn that enclosure there were, besides other convicts, some \nwomen political prisoners, including one who had bera my \nhostess and in whose house I had once stayed. A high wall \nseparated us, but it did not prevent me from listening in horror \nto the language and curses which our friends had to put up \nwith from the women convict warders. \n\nIt was very noticeable that the treatment of political prisoners \nin  and  was worse than it had been two years earlier, \nin . Tlris could not have been due merely to the whims of \nindividual officers, and the only reasonable inference seems to \nbe that this was the deliberate policy of the Government, Even \napart from political prisoners, the United Provinces Gaol \nDepartment had had the reputation in those years of being \nvery much against anything that might savour of humanity. \nWe had an interesting instance of this firom an unimpeachable \nsource. A distinguished gaol visitor, a gallant knight, not a \nrebel and a sedition-monger like us, but one whom the Govern- \n\n\n\nIN BAREILLY AND DEHRA DUN GAOLS  \n\nment had delighted to honour, paid us a visit once in prison. \nHe told us that some months earlier he had visited another \ngaol, and in his inspection note had desciibed the gaoler as \na \u201c humane disciplinarian.\u201d The gaoler in question begged him \nnot to say anything about his humanity, as this was at a dis- \ncount in official circles. But the knight insisted, as he could \nnot conceive that any harm would befall the gaoler because of \nhis description. Result: soon after the gaoler was transferred \nto a distant and out-of-the-way place, which was in the nature \nof a punishment to him. \n\nSome gaolers, who were considered to be particularly fierce \nand unscrupulous, were promoted and given titles. Graft is \nsuch a universal phenomenon in gaols that hardly any one \nkeeps clear of it. But my own experience, and that of many \nof my friends, has been that the worst offenders among the \ngaol staff are usually those who pose as strict disciplinarians. \n\nI have been fortunate in ^aol and outside, and almost every one \nI have come across has given me courtesy and consideration, \neven when perhaps I did not deserve them. One incident in \ngaol, however, caused me and my people much pain. My \nmother, Kamala and Indira, my daughter, had gone to inter- \nview my brother-in-law, Ranjit Pandit, in the Allahabad District \nGaol and, for no fault of theirs, they were insulted and hustled \nout by the gaoler. I was grieved when I learnt of this, and \nthe reaction of the Provincial Government to it shocked me. To \navoid the possibility of my mother being insulted by gaol \nofficials, I decided to give up all interviews. For nearly seven \nmonths, while I was in Dehra Dun Gaol, I had no interview.  PRISON HUMOURS \n\nTwo of us were transferred together from the Bareilly District \nGaol to the Dehra Dun Gaol\u2014 Govind Ballabh Pant and I. To \navoid the possibility of a demonstration, we were not put on the \ntrain at Bareilly, but at a wayside station fifty miles out. We were \ntaken secretly by motor-car at night, and, after many months of \nseclusion, that drive through the cool night air was a rare delight. \n\nBefore we left Bareilly Gaol, a little incident took place which \nmoved me then and is yet fresh in my memory. The Superinten- \ndent of Police of Bareilly, an Englishman, was present there, \nand, as I got into the car, he handed to me rather shyly a packet \nwhich he told me contained old German illustrated magazines. \nHe said that he had heard that I was learning German and so \nhe had brought these magazines for me. I had never met him \nbefore, nor have I seen him since. I do not even know his name. \nThis spontaneous act of courtesy and the kindly thought that \nprompted it touched me and I felt very grateful to him. \n\nDuring that long midnight drive I mused over the relations of \nEnglishmen and Indians, of ruler and ruled, of official and non- \nofficial, of those in authority and those who have to obey. What \na great gulf divided the two races, and how they distrusted and \ndisliked each other. But more than the distrust and the dislike \nwas the ignorance of each other, and, because of this, each side \nwas a little afraid of the other and was constantly on its guard in \nthe other\u2019s presence. To each, the other appeared as a sour-looking, \nunamiable creature, and neither realised that there was decency \nand kindliness behind the mask. As the rulers of the land, with \nenormous patronage at their command, the English had attracted \nto themselves crowds of cringing place-hunters and opportunists, \nand they judged of India from these unsavoury specimens. The \nIndian saw the Englishman function only as an official with all \nthe inhumanity of the machine and with all the passion of a \nvested interest trying to preserve itself. How different was the \nbehaviour of a person acting as an individual and obeying his \nown impulses from his behaviour as an official or a unit in an \narmy. The soldier, stiffening to attention, drops his humanity, \nand, acting as an automaton, shoots and kills inoffensive and \nharmless persons who have done him no ill. So also, I thought, \nthe police officer who would hesitate to do an unkindness to an \n\n\n\nPRISON HUMOURS \n\n\n \n\n\nindividual would, the day after, direct a lathi charge on inno- \ncent people. He would not tliink of himself as an individual \nthen, nor will he consider as individuals those crowds whom he \nbeats down or shoots. \n\nAs soon as one begins to think of the other side as a mass or \na crowd, the human link seems to go. We forget that crowds \nalso consist of individuals, of men and women and children, \nwho love and hate and suffer. An average Englishman, if he \nwas frank, would probably confess that he knows some quite \ndecent Indians, but they are exceptions, and as a whole Indians \nare a detestable crowd. The average Indian would admit that \nsome Englishmen whom he knows were admirable, but, apart \nfrom these few, the English were an overbearing, brutal, and \nthoroughly bad lot. Curious how each person judges of the \nother race, not from the individual with whom he has come in \ncontact, but ftom others about whom he knows very little or \nnothing at all. \n\nPei-sonally, I have been very fortunate and, almost invariably, \nI have received courtesy from my own countrymen as well as \nfrom the English. Even my gaolers and the policemen, who \nhave arrested me or escorted me as a prisoner from place to \nplace, have been kind to me, and much of the bitterness of \nconflict and the sting of gaol life has been toned down because \nof this human touch. It was not surprising that my own coun- \ntrymen should treat me so, for I had gained a measure of \nnotoriety and popularity among them. Even for Englishmen I \nwas an individual and not merely one of the mass, and, I \nimagine, the fact that I had received my education in England, \nand especially my having been to an English public school, \nbrought me nearer to them. Because of this, they could not help \nconsidering me as more or less civilised after their own pattern, \nhowever perverted my public activities appeared to be. Often I \nfelt a little embarrassed and humiliated because of this special \ntreatment when I compared my lot with that of most of my \ncolleagues. \n\nDespite all these advantages that I had, gaol was gaol, and \nthe oppressive atmosphere of the place was sometimes almost \nunbearable. The very air of it was full of violence and mean- \nness and graft and untruth; there was either cringing or cursing. \nA person who was at all sensitive was in a continuous state of \ntension. Trivial occurrences would upset one. A piece of bad \nnews in a letter, some item in the newspaper, would make one \nalmost ill with anxiety or anger for a while. Outside there was \nalways relief in action, and various interests and activities pro- \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nduced an equilibrium of the mind and body. In prison there \nwas no outlet and one felt bottled up and repressed, and, in- \nevitably, one took one-sided and rather distorted views of \nhappenings. Illness in gaol was particularly distressing. \n\nAnd yet I managed to accustom myself to the gaol routine, \nand with physical exercise and fairly hard mental work kept fit. \nWhatever the value of work and exercise might be outside, they \nare essential in gaol, for without them one is apt to go to pieces. \nI adhered to a strict time-table and, in order to keep up to the \nmark, I carried on with as many normal habits as I could, such \nas the daily shave (I was allowed a safety razor). I mention this \nminor matter because, as a rule, people gave it up and slacked in \nother ways. After a hard day\u2019s work, the evening found me \npleasantly tired and sleep was welcomed. \n\nAnd so the days passed, and the weeks and the months. But \nsometimes a month would stick terribly and would not end, or \nso it seemed. And sometimes I would feel bored and fed up and \u2019 \nangry with almost everything and everybody \u2014 with my com- \npanions in prison, with the gaol staff, with people outside for \nsomething they had done or not done, with the British Empire \n(but this was a permanent feeling), and above all with myself. I \nwould become a bundle of nerves, very susceptible to various \nhumours caused by gaol fife. Fortunately I recovered soon from \nthese humours. \n\nInterview days were the red-letter days in gaol. How one \nlonged for them and waited for them and counted the daysl \nAnd after the excitement of the interview there was the \ninevitable reaction and a sense of emptiness and loneliness. If, \nas sometimes happened, the interview was not a success, because \nof some bad news which upset me, or some other reason, I would \nfeel miserable afterwards. There were gaol officials present of \ncourse at the interviews, but two or three times at Bareilly there \nwas in addition a C.I.D. man present ivith paper and pencil, \neagerly taking down almost every word of the conversation. I \nfound this exceedingly irritating, and these interviews were \ncomplete failures. \n\nAnd then I gave up these precious interviews because of the \ntreatment my mother and wife had received in the course of an \ninterview in the Allahabad Gaol and afterwards firom the \nGovernment. For nearly seven months I had no interview. \nIt was a dreary time for me, and when at the end of that period \nI dedded to resume intervieivs and my people came to see me, \nI was almost intoxicated with the joy of it. My sister\u2019s little \nchildren also came to see me, and when a tiny one wanted to \n\n\n\nPRISON HUMOURS \n\n\n \n\nmount on my shoulder, as she used to do, it was more than my \nemotions could stand. That touch of home life, after the long \nyearning for human contacts, upset me. \n\nWhen interviews stopped, the fortnightly letters from home or \nfrom some other gaol (for both my sisters were in prison) \nbecame all the more precious and eagerly expected. If the letter \ndid not come on the appointed day I was worried. And yet \nwhen it did come, I almost hesitated to open it. I played about \nwith it as one does with an assured pleasure, and at the back of \nmy mind there was also a trace of fear lest the letter contain \nany news or reference which might annoy me. Letter writing \nand receiving in gaol were always serious incursions on a peace- \nful and unruffled existence. They produced an emotional state \nwhich was disturbing, and for a day or two afterwards one\u2019s mind \nwandered and it was difficult to concentrate on the day\u2019s work. \n\nIn Naini Piison and Bareilly Gaol I had several companions. \nIn Dehra Dun there were three of us to begin with-AJovind \nBallabh Pant, Kunwar Anand Singh of Kashipur and I\u2014 but \nPantji was discharged after a couple of months on the expiry \nof his six months. Two others joined us later. By the begin- \nning of January  all my companions had left me and I was \nalone. For nearly eight months, till my discharge at the end of \nAugust, I lived a solitary life in Dehra Dun Gaol with hardly \nany one to talk to, except some member of the gaol staff for a \nfew minutes daily. This was not technically solitary confine- \nment, but it was a near approach to it, and it was a dreary \nperiod for me. Fortunately I had resumed my interviews, and \nthey brought some relief. As a special favour, I suppose, I was \nallowed to receive fresh flowers from outside and to keep a few \nphotographs, and they cheered me greatly. Ordinarily, flowers \nand photographs are not permitted, and on several occasions I \nhave not been allowed to receive the flowers that had been sent \nfor me. Attempts to brighten up the cells were not encouraged, \nand I remember a superintendent of a gaol once objecting to \nthe manner in which a companion of mine, whose cell was next \nto mine, had arranged his toilet articles. He was told that he \nmust not make his cell look attractive and \u201c luxurious \u201d. The \narticles of luxury were: a tooth brush, tooth paste, fountain- \npen ink, a bottle of hair oil, a brush and comb, and perhaps \none or two other little things. \n\nOne begins to appreciate the value of the little things of life \nin prison. One\u2019s belongings are so few and they cannot easily \nbe added to or replaced, and one clings to them and gathers up \nodd bits of things whidi, in the world outside, would go- to the \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NliHRU \n\n\n \n\nwaste-paper basket. The property sense does not leave one even \nwhen there is nothing worth while to own and keep. \n\nSometimes a physical longing would come for the soft things \nof life \u2014 ^bodily comfort, pleasant surroundings, the company of \nfriends, interesting conversation, games with children. ... A \npicture or a paragraph in a newspaper Would bring the old days \nvividly before one, carefree days of youth, and a nostalgia \nwould seize one, and the day would be passed in restlessness. \n\nI used to spin a little daily, for I found some manual occupa- \ntion soothing and a relief from too much intellectual work. My \nmain occupation, however, was reading and writing. I could not \nhave all the books I wanted, as there were restrictions and a \ncensorship, and the censors were not always t'ery competent for \nthe job. Spengler\u2019s Decline of the, West was held up because \nthe title looked dangerous and seditious. But I must not com- \nplain, for I had, on the whole, a goodly variety of books. Again \nI seem to have been a favoured person, and many of my col- \nleagues (A Class prisoners) had the greatest difficulty in getting \nbooks on current topics. In Benares Gaol, I was told, even the \nofficial White Paper, containing the British Government\u2019s con- \nstitutiona^roposals, was not allowed in, as it dealt with political \nmatters. The only books that British officials heartily recom- \nmended were religious books or novels. It is wonderful how dear \nto the heart of the British Government is the subject of religion \nand how impartially it encourages all brands of it. \n\nWhen the most ordinary civil liberties have been curtailed in \nIndia, it is hardly pertinent to talk of a prisoner\u2019s rights. And \nyet the subject is worthy of consideration. If a court of law \nsentences a person to imprisonment, does it follow that not only \nhis body but also his mind should be incarcerated? Why should \nnot the minds of prisoners be free even though their bodies are \nnot? Those in charge of the prison administrations in India will \nno doubt be horrified at such a question, for their capacity for \nnew ideas and sustained thought is usually limited. Censorship \nis bad enough at any time and is partisan and stupid. In India \nit deprives us of a great deal of modem literature and advanced \njournals and newspapers. The list of proscribed books is exten- \nsive and is frequently added to. To add to all this, the prisoner \nhas to suffer a second and a separate censorship, and thus many \nbooks and newspapers that can be legally purchased and read \noutside the prison may not reach him. \n\nSome time ago this question arose in the United States, in the \nfamous Sing Sing Prison of New York, where some Communist \nnewspapers had been banned. The fe^ng against Communists \n\n\n\nPRISON HUMOURS \n\n\n \n\nis very strong among the ruling classes in America, but in spite \nof this the prison authorities agreed that the inmates of the \nprison could receive any publication which they desired, inchid- \ning Communist newspapers and magazines. The sole exception \nmade by the Warden was in the case of cartoons which he \nregarded as inflammatory. \n\nIt is a little absurd to discuss this question of freedom of \nmind in prison in India when, as it happens, the vast majority \nof the prisoners are not allowed any newspapers or writing \nmaterials. It is not a question of censorship but of total denial. \nOnly A Class (or in Bengal, Division I) prisoners are allowed \nwriting materials as a matter of course, and not even all these are \nallowed daily newspapers. The daily newspaper allowed is of the \nGovernment\u2019s choice. B and C Class prisoners, politicals and \nnon-politicals, are not supposed to have writing materials. The \nformer may sometimes get them as a very special privilege, \nwhich is frequently withdrawn. Probably the proportion of \nA Class prisoners to the others is one to a thousand, and they \nmight well be excluded in considering the lot of prisoners in \nInma. But it is well to remember that even these favoured \nA Class convicts have far less privileges in regard to books \nand newspapers than the ordinary prisoners in most civilised \ncountries. \n\nFor the rest, the  in every thousand, two or three books \nare permitted at a time, but conditions are such that they \ncannot always take advantage of this privilege. Writing or the \ntaking of notes of books read arc dangerous pastimes in which \nthey must not indulge. This deliberate discouragement of in- \ntellectual development is curious and revealing. From the point \nof view of reclaiming a prisoner and of making him a fit \ncitizen, his mind should be approached and diverted, and he \nshould be made literate and taught some craft. But this point \nof view has perhaps not struck the prison authorities in India. \nCertainly it has been conspicuous by its absence in the United \nProvinces, Recently attempts has been made to teach reading \nand writing to the boys and young men in prison, but they are \nwholly ineffective, and the men in charge of them have no \ncompetence. Sometimes it is said that convicts are averse to \nlearning. My own experience has been the exact opposite, and \nI found many of them, who came to me for the puroose, to \nhave a perfect passion for learning to read and write. We used \nto teach such convicts as came our way, and they worked hard; \nand sometimes when I woke up in the middle of the night I \nwas surprised to find one or two of them sitting by a dim \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nlantern inside their barrack, learning their lessons for the next \nday. \n\nSo I occupied myself with ray books, going from one type of \nreading to another, but usually sticking to \u2018 heavy \u2019 books. \nNovels made one feel mentally slack, and I did not read many \nof them. Sometimes I would weary of too much reading, and \nthen I would take to writing. My historical scries of letters to \nmy daughter kept me occupied right through my two-year \nterm, and they helped me very greatly to keep mentally fit. \nTo some extent I lived through the past I was writing about \nand almost forgot about my gaol surroundings. \n\nTravel books were always welcome \u2014 ^records of old travellers, \nHiuen Tsang, and Marco Polo, and Ibn Battuta and others, and \nmoderns like Sven Hedin, with his journeys across the deserts \nof Central Asia, and Roerich, finding strange adventures in \nTibet. Picture books also, especially of mountains and glaciers \nand deserts, for in prison one hungers for wide spaces and seas \nand mountains. I had some beautiful picture books of Mont \nBlanc, the Alps, and the Himalayas, and I turned to them often \nand gazed at the glaciers when the temperature of my cell or \nbarrack was ii\u201dF. or even more. An atlas was an exciting \naffair. It brought all manner of past memories and dreams of \nplaces we had visited and places we had wanted to go to. And \nthe longing to go again to those haunts of past days, and visit \nall the other inviting marks and dots that represented great \ncities, and cross the shaded regions that were mountains, and \nthe blue patches that were seas, and to see the beauties of the \nworld, and watch the struggles and conflicts of a changing \nhumanity \u2014 ^the longing to do all this would seize us and clutch \nus by the throat, and we would hurriedly and sorrowfully put \nthe atlas by, and return to the well-known walls that sur- \nrounded us and the dull routine that was our daily lot. \n ANIMALS IN PRISON \n\nFor fourteen and a half months I lived in nw little cell or \nroom in the Dehra Dun Gaol, and I began to feel as if I was \nalmost a part of it. I was familiar with every bit of it; I knew \nevery mark arrd dent on the whitewashed walls and on the \nuneven floor and the ceiling with its moth-eaten rafters. In the \nlittle yard outside I greeted little tufts of grass and odd bits of \nstone as old firiends. I was not alone in my cell, for several \ncolonies of wasps and hornets lived there, and many lizards \nfound a home behind the rafters, emerging in the evenings in \nsearch of prey. If thoughts and emotions leave their traces \nbehind in the physical surroundings, the very air of that cell \nmust be thick with them, and they must cling to every object \nin that little space. \n\nI had had better cells in other prisons, but in Dehra Dun I \nhad one privilege which was very precious to me. The gaol \nproper was a very small one, and we were kept in an old \nlock-up outside the gaol walls, but within the gaol compound. \nThis place was so small that Acre was no room to walk about \nin it, and so we were allowed, morning and evening, to go out \nand walk up and down in front of the gate, a distance of \nabout a hundred yards. We remained in the gaol compound, \nbut this coming outside the walls gave us a view of the moun- \ntains and the fields and a public road at some distance. This \nwas not a special privilege for me; it was common for aU the \nA and B Class prisoners kept at Dehra Dun. Within the com- \npound, but outside the gaol walls, there was another small \nbuilding called the European Lock-up. This had no enclosing \nwall, and a person inside the cell could have a fine view of the \nmountains and the life outside. European convicts and odiers \nkept here were also allowed to walk in front of the gaol gate \nevery morning and evening. \n\nOnly a prisoner who has been confined for long behind high \nwalls can appreciate the extraordinary psychological value of \nthese outside walks and open views. I loved these outings, and \nI did not give them up even during the monsoon, when the \nrain came down for days in torrents and I had to in \nankle-deep of water. I would have welcomed the outing in any \nplace, but the sight of the towering Himalayas near by was an \n\nAA \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nadded joy which went a long way to removing the weariness \nof prison. It was my good fortune that during the long period \nwhen I had no interviews, and when for many months I was \nquite alone, I could gaze at these mountains that I loved. I \ncould not see the mountains from my cell, but my mind was \nfull of them and I was ever' conscious of their nearness, and a \nsecret intimacy seemed to grow between us. \n\n\u201c Flocks of birds have flown high and away; \n\nA solitary drift of cloud, too, has gone, wandering on. \n\nAnd I sit alone with Ching-ting Peak, towering beyond. \n\nWe never grow tired of each other, the mountain and I.\u201d \n\nI am afraid I cannot say with the poet, Li.T\u2019ai Po, that I \nnever grew weary, even of the mountain; but that was a rare \nexperience, and, as a rule, I found great comfort in its \nproximity. Its solidity and imperturbability looked down upon \nme with the wisdom of a million years, and mocked at my \nvarying humours and soothed my fevered mind. \n\nSpring was very pleasant in Dehra, and it was a far longer \none than in the plains below. The winter had denuded almost \n\u2022all the trees of their leaves, and they stood naked and bare. \nEven four magnificent pecpal trees, which stood in front of the \ngaol gate, much to my surprise, dropped nearly all their leaves. \nGaunt and cheerless they stood there, till the spring air warmed \nthem up again and sent a message of life to their innermost \ncells. Suddenly there was a stir both in the peepals and the \nother trees, and an air of mjrstery surrounded them as of \nsecret operations going on behind the scenes; and I would be \nstirtled to find little bits of green peeping out all over them. \nIt was a gay and cheering sight; And then, very rapidly, the \nleaves would come out in their millions and glisten in the sun- \nlight and play about in the breeze. How wonderful is the \nsudden change from bud to leaf I \n\nI had never noticed before that fresh mango leaves are \nreddish-brown, russet coloured, remarkably like the autumn \ntints on the Kashmir hills. But they change colour soon and \nbecome green. \n\nThe monsoon rains were always welcome, for they ended the \nsummer heat. But one could have too much of a good thing, \nand Dehra Dun is one of the favoured haunts of the rain god. \nWithin the first five or six weeks of the break of the monsoon \nwe would have about fifty or sixty inches of rain, and it was \n. not pleasant to sit cooped up in a little narrow place trying to \n\n\n\nANIMALS IN PRISON \n\n\n \n\navoid the tvater dripping from the ceiling or rushing in from \nthe windows. \n\nAutumn again was pleasant, and so was the winter, except \nwhen it rained. With thunder and rain and piercing cold \nwinds, one longed for a decent habitation and a little warmth \nand comfort. Occasionally there would be a hailstorm, with \nhailstones bigger than marbles coming down on the corrugated \niron roofs and making a tremendous noise, something like an \nartillery bombardment. \n\nI remember one day particularly; it was the ath of Decem- \nber, . There was a thunderstorm and rain all day, and it \nwas bitterly cold. Altogether it was one of the most miserable \ndays, from the bodily point of view, that I have spent in gaol. \nIn the evening it cleared up suddenly, and all my misery de- \nparted when I saw all the neighbouring mountains and hills \ncovered with a thick mantle of snow. The next day \u2014 Christ- \nmas Day \u2014 was lovely and clear, and there was a beautiful view \nof snow-covered mountains. \n\nPrevented from indulging in normal activities we became \nmore observant of nature\u2019s ways. We watched also the various \nanimals and insects that came our tvay. As I grew more \nobservant I noticed all manner of insects living in my cell or \nin the little yard outside. I realised that while I complained of \nloneliness, that yard, which seemed empty and deserted, was \nteeming with life. All these creeping or crawling or flying in- \nsects lived their life without interfering with me in any way, \nand I saw no reason why I should interfere with them. But \nthere was continuous war between me and bed-bugs, mosquitos, \nand, to some extent, flies. Wasps and hornets I tolerated, and \nthere were himdreds of them in my cell. There had been a \nlittle tiff between us when, inadvertently I think, a wasp had \nstung me. In my anger I tried to exterminate the lot, but they \nput up a brave fight in defence of their temporary home, which \nprobably contained their eggs, and I desisted and decided to \nleave them in peace if they did not interfere with me any \nmore. For over a year after diat I lived in that cell surrounded \nby these wasps and hornets, and they never attacked me, and \nwe respected each other. \n\nBats I did not like, but I had to endure them. They flew \nsoundlessly in the evening^dusk, and one could just see them \nagainst the darkening sky.Eerie things; I had a horror of them. \nThey seemed to pass within an inch of one\u2019s face, and I was \nalways afraid that they might hit me. Higher up in the air \npassed the big bats, the flying-foxes. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nI used to watch the ants and the white ants and other insects \nby the hour. And the lizards as they crept about in the \nevenings and stalked their prey and chased each other, wagging \ntheir tails in a most comic fashion. Ordinarily they avoided \nwasps, but twice I saw them stalk them with enormous care \nand seize them from the front. I do not know if this avoidance \nof the sting was intentional or accidental. \n\nThen there were squirrels, crowds of them if trees were \nabout. They would become very venturesome and come right \nnear us. In Lucknow Gaol I used to sit reading almost without \nmoving for considerable periods, and a squirrel would climb \nup my leg and sit on my knee and have a look round. And \nthen It would look into my eyes and realise that I was not a \ntree or whatever it had tideen me for. Fear would disable it \nfor a moment, and then it would scamper away. Little baby \nsquirrels would sometimes fall down from the trees. The \nmother would come after them, roll them up into a little ball, \nand carry them off to safety. Occasionally the baby got lost. \nOne of my companions picked up three of these lost baby \nsquirrels and looked after them. They were so tiriy that it was \na problem how \"fo feed them. The problem was, however, \nsolved rather ingeniously. A fountain-pen filler, with a little \ncotton wool attached to it, made an efficient feeding bottle. \n\nPigeons abounded in all the gaols I went to, except in the \nmountain prison of Almora. There were thousands of them, \nand in the eveniims the sky would be thick with them. Some- \ntimes the gaol officials would shoot them down and feed on \nthem. There were mainas, of course; they are to be found \neverywhere. A pair of them nested over my cell door in Dehra \nDun, and I used to feed them. They grew quite tame, and if \nthere was any delay in their morning or evening meal they \nwould sit quite near me and loudly demand their food. It was \namusing to watch their signs and listen to their impatient cries. \n\nIn Naini there were thousands of parrots, and large numbers \nof them lived in the crevices of my barrack walls. Their court- \nship and love-making was always a fascinating sight, and \nsometimes there were fierce quarrels between two male parrots \nover a lady parrot, who sat calmly by waiting for the result of \nthe encounter and ready to grant her favours to the winner. \n\nDehra Dun had a variety of birds, and there was a regular \njumble of singing and lively chattering and twittering, and \nhigh above it all came the koel\u2019s plaintive call. During the \nmonsoon and just before it the Brain-Fever bird visited us, and \nI realised soon why it was so named. It was amazing the per- \n\n\n\nANIMAtS IN PRISON \n\n\n \n\nslstence with which it went on repeating the same notes, in \ndaytime and at night, in sunshine and in pouring rain. We \ncould not see most of these birds, we could only hear them \nas a rule, as there were no trees in our little yard. But I used \nto watch the eagles and the kites gliding gracefully high up in \nthe air, sometimes swooping down and then allowing them- \nselves to be carried up by a current of air. Often a horde of \nwild duck would fly over our heads. \n\nThere was a large colony of monkeys in Bareilly Gaol and \ntheir antics were always worth watching. One incident im- \npressed me. A baby monkey managed to come down into our \nbarrack enclosure and he could not mount up the wall again. \nThe warder and some convict overseers and other prisoners \ncaught hold of him and tied a bit of string round his neck. \nThe parents (presumably) of the little one saw all this from \nthe top of the high wall, and their anger grew. Suddenly one \nof them, a huge monkey, jumped down and charged almost \nright into the crowd which surrounded the baby monkey. It \nwas an extraordinary brave thing to do, for the warder and \nC.O.\u2019s had sticks and lathis and they were brandishing them \nabout, and there was quite a crowd of them. Reckless courage \ntriumphed, and the crowd of humans fled, terrified, leaving \ntheir sticks behind theml The little monkey was rescued. \n\nWe had often animal visitors that were not welcome. \nScorpions were frequently found in our cells, especially after \na thunderstorm. It was surprising that I was never stung by \none, for I would come across them in the most unlikely places \u2014 \non my bed, or sitting on a book which I had just lifted up. I \nkept a particularly black and poisonous-looking brute in a \nbottle for some time, feeding him with flies, etc., and then \nwhen I tied him up on a wall with a string he managed to \nescape. I had no desire to meet him loose again, and so I \ncleaned my cell out and hunted for him everywhere, but he \nhad vanished. \n\nThree or four snakes were also found in my cells or near \nthem. News of one of them got out, and there were headlines \nin the Press. As a matter of fact I welcomed the diversion. \nPrison life is dull enough, and everything that breaks through \nthe monotony is appreaated. Not that I appreciate or welcome \nsnakes, but they do not fill me with terror as they do some \npeople. I am aftaid of their bite, of course, and would protect \nmyself if I saw a snake. But there would be no feeling of \nrepulsion or overwhelming flight. Centipedes horrify me \nmuch more; it is not so much fear as instinaive repulsion. In \n\n\n\nS jAWArtAKLAl. KEHRU \n\nAlipore Gaol in Calciifta I woke in the middle of the night \nand felt something crawling over my foot. I pressed a torch \nI had and I saw a centipede on the bed. Instinctively and with \namazing rapidity I vaulted clear out of that bed and nearly hit \nthe cell wall. I realised fully then what Pavlov\u2019s reflexes were. \n\nIn Dehra Dun I saw a new animal, or rather an animal which \nwas new to me. I was standing at the gaol gate talking to the \ngaoler when we noticed a man outside carrying a strange \nanimal. The gaoler sent for him, and I saw something between \na lizard and a crocodile, about two feet long w'ith claws and a \nscaly covering. This uncouth animal, which was very much \nalive, had been twisted round in a most peculiar way forming \na kind of knot, and its owner had passed a pole through this \nknot and was merrily carrying it in this fashion. He called it \na \u201cBo.\u201d When asked by the gaoler what he proposed to do \nwith it, he replied with a broad smile that he would make \nbhujji \u2014 a. kind of curry \u2014 out of it! He was a forest-dweller. \nSubsequently I discovered from reading F. W. Champion\u2019s book \n\u2014 The Jungle in Sunlight and Shadow \u2014 that this animal was \nthe Pangolin. \n\nPrisoners, especially long-term convicts, have to suffer most \nfrom emotional starvation. Often they seek some emotional \nsatisfaction by keeping animal pets. The ordinary prisoner can- \nnot keep them, but the convict overseers have a little more \nfreedom and the gaol staff usually does not object. The com- \nmonest pets were squirrels and, strangely, mongooses. Dogs \nare not allowed in gaols, but cats seem to be encouraged. A \nlittle kitten made friends with me once. It belonged to a gaol \nofficial, and when he was transferred he took it away with him. \nI missed it. Although dogs are not allowed, I got tied up with \nsome dogs accidentally in Dehra Dun. A gaol official had \nbrought a bitch, and then he was transferred, and he deserted \nher. The poor thing became a homeless wanderer, living under \nculverts, picking up scraps from the warders, usually starving. \nAs I was being kept in the lock-up outside the gaol proper, she \nused to come to me begging for food. I began to feed her \nregularly, and she gave birth to a litter of pups under a culvert. \nMany of these were taken away, but three remained and I fed \nthem; One of the puppies fell ill with a violent distemper, and \ngave me a mat deal of trouble. I nursed her with cafe, and \nsometimes I would get up a dozen times in the course of the \nnight to look after her. She survived, and I was happy that my \nnursing had pulled her round. \n\nI came in contact with animals far more in prison than I had \n\n\n\nANIMALS IN PRISON  \n\ndone outside. I had always been fond of dogs, and had kept \nsome, but I could never look after them properly as other \nmatters claimed my attention. In prison I was grateful for their \ncompany. Indians do not, as a rule, approve of animals as \nhousehold pets. It is remarkable that in spite of their general \nphilosophy of non-violence to animals, they are often singularly \ncareless and unkind to them. Even the cow, that favoured \nanimal, though looked up to and almost worshipped by many \nHindus and often the cause of riots, is not treated kindly. \nWorship and kindliness do not always go together. \n\nDifferent countries have adopted different animals as symbols \nof their ambition or character \u2014 ^the eagle of the United States \nof America and of Germany, the lion and bulldog of England, \nthe fighting-cock of France, the bear of old Ritssia. How far \ndo these patron animals mould national character? Most of \nthem are aggressive, fighting animals, beasts of prey. It is not \nsurprising that the people who grow up with these examples \nbefore them should mould themselves consciously after them \nand strike up aggressive attitudes, and roar, and prey on others. \nNor is it surprising that the Hindu should be mild and non- \nviolent, for his patron animal is the cow.  WHAT IS RELIGION? \n\nOur peaceful and monotonous routine in gaol was suddenly \nupset in the middle of September  by a bombshell. News \ncame that Gandhiji had decided to \u201c fast unto death \u201d in disap- \nproval of the separate electorates given by Mr. Ramssw Mac- \nDonald\u2019s Communal Award to the Depressed Classes. Wiat a \ncapacity he had to give shocks to people ! Suddenly all manner \nof ideas rushed into my head; all kinds of possibilities and \ncontingencies rose up before me and upset my equilibrium \ncompletely. For two days I was in darkness with no light to \nshow the way out, my heart sinking when I thought of some \nresults of Gandhiji\u2019s action. The personal aspect was powerful \nenough, and I thought with anguish that I might not see him \nagain. It was over a year ago that I had seen him last on board \nship on the way to England. Was that going to be my last \nsight of him? \n\nAnd then ..felt annoyed with him for choosing a side-issue \nfor his final sacrifice \u2014 ^just a question of electorate. What would \nbe the result on our freedom movement? Would not the larger \nissues fade into the background, for the time being at least? \nAnd if he attained his immediate object and got a joint elec- \ntorate for the Depressed Classes, would not that result in a \nreaction and a feeling that something has been achieved and \nnothing more need be done for a while? And was not his action \na recognition, and in part an acceptance, of the Communal \nAward and the general scheme of things as sponsored by the \nGovernment? Was this consistent with Non-Co-operation and \nCivil Disobedience? After so much sacrifice and brave en- \ndeavour, was our movement to tail off into something insig- \nnificant? \n\n... I felt angry with him at his religious and sentimental ap- \nproach to a political question, and his frequent references to \nGod in connection with it. He even seemed to suggest that \nGod had indicated the very date of the fast. What a terrible \nexample to set I \n\nIf Bapu died I What would India be like then? And how \nwould her politics run? There seemed to he a dreary and dismal \nfuture ahead, and despair seized my heart whdi I thought of \nit. \n\n\n \u00b0 \n\n\n\nWHAT IS RELIGION? \n\n\n \n\nSo I thought and thought, and confusion reigned in my head, \nand anger and hopelessness, and love for hiin who was the \ncause of this upheaval. I hardly knew what to do, and I was \nirritable and short-tempered wiA everybody, and most of all \nwith myself. \n\nAnd then a strange thing happened to me. I had quite an \nemotional crisis, and at the end of it I felt calmer and the \nfuture seemed not so dark. Bapu had a curious knack of doing \nthe right thing at the psychological moment, and it might be \nthat his action \u2014 ^impossible to justify. as it was from my point \nof view \u2014 would lead to great results, not only in the narrow \nfield in which it was confined, but in the wider aspects of our \nnational struggle. And even if Bapu died our struggle for \nfreedom would go on. So whatever happened, one must keep \nready and fit for it. Having made up my mind to face even \nGandhiji\u2019s death without flinching, I felt calm and collected \nand ready to face the world and aU it might offer. \n\nThen came news of the tremendous upheaval all over the \ncountry, a magic wave of enthusiasm running through Hindu \nsociety, and untouchability appeared to be doomed. What a \nmagician, I thought, was this little man sitting in Yeravda \nPrison, and how well he knew how to pull the strings that \nmove people\u2019s hearts ! \n\nA telegram from him reached me. It was the first message \nI had received from him since my conviction, and it did me \ngood to hear from him after tliat long interval. In this tele- \ngram he said : \n\nDuring all these days of agony you have been before mind\u2019s \neye. I am most anxious to know your opinion. You know how \nI value your opinion. Saw Indu (and) Sarup\u2019s children. Indu \nlooked happy and in possession of more flesh. Doing very well. \nWire reply. Love. \n\n\u25a0 It was extraordinary, and yet it was characteristic of him, \nthat in the agony of his fast and in the midst of his many \npreoccupations, he should refer to the visit of my daughter \nand my sister\u2019s children to him, and even mention that Indira \nhad put on flesh! (My sister was also in prison then and all \nthese children were at school in Poona.) He never forgets the \nseemingly little things in life which reaUy mean so much. \n\nNews also came to me just then that some settlement had \nbeen reached over the electorate issue. The superintenddit of \nthe gaol was good enough to allow me to send an answer to \nGandhiji, and I sent him the following telegram ; \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nYour telegram and brief news that some settlement reached \nfilled me with relief and joy. First news of your decision to fast \ncaused mental agony and confusion, but ultimately optimism \ntriumphed and I regained peace of mind. No sacrifice too great \nfor suppressed downtrodden classes. Freedom must be judged \nby freedom of lowest but feel danger of other issues obscuring \nonly goal. Am unable to judge from religious view point. \nDanger your methods being exploited by others but how can I \npresume to advise a magician. Love. \n\nA \u2018pact\u2019 was signed by various people gathered in Poona, \nand with unusual speed the British Prime Minister accepted it \nand varied his previous award accordingly, and the fast was \nbroken. I disliked such pacts and agreements greatly, but I \nwelcomed the Poona Pact apart from its contents. \n\nThe excitement was over and we reverted to our gaol routine. \nNews of the Harijan movement and of Gandhiji\u2019s activities \nfrom prison came , to us, and I was not very happy about it. \nThere was no doubt that a tremendous push had been given to \nthe movement to end untouchability and raise the unhappy \ndepressed classes, not so much by the pact as by the crusading \nenthusiasm created all over the country. That was to be wel- \ncomed. But it was equally obvious that civil disobedience had \nsuffered. The country\u2019s attention had been diverted to other \nissues, and many Congress workers had turned to the Harijan \ncause. Probably most of these people wanted an excuse to \nrevert to safer activities which did not involve the risk of gaol \ngoing or, worse still, lathi blows and confiscations of property. \nThat was natural, and it was not fair to expect all the thousands \nof our workers to keep always ready for intense suffering and the \nbreak-up and destruction of their homes. But still it was pain- \nful to watch this slow decay of our great movement. Civil \ndisobedience was, however, still going on, and occasionally there \nwere mass demonstrations like the Calcutta Congress in March- \nApril . Gandhiji was in Yeravda Prison, but he had been \n' given certain privileges to meet people and issue directions for \nthe Harijan movements. Somehow this took away from the \nsting of his being in prison. All this depressed me. \n\nMany months later, early in May , Gandhiji began his \ntwenty-one-day fast. The first news of 'tms had again come as \na sho^ to me, but I accepted it as an inevitable occurrence and \nsc hoole d myself to it. Indeed I was irritated that people should \nurge him to give it up, after he had made up his mind and \ndeclared it to the public. For me the fast was an incompre- \nhensible thing and, if I had been asked before the decision had \n\n\n\nWHAT IS RELIGION? \n\n\n \n\nbeen taken, I would certainly have spoken strongly against it. \nBut I attached great value to Gandhi ji\u2019s word, and it seemed to \nme wrong for any one to try to make him break it, in a per- \nsonal matter which, to him, was of supreme importance. So, \nunhappy as I was, I put up with it. \n\nA few days before beginning his fast he wrote to me, a typical \nletter which moved me very much. As he asked for a reply \nI sent him the following telegram : \n\nYour letter. What can I say about matters I do not under- \nstand. I feel lost in strange country where you are the only \nfamiliar landmark and I try to grope my way in dark but I \nstumble. Whatever happens my love and thoughts tvill be with \nyou. \n\nI had struggled against my utter disapproval of his act and \nmy desire not to hurt him. I felt, however, that I had not sent \nhim a cheerful message, and now that he was bent on under- \ngoing his terrible ordeal, which might even end in his death, \nI ou^t to cheer him up as much as I could. Little things make \na difference psychologically, and he would have to strain every \nnerve to survive. I felt also that we should accept whatever \nhappened, even his death, if unhappily it should occur, with a \nstout heart. So I sent him another telegram : \n\nNow diat you are launched on your great enterprise may I \nsend you again love and greetings and assure you that I feel \nmore clearly now that whatever happens it is well and whatever \nhappens you win. \n\nHe survived the fast. On the first day of it he was discharged \nfrom prison, and on his advice Civil Disobedience was suspended \nfor six weeks. \n\nAgain I watched the emotional upheaval of the country \nduring the fast, and I wondered more and more if this was the \nright method in politics. It seemed tp be sheer rpvivalism, and \nclear thinking had not a ghost of a chance against it. All badia, \nor most of it, stared reverently at the Mahatma and expected \nhim to perform miracle after miracle and put an end to un- \ntouchabuity and get swaraj and so on \u2014 and did precious little \nitself f And Gan&iiji did not encourage others to think; his \ninsistence was only on purity and sacnfice. I felt that I was \ndrifting further and further away from him mentally, in spite \nof my strong emotional attachment to him. Often enough he \nwas guided in his political activities by an unerring instinct. He \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nhad the flair for action, but was the way of faith the right way \nto train a nation? It might pay for a short while, but in the \nlong run? \n\nAnd I could not understand how he could accept, as he \nseemed to do, the present social order, which was based \non violence and conflict. Within me also conflict raged, and I \nwas torn between rival loyalties. I knew that there was trouble \nahead for me, when the enforced protection of gaol was re- \nmoved. I felt lonely and homeless, and India, to whom I had \ngiven my love and for whom I had laboured, seemed a strange \nand bewildering land to me. Was it my fault that I could not \nenter into the spirit and ways of thinking of my countrymen? \nEven with my closest associates I felt that an invisible barrier \ncame between us and, unhappy at being unable to overcome it, \nI shrank back into my shell. TTie old world seemed to envelop \nthem, the old world of past ideologies, hopes and desires. The \nnew world was yet far distant. \n\n\u201c Wandering between two worlds, one dead. \n\nThe other powerless to be born. \n\nWith nowhere yet to rest his head.\u201d \n\nIndia is supposed to be a religious country above everything \nelse, and Hindu and Moslem and Sikh and others take pride in \ntheir faiths and testify to their truth by breaking heads. The \nspectacle of what is called religion, or at any rate organised \nreligion, in India and elsewhere has filled me with horror, and \nI have frequently condemned it and wished to make a clean \nsweep of it. Almost always it seems to stand for blind belief \nand reaction, dogma and bigotry, superstition and exploitation, \nand the preservation of vested interests. And yet I knew well \nthat there was something else in it, something which supplied a \ndeep inner craving of human beings. How else could it have \nbeen the tremendous power it has been and brought peace and \ncomfort to innumerable tortured souls? Was that peace merely \nthe shelter of blind belief and absence of questioning, the calm \nthat comes firom being safe in harbour, protected from the \nstorms of the open sea, or was it something more? In some \ncases certainly it was something more. \n\nBut organised religion, whatever its past may have been, to- \nday is very largely an empty form devoid of real content. Mr. \nG. K. Chesterton has compared it (not. his own particular brand \nof religion, but others ) to a fijssil which is the form of an \nanimal or organism firom which all its own organic substance \nhas entirely msappeared, but which has kept its shape, because \n\n\n\nWHAT IS RELIGION? \n\n\n \n\nit has been filled up by some totally different substance. And \neven where something of value still remains, it is enveloped by \nother and harmful contents. \n\nThat seems to have happened in our Eastern religions as well \nas in the Western. The Church of England is perhaps the most \nobvious example of a religion which is not a religion in any \nreal sense of the word. Partly that applies to all organised \nProtestantism, but the Church of England has probably \ngone further because it ha.s long been a State political depart- \nment.^ \n\nMany of its votaries are undoubtedly of the highest character, \nbut it is remarkable how that Church has served the purposes \nof British imperialism and given both capitalism and imperial- \n\n\n' In India the Church of England has been almost indistinguish- \nable from the Government. The officially paid (out of Indian \nrevenues) priests and diaplains are the symbols of the imperial \npower just as the higher services are. The Church has been, on the \nwhole, a conservative and reactionary force in Indian politics and \ngenerally opposed to reform or advance. The average missionary is \nusually wholly ignorant of India's past history and culture and does \nnot take the slightest trouble to find out what it was or is. He is \nmore interested m pointing out the sins and failings of the heathen. \nOf course, there have been many fine exceptions. India does not \npossess a mo:|:e devoted friend than Charlie Andrews, whose abound- \ning love and spirit of service and overflowing friendliness it is a joy \nto have. The Christa Seva Sangh of Poona contains some fine \nEnglishmen, whose religion has led them to understand and serve \nand not to patronise, and who have devoted themselves with all \ntheir great ^ts to a selfless service of the Indian people. There \nare many other English churchmen whose memory is treasured in \nIndia. \n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, speaking in the House of Lords \non December la, , referred to the preamble of the Montagu- \nChelmsford reforms of  and said that \"he sometimes thought \nthe great declaration had been somewhat hastily made, and sup- \nposed that it was one of the hasty, generous gestures after the War, \nbut the goal set could not be wiAdrawn.\u201d It is worthy of note that \nthe head of the English Church should take such an exceedingly \nconservative view or Indian politics. A step, which was considered \nwholly insufficient by Indian opinion and which, because of this, \nled to non-co-operation and all its consequences, is consid^ed by \nthe Archbishop as \u201c hasty and generous.\" It is a comforting doc- \ntrine from the point of view of the English ruling classes, and, no \ndoubt, this conviction of their own generosity, evra to the point of \nrashness, -must produce a righteous glow of satisfaction. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nism a moral and Christian covering. It has sought to justify, \nfrom the highest ethical standards, British predatory policy in \nAsia and Africa, and given that extraordinary and enviable \nfeeling of being always in the right to the English, Whether the \nChurch has helped in producing this attitude of smug rectitude \nor is itself a product of it, I do not know. Other less favoured \ncountries on the Continent of Europe and in America often \naccuse the English of hypocrisy \u2014 per fide Albion is an old taunt \n\u2014 ^but the accusation is probably the outcome of envy at British \nsuccess, and certainly no other imperialist Power can afford to \nthrow stones at England, for its own record is equally shady. \nNo nation that is consciously hypocritical could have the \nreserves of strength that the British have repeatedly shown, and \nthe brand of \u2018 religion \u2019 which they have adopted has apparently \nhelped them in this by blunting their moral susceptibilities \nwhere their own interests were concerned. Other peoples and \nnations have often behaved far worse than the British have \ndone, but they have never succeeded, quite to the same extent, \nin making a virtue of what profited them. All of us find it \nremarkably easy to spot the mote in the other\u2019s eye and over- \nlook the beam in our own, but perhaps the British excel at this \nperformance,* \n\nProtestantism tried to adapt itself to new Conditions and \nwanted to have the best of both worlds. It succeeded remark- \nably so far as this world was concerned, but from the religious \npoint of view it fell, as an organised religion, between two stools, \nand religion gradually gave place to sentimentality and big \nbusiness. Roman Catholicism escaped this fate, as it stuck on to \nthe old stool, and, so long as that stool holds, it will flourish. \nTo-day it seems to be the only living religion, in the restricted \nsense of the word, in the West, A Roman Catholic friend sent \nme in prison many books on Catholicism and Papal Encyclicals \nand I read them with interest. Studying them, I realised the \n\n* A recent instance of how the Chinch of England indirectly \ninfluences politics in India has come to my notice. At a provindal \nconference of the U.P. Indian Christians held at Cawnpore on the \nth November, , the Chairman of the Reception Committee, \nMr. E, V. David, said : \u201c As Christians we are bound by our religion \nto loyalty to die King, who is the Defender of our Faith.\u201d Inevit- \nably that meant support of British imperialism in India. Mr. David \nfurther expressed his sympathies with some of the views of the ' die- \nhard' Conservative elements in England in regard to the I.C.S., the \npolice, and the whole proposed constitution, which, according to \nthem, might endanger Chnstian misrions in India. \n\n\n\nWHAT IS RELIGION? \n\n\n \n\nhold it had on such large numbers of people. It offered, as \nIslam and popular Hinduism offer, a safe anchorage from doubt \nand mental conflict, an assurance of a future life which will \nmake up for the deficiencies of this life. \n\nI am afraid it is impossible for me to seek harbourage in this \nway. I prefer the open sea, with all its storms and tempests. Nor \nam I greatly interested in the after life, in what happens after \ndeath. I find the problems of this life sufficiently absorbing to \nfill my mind. The traditional Chinese outlook, fundamentally \nethical and yet irreligious or tinged with religious scepticism, \nhas an appeal for me, though in its application to life I may not \nagree. It is the Tao, the path to be followed and the way of life \nthat interests me; how to understand life, not to reject it but to \naccept it, to conform to it and to improve it. But the usual \nreligious outlook does not concern itself with this world. It \nseems to me to be the enemy of clear thought, for it is based \nnot only on the acceptance without demur of certain fixed and \nunalterable theories and dogmas, but also on sentiment and \nemotion and passion. It is far removed from what I consider \nspiritually and things of the spirit, and it deliberately or \nunconsciously shuts its eyes to reality lest reality may not \nfit in with preconceived notions. It is narrow and intolerant \nof other opinions and ideas; it is self-centred and egotistic, and \nit often allows itself to be exploited by selfseekers and oppor- \ntunists. \n\nThis does not mean that men of religion have not been and \nare not still often of the highest moral and spiritual type. But \nit does mean that the religious outlook does not help, and even \nhinders, the moral and spiritual progress of a people, if \nmorality and spirituality are to be judged by this world\u2019s stan- \ndards, and not by the hereafter. Usually religion becomes an \nasocial quest for God or the Absolute, and the religious man is \nconcerned far more with his own salvation than with the good \nof society. The mystic tries to rid himself of self, and in the \nprocess usually becomes obsessed with it. Moral standards have \nno relation to social needs, but are based on a highly meta- \nphysical doctrine of sin. And organised religion invariably \nbecomes a vested interest and thus, inevitably a reactionary fierce \nopposing change and progress. \n\nIt is well known that the Christian Church in the early days \ndid not help the slaves to improve their social status. The slaves \nbecame the feudal serfs of the Middle Ages of Europe because \nof economic conditions. The attitude of the Church, as late m \ntwo hundred years ago (in .), was well exemplified in a letter \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NKHRU \n\n\n \n\nwritten by the Bishop of London to the slave-owners of the \nsouthern colonies of America.^ \n\n\u201c Christianity,\u201d wrote the Bishop, \u201c and the embracing of the \ngospel does not make the least alteration in Civil property or in \nany of the duties which belong to civil relations: but in all these \nrespects it continues Persons just in the same State as it found \nthem. The Freedom which Christianity gives is Freedom from \nthe bondage of Sin and Satan and from the Dominion of Men\u2019s \nLusts and Passions and inordinate Desires; hut as to their out- \nward condition, whatever that was before, whether bond or free, \ntheir being baptised and becoming Christians makes no manner \nof change in them.\u201d \n\nNo organised religion to-day will express itself in this out- \nspoken manner, but essentially its attitude to property and the \nexisting social order will be the same. \n\nWords are well known to be, by themselves, very imperfect \nmeans of communication, and are often understood in a variety \nof ways. No word perhaps in any language is more likely to be \ninterpreted in different ways by different people as the word \n\u2018 religion \u2019 (or the corresponding words in other languages). \nProbably to no two persons will the same complex of ideas and \nimages arise on hearing or reading this word. Amon^ these \nideas and images may be those of rites and ceremonial, of \nsacred books, of a community of people, of certain dogmas, of \nmorals, reverence, love, fear, hatred, charity, sacrifice, asceti- \ncism, fasting, feasting, prayer, ancient history, marriage, death, \nthe next world, of riots and the breaking of heads, and so on. \nApart from the tremendous confusion caused by this immense \nvariety of images and interpretations, almost invariably there \nwill be a strong emotional response which will make dispassion- \nate consideration impossible. The word \u2018religion\u2019 has lost all \nprecise significance (if it ever had it) and only causes confusion \nand gives rise to interminable debate and argument, when often \nenough entirely different meanings are attached to it. It would \nbe far better if it was dropped from use altogether and other \nwords with more limited meanings were used instead, such as : \ntheology, philosophy, morals, ethics, spirituality, metaphysics, \nduty, ceremonial, etc. Even these words are va^e enough, but \nthey have a much more limited range than \u2018 religion.\u2019 A great \nadvantage would be that these words have not yet attached to \n\n* This letter is quoted in Reinhold Niebuhr's Moral Man and \nImmoral Society (p. ), a book which is exceedingly interesting and \nstimulating. \n\n\n\nWHAT IS RELIGION? \n\n\n \n\nthemselves, to the same extent, the passions and emotions that \nsurround and envelop the word \u2018 religion.\u2019 \n\nWhat then is religion (to use the word in spite of its obvious \ndisadvantages)? Probably it consists of the inner development \nof the individual, the evolution of his consciousness in a certain \ndirection which is considered good. What that direcdon is will \nagain be a matter for debate. But, as far as I understand it, \nreligion lays stress bn this inner change and considers outward \nchange hs but the projection of this inner development. There \ncan be no doubt that this inner development powerfully influ- \nences the outer environment. But it is equally obvious that the \nouter environment powerfully influences the inner development. \nBoth act and interact on each other. It is a commonplace that in \nthe modern industrial West outward development has far out- \nstripped the inner, but it does not follow, as many people in the \nEast appear to imagine, that because we are industrially back- \nward and our external development has been slow, therefore our \ninner evolution has been greater. That is one of the delusions \nwith which we try to comfort om-selves and try to overcome our \nfeeling of inferiority. It may be that individuals can rise above \ncircumstances and environment and reach great inner heights. \nBut for large groups and nations a certain measure of external \ndevelopment is essential before the inner evolution can take \nplace. A man who is the victim of economic circumstances, and \nwho is hedged and restricted by the struggle to live, can very \nrarely achieve inner consciousness of any nigh degree. A class \nthat is downtrodden and exploited can never progress inwardly. \nA nation which is politically and economicaUy subject to \nanother and hedged and circumscribed and exploited can never \nachieve inner growth. Thus even for inner development exter- \nnal freedom and a suitable environment become necessary. In \nthe attempt to gain this outer feeedom and to change the en- \nvironment so as to remove all hindrances to inner development, \nit is desirable that the means should be such as not to defeat \nthe real object in view. I take it that when Gandhiji says that \nthe means are more important than the end, he has something \nof this kind in view. But the means should be such as lead to \nthe end, otherwise they are wasted effort, and they might even \nresult in even greater degradation, both outer and inner. \n\n\u201cNo man can live without religion,\u201d Gandhiji has written \nsomewhere. \"There are some who in the egotism of their reason \ndeclare that they have nothing to do with felTpon. But that is \nlike a man saying that he breathes, but that he has no nose \u201d \nAgain he says : \u2018TVly devotion to truth has drawn me into the \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nfield of politics; and I can say without the slightest hesitation, \nand yet in all humility, that those who say that religion has \nnothing to do with politics do not know what religion means.\u201d \nPerhaps it would have heen more correct if he had said that \nmost of these people who want to exclude religion from life and \npolitics mean by that word * religion \u2019 something very different \nfrom what he means. It is obvious that he is using it in a sense \n\u2014 ^probably moral and ethical more than any other^-different \nfrom that of the critics of religion. This use of the same word \nwith different meanings makes mutual comprehension still more \ndifficult. \n\nA very modern definition of religion, with which the men of \nreligion will not agree, is that of Professor John Dewey. \nAccording to him, religion is \u201cwhatever introduces genuine \nperspective into the piecemeal and shifting episodes' of exist- \nence or again \" any activity pursued in behalf of an ideal end \nagainst obstacles, and in spite of threats of personal loss, \nbecause of conviction of its general and enduring value, is reli- \ngious in quality.\u201d If this is religion, then surely no one can \nhave the slightest objection to it. \n\nRemain Rolland also has stretched religion to mean some- \nthing which will probably horrify the ormodox of organised \nreligions. In his Life of Ramkrishna, he says ; \n\n\u201c. , . many souls who are or who believe they are free from \nall religious lielief, but who in reality live immersed in a state of \nsuper-rational consciousness, which they term Socialism, Com- \nmunism, Humanitarianism, Nationalism and even Rationalism. \nIt is the quality of thought and not its object which determines \nits. source and allows us to decide whether or not it emanates \nfrom religion. If it turns fearlessly towards the search for truth \nat all costs with single-minded sincerity prepared for any sacri- \nfice, I should call it religious; fcr it presupposes faith in an end \nto human dfbrt higher than the life of exisdhg society, and \neven higher than the\" life of huinmity as a whole. Scepticism \nitself, when it proceeds from vigorous natures true to the core, \nwhen it is an expression of strength and not of weakness, joins \nin the march of the Grand Army of the religious Soul.\u201d \u2019 \n\nI cannot presume to fulfil the conditions laid down by Romain \nRolland, but on these terms I am prepared to be a humble \ncamp-follower of the Grand Army,  THE \u2018DUAL POLICY\u2019 OF THE BRITISH \nGOVERNMENT \n\nThe Harijan movement was going on, guided by Gandhiji from \nYeravda Prison and later from outside. There was a great \nagitation for removing the barriers to temple entry, and a Bill \nto that cflFect was introduced in the Legislative Assembly. And \nthen the remarkable spectacle was witnessed of an outstanding \nleader of the Congress going from house to house in Delhi, \nvisiting the members of the Assembly and canvassing for their \nvotes for this Temple Entry Bill. Gandhiji himself sent an \nappeal through him to the Assembly members. And yet civil \ndisobedience was still going on and people were going to prison, \nand the Assembly had been boycotted by the Congress and all \nour members had withdrawn from it. The rump that remained \nand the others who had filled the vacancies had distinguished \nthemselves in this crisis by opposition to the Congress and \nsupport of the Government, A majority of them had helped \nthe Government to pass repressive legislation giving some per- \nmanence to the extraordinary provisions of the Ordinances. \nThey had swallowed the Ottawa Pact, they had fed and feasted \nwith the great ones in Delhi and Simla and London, and joined \nin the thank-offerings for British rule in India, and prayed for \nthe success of what was called the \u2018Dual Policy \u2019 in India. \n\nI was amazed at Gandhiji\u2019s appeal, under the circumstances \nthen existing, and even more so by the strenuous efforts of \nRajagopalachariar, who, a few weeks before, had been the act- \ning-President of the Congress. Civil Disobedience, of course, \nsuffered by these activities, but what hurt me more was the \nmoral side. To me, for Gandhiji or any Congress 'leader to \ncountenance such activities appeared immoral and almost a \nbreach of faith with the large numbers of people in gaol or \ncarryhig on the struggle. But I knew that his way of looking at \nit was different. \n\nThe Government attitude to this Temple Entry Bill, then and \nsubsequently, was very revealing. It put every possible diffimlty \nin the way of its promoters, went on postponing it and en- \ncouraging opposition to it, and then finally declared its own \nopposition to it, and killed it. That, to a greater or lesser extent, \nhas been its attitude to all, measures of social reform in India, \n\n * \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL N\u00a3HRU \n\nand on the plea of non-interference with religion, it has pre- \nvented social progress. But this, it need hardly be said, has not \nprevented it from criticising our social evils and encouraging \nothers to do so. By a fluke, the Sarda Child Marriage Restraint \nBill became law, but the subsequent history of this unhappy \nAct showed more than anything else how much averse to en- \nforcing any such measure the Government was. The Govern- \nment that could produce ordinances overnight, creating novel \noftcnces and providing for vicarious punishment, and could send \nscores of thousands of people to prison for breach of their pro- \nvisions, apparently quailed at the prospect of enforcing one of \nits regular laws like the Sarda Act. The effect of the Act was \nfirst to increase tremendously the very evil it was intended to \ncombat, for people rushed to take advantage of the intervening \nsix months of grace which .the Act very foolishly allowed. And \nthen it was discovered that the Act was more or less of a joke \nand could be easily ignored without any steps being taken by \nGovernment. Not eyen the slightest attempt at propaganda was \nmade officially, and most people in the villages never knew \nwhat the Act was. They heard distorted accounts of it from \nHindu and Muslim village preachers, who themselves seldom \nknew the correct facts. \n\nThis extraordinary spirit of toleration of social evils in India \nwhich the British Government has shown is obviously not due \nto any partiality for them. It is true that they do not very much \ncare about their removal, for these evils do not interfere with \ntheir business of governing India and exploiting her resources. \nThere is also always the danger of irritating various people by \nproposing social reforms, and, having to face enough anger and \nirritation on the political plane, the British Government has no \ndesire whatever to add to its troubles. But latterly the position \nhas become worse from the point of view of the social reformer, \nfor the British are becoming more and more the silent bulwarks \nof these evils. This is due to their close association with the \nmost reactionary elements in India. As opposition to their rule \nincreases they have to seek strange allies, and to-day the firmest \nchampions of British rule in India are the extreme communal- \nists and the religious reactionaries and obscurantists. The \nMuslim communal organisations are notoriously reactionary \nfrom every point of view\u2014 political, economic, social. The \nHindu Mahasabha rivals them, but it is left far behind in this \nbackward-moving race by the Sanatanists, who combine reli- \ngious obscurantism of an extreme type with fervent, or at any \nrate loudly expressed, loyalty to British rule. \n\n\n\n'dual policy' of BRITISH GOVERNMENT  \n\nIf the British Government was quiescent and took no steps to \npopularise the Sarda Act and to enforce it, why did not the \nCongress or other non-official organisations carry on propaganda \nin favour of it? This question is often put by British and other \nforeign critics. So far as the Congress is concerned, it has been \nengaged during the last fifteen years, and especially since , \nin a fierce life-and-death struggle for national freedom with the \nBritish rulers. The other organisations have no .real strength \nor contact with the masses. Men and women of ideals and \nforce of character and influence among the masses were drawn \ninto the Congress and spent mucli of their time in British \nprisons. \n\nOther organisations could seldom go beyond the passing of \nresolutions by select people who feared the mass touch. They \nfunctioned in a gentlemanly way or, like the All-India Women\u2019s \nAssociation, in a lady-like way, and the spirit of aggressive \npropaganda was not theirs. Besides, they too were paralysed by \nthe terrible repression of all public activities by the Ordinances \nand the laws that followed them. Martial law may crush revolu- \ntionary activity, but at the same time it paralyses civilisation \nand most civilised activities. \n\nBtit the real reason why the Congress and other non-official \norganisations cannot do much for social reform goes deeper. We \nsuffer from the disease of nadonalism, and that absorbs our \nattention and it will continue to do so till we get political free- \ndom. As Bernard Shaw has said: \"A conquered nation is like \na man with cancer; he can think of nothing else. . . . There is \nindeed no greater curse to a nation than a nationalist move- \nment, which is only the agonising symptom of a suppressed \nnatural function. Conquered nations lose their place in the \nworld\u2019s march because they can do nothing but strive to get rid \nof their nationalist movements by recovering their national \nliberty.\u201d \n\nPast experience shows us that we can make little social pro- \ngress under present conditions, in spite of apparent transfers of \nsubjerts to elected ministers. The tremeiidous inertia of the \nGovernment is always helpful to the conservative elements, and \nfor generations past the British Government has crushed initia- \ntive and ruled despotically, or paternally, ^ it has itself called \nit. It does not approve of any big oj^hised effort by iibn- \nbfficials, and suspects ulterior motives. 'Ae Harijan movement, \nin spite of every precaution taken by its organisers, has occa- \nsionally come in conflict with officials. I am sure that if the \nCongress started a nation-wide propaganda for the greater use \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nof soap it would come in conflict with Government in many \nplaces. \n\nI do not think it is very difficult to convert the masses to \nsocial reform if the State takes the matter in hand. But alien \nrulers are always suspect, and they cannot go far in the process \nof conversion. If the alien element was removed and economic \nchanges were given precedence, an energetic administration \ncould easily introduce far-reaching social reforms. \n\nBut social reform and the Sarda Act and the Harijan Move- \nment did not fill our minds in prison, except in so far as I felt \na little irritated by the Harijan Movement because it had come \nin the way of civil disobedience. Early in May  Civil Dis- \nobedience had been suspended for six weeks, and we waited \nanxiously for further developments. That suspension had given \na final blow to the movement, for one cannot play fast and \nloose with a national struggle and switch it on and off at will. \nEven before the suspension the leadership of the movement \nhad been singularly weak and ineffective. There were petty \nconferences being held, and all manner of rumours spread \nwhich militated against active work. Some of the acting-Presi- \ndents of the Congress were very estimable men, but it was \nunkindness to them to make them generals of an active cam- \npaign. There was too much of a hint of tiredness about them, \nof a desire to get out of a difficult position. There was some \ndiscontent against this vacillation and indecision in high quar- \nters, but it was difficult to express it in an organised way, as all \nCongress bodies were unlawful. \n\nThen came Gandhiji\u2019s twenty-one-day fast, his discharge from \nprison, and the suspension of dvil disobedience for six weeks. \nThe fast was over, and very slowly he recovered from it. In the \nmiddle of June the period of suspension of civil disobedience \nwas extended by another six weeks. Meanwhile the Govern- \nment had in no way toned down its aggression. In the Anda- \nman Islands political prisoners (those convicted in Bengal for \nacts of revolutionary violence were sent there) were on hunger- \nstrike on the question of treatment, and one or two of them \ndied\u2014 starved to death. Others h-j dying. People who addressed \nmeetings in India in protest of what was happening in the \nAndamans were themselves arrested and sentenced. We were \nnot only to suffer, but we were not even to complain, even \nthough prisoners died by the terrible ordeal of the hunger- \nstrike, having no other means of protest open to them. Some \nmonths later, in September  (when I was out of prison), an \nappeal was issued over a number of signatures including \n\n\n\n\u2018dual policy\u2019 of BRITISH GOVERNMENT  \n\nRabindra Nath Tagore, C. F. Andrews, and many other well- \nknown people, mostly unconnected with the Congress, asking \nfor more humanitarian treatment of the Andamans\u2019 prisoners, \nand preferably for their transfer to Indian gaols. The Home \nMember of the Government of India expressed his great dis- \npleasure at this statement, and criticised the signatories strongly \nfor their sympathy for the prisoners. Later, as far as I can \nremember, the expression of such sympathy was made a \npunishable offence in Bengal. \n\nBefore the second six weeks of suspension of civil dis- \nobedience were over, news came to us in Dehra Dun Gaol that \nGandhiji had called an informal conference at Poona. Two or \nthree hundred people met there and, on Gandhiji\u2019s advice, mass \ncivil disobedience was suspended, but individual civil dis- \nobedience was permitted, and all secret methods were barred. \nThe decisions were not very inspiring, but I did not particularly \nobject to them so far as they went To stop mass civil dis- \nobedience was to recognise and stabilise existing conditions, for, \nin reality, there was no mass movement then. Secret work was \nmerely a pretence that we were carrying on, and often it \ndemoralised, having regard to the character of our movement \nTo some extent it was necessary in order to send instructions \nand keep contacts, but civil disobedience itself could not be \nsecret. \n\nWhat stirprised me and distressed me was the absence of \nany real discussion at Poona of the existing situation and of \nour objectives. Congressmen had met together after nearly two \nyears of fierce conflict and repression, and much had hap- \npened meanwhile in the world at large and in India, including \nthe publication of the White Paper containing the British \nGovernment\u2019s proposals for constitutional reform. We had to \nput up during this period with enforced silence, and on the \nother side there had been ceaseless and perverted propaganda \nto obscure the issues. It was frequently stated, not oiuy by \nsupporters of the Government but by Liberals and others, that \nthe Congress had g^ven up its objective of independence. The \nleast that should have been done, I thought, was to lay stress \non our political objective, to make it clear again, and, if pos- \nsible, to add to it social and economic objectives. Instead of \nthis, the discussion seems to have been entirely confined to the \nrelative merits of mass and individual civil disobedience, and \nthe desirability or otherwise of secrecy. There was also some \nstrange talk of \u2018 peace \u2019 with the Government. Gandhiji sent \na telegram to the Viceroy, as far as I remember, asking for an \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHAHLAL NEHRU \n\n\ninterview, to which the Viceroy replied with a \u2018No\u2019, and then \nGandhiji sent a second telegram mentioning something about \n\u2018honourable peace*. Where was this elusive peace that was \nbeing sought, when the Government was triumphantly trying \nto crush the nation in every way, and people were starving to \ndeath in the Andamans? But I knew that, whatever happened, \nit was Gandhiji\u2019s way always to offer the olive branch. \n\nRepression was going on in full swing, and all the special laws \nsuppressing public activities were in force. In February  \neven a memorial meeting on my father\u2019s death anniversary was \nprohibited by the police, although it was a non-Congress meet- \ning, and such a good Moderate as Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru was \nto have presided over it. And as a vision of future favours to \ncome we had been presented with the White Paper. \n\nThis was a remarkable document, a perusal of which left one \ngasping for breath. India was to be converted into a glorified \nIndian State, with a dominating influence of the Statea feudal \nrepresentatives in the Federation. But in the States themselves \nno outside interference would be tolerated, and undiluted \n\n\nautocracy would continue to prevail there. The real imperial \nlinks, the chains of debt, would- bind us for ever to the City of \nLondon, and the currency and monetary policy would also be \ncontrolled, through a Reserve Bank, by the Bank of England. \nThere would he an impregnable defence of all vested rights, \nand additional vested interests were going' to be created. Our \nrevenues were mortgaged up to the hilt for the benefit of these \nvested interests. The great imperial services, which we love so \nmuch, would continue uncontrolled and untouched, to train us \n\n\nfor further instalments of self-government. There was going to \nbe Provincial Autonomy, but the Governor would be a benevo- \nlent and all-powerful dictator keeping us in order. And high \nabove all would sit the All-Highest, the supreme Dictator, ihe \nViceroy, with conmlete powers to do what he will and check \nwhen he desires. Truly, the genius of the British ruling class \nfor colonial government was never more in evidence, and well \nmay the Hitlers and Mussolinis admire them and look with \nen'vy on the Viceroy of India. \n\nHaving produced a constitution which tied up India hand \nand foot, a collection of \u2018special responsibilities * and safeguards \nwere added as additional fetters, making the unhappy country \na prisoner incapable of movement. As Mr. Neville Chamber- \nlain said: \u201c They had done their best to surround the proposals \nwith all the safeguards the wit of man could devise.\" \n\nEnrtherrwtr were informed that for these favours we would \n\n\n\n\u2018dual policy\u2019 of BRITISH GOVERNMENT  \n\nhave to pay heavily \u2014 to begin with a lump sum of a few crores, \nand then annual payment. We could not have the blessings \nof Swaraj without adequate payment. We had been suffering \nunder the delusion that India was poverty-stricken and already \nhad too heavy a burden to carry, and we had looked to freedom \nto lighten it. That had been for the masses the urge for free- \ndom. But it now appeared that the burden was to become \nheavier. \n\nThis Gilbertian solution of the Indian problem was ofiered \nwith true British grace, and we were told how generous our \nrulers were. Never before had an imperial Power of its own \nfree will offered such power and opportunities to a subject \npeople. And a great debate arose in England between the \ndonors and those who, horrified at such generosity, objected to \nit. This was the outcome of the many comings and goings \nbetween India and England during three years, of the- three \nRound Table Conferences, and innumerable committees and \nconsultations. \n\nBut the visits to England were not over yet. There was the \nJoint Select Committee of the British Parliament which was \ngoing to sit in judgment on the White Paper, and Indians went \nto it as a kind of assessors and as witnesses. There ivere also \nmany other committees sitting in London, and there was an \nundignified scramble behind the scenes for membership of any \ncommittee which meant a free passage to and stay in the heart \nof the Empire. Brave men, undaunted by the petrifying pro- \nvisions of the White Paper, undertook to face the perils of the \nsea voyage or the air journey, and the greater dangers of a \nstay in London city in order to attempt, with all the eloquence \nand power of persuasion at their command, to vary the pro-, \nvisions of the White Paper. They knew and said that the task \nwas an almost hopeless one, but they were no quitters, and \nwould continue to have their say even though there was no \none to listen to them. One of them, a leader of the .Responsi- \nvists, stuck on till the bitter end, when all others had left, \nprobably having interview after interview and dinner after \ndiimer with the men in authority in London, so that he might \nimpress upon them what political changes he desired. When at \nlast he returned to his native land, he infisrmed an expectant \npublic that, with the well-known tenacity of the Marathas, he \nhad refused to give up his job, and had stayed on in London \nto have his say to the very end. \n\nI remember a firequent complaint of my father\u2019s that his \nResponsivist friends had no sense of humour. He often got \n\n\n\n JAWAHAHLAL NEHRU \n\ninto trotible with them because of his humorous remarks, \nwhich were not appreciated by them at all, and then he had to \nexplain and soothe \u2014 a tiring operation. And I thought of the \nfine fighting spirit of the Marathas, not only in the past but \nin the present during our national struggles, and of the great \nand indomitable Tilak, who would not bend though he break. \n\nThe Liberals utterly disliked the White Paper. They also \nhad no liking for the repression that was going on from day \nto day in India, and sometimes though rarely, even protested \nagainst it, always making it dear that they condemned the \nCongress and all its works. Tlicy would suggest to Govermnent \noccasionally to release some prominent Congressman firom \nprison \u2014 ^they could only think in terms of individuals they knew. \nThe argument advanced, both by the Liberals and Responsi- \nvisits, was that so-and-so should be released as there was no \nlonger any danger to the public peace. And then it is always \nopen to the Government to re-arrest that person if he mis- \nbehaves, and Government could do so with more justification, \nSome people in England also were good enough to plead for the \nrelease of some members of the Working Committee, or special \nindividuals, on these grounds. We could not help being grate- \nful to people who were interested in us while we were in prison, \nbut we felt also sometimes that it would be a good thing if \nwe were saved from our well-meaning friends. We did not \ndoubt their good intentions, but it was obvious that they had \nadopted completely the ideology of the British Government, \nand between them and us there was a wide chasm. \n\nThe Liberals did not like much that was happening in India; \nthey were unhappy about it, and yet what were they to do? \nIt was unthinkable for them to take any effective action against \nGovernment. Merely to preserve themselves as a separate entity \nthey had to retreat further away from the masses and the active \nelements in the population; to drift to the Right, till their \nideology was hardly distinguishable from that of the Govern- \nment. Small in numbers, and with no mass influence, they \ncould not make any difference to a mass struggle. But among \nthem were some distingxiished and well-knovm persons who \nwere personally respected. And these leaders, as well as the \nLiberal and Responsivist groups as a whole, did an inestimable \nservice to the British Government at a moment \u00abof grave crisis \nby a moral support of the official policy. Even the coercion \nand lawlessness of Government profited by the lack of effective \ncriticism and occasional acquiescence and approval of the \n_^Libemis,'\u2018Thus the Liberals and Responsivists gave a moral \n\n\n\n\u2018dual policy* of BRITISH GOVERNMENT  \n\nsanction, to the fierce and unprecedented coercion that was \ngoing on in die country at a time when the Government was \nhard put to it to justify it. \n\nThe White Paper was bad, very bad, so said the Liberal \nleaders. What was to be done about it? At the Liberal Federa- \ntion meeting held in Calcutta in April , Mr. Srinivasa \nSastri, the most eminent of the Liberal leadens, pleaded that \nhowever unsatisfactory the constitutional changes might be \nthey should work them. \u201c This is no time to stand by and let \nthings pass,\u201d he said. The only action that apparently was \nconceivable to him was to accept what was given and to try to \nwork it. The alternative to this was doing nothing. Further \nhe added : \u201c If we have wisdom, experience, moderation, power \nof persuasion, quiet influence, and real efiiciency\u2014 if we have \nthese virtues, this is the time to display them in the fullest \nstrength.\u201d \u201d Shining words \u201d was the Calcutta Statesman's com- \nment on this eloquent appeal. \n\nMr. Sastri is always eloquent, and has the orator\u2019s love of \nfine words and their musical use. But he is apt to he carried \naway hj his enthtisiasms, and the word-magic that he creates \nblurs his meaning to others and perhaps to himself. It is worth \nwhile examining this appeal he m^de at Calcutta in April  \nduring the continuance of the Civil Disobedience Movement. \nFundamental principles and oHectives apart, two points seem \nto me worthy of note. The flrst is that whatever happens, \nhowever much we might be insulted, crushed, humiliated, and \nexploited by the British Government, we must submit to it. \nThe line can never be drawn beyond which we must not go. \nA worm may turn, but not the Indian people if they followed \nMr. Sastri\u2019s advice. There is no other way according to him. \n'I'his means that, so far as he is concerned, submission to and \nacceptance of the British Government\u2019s decisions is tantamount \nto a religion (if I may use that unfortunate word). It is the \nfate \u2014 Kismet \u2014 to which all of us have to bow whether we want \nto or not. \n\nIt must be noted that he was not giving advice on a definite, \nknown situation. The ' constiturional changes \u2019 were still in the \nmaking, though one had a fiiir notion that they would be very \nbad. K he had said that, bad as the White Paper proposals are, \nhaving regard to all the circumstances, I am in fevour of work- \ning them, should they be enacted, his advice might have been \ngood, or bad, but it had relation to existing fiicts. Mr. Sastri \nwent much further, and said that however unsatisfecto^ the \nconstitutional changes nu^t be his advice would hold. Ite was \n\n\n\n jawaharlal nehru \n\nprepared to give a blank cheque to the British Government on \nthe most vital matter from the nation\u2019s view-point. It is a little \ndifficult for me to understand how any individual, group, or \nparty, can talce up this attitude of commitment to an unforeseen \nfuture, unless it has no principles or moral and political stan- \ndards whatever, and has for its creed and policy invariable \nsubservience to the ruler\u2019s mandates. \n\nThe second point that strikes me is one of pure tactics. The \nWhite Paper was one stage in the long march to the enactment \nof the new reforms. It was, from Government\u2019s point of view, \nan important stage, but many stages remained, and it was \npossible that it might be altered for better or worse during its \nsubsequent journey. These alterations would obviously depend \non the pressure brought to bear on the British Government \nand Parliament from various interests. In this tug-of-war it \nwas conceivable that the desire to win over the Indian Liberals \nto its side might have influenced the Government and induced \nit to liberalise the proposals, or at least to resist encroachments. \nBut Mr. Sastri\u2019s emphatic declaration, long before the question \nof acceptance or rejection, workix^ or not working the new \nreforms arose, made it clear to the Government that they could \ncompletely ignore the Indian Liberals. There was no cmestion \nof winning them over. They would not desert the Govern- \nment, even if they were pushed out. Looking at the matter' \nfrom the Liberal view-point, as far as I can, Mr. Sastri\u2019s speech \nat Calcutta seems to me to have been extraordinarily bad tactics \nand injurious to the Liberal cause. \n\nI have ventured to write so much on Mr. Sastri\u2019s old speech, \nnot because of any intrinsic importance of that speech or the \nLiberal Federation meeting, but because of my desire to under- \nstand the mentality and psychology of the Liberal leaders. \nThey are able and estimable men, and yet, with the best will \nin the world, I have been whoUy unable to appreciate why they \nact as they do. Another speech of Mr. Sastri\u2019s, which I rei^d in \nprison, influenced me greatly. He was addressir^ the Servants \nof Inffia Society, of which he is president, at Riona in June \n. He is reported to have pointed the danger in India \nif British influence were suddenly vrithdrawn, of political \nmovements being marked by acute hatred, persecution, and \noppression of one party by another. On the other hand, tolera- \ntion having throughout been a feature of British political life, \nthe more India\u2019s future is worked out in co-operation with \nBritain, the greater the likelihood of toleration prevailing in. \nIndia. Being in prison, I have to rely on the summary of \n\n\n\n\u2018dual policy\u2019 of BRITISH GOVERNMENT  \n\nMr. Sastri\u2019s speech given by the Statesman of Calcutta. The \nStatesman added : \u201c It is a pleasant doctrine, and we note that \nDoctor Moonje has been speaking in the same sense.\u201d Mr. \nSastri is further reported to have referred to the suppression \nof freedom in Russia, Italy, and Germany, and to the in- \nhumanities and savageries that were being perpetrated there. \n\nIt struck me, when I read this, how extraordinarily similar \nwas Mr. Sastri\u2019s outlook in regard to Britain and India to that \nof the \u2018diehard\u2019 British Conservative. In matters of detail \nthere were no doubt differences, but fundamentally the ideology \nwas the same. Mr. Winston Churchill could have expressed \nhimself in identical language without doing any violence to his \nconvictions. And yet Mr. Sastri belongs to the Left wing of the \nLiberal party, and is the ablest of its leaders. \n\nI am afraid I am wholly unable to accept Mr. Sastri\u2019s reading \nof history, or his views on world affairs, and more particularly \non Britain and India. Probably no foreigner, who is not an \nEnglishman, will accept them; possibly many Englishmen of \nadvanced views will msagree with him. It is his happy gift \nto see the world and his ovra country through the tinted glasses \nof the British ruling class. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that \nhe should ignore in this speech the very imusual occurrence \nwhich had taken place from day to day in India during the \nprevious eighteen months, and were taking place at the time \nthe speech was delivered. He referred to Russia, Italy, and \nGermany, but not to the fierce repression and suppression of all \nliberties in his own country. He may not have known of all \nthe terrible occurrences in the Frontier Province and in Bengal \n\u2014the \u2018 rape of Bengal \u2019 as Rajendra Babu has called it in his \nrecent Congress presidential address \u2014 as the heavy veil of cen- \nsorship hid much of what was happening. But was he oblivious \nto the agony of India and the struggle for life and freedom \nthat his people were waging against a powerful adversary? Did \nhe not know of the ponce raj that prevailed over large areas, \nof conditions resembling martial law, of the Ordinances, of \nthe hunger-strikes, and other sufferings in prison? Did he not \nrealise that the veiy toleration and freedom for which he \npraised Britain had been crushed by Britain herself in India? \n\nIt did not matter whether he agreed with the Congress or \nnot. He was perfectly entitled to critidse and condemn Con- \ngress policy. But as an Indian, as a lover of freedom, as a \nsensitive man, what were his reactions to the wonderful courage \nand sacrifice of his countrymen and countrywomen? Did he \nnot feel any pain and anguish when our rulers played with a \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nhatchet on India\u2019s heart? Was it nothing to him that scores \nof thousands were refusing to bend before the physical might \nof a proud empire, and preferred to see their bodies crushed, \ntheir homes broken, their dear ones suffer, rather than yield \ntheir souls? We put on a brave face in gaol or outside, and \nsmiled and laughed, but we smiled often through our tears, and \nour laughter was sometimes near to crying. \n\nMr. Verrier Elwin, a brave and generous Englishing, tells \nus what his reactions were. \u201c It was a wonderful experience,\u201d \nhe says of , \u201c to watch a whole nation throwing oJff its \nmental bonds of servitude and rising to its true dignity of \nfearless determination.\u201d And again: \"The amazing discipline \nexhibited by most of the Congress volunteers during the \nSatyagraha struggle, a discipline to which one of the provincial \nGovernors has borne generous testimony. . . .\u201d \n\nMr. Srinivasa Sastri is an able and sensitive man who is widely \nrespected by his countrymen, and it seems impossible that he \nwould not react in the same way and feel for his countrymen \nduring such a struggle. One would have expeaed him to raise \nhis voice in denunciation of the suppression of all civil liberty \nand all public activities by the Government. One would further \nhave hoped that he and his colleagues would personally visit \nthe worst affected areas \u2014 ^Bengal and the Frontier\u2014 not m any \nway to help the Congress or. civil disobedience, but to expose \nand thus check official and police excesses. This is usually done \nby the lovers of freedom and civil liberty in other countries. \nBut instead of acting in this way, instead of trying to check \nthe executive when it was riding rough-shod over India\u2019s men \n* and women and had done away with even the usual liberties; \ninstead at least of finding out what was happening, he diose \nto give a certificate to the British for toleration and freedom \n\nS * ist when both of these virtues were completely lacking under \nrifish rule in India. He gave them his moral backing and \nthus heartened and encouraged them in their task of repression. \n\nI am quite sure that he could not have meant this or realised \nthe consequences of his action. But that his speech must have \nhad this effect cannot be doubted. Why, then, should he think \nand act in this manner? \n\nI have found no adequate answer to this question except that \nthe Liberal leaders have cut themselves completely aloof firom \ntheir countrymen as well as fi:om all modem thought. The \nmusty books that they read have shut out the people of India \nfrom their view, and they have developed a kind of narcissism. \nWe went to gaol and our bodies were locked up in cells, but \n\n\n\n'dual policy\u2019 of BKITISH government  \n\nour minds ranged free and our spirits were undismayed. But \nthey created mental prisons of their own fashioning, where \nthey went round and round and from which they feund no \nescape. They worshipped the God of Things as they are; and \nwhen things changed, as they do in this changing world, they \nwere without rudder and compass, helpless in mind and body, \nwithout ideals or moral values. The choice for each one of us \nalways is to go forward or be pushed; we cannot remain static \nin a dynamic universe. Afraid of change and movement, the \nLiberals were frightened at the tempests that surrotmded them; \nweak of limb, mey could not go forward, and so they were \ntossed hither and thither, clutching at every straw that came \nfheir way. They became the Hamlets of Indian politics, \n\" sicklied o\u2019er with the pale cast of thought \u201d, ever doubting, \nhesitating, and irresolute. \n\n\u201c The dme is out of joint. O cursed spite! \n\nThat ever I was bom to set it right.\" \n\nThe Servant of India, a Liberal weekly, accused Congress- \nmen, during the latter days of the Civil Disobedience Move- \nment, of waiting to go to P^on, and when they got there \nwanting to come out again. Ihat, it said with some irritation, \nwas the sole Congress policy. The Liberal alternative to that, \napparently, was to send a deputation to England to wait on the \nBritish ministers, or to wait and pray for a change of Govern- \nment in England. \n\nIt was true, to some extent, that the Congress policy then was \nmainly one of defiance of the Ordinance laws and other re- \npressive measures, and this led to gaol. It was also true that \nthe Congress and the nation were exhausted after the long \nstruggle and could not bring any effective pressure on the \nGovernment. But there was a practical and moral consideratira. \n\nNaked coerdon, as India was experiencing is an expensive \naffair for the rulers. Even for them it is a painful nerve- \nshaking ordeal, and they know well that ultimately it weakens \ntheir foxmdations. It exposes continually the real character of \ntheir rule, both to the people coerced and the world at large. \nThey infinitely prefer to put on the velvet glove to hide me \niron fist. Nothing is more irritating and, in die_ final analysis, \nharmful to a Government than to have to deal with people who \nvrill not hend to ite will, whatever the consequences. So even \nsporadic defiance of the repressive measures had value; it \nstrengthened the people and sapped the morale of Government, \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NKHRU \n\n\n \n\nThe moral consideration was even more important. In a \nfamous passage Thoreau has said: \u201cAt a time when men and \nwomen are unjustly imprisoned the place for just men and \nwomen is also in prison.\u201d This advice may not appeal to \nLiberals and others, but many of us often feel that a moral life \nunder existing conditions is intolerable, when, even apart from \ncivil disobedience, many of our colleagues are always in prison \nand the coercive apparatus of the State is continually repress- \ning us and humUiating us, as well as helping in the exploitation \nof our people. In our own country we move about as suspects, \nshadowed and watched, our words recorded lest they infringe \nthe all-pervading law of sedition, our correspondence, opened, \nthe possibility of some executive prohibition or arrest always \nfacing us. For us the choice is ; abject submission to the power \nof the State, spiritual degradation, the denial of the truth that \nis in us, and our moral prostitution for purposes that we con- \nsider base \u2014 or opposition with all the consequences thereof. No \none likes to go to gaol or to invite trouble. But often gaol is \npreferable to the other alternative. \u201c The only real tragedy in \nlife,\u201d as Bernard Shaw has written, \u201c is the being used by per- \nsonally minded men for purposes which you know to be base. \nAll the rest is at the worst mere misfortune and mortality : this \nalone is misery, slavery, hell on earth.\u201d  THE END OF A LONG TERM \n\nThe time for my discharge was drawing near. I had received \nthe usual remissions for \u2018 good behaviour and this had reduced \nmy two-year term by t&ee and half months. My peace of \nmmd, or rather the general dullness of the mind which prison \nproduces, was being disturbed by the excitement created by the \nprospect of release. What must I do outside? A difficult \nquestion, and the hesitation I had in answering it took away \n&om the joy of going out. But even that was a momentary \nfeeling, and my long-suppressed energy was bubbling up and \nI was eager to be out. \n\nThe end of July  brought a painffil and very disturbing \npiece of news \u2014 the sudden death of J. M. Sen-Gupta. We had \nnot only been close colleagues on the Congress Working Com- \nmittee tor many years, but he was also a link with my early \nCambridge days. We met in Cambridge first\u2014 I was a freshman, \nand he had just taken his degree. \n\nSen-Gupta died under detention. He had been made a State \nprisoner on his return firom Europe early in , while he was \nyet on board ship in Bombay. Since then he had been a \nprisoner or a \u2018detenu, and his health had deteriorated. Various \nmcilities were given to him by the Government, but evidently \nthey could not check the cotu^e of the disease. His funeral in \nCalcutta was the occasion for a remarkable mass demonstration \nand tribute; it seemed that the long pentrup sufifering soul of \nBengal had ffiimd an oudet ffir a while at least. \n\nSo SenGupta had gone. Subhas Bose, another State prisoner \nwhose healm had broken down by years of interment and \nprison, had at last been permitted by me Govermnent to go ,to \nEurope fiir treatment. The veteran Vuhabhhhai Patel also lay ill \nin Europe. And how many others had broken down in health \nor died, unable to stand the physical strain of gaol life and \nceaseless activity outside I How many, though outwardly not \nmuch changed, had suffered deeper mental derangements and \ndeveloped complexes on account of the ahnormd lives they \nhad been made to lead I . . \n\nSenGupta\u2019s diath made me vividly aware of all this terrible, \nsilent sumring going on throughout the country, and I fflt \n.weary and depressed. To what end was all this? To what end? \n\nmw \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nI had been fortunate about my own health, and in spite of \nthe strains and irregular life of Congress activity I had, on the \nwhole, kept well. Partly, I suppose, this was due to a good \nconstitution I had inherited, partly to my care of the body. \nIllness and weak health as well as too much fat seemed to me \na most unbecoming state of alfairs, and with the help of \nexercise, plenty of fresh air, and simple food, I managed to keep \naway from them. My own experience has been mat a vast \nproportion of the ailments of the Indian middle classes are \ncaused by wrong feeding; the food is both rich and excessive. \n(This applies only to those who can afford such wasteful habits.) \nThe fond mother lays the firm foundation of life-long indiges- \ntion by over-feeding the child with sweets and other so-called \ndainties. The child is also muffled up in too many clothes. \nThe English people in India also seem to eat far too much, \nalthough their food is less rich. Probably they have improved \na little from the older generation which used to consume \nenormous quantities of food, hot and strong. \n\nI have cared little for food fads, and have only avoided over- \neating and rich foods. Like nearly all Kashmiri Brahmans our \nfamily was a meat-eating one, and from clJldhood onwards I \nhad always taken meat, ^thou^h I never fancied it much. With \ndie coming of Non-Co-operauon in  I gave up meat and \nbecame a vegetarian. I remained a vegetarian till a visit to \nEurope six years later, when I relapsed to meat-eating. On my \nreturn to India I became a vegetarian again, and since then  \nhave been more or less a vegetarian. Meat-eating seems to \nagree with me well, but I have developed a distaste for it, and \nit gives me a feeling of coarseness. \n\nMy periods of ill-health, chiefly in prison in a, when for \nmany months I got a rise of temperature every, day> annoyed \nme, because they hurt my conceit of good health. And for the \nfirst time I did not think, as I used to do, in terms of abounding \nlife and energy, but a spectre of a gradual decay and a wearing \naway rose up before me and alarmed me. I do not think I am \nparticularly frightened of death. But a slow deterioration, \nbodily and mental, was quite another matter. However, my \nfears proved exaggerated, and I managed to get rid of the indis- \nposition and bimg my body imder control. Long sun-baths \nduring the winter helped me to get back my feeling of well- \nbeing. While my companions in prison would shiver in their \ncoats and shawls, I would sit, bare^odied, delightfully warmed \nup by the sun\u2019s embrace. This was only possible in North India \nduring the winter, as elsewhere the sun is usually too hot. \n\n\n\nTHE END OF A LONG TERM \n\n\n \n\nAmong my exercises one pleased me particularly \u2014 the \nshirshasana, standing on the head with the palms of the hands, \nfingers interlocked, supporting the back of the head, elbows on \nthe floor, body vertical, upside down. I suppose physically this \nexercise is very good : I liked it even more for its psychological \nei&ct on me. The slightly comic position increased my good \nhumour and made me a little more tolerant of life's vagaries. \n\nMy usual good health and the bodily sense of well-being \nhave been of very great help to me in. getting over periods of \ndepression, which are inevitable in prison life. They have \nhelped me also in accommodating myself to changing con- \nditions in prison or outside. I have had many shocks, which \nat the time seemed to bowl me over, but to my own surprise I \nhave recovered sooner than I expected. I suppose a test of my \nfundamental sobriety and sanity is the fact that I hardly know \nwhat a bad headache is, nor have I ever been troubled with \ninsomnia. I have escaped these common diseases of civilisation, \nas also bad eyesight, in spite of excessive use of the eyes for \nreading and writing, sometimes in a bad light in gaol. An \neye specialist expressed his amazement last year at my good \neyesight. Eight years before he had prophesied that I would \nhave to take to spectacles in another year or two. He was very \nmuch mistaken, and I am still carrying on successfully without \nthem. Although these facts might establish my reputation for \nsobriety and sanity, I might add that I have a horror of people \nwho are inescapably and unchangingly sane and sober. \n\nWhile I waited for my discharge from prison, the new form \nof civil disobedience for individuals was beginning outside. \nGandhiji decided to give the lead and, after giving foil notice \nto the authorities, he started on August ist with the intention \nof preaching civil resistance to the Gujrat peasantry. He was \nimmediately arrested, sentenced to one year, and sent back \nagain to his cell in Yeravda. I was glad he had gone back. \nBut soon a new complication arose. Gandhiji claimed the same \nfacilities for carrying on Haiijan work firom prison as he had \nhad before; the Government refused to grant them. Suddenly \nwe heard that Gandhiji had started fasting again on this issue. \nIt seemed an extraordinarily trivial matter for such a tremen- \ndous step. It was quite impossible for me to understand his \ndecision, even though he might be completely right in his \nargument with the Government. We could do nothing, and we \nlooked on, bewildered. \n\nAfter a week of the fast his condition grew rapidly worse. He \nhad been removed to a hospital, but he was still a prisoner \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nand Government would not give in on the question of facilities \nfor Harijan work. He lost the will to live (which he had during \nhis previous fasts) and allowed himself to go down hill. The \nend seemed to be near. He said good-bye and even made dis- \npositions about the few personal articles that were lying about \nhim, giving some to the nurses. But the Government had no \nintention of allowing him to die on their hands, and that \nevening he was suddenly discharged. It was just in time to \nsave him. Another day and perhaps it would have been too \nlate. ProbabW a great deal of the credit for saving him \nshould go to C. F. Andrews who had rushed to India, contrary \nto Gandhiji\u2019s advice. \n\nMeanwhile I was transferred from Dehra Dun Gaol on \nAugust ard, and I returned to Naini Prison after more than \na year and a half\u2019s residence in other gaols. Just then news \ncame of my mother\u2019s sudden illness and her removal to hos- \npital. On the th August,  ,  was discharged from Naini \nliecause my mother\u2019s condition was considered serious. Ordi- \nnarily I would have been released, at the latest, on September \nnth when my term expired. I was thus given an additional \nthirteen days of remission by the Provincial Government.  DOMINION STATUS AND INDEPENDENCE \n\nMost of those who have sh^ed Congress policy during the last \nseventeen years have come from the middle classes. Liberal or \nCongressmen, they have come from the same class and have \ngrown up in the same environment. Their social life and con- \ntacts and friendships have been similar, and there was little \ndifference to begin vidth between the two varieties of bourgeois \nideals that they professed. Temperamental and psychological \ndifferences began to separate them, and they began to look in \ndifferent directions \u2014 one group more towards the Government \nand the rich, upper middle class, the other towards the lower \nmiddle classes, ttie ideology still remained the same, the objec- \ntives did not differ, but behind the second group there was now \nthe push of larger numbers from the market-place and the \nhumbler professions as well as the unemployed intelligentsia. \nThe tone changed; it was no longer respectful and polite, but \nstrident and aggressive. Lacking strength to act effectively, some \nrelief was found in strong language. Frightened by this new \ndevelopment, the moderate elements dropped out and sought \nsafety m seclusion. Even so, the upper middle class was strongly \nrepresented in the Congress, though in numbers the little \nbourgeoisie was predominant. They were drawn not only by the \ndesire for success in their national struggle, but because they \nsought an inner satisfaction in that struggle. They sought \nthereby to recover their lost pride and self-respect, and to reha- \nbilitate their shattered dignity. It was the usual nationalist \nurge, and though this was common to all, it was here that the \ntemperamental differences between the moderate and the ex- \ntremist became evident. Gradually the lower middle class began \nto dominate the Congress, and later the peasantry made their \ninfluence felt. \n\nAs the Congress became more and more the representa- \ntive of the rural masses, the gulf that separated it from \nthe Liberals widened, and it became almost impossible for \nthe Liberal to understand or appreciate the Congress view-point. \nIt is not easy for the upper-dMs drawing-room to understand \nthe humble cottage or the mud hut. Yet, in spite of these \ndifferences, both ideologies were nationalist and bourgeois; \nthe variation was one of degree, not of kind. In the Congress \n\n\n\nDOMINION STATUS AND INDEPENDE*ICE  \n\nmany people remained to the last who would have been quite at \nhome in the Liberal group. \n\nFor many generations the British treated India as a kind of \nenormous country-house (after the old English fashion) that \nthey owned. They were the gentry owning the house and occu- \npying the desirable parts of it, while the Indians were consigned \nto the servants* hall and pantry and kitchen. As in every proper \ncountry-house there was a fixed hierarchy in those lower regions \n\u2014 ^butler, housekeeper, cook, valet, maid, footman, etc. \u2014 and \nstrict precedence was observed among them. But between the \nupper and lower regions of the house there was, socially and \npolitically, an impassable barrier. The fact that the British \nGovernment should have imposed this arrangement upon us \nwas not surprising; but what does seem surprising is that we, \nor most of us, accepted it as the natural and inevitable ordering \nof our lives and destiny. We developed the mentality of a good \ncountry-house servant. Sometimes we were treated to a rare \nhonour \u2014 we were given a cup of tea in the drawing-room. The \nheight of our anobition was to become respectable and to be \npromoted individually to the upper regions. Greater than any \nvictory of arms or diplomacy was this psychological triumph \nof the British in India. The slave began to think as a slave, as \nthe wise men of old had said. \n\nTimes have, changed, and the country-house type of civilisa- \ntion is not accepted willingly now, either in England or India. \nBut still there remain people amongst us who desire to .stick to \nthe servants\u2019-halls and take pride in the gold braid arrll livery \nof their service. Others, like the Liberals, accept that country- \nhouse in its entirety, admire its architecture and the whole \nedifice, but look forward to replacing the owners, one by one, by \nthemselves. They call this Indianisation. For them the problem \nis one of changing the colour of the administration, or at most \nhaving a new administration. They never think in terms of a \nnew State. \n\nFor them Swaraj means that everything continues as \n' before, only with a darker shade. They can oiuy conceive of a \nfuture in which they, or people like them, will play the principal \nre and take the place of the English high officials; in which \nthere are the same types of services, government departments, \nlegislatures, trade, industry \u2014 ^with the I.C.S. at their jobs; the \npnnees in their palaces, occasionally appearing in fancy dress \nor carnival attire with all their jewels glittering to impress their \nsubjects; the landlords claiming special protection, and mean- \nwhile harassing their tenants; tiie money-lender, with hb \n\n\n\ni jawaharlal nehrv \n\nmoney-bags, harassing both zamindar and tenant; the lawyer \nwith his fees; and God in His heaven. \n\nEssentially their outlook is based on the maintenance of the \nstatus quo, and the changes they desire can almost be termed \npersonal changes. And they seek to achieve these changes by a \nslow infiltration with the goodwill of the British. The whole \nfoimdation of their politics and economics rests on the continu- \nance and stability of the British Empire. Looking on this \nEmpire as unshakable, at least for a considerable time, uiey adapt \nthemselves to it, and accept not only its political and economic \nideology but also, to a large extent, its moral standards, which \nhave all been firamed to secure the continuance of British \ndominance. \n\nThe Congress attitude differs fundamentally from this because \nit seeks a new State and not just a different administration. \nWhat that new State is going to be may not be quite clear to \nl^e average Congressman, and opinions may differ about it. But \nit is common ground in the Congress (except perhaps for a \nmoderate firing^ that present conditions and methods cannot \nand must not continue, and basic changes are essential. Herein \nlies the difference between Dominion Status and Independence. \nThe former envisages the same old structure, with many bonds \nvisible and invisible tying us to the British economic system; \nthe latter gives us, or ought to give us, fireedom to erect a new \nstructure to suit our circumstances. \n\nIt is not a question of an inmlacable and irreconcilable anta- \n\nS onism to England and the English people, or the desire to \nreak firom them at all costs. It would be - natural enough If \nthere was bad blood between India and En|;land after what has \nhappened. \"The clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses \nthe pi^-axe,\u201d says Tagore, and the key to our hearts was \ndestroyed long ago, and the abundant use of the pick-axe on us \nhas not made us partial to the British. But if we claim to serve \nthe larger cause of India and humanity we cannot afford to be \ncarried away by our momentary passions. And even if we were \nso inclined the hard training which Gandhiji has given us for \nthe last fifteen years would prevent us. I write this sitting in a \nBritish prison, and for months past my mind has been full of \nanxiety, and I have perhaps suffered more during this solitary \nimprisonment than I have done in gaol before. Anger and \nresentment have often filled my mind at various happenings, \nand yet as I sit here, and look deep into my mind and heart, I \nI do not find any anger against England or the English people. I \ndislike British imperialism and I resent its imposition on India; \n\n\n\nDOMINION STATUS AND INDEPENDENCE  \n\nI dislike the capitalist system; I dislike exceedingly and resent \nthe way India is exploited by the ruling classes of Britain. But \nI do not hold England or the English people as a whole respon- \nsible for this, and even if I did, I do not think it would make \nmuch difference, for it is a little foolish to lose one\u2019s temper at \nor to condemn a whole people. They are as much the victims \nof circumstances as we are. \n\nPersonally, I owe too much to England in my mental make- \nup ever to feel wholly alien to her. And, do what I will, I can- \nnot get rid of the habits of mind, and the standards and ways \nof judging other countries as well as life generally, which I \nacquired at school and college in England. All my predilections \n(apart from the political plane) are in favour of England and \nthe English people, and if I have become what is called an un- \ncompromising opponent of British rule in India, it is almost in \nspite of myself. \n\nIt is that rule, that domination, to which we oHect, and with \nwhich we. cannot compromise willingly \u2014 ^not the English people. \nLet us by all means have the closest contacts with the English \nand other foreign peoples. We want fresh air in India, fresh \nand vital ideas, healthy co-<meration; we have grown too \nmusty with age. But if the English come in the rSle of a \ntiger they can expect no friendship or co-operation. To the tiger \nof imperialism there will only be the fiercest opposition, and \nto-day our country has to deal with that ferocious animal. It \nmay be possible to tame the wild tiger of the forest and to \ncharm away ,his native ferocity, but there is no such possibility \nof taming capitalism and imperialism when they combine and \nswoop down on An unhappy land. \n\nFor any one to say that he or his country will not comptomise \nis, in a sense, a foolish remark, for life is always forcing us to \ncompromise. When applied to another country or people, it is \ncompletely foolish. But there is truth in it when it is applied to \na system or a particular set of circumstances, and then it be- \ncomes something beyond human power to accomplish. Indian \nfreedom and British imperialism are two incompatibles, and \nneither martial law nor all the sugar-coating in the world \ncan make them compatible or bring them together. Only \nwith the elimination of British imperialism from India will \nconditions be created which permit of real Indo-British co- \noperation. \n\nWe are told that independence is a narrow creed in the \nmodern world, which is increasingly becoming inter-dependent, \nand therefore in demanding independence we are trying to put \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nthe, clock back. Liberals and pacifists and even so-called social- \nists in Britain advance this plea and chide us for our narrow \nnationalism, and incidentally suggest to us that the way to a \nfuller national life is through the \" British Commonwealth of \nNations.\u201d It is curious how all roads in England \u2014 ^liberalism, \npacifism, socialism, etc. \u2014 lead to the maintenance of the \nEmpire. \" The desire of a ruling nation to maintain the status \nquo,\u201d says Trotsky, \u201cfrequently dresses up as a superipfity to \n' nationalism just as the desire of a victorious nation to hang \non to its booty easily takes the form of pacifism. Thus Mac- \nDonald, in the face of Gandhi, feels as though he were an inter- \nnationalist.\" \n\nI do not know what India will be like or what she will do \nwhen she is politically free. But I do know that those of her \npeople who stand for national independence to-day stand also \nfor the widest internationalism. For a socialist, nationalism can \nhave no meaning, but even many of the non-socialists in the \nadvanced ranks of the Congress are confirmed internationalists. \nIf we claim independence to-day it is with no desire for isola- \ntion. On the contrary, we are perfectly willing to surrender part \nof that independence, in common with other countries, to a real \ninternational order. Any inmerial system, by whatever high- \nsounding name it may be called, is an enemy of such an'order, \nand it is not through such a system that world co-operation or \nworld peace can be reached. \n\nRecent developments have shown all over the world how the \nvarious imperialist systems are isolating themselves more and \nmore by autarchy and economic imperialism. Instead of the \ngrowth of internationalism we see a reversal of the process. The \nreasons for this are not difficult to discover, and they indicate \nthe growing weakness of the present economic order. One of \nthe results of this policy is that while it produces greater co- \noperation within the area of autarchy, it also means isolation \nfrom the rest of the world. For India, as we have seen by \nOttawa and other decisions, it has meant a progressive lessening \nof our ties and contacts with other countries. We have become, \neven more than we were, the hangers-on of British industry; \nand the dangers of this policy, apart firom the immediate harm \nit has done in various ways, are obvious. Thus Dominion \nStatus seems to lead to isolation and not to wider international \ncontacts. \n\nOur friends the Indian Liberals, however, have an amazing \nknack of seeing the world, and more particularly their own \ncountry, throu^ British speaacles of true-blue colour. With- \n\n\n\nDOMINION STATUS AND INDEPENDENCE  \n\nout trying to appreciate what the Congress says and why it says \nso, they repeat the old British argument of independence being \nnarrower and less soul-lifting man Dominion Status. Inter- \nnationalism means for them vihitehall, for they are singularly \nignorant of other countries, partly because of the langua^ \ndifficulty, but even more so because they are quite content to \nignore them. They are, of course, averse to direct action or \nany kind of aggressive politics in India. But it is curious \nto note that some of their leaders have no objection to such \nmethods being adopted in other countries. They can appre- \nciate and admire them from a distance, and some of the \npresent-day dictators of Western countries receive their mental \nhomage. \n\nNames are apt to mislead, but the real cmestion before us in \nIndia is whether we are aiming at a new State or merely at a \nnew administration. The Liberal answer is clear; they want the \nlatter, and nothing more, and even that is a distant and pro^es- \nsive ideal. The words ' Dominion Status \u2019 are mentioned from \ntime to time, but their real objective for the time being is ex- \npressed in those mystic words .\u201cresponsibility at the centre\". \nNot for them the full-blooded words: Power, Independence, \nFreedom, Liberty; they sound dangerous. The lawyer's lan- \nguage and approach appeals to them far more, even though it \nmay not enthuse the multitude. History has innumerable in- \nstances of individuals and groups facing perils and risking their \nlives for the sake of faith and fireedom. It seems doubtful if \nany one will ever deliberately give up a meal or sleep less \nsoundly for \"responsibility at the centre\" or any other legal \nphrase. \n\nThis, then, is their objective, and this is to be reached not by \n' direct action \u2019 or any other form of aggressive action but, as \nMr. Srinivasa Sastri put it, by a display of \" wisdom, experi- \nence, moderation! power of persuasion, quiet influence and real \nefficiency.\u201d It is hoped that by our good behaviour and qur \ngood work we shall ultimately induce our rulers to part with \npower. In other words, they resist us to-day because either they \nare irritated against us on account of our aggressive attitude, or \nthey doubt our capacity, or both. This seems a rather naive \nanalysis of im perialism and the present situation. That brilliant \nEnglish writer. Professor R. H. Tawney, has written an appro- \npriate and arresting passage dealing with the notion of gaining \npower in stages and with the co-operation of the ruling classes. \nHe refers to the British Labour Pa^ty, but his words are even \nmore applicable to India, for in England they have at least \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ndemocratic institutions, where the will of the majority can, in \ntheory, make itself felt. Professor Tawney writes : \n\n\" Onions can be eaten leaf by leaf, but you cannot skin a live \ntiger paw by paw; vivisection is its trade, and it does the skin- \nnmg first. . . . \n\n\u201cIf there is any country where the privileged classes are \nsimpletons, it is certainly not England. The idea that taa and \namiability in presenting the Labour Party\u2019s case can hoodwink \nthem into the belief that it is their case also, is as hopeless as \nan attempt to bluff a sharp solicitor out of a property of which \nhe holds the title-deeds. The plutocra(^ consists of agreeable, \nastute, forcible, self-confident, and, when hard pressed, tmscni- \npulous people, who know pretty well on which side their bread \nIS buttered, and intend that the supply of butter shall not run \nshort. ... If their position is seriously threatened, they will use \nevery piece on the board, political and economic \u2014 ^the House of \nLords, the Crown, the Press, disaffection in the Army, financial \ncrisis, international difficulties,- and even, as newspaper attacks \non the pound in  showed, the emigri trick of mjuring one\u2019s \ncountry to protect one\u2019s pocket.\u201d \n\nThe British Labour Party is a powerful org^isation. It is \nbacked by the Trade Unions, with their millions of paying \nmembers, and a highly developed co-operative organisation, as \nwell as many members and sympathisers among the professional \nclasses. Britain has democratic parliamentary institutions based \non adult suffrage, and a long tradition of civil liberty. In spite \nof all this, Mr. Tawney is of opinion \u2014 and recent events have \ncotifiimed the soundness of this \u2014 ^that the Labour Party cannot \nhope to gain real power merely by smiling and persuasion, use- \nful and desirable as both these approaches are. Mr. Tawney \nsuggests that even if the Labour Party obtained a majority in, \nthe House of Commons, it would still be powerless . to make any \nradical change in face of the opposition of the privileged \nclasses, who hold so many political, social, economic, financial \nand military citadels. In India, it need hardly be pointed out, \nconditions are very different. There are no democratic institu- \ntions or traditions. We have instead a well-established practice \nof ordinance and dictatorial rule and the supprestion of the \nliberties of the person, of meech, writing, assembly and the \nPress. Nor have the liberals any strong organisation behind \nthem. They have thus to rely on thtir smile alone. \n\nLiberals are strongly opposed to any activity that is ' uncon- \nstitutional\u2019 or \u2018illegal\u2019. In countries with democratic constitu- \ntions the word \u2018 cpnstitutional \u2019 has a wide significance. It \n\n\n\nDOMINION STATUS AND INDEPENDENCE  \n\ncontrols the making of laws, it protects liberties, it checks the \nexecutive, it provides for the democratic methods of bringing \nabout changes in the political and economic structure. But in \nIndia there is no such constitution and the word can mean no \nsuch thing.*. To use it here is merely to introduce an idea which \nhas no place in the India of to-day. The word \u2018 constitutional ' \nis often used here, strange to s^, in support of the executive's \nmore or less arbitrary actions. .Or else it is used in the sense of \n\u2018 legal \u2019. It is far beltter to confine ourselves to the words ' legal \u2019 \nor \u2018 illegal \u2019, though they are vague enough and vary fiom day \nto day. \n\nA new ordinance or a new law creates new offences. To \nattend a public meeting may be an offence; so also to ride a \nbicycle, to wear certain clothes, not to be home by sunset, not \nto report oneself to the police daily\u2014 all these and numerous \nother acts are offences to-day in some part of India. A certain \nact may be an offence in one part of the country and not in \nanother. When these laws can he promulgated by an irrespon- \nsible executive at the shortest notice, the word \u2018 legal ' simply \nmeans the will of that executive and nothing more. Ordinarily \nthat will is obeyed, willingly or sullenly, because the conse- \n\n uences of disobedience are unpleasant. But for any one to say \nlat he will always obey\u2019 it means abject submission to a dic- \ntatorship or irresponsible authority, the surrender of his con- \nscience, and the impossibility of ever gaining freedom, so far as \nhis activities are concerned. \n\nIn every democratic country to-day there is an argument \ngoing on as to whether radical economic changes can be \nbrought^ about in the ordinary course through the constitu- \ntional machin ery at their disposal. Many people are of opinion \nthat this cannot be done, and some unusual and revolutionary \nmethod will have to be adopted. For our purpose in India the \nissue of this argument is immaterial, for we have no constitu- \ntional means of bringing about the changes we desire. If the \nWhite Paper or something like it is enacted, constitutional \nprogress in many directions will be stopped completely. There \nis no way out except by revolution or illegal action. What \n\n* Mr. C. Y. eSuntamani, the eminent Liberal leader and editor- \nin-diief of the Leader newspaper, has himself laid stress on the lack \nof any kind of constitutional government in India, in his criticism, \nin the U.P. Council, of the Report of the Parliamentary Joint Select \nCommittee on hidia: \"(Better submit to the present unconsdm- \ntional government rather than to the more reacdonary and further \nmore unconstitudonal government of the future.\u201d \n\n\n\nH \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nthen is one to do? Give up all idea of change and resign \noneself to fate? \n\nThe position to-day in India is even more extraordinary. The \nExecutive can and does prevent or restrict all manner of public \nactivities. Any activity that is, in its opinion, dangerous for it \n\" is prohibited. Thus all effective public activity can be stopped, \nas it was stopped during the last three years. Submission to \nthis means giving up all public work. Ihat is an impossible \nposition to take up. \n\nNo one can say that he will always and without fail act \nlegally. Even in a democratic state occasions may arise when \none's conscience compels one to act otherwise. In a despotically \nor arbitrarily governed country these occasions are bound to \nbe more frequent; indeed, in such a state the law loses all moral \njustification. \n\n\u201cDirect action is allied to dictatorship and not democracy, \nand those who wish to bring about the triumph of democracy \nmust eschew direct action,\u201d say the Liberals. This is confused \nthinking and loose writing. Sometimes direct action \u2014 e.g. a \nworkers\u2019 strike \u2014 ^may even be legal. But probably political \naction was meant. In Germany to-day under Hitler what kind \nof action is possible? Either abject submission or illegal and \nrevolutionary action. How could democracy be served mere? \n\nIndian Liberals often refer to democracy, but most of them \nhave no desire to go near it. Sir P. S. Sivaswamy Iyer, one of \nthe most prominent of Liberal leaders, said in May : \"In \nadvocating the convention of a constituent assembly, the Con- \ngress places too much faith in the wisdom of the multitude, \nand does too little justice to the sincerity and ability of men \nwho have taken part in various Round Table Coniterences. I \nvery much doubt whether the constituent assembly would have \ndone better.\u201d Sir Sivaswamy\u2019s idea of democracy is thus some- \nthing apart from the 'multitude', and fits in more with a \ncollection of ' sincere and able \u2019 men nominated by the British \nGovernment. Further, he blesses the White Paper, for though \n\"not fully satisfied\u201d with it, \u201che thought it would be unwise \nfor the country to oppose it wholesale . There appears to be \nno reason whatever why there should not be the most perfect \nco-operation between the British Government and Sir P. S. \nSivaswamy Iyer. \n\nThe withdrawal of civil disobedience by the Congress was \nnaturally welcomed by the Liberals. It was also not surprising \nthat th^ should take credit for their wisdom in having kept \naloof firom this \u201cfoolish and ill-advised movemprit\u201d, \u201cDid w** \n\n\n\nDOMINION STATUS AND INDEPENDENCE  \n\nnot say so? \u201d they told us. It was a strange argument. Because \nwhen we stood up and put up a good fight we were knocked \ndown; therefore, the moral pointed out was that standing up is \na bad thing. Crawling is best 'and safest. It is quite impossible \n\u00a3 be knocked down or to fall from that horizontal position.  INDIA OLD AND NEW \n\nIt was natural and inevitable that Indian nationalism should \nresent alien rule. And yet it was curious how large numbers of \nour intelligentsia, to the end of the nineteen^ century, ac- \ncepted, consciously or unconsciously, the British ideology of \nempire. They built their own arguments on this, ^d only \nventured to criticise some of iw outward manifestations. The \nhistory and economics and other subjects that were taught in \nthe schools and colleges were written entirely from the British \nimperial view-point, and laid stress on our numerous failings \nin the past and present and the virtues and high destiny of the \nBritish. We accepted to some extent this distorted version, and \neven when we resisted it instinctively we were influenced by it. \nAt first there was no intellectual escape from it for we knew no \nother iacts or arguments, and so we sought relief in religious \nnationalism, in me thought that at least in the sphere of re- \nligion and philosophy we were second to no other people. We \ncomforted ourselves m our misfortune and degradation with \nthe notion that though we did not possess the outward show \nand glitter of the \"^^st we had the real inner article, which \nwas far more valuable and worth having. Vivekananda and \nothers, as well as the interest of Western scholars in our old \nphilosophies, gave us a measure of self-tespect again and \nroused up our dormant pride in our past. \n\nGradually we began to suspect and examine critically British \nstatements about our past and present conditions, but still we \nthought and worked within the framework of British ideology. \nIf a thing was bad, it would be called \u2018un-British\u2019; if a \nBritisher in India misbehaved, the fault was his, not that of \nthe system. But the collection of this critical material of \nBritish rule in India, in spite of the moderate outlook of the \nauthors, served a revolutionary purpose and gave a political and \neconomic fisundation to our nationalism. Dadabhai Naoroji\u2019s \nPoverty and Un-British Rule in India, and books by Romesh \nDutt and William Digby and others, thus played a revolu- \ntionary re in the development of our nationalist thought. \nFurther researches in andent Indian history revealed b rilliant \nand highly dvilised periods in the remote past, and we read of \nthese with great satisfaction. We also discovered that the \n\n* \n\n\n\nINDIA OLD AND NEW \n\n\n\u00bb \n\nBritish record in India was very different from what we had \nbeen led to believe from their history books. \n\nOur challenge to the Britisfr version of history, economics, \nand administration in India grew, and yet we continued to \nfunction within the orbit of their ideology. That was the \nposition of Indian nationalism as a whole at the turn of the \ncentury. That is still the position of the Liberal group and \nother small groups as well as a number of moderate Congress- \nmen, who go forward emotionally from time to time, but \nintellectually still live in the nineteenth century. Because of \nthat the Liberal is unable to grasp the idea of Indian freedom, \nfor the two are fundamentally irreconcilable. He imagines that \nstep by step he will go up to higher offices and will deal with \nfatter and more important files. The m ach in ery of govern- \nment will go on smoothly as before, only he will be at the \nhub, and somewhere in the background, without intruding \nthemselves too much, wiU be the British Army to give him \nprotection in case of need. That is his idea of Dominion Status \nwithin the Empire. It is a naive notion impossible of achieve- \nment, for the price of British protection is Indian subjection. \nWe cannot have it both ways, even if that was not degrading \nto the self-respect of a great coimtry. Sir Frederick Whyte (no \npahisan of Indian nationalism) says in a recent book:* \"He \n(the Indian) stiU believes that England wUl stand between him \nand disaster, and as long as he cherishes this delusion he can- \nnot even lay the foundation of his own ideal of selfgovem- \nment.\u201d Evidently he refers to the Liberal or the reactionary \nand communal t^es of Indians, largely with whom he must \nhave come into contact when he was President of the Indian \nLegislative Assembly. This is not the Congress belief, much \nless is it that of other advanced groups. They agree with \nSir Frederick, however, that there can be ho freedom till this \ndelusion goes and India is left to free disaster, if that is her \nfate, by herself. The complete withdrawal of British military \ncontrol of India wUl be the beginning of Indian freedom. \u2022 \n\nIt is not surprising that the Indian intelligentsia m the lune- \nteenth century should have succumbed to British ideology; \nwhat is surprising is that some people should continue to sufiw \nthat delusion even after the -stirring events and changes of the \ntwentieth century. In the nineteenth century the British ruling \nclasses were the aristocrats of the world, with a long record \nof wealth and success and power behind them. Inis long \nrecord and training gave them some of the virtues as well as \n* Sir Frederick \\^yte: The Future of East and West. \n\n\n\n TAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nfailings of aristocracy. We in India can comfort ourselves with \nthe thought that we helped substantially during the last cen- \ntury and three-quarters in providing the wherewithal and the \ntraming for this superior state. They began to think themselves \n\u2014 as so many races and nations have done \u2014 ^the chosen of \nGod and their Empire as an earthly Kingdom of Heaven. If \ntheir special position was acknowledged and their superiority \nnot challenged, they were gracious and obliging, provided that \nthis did them no harm. But opposition to them became opposi- \ntion to the divine order, and as such was a deadly sin which \nmust be suppressed. \n\nM. Andr^ Siegfried has an interesting passage dealing with \nthis aspect of British psychology.^ \n\n\u201cPar Vhabitude hdrSditaire du pouvoir joint a la richesse, il \na find par contracted une maniere ^Stre, aristocratique, curieuse- \nmetit imbue de droit divin ethnique et qui mime a continui \nde s^accentuer quand dejd la suprematie hritannique itait \ncontestie, Les jeunes ginirations de la fin du siicle , . , elles \nen arrivent h se dire, inconsciemment, que ce succhs leur est \ndd. . . . \n\n\u201c Cette facon d\u2019interpriter les chases est intiressante d \nsouligner, parce qu\u2019elle ecladre, dans ce difiU particuliirement \ndilicat, les rdactions de la psychology britamdque.

There was something \nfascinating about the British approach to the Indian problem, \neven though it was singularly irritating. The .calm assurance \nof always being in the Hght and of having home a great \nburden worthily, faith in their racial destiny and their own \nbrand of imperialism, contempt and anger at the unbelievers \nand sinners who challenged the foundations of the true faith \u2014 \nthere was something of the religious temper about this attitude, \nlike the Inquisitors of old, they were bent on saving us re- \n\nf ardless of our desires in the matter. Incidentally they profited \ny this traffic in virtue, thus demonstrating the truth of the \nold proverb: \u201cHonesty is the best policy\u201d. The progress of \nIndia became synonymous with the adaptation of the country \n^ In La Crise Britannique au XX* Sidcle, \n\n\n\nINDIA OLD AND NEW \n\n\n \n\nto the imperial scheme and the fashioning of chosen Indians \nafter the British mould. The more we accepted Bridsh ideals \nand objectives the fitter we were for \u2018self-government\u2019. Free- \ndom would be ours as soon as we demonstrated and guaranteed \nthat we would use it only in accordance with British wishes. \n\nIndians and Englishmen are, I am afraid, likely to disagree \nabout the record of British mle in India. That is perhaps \nnatural, but it does come as a shock when high British officials, \nincluding Secretaries of State for India, draw fanciful pictures \nof Indins past and present and make statements which have \nno basis in fact. It is quite extraordinary how ignorant English \npeople, apart firom some experts and others, are about India. If \nfacts elude them, how much more is the spirit of India beyond \ntheir reach? They seized her body and possessed her, but it \nwas the possession of violence. They did not know her or try \nto know her. They never looked into her eyes, for theirs were \naverted and hers downcast through shame and humiliation. \nAfter centuries of contact they face each other, strangers still, \nfull of dislike for each other. \n\nAnd yet India with all her poverty and degradation had \nenough of nobility and greatness about her, and though she \nwas overburdened with ancient tradition and present misery, \naiid her eyelids were a little weary, she had \u201c a beauty wrought \nout firom within upon the flesh, the deposit little cell by \ncell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite \npassions B^ind and within her battered body one could still \nglimpse a majesty of soul. Through long ages she had travelled \nand gathered much wisdom on the way, and trafficked with \nstrangers and added them to her own big family, and witnessed \ndays of glory and of decay, and suffered humiliation and ter- \nrible sorrow, and seen many a strange sight; but throughout her \nlong journey she had clung to her immemorial culture, drawn \nstrength and vitality fi:om it, and shared it , with other lands. \nLike a pendulum she had swung up and down; she had ven- \ntured with the daring of her thought to reach up to the \nheavens and unravel their mystery, and she had also had bitter \nexperience of the pit of hell. Despite the woeful accumulations \nof superstition and degrading custom that had clung to her \nand borne her down, she had never wholly fiirgotten the in- \nspiration that some of the wdsest of her children, at the dawn \nof history, had given her in the Upanishads. Their keen minds, \never restless and ever striving and exploring, had not sought \nrefuge in blind dogma or grown complacent in the routine \nobservance of dead forms or ritual and creed. They had de- \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nmanded not a personal relief from suffering in the present or \na place in a paradise to come, but light and understanding: \n\u201c Lead me ffom the unreal to the real, lead me from darkness \nto light, lead me from death to immortality.\u201d * In the most \nfamous of the prayers recited daily even to-day by millions, the \ngayatri mantra, the call is for knowledge, for enlightenment. \n\nThough often broken up politically her spirit always guarded \na common heritage, and in her diversity there was ever an \namazing unity.\u00ae Like all ancient lands she was a curious mix- \ntutc of the good and bad, but the good was hidden and had \nto he sought after, while the odour of decay was evident and \nher hot, pitiless sun gave full publicity to the bad. \n\nThere is some similarity between Italy and India, Both are \nancient countries with long traditions of culture behind them, \nthough Italy is a newcomer compared to India, and India is \na much vaster country. Both are split up politically, and yet \nthe conception of Italia, like that of India, never died, and \nin all their diversity the unity was predominant. In Italy the \nunity was largely a Roman unity, for that great city had \ndominated the country and been the fount and symbol of \nunity. In India there was no such single centre or dominant \ndty, although Benares might well be called the Eternal City \nof the East, not only for India but also for Eastern Asia. But, \nunlike Rome, Benares never dabbled in empire or thought of \ntemporal power. Indian culture was so widespread all over \nIndia that no part of the country could be called the heart of \nthat culture. From Cape Comorin to Amaranath and Badrinath \nin the Himalayas, from Dwarka to Puri, the same ideas coursed, \nand if there was a clash of ideas in one place, the noise of it \nsoon reached distant parts of the country. \n\nJust as Italy gave the gift of culture and religion to Western \nEurope, India \u00a3d so to Eastern Asia, though Qiina was as old \nand venerable as India. And even when Italy was lying pros- \ntrate politically, her life coursed through the veins of Europe. \n\nIt was Mettemich who called Italy a \u201cgeographical ex- \npression\u201d, and many a would-be Mettemich has used that \n\n^ Brihadaranyak Upanishad, i, , . \n\n\u00ae \u201c greatest of all the contradictions in India is that over \nthis diversity is spread a greater unity, which is not immediately \nevident because it failed historically to find expression in any \npolitical cohesion to make the country one, but which is so great \na reality, and so powerful, that even the Musulman world of mdia \nhas to confess that it has been deeply affected by coming wiritdn \nits influence.\u201d Sir Frederick Whyte ; Tha Future of East and West. \n\n\n\nINDIA OLD AND NEW ! \n\nphrase for India, and, strangely enough, there is a similarity \neven in their geographical positions in the two continents. \nMore interesting is the comparison of England with Austria, \nfor has not England of the twentieth century been compared \nto Austria of the nineteenth, proud and haughty and imposing \nstill, but with the roots that gave strength shrivelling up and \ndecay eating its way into the mighty fabric. \n\nIt is curious how one cannot resist the tendency to give an \nanthropomorphic form to a country. Such is the force of habit \nand early associations. India becomes Bharat Mata, Mother \nIndia, a beautiful lady, very old but ever youthful in appear- \nance, sad-eyed and forlorn, cruelly treated by aliens and out- \nsiders, and calling upon her children to protect her. Some such \npicture rouses the emotions of Hundreds of thousands and \ndrives them to aaion and sacrifice. And yet India is in the \nmain the peasant and the worker, not beautiful to look at, for \npove^ is not beautiful. Does the beautiful lady of our \nima^ations represent the bare-bodied and bent workers in \nthe fields and factories? Or the small group of those who have \nfrom ages past crushed the masses and exploited them, imposed \ncruel customs on them and made many of them even untouch- \nable? We seek to cover truth by the creatures of our imagina- \ntions and endeavour to escape firom reality to a world of \ndreams. \n\nAnd yet despite these diSerent classes and their mutual con- \nflicts there was a common bond which united them in India, \nand one is amazed at its persistence and tenacity and enduring \nvitality. What was this strength due to? Not merely the \npassive strength and weight of inertia and tradition, |[reat as \nthese always are. There was an active sustaining princmle, fijr \nit resisted successfully poweiful outside influences and absorbed \ninternal forces that rose to combat it. And yet with all its \nstren^h it could not preserve political fifeedom or endeavour \nto brmg about political unity. These latter do not appear to \nhave been considered worth much trouble; their importance \nwas very foolishly ignored, and we have suffered fiir this neglect. \nRight through history the old Indian ideal did not glorify \npolitical and military triumph, and it looked down upon money \nand the professional money-making class. Honour and wealm \ndid not go together, and honour was meant to go, at least in \ntheory* to the meii who served the community with little in the \nshape of financial reward. \n\nThe old culture managed to live through many a fierce storm \nand tempest, but though it kept its outer fijrm, it lost its real \n\n\n\n JAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\ncontent. To-day it is fighting silently and desperately against \na new and all-powerful opponent \u2014 the bania civilisation of the \ncapitalist West. It will succumb to this newcomer, for the West \nbrmgs science, and science brings food for the hungry millions. \nBut the West also brings an antidote to the evils of this cut- \nthroat civilisation \u2014 the principles of socialism, of co-operation, \nand service to the community for the common good. This is \nnot so unlike the old Brahman ideal of service, but it means \nthe brahmanisation (not in the religious sense, of course) of all \nclasses and groups and the abolition of class distinctions. It \nmay be that when India puts on her new garment, as she must, \nfor the old is tom and tattered, she will have it cut in this \nfashion, so as to make it conform both to present conditions \nand her old thought. The ideas she adopts must become racy to \nher soil. \n THE RECORD OF BRITISH RULE \n\nWhat has been the record of British rule in India? I doubt if \nit is possible for any Indian or Englishman to take an objective \nand dispassionate view of this long record. And even if this \nwere possible, it would be still more difficult to weigh and \nmeasure the psychological and other immaterial factors. We \nare told that British rule \u201chas given to India that which \nthroughout the centuries she never possessed, a government,- \nwhose authority is vmcjuestioned in any part of me sub-con- \ntinent \u2019V it has estabhshed the rule of law and a just and \nefficient administration; it has brought to India Western con- \nceptions of parliamentary government and personal liberties; \nand \" by transforming British India into a single unitary state \nit has engendered amongst Indians a sense of political unity \u201c \nand thus fostered the mst beginnings of nationalism.* That \nis the British case, and there is much truth in it, though the \nrule of law and personal liberties have not been evident for \nmany years. \n\nThe Indian survey of this period lays stress on many other \nfactors, and points out the injury, mat eria l and spirimaJ, that \nforeign rule has brought us. The view-point is so different that \nsometimes the very thing that is commended by the British is \ncondemned by Indians. As Doctor Ananda Coomaraswamy \nwrites : \u201c One of the most remarkable features of British rule \nin India is that the greatest injuries inflicted upon the Indian \npeople have the outward appearance of blessings.\u201d \n\nAs a matter of fact the changes that have taken place in \nIndia diflring the last century or more have been world changes \ncommon to most countries in the East and West. The growth \nof industrialism in Western Europe, and later on in the rest of \nthe world, brought nationalism and the strong unitary state in \nits train everywhere. The British can take creiSt for having first \nopened India\u2019 s windo w to the West and brought her one aspect \nof Western indu^rialism and science. But having done so uiey \nthrottled the further industriaf growth of the country till , \ncircumstances forced their hands. India was already the meet- \u2019 \ning-place of two cultures, the western Asiatic culture of Islam \n\n* The quotadons are from the Report of the Joint Parliamentary \nCommittee on Indian Constitutional Reform (). \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRtT \n\nand the eastern, her own product, which spread to the Far East \nAnd now a third and more powerful impulse came from further \nwest, and India became a meal point and a battle-ground for \nvarious old and new ideas. There can be no doubt that this \nthird impulse would have triumphed and thus solved many of \nIndia's old problems, but the British, who had themsdves \nhelped in brmging it, tried to stop its further progress. They \npreve nted our industria l growth, and thus delayed our political \ngrowtti, and preserved all the out-of-date feudal and other relics \nthey could find in the country. They even froze up our \nchanging and to some extent progressing laws and customs at \nthe stage they foimd them, and made it difficult for us to \nget out of their shackles. It was not with their good,will or \nassistance that the bourgeoisie grew in India. But after intro- \nducing the railway and other products of industrialism they \ncotdd not stop the wheel of change; they could only check it \nand slow it down, and this they did to their own manifest ad- \nvantage. \n\n\"On this solid foundation the majestic structure of the \nGovernment of India rests, and it can be claimed with certainty \nthat in the period which has elapsed since ij when the Crown \nassumed supremacy over all the territories of the East India \nCompany, the educational and material progress of India has \nbeen greater than it was ever within her power to achieve during \nany other period of her long and chequered history.\u201d ^ This \nstatement is not so self-evident as it appears to be, and it has \noften been stated that literacy actually went down with the \ncoming of British rule. But even if the statement was wholly \ntrue, it amounts to a comparison of the modem industrial age \nwith past ages. In almost every country in the world the educa- \ntional and material progress has been tremendous during the \npast century because of science and industrialism, and it may \nbe said with assurance of any such country that progress of \nthis kind \"has been greater than was ever within her power \nto achieve during any other period of her long and chequered \nhistory\u201d \u2014 ^though perhaps that country\u2019s history may not be \na long one in comparison with Indian history. Are we need- \nlessly ca ntank erous and perverae if we suggest that some such \ntechnical process would have come to us anyhow in this in- \ndustrial age, and even without British rule? And, indeed, if we \ncompare oiir lot with many other countries, may we not hazard \nthe guess that such progress might have been greater, for we have \nhad to contend agamst a stifling of (hat progress by t|ie British \n^ Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (). \n\n\n\nTHE RECORD OF BRITISH RULE \n\n\n \n\nthemselves? Railways, telegraphs, telephones, wireless and the \nlike are hardly tests of the goodness or beneficence of British \nrule. They were welcome and necessary, and because the British \nhappened to be the a^nts who brought theta first, we should \nbe grateful to them. But even, these heralds of industrialism \ncame to us primarily for the str^gthening of British rule. \nThey were the veins and arteries through which the nation\u2019s \nblood should have coursed, increasing its trade, carrying its \nproduce, and bringing new life and wealth to its millions. It is \ntrue that in the long-run some such result was likely, but they \nwere designed and worked for another purpose \u2014 ^to strengthen \nthe imperial hold and to capture markets for British goods \u2014 \nwhich they succeeded in achieving. I am all in favour of \nin dustrialisation and the latest methods of transpeirt, but \nsometimes, as I rushed across the Indian plains, the railway, \nthat life-giver, has almost seemed to me liW iron bands con- \nfining and imprisoning India. \n\nThe British conception of ruling India was the police con- \nception of the State. Government\u2019s job was to protect tEe\"State \nand leave the rest to others. Their public finance de^t with \nmilita^ expenditure, police, civil administration, interest on \ndebt. The economic needs of the citizens were not looked after, \nand were sacrificed to British interests. The cultural and other \nneeds of the /people, except for a tiny handful, were entirely \nneglected. The changing conceptions of, public finance which \nbrought free and universal education, improvement of public \nhealth, care of poor and feeble-minded, insurance of workers \nagainst illness, old age and unemployment, etc., in other \ncountries, were almost entirely beyond the ken of die Govern- \nment. It could not indulge in these spending activities for its \ntax system was most regressive, taking a much larger pro- \nportion of small incomes than of the larger ones, and its ex- \npenditure on its protective and administrative functions was \nterribly heavy and swallowed up most of the revenue. \n\nThe outstanding feature of British rule was their concen- \ntration on everythi ng that went to strengthen their poli tical and \nec onomic hold on fhe country. Everything else was incidental. \nIf they built up a powerful central government and an efficient \npolice force, that was an achievement for which they can take \ncredit, but die Indian people can hardly congratulate tiiemselves \non it. Unity is a good thing, but unity in subjection is hardly \na thing to be proud of. The very strength of a despotic govern- \nment may become a greater buraen for a' people; and a police \nforce, no doubt useful in many ways, can be, and has been often \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\nenou^, turned against the very people it is supposed to pro- \ntect. Bertrand Russell, comparing modern civilisation with the \nold Greek, has recently written : \u201c The only serious superiority \nof Greek civilisation as compared to ours was the inefficiency \nof the police, which enabled a larger proportion of decent \npeople to escape.\u201d \n\nBritain\u2019s supremacy in India brought us peace, and India was \ncertainly in need of peace after the troubles and misfortunes \n\u25a0^that followed the break-up of the Moghal empire. Peace is a \nprecious commodity, necessary for any progress, and it was \nwelcome to us when it came. But even peace can be purchased \nat too great a price, and we can have the perfect peace of the \ngrave, and the absolute safety of a cage or of prison. Or peace \nmay be the sodden despair of men unable to better themselves. \nThe peace which is imposed by an alien conqueror has hardly \nthe restful and soothing qualities of the real article. War is \na terrible thing and to be avoided, but it does encourage some \nvirtues, which, according to William James, the psychologist, \nare: fidelity, cohesiveness, tenacity, heroism, conscience, edu- \ncation, inventiveness, economy, and physical health and vigour. \nBecause of this, James sought for a moral equivalent of war \nwhich, without the horrors of war, would encourage these \nvirtues in a community. Perhaps if he had \"learnt of non- \nco-operation and dvil disobedience he would have found some- \nthing after his own heart, a moral and peaceful equivalent of \nwar. \n\nIt is a futile task to consider the \u2018ifs\u2019 and possibilities of \nhistory. I feel sure that it was a good thing for India to come \nin contact with the sdentific and industrial West. Science was \n\n\nthe great gift of the West, and India lacked this, and without \nit she was doomed to decay. The manner of our contacts was \nunfortunate, and yet, perhaps, only a succession of violent \nshocks could shake us out of our torpor. From this point of \nview the Protestant, individualistic, Anglo-Saxon English were \nsuitable, for- they were more different from us than most other \nWesterners, and could give us greater shocks. \n\nThey gave us. political unity and that was a desirable thing, \n^but wheflier lye had this unity or not, Indian nationalism would \n'have grown and demanded that unity. The Arab world is to- \nday sj^t up into a large number of separate states \u2014 ^indepen- \ndent, protected, mandatory and the like \u2014 ^but throughout all of \nthem runs the desire for Arab unity. There can be no doubt \nthat Arab nationalism would largely achieve this unity if Wes- \ntern imperialist powers did not stand in the way. But, as in \n\n\n\nTHE RECORD OF BRITISH RULE  \n\nIndia, it is the purpose of these powers to encourage disruptive \ntendencies and create minority problems which weaken and \npartly counteract the nationalist urge and give an excuse to the \nimperialist power to stay on and pose as the impartial arbi- \ntrator. \n\nThe political unity of India was achieved incidentally as \na side-product of the Empire\u2019s advance. In later years, when \nthat unity allied itself to nationalism and challenged alien rule, \nwe witnessed the deliberate promotion of disunity and sec- \ntarianism, formidable obstacles to our future progress. \n\nWhat a long time it is since the British came here, a century \nand three-quarters since they became dominant I They had a \nfree hand, as despotic governments have, and a magnificent \nopportunity to mould India according to their desire. During \nthese years the world has changed out of all recognition\u2014 \nEngland, Europe, America, Japan. The insignificant American \ncolonies bordering the Atlantic in the eighteenth century con- \nstitute to-day the wealthiest, the most powerful and techni call y \nthe most advanced nation; Japan, within a brief span, has \nundergone amazing changes; the vast territories of the U.S.S.R., \nwhere till only yesterday the dead hand of the Tsar's govern- \nment suppressed and stifled all growth, now pulsate with a new \nlife and build a new world berore our eyes. There have been \nbig changes in India also, and the country is very different \nfrom what it was in the eighteenth century \u2014 ^railways, irrigation \nworks, factories, schools and colleges, huge government offices, \netc., etc. \n\nAnd yet, in spite of these changes, what is India like to-day? \nA servile state, with its splendid strength caged up, hardly \ndaring to breaAe freely, governed by strangers firom afar; her \npeople poor beyond compare, short-lived and incapable of \nresisting disease and epidemic; illiteracy rampant; vast areas \ndevoid of all sanitary or medical provision; unemployment on \na prodigious scale, both among the middle classes and the \nmasses. Freedom, democracy, socialism, communism are, we \nare told, the slogans of unpractical idealists, doctrinaires or \nknaves; the test must be one of the well-bdng of the people as \na whole. That is indeed a vital test, and by that test India \nmakes a terribly poor show to-day. We read of great schemes \nof unemployment relief and the alleviation of distress in other \ncountries; what of our scores of millions of unemployed ^d \nthe distress that is widespread and permanent? We read , also \nof housing schemes elsewhere; where are the houses of hun- \ndreds of millions of our people, who live in mud huts or have \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nno shelter at all? May we not envy the lot of other countries \nwhere education, sanitation, medical relief, cultural facilities, \nand production advance rapidly ahead, while we remain where \nwe were, or plod wearily along at the pace of a snail? Russia \nin a brief dozen years of wonderful effort has almost ended \nilliteracy in her vast territories, and has evolved a fine and \nup-to-date system of education, in touch with the life of the \nmasses. Backward Turkey, under the Ataturk, Mustapha \nKemal\u2019s leadership, has also made giant strides towards wide- \nspread literacy. Fascist Italy, on the very threshold of its career, \nattacked illiteracy with vigour. Gentile, the Education Minister, \ncalled for \u201ca fiontal attack on illiteracy. That gangrenous \nplague, which is rotting our body politic, must be extirpated \nwith a hot iron.\u201d Hard words, unseemly for a drawing-room, \nbut they show the conviction and energy behind the thought. \nWe are politer here and use more rounded phrases. We move \nwarily and exhaust our energies in commissions and commit- \ntees. \n\nIndians have been accused of talking too much and doing \nlittle. It is a just charge. But may we not express our wonder \nat the inexhaustible capacity of the British for committees and \ncommissions, each of which, after long labour, produces a \nlearned report\u2014 -\"a great State document\u201d \u2014 ^wbich is duly \npraised and pigeon-holed? And so we get the sensation of \nmoving ahead, of progress, and yet have the advantage of \nremaimng where we were. Honour is satisfied, and vested \ninterests remain untouched and secure. Other countries discuss \nhow to get on; we discuss checks and brakes and safeguards \nlest -we go too fast. \n\n\u201c The Imperial splendour became the measure of the people's \npoverty,\u201d so we are told (by the Joint Parliamentary Committee \n) of the Moghal times. It is a just observation, but may we \nnot apply the same measure to-day? What of New Delhi \nto-day with its Viceregal pomp and pageantry, and the Pro- \nvincial GQvemors with all their ostentation? And all this with \na background of abject and astonishing poverty. The contrast \nhurts, and it is a little difficult to imagine how sensitive men \ncan put up with it. India to-day is a poor and dismal sight \nbehind all the splendours of the imperial firontage. There is \na mat deal of patchwork and superficiality, and behind it the \numiappy petty bourgeoisie, crushed more and more by modem \nconditions. Further back come the workers, living miserably \nin grinding poverty, and then the peasant, that symbol of \nIndia, whose lot it is to be \u201c bom. to Endless Nisiht \n\n\n\n-iRE RECORD OF BRITISH RULE \n\n\n \n\n\n\u201c Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans \n^on his hoe and,gaze on the ground, \n\nThe emptiness of ages on his face, \n\nAnd on his back the burden of the world. \n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 * a \u2022 \n\n\u201c Through this dread shape the suffering ages look. \n\nTime\u2019s tragedy is in -that aching stoop. \n\nThrough this dread shape humanity betrayed. \n\nPlundered, profaned and disinherited. \n\nCries protest to the powers that made the world, \n\nA protest that is also prophecy.\u201d * \n\nIt would be absurd to cast the blame for all India\u2019s ills on the \nBritish. That responsibility must be shouldered by us, and we \nmay not shirk it; it is unseemly to blame others for the inevit- \nable consequences of our own weaknesses. An authoritarian \nsystem of government, and especially one that is foreign, must \nencourage a psychology of subservience and try to limit the \nmental oudow and horizon of the people. It must crush much \nthat is finest in youth \u2014 enterprise, spirit of adventure, origi- \nnality, \u2018pep\u2019 \u2014 and encourage sne^shness, rigid confbrmity, \nand a desire' to cringe and please the bosses. Su(\u00b1 a system does \nnot bring out the real service mentality, the devotion to public \nservice or to ideals; it picks out the least public-spirited persons \nwhose sole objective is to get on in life. We see what a class \nthe British attract to themselves in India! Some of them are \nintellectually keen and -capable of good work. They drift to \ngovernment service or semi-govemment service because of lack \nof opportunity elsewhere, and gradually they tone down and \nbecome just parts of the big machine, their minds imprisoned \nby the dull routine of work. They develop the qualities of a \nbureaucracy \u2014 \u201ca competent knowledge of clerkship and the \ndiplomatic art of keeping office At the highest they have a \n\ng assive devotion to the public service. There is, or can be, no \naming enthusiasm. Tnat is not possible^ under a foreign \ngovernment. \n\nBut apa!rt from these, the majority of petty officials are not \nan admirable lot, for they have o:^ learnt to cringe to their \nsuperiors and bully their inferiors. The fault is not theirs. That \nis the training the system gives them. And if sycophancy and \nnepotism flourish, as they often do, is it to be wondered at? \nThey have no ideals in service; the haunting fear of unem- \nployment and consequent 'starvation pursues them, and thdr \n\n^ These extracts are from the American poet,- E. Markham\u2019s \nTpoeax: The Man with the Hoe, \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nchief concern is to hold on to their johs and get other jobs for \ntheir relatives and friends. Where the spy and that most \nodious of creatures, the informer, always hover in the back- \nground, it is not easy to develop the more desirable virtues in \na people. \n\nRecent developments have made it even more difficult for \nsensitive, public-spirited men to join government service. The \nGovernment does not want them, and they do not wish to \nassociate with it too closely, unless compelled by economic \ncircumstance. \n\nBut, as all the world knows, it is the White Man who bears \nthe burden of Empire, not the Brown. We have various im- \nperial services to carry on the imperial tradition, and a suffi- \nciency of safeguards to protect their special privileges, all, we \nare told, in the interests of India. It is remarkable how the \ngood of India seems to be tied up with the obvious interests \nand advancement .of these services. If any privilege or prize \npost of the Indian Civil Service is taken away, we are told that \ninefficiency and corruption will result. If the reserved jobs for \nthe Indian Medical Service are reduced, this becomes a \u201c menace \nto India\u2019s health.\u201d And of course if the British element in \nthe army is touched, all manner of terrible perils confront us. \n\nI think there is some truth in this; that if the superior \nofficials suddenly went away and left their departments in \ncharge of their subordinates there would be a fall in efficiency. \nBut that is because the whole system has been built this way, \nand the subordinates are not by any means the best men, nor \nhave they ever been made to shoulder responsibility. I feel \nconvinced that there is abundant good material in India, and \nit could be available within a feirly short period if proper \nsteps were taken. But that means a complete change m our \ngovernmental and social outlook. It means a new State. \n\nAs it is we are told that whatever changes in the constitu- \ntional apparatus may come our way, the ri^d framework of \nthe great services which guard and shelter us will continue as \nbefore. Hierophants of the sacred mysteries of government, \nthey will guard the temple and prevent the vulgar from enter- \nir^ its holy precincts. Gradually, as we make ourselves worthy \nof the privilege, they will remove the veils one after another, \ntiU, in some future age, even the holy of holies stands un- \ncovered to our wondering and reverent eyes. \n\nOf all these imperial services the Indian Civil Service holds \nfirst place, and to it must largely go the credit or discredit for \nthe, functioning of government in India. We have been fre- \n\n\n\nTHE RECORD OF BRITISH RULE I , \n\nquently told of the many virtues of this service, and its great- \nness in the imperial scheme has almost become a maxim. Its \nunchallenged position of authority in India with the almost \nautocratic power that this gives, as well as the praise and \nboosting which it receives in ample measure, cannot be wholly \ngood for the mental equilibrium of any individual or group. \nWith all my admiration for the Service, I am afraid I must \nadmit that it is peculiarly susceptible, both individually and \nas a whole, to that old and yet somewhat modem disease, \nparanoia. \n\nIt would be idle to deny the good qualities of the I.C.S., for \nwe are not allowed to forget them, but so much bunkum has \nbeen and is said about the Service that I sometimes feel that \na little debunking would be desirable. The American economist, \nVeblen, has called the privileged classes the \u201ckept classes\u201d. I \nthink it would be equally true to call the I.C.S., as well as the \nother imperial services, the \u201c kept services \u201d. They are a very \nexpensive luxury. \n\nMajor D. Graham Pole, formerly a Labour member of the \nBritish Parliament and one who is greatly interested in Indian \naffairs, writing in the Modem Review some time ago stated \nthat \u201c no one has ever tried to dispute the fact that the I.C.S. \nis a most able and efficient service.\u201d As similar statements are \nfrequently made in England and believed, it is worth while \nexamining this. It is always unsafe to make such positive and \ndefinite statements which can easily be disproved, and Major \nGraham Pole is entirely wrong in imagining that the fact has \nnot been disputed. It has been frequently mallenged and dis- \nputed, and long ago even Mr. G. K. Gokhale said many hard \nthin\u00bb about the I.C.S, The average Indian\u2014 Congressman or \nnon-Congressman\u2014 would certainly join issue with Major \nGraham Pole. And yet it is possible that both may be partly \nright and may be thinking of different qualifications. Ability \nand efficiency for what? If this ability and efficiency are to be \nmeasured from the point of view of strengthening the British \nEmpire in India and helping it to exploit the country, the LC.S. \nmay certainly claim to have done well. If however, the test is \nthe well-being of the Indian masses, they have signally friled, \nand their faimre becomes even more noticeable wffien one sees \nthe enormous distance that separates them in regard to income \nand standards of living from the masses they are meant to \nserve, and from whom ultimately their varied emoluments \ncome. \n\nIt is perfectly true that the service has, as a whole, kept up \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\na certain standard, though that standard is necessarily one of \nmediocrity, and has occasionally thrbwn up exceptional men. \nMore could hardly be expected of any such service. It em- \nbodied essentially the British Public School spirit, with all its \ngood and bad points (though many of the members of the \nLC.S. now are not public school men). Though it kept up a \ngood standard, it disapproved strongly of nonconformity with \nthe type, and special abilities of individual members lost them- \nselves in the dull routine'of the day\u2019s work, and to some extent \nin the fear of appearing different nrom the others. There were \nmany earnest members, many with a conception of service, but \nit was service of the Empire, and India came only as a bad \nsecond. Trained and circumstanced as they were, they could \nonly act in that way. Because they were few in numbers, sur- \nrounded by an alien and often unfriendly people, they held \ntogether and kept up a certain standard. The prestige both of \nrace and office demanded this. And because they had largely \nautocratic powers, they resented all criticism, considered it one \nof the major sins, became more and more intolerant and \npedagogic, and developed many of the ffillings of irresponsible \nrulers. They were self-satisfied and self-sufficient, narrow and \nfixed minds, static in a changing world, and wholly unsuited to \na progressive environment. When abler and more adaptable \nminds than theirs tackled the Indian problem they resented \nthis, called them offensive names, suppressed them and threw \nevery possible obstacle in their way. And when post-war \nchanges brought dynamic conditions, they were wholly at sea \nand unable to adapt themselves to them. Their limited hide- \nbound education had not fitted them for such emergencies and \nnovel situations. They had been spoilt by a long spell of irres- \nponsibility. As a group they had practically ^solute power, \nsubject only in theory to a control by the British Parliament. \n\u201cPower corrupts,\u201d Lord Acton has told us, \"and absolute \npower corrupts absolutely.\u201d \n\nThey were, on the whole, reliable officers in their limited \nway, doing their day-to-day work fairly competently, without \u2022 \nbrilliance. But their very training was such that a wholly un- \nexpected situation found them wanting, although their self- \nconfidence, their methodical nature, and their esprit de corps \nhelped them to tide over immediate difficulties. The famous \nMesopotamia muddle exposed the British Indian Government \nfor its inefficiency and \u2018 woodenness but many a aiTnilar \nmuddle does not see the light of day. Even their reaction to \nCivil Disobedience was crude. To shoot and club may dispose of \n\n\n\nTH*. Kji^CORD Ol!' BRITISH RULE  \n\nthe opponents for a while, bnt it does not solve any problem, \nand it undermines that very feeling of superiority which it is \nmeant to protect. It was not surprising that they had recourse \nto violence to meet a growing and aggressive nationalist move- \nment. That was inevitable, for empires rest on that and they \nhad been taught no other way of meeting opposition. But the \nfact that excessive and unnecessary violence was used showed \nthat they had lost all grip of the situation, and no longer \n\nE ossessed the self-control and restraint which they seemed to \nave in normal times. Nerves frequently gave way and even \nin their public utterances there was a trace of hysteria. The \ncalm confidence of other days was gone. A crisis has a pitiless \nway of showing us all up and exposing our innermost weak- \nnesses. Civil Disobedience was such a crisis and test, and very \nfew on either side of the barricade \u2014 Congress or Government- \nsurvived fully that test. In a crisis the number of men and \nwomen of really first-class calibre is found to be small, says \nMr. Lloyd George, and \" the rest do not count in a crisis. The \nhummocks that look like eminences in fine weather are quickly \nsubmerged in a great flood when the highest peaks alone are \nvisible Aove the surfiice of the waters.\u201d \n\nThe I.C.S. were intellectually and emotionally not prepared \nfor what happened. The ori^al training of many of their \nmembers was classical, which gave them a certain culture and \na certain charm. It was an old-world attitude, suitable fi)r the \nVictorian Age, but utterly out of place under modern condi- \ntions. They lived in a narrow, circumscribed world of their \nown \u2014 ^Anglo-Indian\u2014 which was neither England nor India. \nThey had no appreciation of the forces at work in contem- \nporary society. In spite of their amusing assumption of being \nthe trustees and guardians of the Indiw masses, they knew \nlittle. about them and even less about the new agressive bour- \ngeoisie. They judged Indians from the sycophants and office- \nseekers who surrounded them and dismissed others as agitators \nand knaves. Their knowledge of post-war changes all over the \nworld, and especially in the economic sphere, was of the \nslightest, and they were too much in the ruts to adjust them- \nselves to changing conditions. They did not realise that the \norder they represented was out of date under modem condi- \ntions, and that they were approaching as a group more and \nmore the type which T. S. Emot describes in The Hotlow Men. \n\nAnd yet that order will continue so long as British im- \nperialism continues, and this is powerful enough still and has \n-hie and remiiTccfiil leaders. The British Government in India \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nis like a tooth that is decaying, hut is still strongly imhedded. \nIt is painful, but it cannot he easily pulled out. The pain is \nlikely to continue, and even grow worse, till the tooth is taken \nout or falls out itself. \n\nThe Public School type has had its day even in England, and \ndoes not occupy the same place as it did, although it is still \nprominent in public aifairs. In India it is still more out of \nplace, and it can never fit in or co-operate with an aggressive \nnationalism, much less with those working for social change. \n\nThere are of course many excellent men, both English and \nIndian, in the I.C.S. but, so long as the present system pre- \nvails their excellence will be devoted to objects which are not \nbeneficial to the Indian people. Some Indian members of the \nService are so overcome oy this Public School spirit that they \nbecome plus royaliste que le roi. I remember meeting a youth- \nful Indian member of the I.C.S. who had a very high opinion \nof himself which unfortunately I could not share. He pointed \nout to me the many virtues of his Service, and ended up by \nthe unanswerable argument in favour of the British Empire \u2014 \nwas it not better than the Roman Empire and the Empires of \nChengiz Khan and Timur? \n\nThe underlying assumption of the I.C.S. is that they dis- \ncharge their duties most efficiently, and therefore they can lay \nevery stress on thdr claims, and the claims are many and \nvaried. If India is poor, that is the fault of her social customs, \nher banias and money-lenders, and above all, her enormous \npopulation. The greatest bania of all, the British Government \nin India, is conveniently ignored. And what they propose to do \nabout this population I do not know, for in spite of a great \ndeal of help received from famines, epidemics, and a high \ndeath-rate generally, the population is still overwhelming. Birth-' \ncontrol is proposed and I, for one, am entirely in favour of the \nspread of the knowledge and methods of birth-control. But \nthe use of these methods itself requires a much higher standard \nof living for the masses, some measure of general education, \nand innumerable clinics, all over the country. Under present \nconditions birth-control methods are completely out of reach \nfor the masses. The middle classes can profit by them as, I \nbelieve, they are doing to a growing extent. \n\nBut this argument of over-population is deserving of fimher \nnotice. The problem to-day all over the world is not one of \nlack of food or lack of other essentials, but actually lack of \nmouths to feed, or, to put it differently, lack of capacity to buy \nfood, etc., for those who are in need. Even in India, considered \n\n\n\nTHE RECORD OF BRITISH RULE  \n\napart, there is no lack of food, and though the population has \ngone up, the food supply has increased and can increase more \nproportionately than the population. Then again the much \nadvertised increase of population in India has been (except in \nthe last decade) at a much lower rate than in most Western \ncountries. It is true that in future the difference will be greater, \nfor various forces are tending to lessen or even stop population \nincrease in Western countries. But limitin g factors are likely to \ncheck population increase in India also soon. \n\nWhenever India becomes free, and in a position to build her \nnew life as she wants to, she will necessarily require the best \nof her sons and daughters for this purpose. Good human \nmaterial is always rare, and in India it is rarer still because of \nour lack of opportunities under British rule. We shall want \nthe help of many foreign experts in many departments of \npublic activity, particularly in those which require special \ntechnical and scientific knowledge. Among those who have \nserved in the I.C.S. or other imperial services there tvill be \nmany, Indians or foreigners, who will be necessary and wel- \ncome to the new order. But of one thing I am quite sure, that \nno new order can be built up in India so long as the spirit of \nthe I.C.S. pervades our administration and our public services. \nThat spirit of authoritarianism is the ally of imperialism, and \nit cannot co-exist with freedom. It will either succeed in \ncrushing fireedom or will be swept away itself. Only with one \ntype of state it is likely to fit in, and that is the fascist type. \nTherefore it seems to me quite essential that the I;C.S. and \nsimilar services must disappear, completely, as such, before we \ncan start real work on a new order. Individual members of \nthese services, if they are willing and competent for the new \njob, will be welcome, but only on new conditions. It is quite \ninconceivable that they will get the absurdly high salaries and \nallowances that are paid to them to-day. The new India must \nbe served by earnest, efiicient workers who have an ardent faith \nin the cause they serve and are bent on achievement, and who \nwork for the joy and glory of it, and not for the attraction of \nhigh salaries. The money motive must be reduced to a mini- \nmum. The need for foreign helpers will be considerable, but \nI imagine that the least wanted will be civil administrators who \nhave no technical knowledge. There will be no lack of such \npeople in India. \n\nI have previously stated how the Indian Liberals, and other \ngroups like them, have accepted British ideology with reference \nto the government of India. This is especially noticeable in \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nregard to the Services, for their cry is for \u2018 indiaixisation ' and \nnot for radical change of the spirit and nature of the Services \nand the State structure. This is a vital matter on which it is \nimpossible to give in, for Indian freedom is bound up not only \nwith the withdrawal of British Forces and Services, but also \nwith the elimination of the authoritarian spirit that inspired \nthem, and a levelling down of their salaries and privileges. \nThere is a great deal of talk of safeguards in these days of \nconstitution-making. If these safeguards are to be in the in- \nterests of India, they should lay down, among other things, that \nthe I.C.S, and similar services should cease to exist, in their \npresent form and with the powers and privileges they possess, \nand should have nothing to do with the new constitution. \n\nEven more mysterious and formidable are the so-called \nDefence Services. We may not criticise them, we may not say \nanything about them, for what do we know about such matters ? \nWe must only pay and pay heavily without murmuring. A \nshort while ago, in September , Sir Philip Chetwode, the \nCommander-in-Chief in India, speaking in the Council of State \nat Simla, told Indian politicians, in pungent military language, \nto mind their own business and not interfere with his. Re- \nferring to the mover of an amendment to some proposition, he \nsaid : \u201c Do he and his friends think that a war-worn and war- \nwise race like the British, who won their Empire at the point \nof the sword and have kept it by the sword ever since, are to \nbe talked out of war wisdom which that experience brings to \na nation by armchair critics. . . \u201d He made many other intei^ \nesting remarks, and we were informed, lest we might think that \nhe had spoken in the heat of the moment, that he had care- \nfully written out his speech and spoke from a manuscript. \n\nIt is, of course, an impertinence for a layman to argue about \nmilitary matters with a Commander-in-Chief, and yet perhaps \neven an armchair critic might be permitted to make a few \nobservations. It is conceivable that the interests of those who \nhold the Empire by the sword and those over whose heads \nthis shining weapon ever hangs, might differ. It is possible that \nan Indian army might be made to serve Indian interests or to \nserve imperial interests, and the two might differ or even con- \nflict with each other. A politician and an armchair critic might \nalso wonder if the claims of eminent generals for freedom from \ninterference are valid after the experiences of the World War. \nThey had a free field then to a large extent, and from all \naccounts they made a terrible mess of almost everything in \nevery army\u2014 British, French, German, Austrian, Italian, \n\n\n\nTHE RECORD OF BRITISH RULE  \n\nRussian. Captain Liddell Hart, the distinguished British \nmilitary historian and strategist, writes in his History of the \nWorld War that at one stage in the War while British soldiers \nfought the enemy, British generals fought one another. The \nnational peril did not bring unity of thought or eflfbrt. The \nWar, he continues, \u201c has shattered our faith in idols, our hero- \nworshipping belief that great men are different clay from \ncommon men. Leaders are still necessary, perhaps more neces- \nsary, but our awakened realisation of their common humanity \nis a safeguard agsunst either expecting from them, or trusting \nin them, too much.*\u2019 \n\nThat arch-politician, Mr. D. Lloyd George, has painted in his \nWar Memoirs a terrible picture of the failmgs and blunders of \nthe generals and ad m i r al s in the World War, blunders which \ncost the lives of hundreds of thousands of men. England and \nher allies won the War, but it was a \u201c blood-stained stagger to \nvictory the reckless and .unintelligent handling of men and \nsituations by the high officers brought England almost to the \nrim of catastrophe, and she and her allies were saved largely \nby the incredible folly of their foes. So writes the great War \nPremier of Btitain, and he explains how he had to undertake \nsurgical operations in order to get ideas into Lord Jellicoe's \nhead, especially in regard to the proposal for having a convoy \nsystem. Of the. French Marshal Jofi&e, he seems to think that \nhis chief virtue was the possession of a resolute countenance \nwhich inspired a sense of strength. \u201cThat is what harassed \npeople instinctively seek in trouble. They make the mistake of \nthinking that the seat of intelligence is in the chin.\u201d \n\nBut Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s main indictment is against the \nBritish High Command itself, the Commander-in-Chief, Field- \nMarshal Haig, He demonstrates how Lord Haig\u2019s inordinate \nvanity and refusal to listen to politicians and others, made him \nconceal important facts from the British Cabinet itself, and led \nthe British Army in France to one of its greatest disasters. \nAnd even when failure stared him in the face, obstinate to the \nlast, he continued his ill-advised offensive for several months \nin that awful mud of Passchendaele and Cambrai, till seventeen \nthousand officers alone lay dead and dying, and four hundred \nthousand gallant British soldiers were \u2018casualties\u2019. It is well \nthat the \u2018 Unknown Soldier \u2019 is honoured to-day after his death; \nhis life was cheap, and he had little consideration when he was \nalive. \n\nPoliticians, like all other people, err frequently, but demo- \ncratic politicians have to be sensitive and responsive to men \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nand events, and they usually realise their mistakes and try to \nrepair them. The soldier is bred in a different atmosphere, \nwhere authority reigns and criticism is not tolerated. So he \nresents the advice of others and when he errs, he errs \nthoroughly and persists in error. For him the chin is more \nimportant than the mind or brain. In India we have the \nadvantage of having produced a mixed type, for the civil \nadministration itself has grown up and lives in a semi-military \natmosphere of authority and self-sufficiency, and possesses \ntherefore to a great extent the soldier\u2019s chin and other virtues. \n\nWe are told that the process of \u2018 indianisation \u2019 of the army \nis being pushed on, and in another thirty years or more an \nIndian general might even appear on the Indian stage. It is \npossible that in not much more than a hundred years the \nprocess of indianisation might be considerably advanced. One \nis apt to wonder how, in a moment of crisis, England built up \na mighty army of millions within a year or two. If it had \npossessed our mentors, perhaps it would have proceeded more \ncautiously and warily. It is possible of course that the War \nwould have been over long before this soundly-trained army \nwas ready for it. One thinks also of the Russian Soviet armies \ngrowing out of almost nothing and facing and triunyhing over \na host of enemies, and to-day constituting one of the most \nefficient fighting machines in the world. They did not appa- \nrently possess \u201c war-worn and war-wise \u201d generals to advise them. \n\nWe have now a military academy at Dehra Dun where \ngentlemen cadets are trained to become officers. They are very \nsmart on parade, we are told, and they will no doubt make \nadmirable officers. But I wonder sometimes what purpose this \ntraining serves, unless it is accompanied by technical training. \nInfantry and cavalry are about as much use to-day as the \nRoman phalanx, and the rifle is little better than a bow and \narrow in an age of air warfare, gas bombs, tanks, and powerful \nartillery. No doubt their trainers and mentors realise this. \n\nWhat has been the record of British rule in India? Who are \nwe to complain of its deficiencies when they were but the \nconsequences of our own failings? If we lose touch with the \nriver of change and enter a backwater, become self-centred and \nselfsatisfied, and, ostrich-like, ignore what happens elsewhere, \nwe do so at our peril. The British came to us on the crrat of \na wave of new impulse in the world, and represented mighty \nhistoric forces which they themselves hardly realised. Are we \nto complain of the cyclone that uproots us and hurls us about. \n\n\n\nTHE RECORD OK BRITISH RULE  \n\nor the cold wind that makes us shiver? T^et us have done with \nthe past and its bickering and face the future. To the British \nwe must be grateful for one splendid gift of which they were \nthe bearers, the gift of science and its rich offspring. It is diffi- \ncult, however, to forget or view with equanimity the efforts of \nthe British Government in India to encourage the disruptive, \nobscurantist, reactionary, sectarian, and opportunist elements in \nthe country. Perhaps that too is a needed test and challenge \nfor us, and before India is reborn it will have to go through \nagain and again the fire that cleanses and tempers and bums \nup the weak, the impure and the corrupt. \n IMPASSE \n\nThe possibility of my re-arrest and conviction always hung over \nme. It was, indeed, more than a possibility when the land was \nruled by Ordinances and the like and the Congress itself was \nan illegal organisation. Constimted as the British Government \nwas, and constituted as I was, my supression seemed inevitable. \nThis ever-present prospect influenced my work. I could not \nsettle down to anything, and I was in a hurry to get through \nas much as possible. \n\nAnd yet I had no desire to invite arrest, and to a large extent \nI avoided activities which might lead to it. Invitations came to \nme from many places in the province and outside to undertake \na tour. I refused them, for any such speaking tour could only \nbe a raging campaign which would be abruptly ended. There \nwas no half-way house for me then. When I visited any place \nfor some other object\u2014 to confer with Gandhiji and the Work- \ning Committee members \u2014 I addressed public meetings and \nspoke freely. In Jubbulpore we had a great meeting and a very \nimpressive procession; in E)elhi the gathering was one of the \nbiggest I had seen there. Indeed, the very success of these \nmeetings made it clear that the Government would not tolerate \ntheir frequent repetition. In Delhi, soon after the meeting, \nthere was a very .strong rumour of my impending arrest, but \n survived and returned to Allahabad, breaking journey at \nAligarh to address the Muslim University students there. \n\nI disliked the idea of taking part in non-political public \nactivities when the Government was trying to crush all efective \npolitical work. I found a strong tendency among Congressmen \nto seek shelter from such work by engaging in the most hum- \ndrum activities which, though desirable in themselves, had \nlittle to do with our struggle. The tendency was natural, but \nI felt that it should not be encouraged just then. \n\nIn the middle of October  we had meetings of our U.P. \nCongress workers in Allahabad to consider the situation and \ndecide, on future work. The Provincial Congress Committee \nwas an illegal body, and as our object was to meet and not just \nto defy the law, we did not formally convene this committee. \nBut we asked all its members who were outside gaol, as well as \nother selected workers, to come to an informal conference. \n\n \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nThere was no secrecy about our meetings, though they were \nprivate, and we did not know till the lait moment whether the \nGovernment would interfere or not. At these meetings we paid \na great deal of attention to the world situation \u2014 the great \nslump, naziism, communism, etc. We wanted our comrades to \nsee the Indian struggle in relation to what was happening else- \n^where. The conference ultimately passed a socialistic resolution \ndefining our objective and expressed itself against the with- \ndrawal of civil disobedience. Everybody knew well enough \nthat there was no chance of widespread civil disobedience, and \neven individual civil disobedience was likely to peter out soon \nor continue on a very restricted scale. But a withdrawal made \nlittle difference to us as the Government oflEensivc and Ordinance \nlaws continued. So, more as a gesture tlian anything else, we \ndecided to continue the formal civil disobedience but in effect \nour instructions to our workers were not to go out of their way \nto invite arrest. They were to carry on their normal work and \nif arrest came in the course of that, to accept it with good \ngrace. In particular, they were asked to renew contacts with \ndie rural areas and find out the condition of the peasantry, \nboth as a result of the remissions of rent and Government \nrepression. There was no question of a no-rent campaign then. \nThis had been formally withdrawn after the Poona Conference, \nand it was obvious that it could not be revived under the cir- \ncumstances. \n\nThis programme was a mild and inoffensive one with nothing \npatently illegal in it, and yet we knew that it would lead to \narrests. As soon as our workers went to the villages they were \narrested and charged, quite wrongly, with preaching a no-rent \ncampaign (which had been made an offence under the Ordi- \nance laws) and convicted. It was my intention to go to these \nrural areas after the arrest of many of my comrades, but other \nactivities claimed my attention and I postponed my visit till it \nwas too late. \n\nTwice, during those months, tiie members of the Working \nCommittee met together to consider the all-India situation. \nThe Committee itself was not ftmetioning, not so much because \nit was an illegal bo(^ but because, at Gandhiji\u2019s instance after \nPoona, aU Congress Committees and offices had been suspended. \nI happened to occupy a peculiar position as, on coming out of \ngaol, I refused to join this self-denying ordinance and insisted on \ncalling myself the General Secretary of the Congress. But I \nfunctioned in the air. There was no proper office, no staff, no \nacting-president, and Gandhiji, though available for consul- \n\n\n\nIMPASSfi \n\n\n \n\nration, was busy with one of his tremendous all-India tours, \nthis time for Harijan work. We managed to catch him during \nhis tour at Jubbulpore and Delhi and held our consultations \nwith Working Committee members. They served to bring out \nclearly the differences between various members. There was \nan impasse, and no way out of it agreeable to everybody. Gan- \ndhiji was the deciding factor between those who wanted to with- \ndraw civil disobedience and those who were against this. As he \nwas then in favour of the latter course, matters continued as \nbefore. \n\nThe question of contesting elections on behalf of the Con- \ngress to the legislatures was sometimes discussed by Congress- \nmen, though the Working Committee members were not much \ninterested in this at the time. It did not arise; it was obviously \npremature. The 'Reforms\u2019 were not likely to materialise for \nanother two or three years at least, and there was then no \nmention of fresh elections for the Assembly. Personally I had \nno theoretical objection to contesting elections, and I felt sure \nin my mind that when the time came the Congress would have \nto go in for them. But to raise this question then was only to \ndistract attention. I hoped that the continuance of our struggle \nwould clear up the issues that faced us and prevent the com- \npromising elements from dominating the situation. \n\nMeanwhile I continued sending articles and statements to the \nPress. To some extent I had to tone down my writings, for they \nwere written with a view to publication, and there was the \ncensor and various laws whose octopus-like tentacles reached \nfar. Even if I was prepared to take risks, the printers, pub- \nlishers and editors were not. On the whole the newspapers were \ngood to me and stretched many a point in my favour. But not \nalways. Sometimes statements and passages were suppressed, \nand once a whole long article, over which I had taken some \npains, never saw the light of day. When I was in Calcutta in \n'Japuary  the editor of one of the leading dailies came to \nsee'fti^He told me that he had sent one of my statements to \nthe Edtlbt^Chief of all Calcutta newspapers for his opinion, \nand as the\u2019S^itor-in-Chief had disapproved of it, it had not \nbeen publishedSThe \u2018 Editor-in-Chief \u2019 was the Government \nPress Censor for Catemta. \n\nIn some of my PressNkt^iews and statements I ventured to \ncriticise forcibly some grolljk^^nd individuals. This -was re- \nsented, partly because of the loKi^^ich Gandhiji had helped, \nto spread, that Congress could be a?ll\u00bbsjjed without any danger \nof its hitting back. Gandhiji himself set an example of \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAT- NEHRU \n\nthis and in varying degrees leading Congressmen had followed \nhis lead, though sometimes this was not so. Usually we stuck \nto vague and pious phrases, and this gave an opportunity to our \ncritics to get away with their faulty reasoning and opportunist \ntactics. The real issues were avoided on both sides, and an \nhonest discussion, with occasional parry and thrust, seldom took \nplace, as it does in Western countries, except where facism \nprevails, \n\nA friend, whose opinion I valued, wrote to me that she had \nbeen a little surprised at the vigour of some of my statements to \nthe Press \u2014 was almost becoming \u2018 cattish '. Was this the out- \ncome of \u2018 frustration ' of my hopes ? I wondered. Partly it was \ntrue, for nationally all of us suffer from frustration. Indi- \nvidually also it must have been true to some extent. Yet I was \nnot very conscious of the feeling because personally I had no \nsensation of suppression or failure. Ever since Gandhiji came \nwithin my ken politically, I learnt one thing at least from him : \nnot to suppress my ideas within me for fear of the consequences. \nThat habit\u2014 -followed in the political sphere (in other spheres it \nwould be more difficult and dangerous to follow)\u2014 has often got \nme into trouble, but it has also brought much satisfaction with \nit. I think that it is because of this that many of us have \nescaped real bitterness of heart and the worst kinds of frus- \ntration. The knowledge also that large numbers of people think \nof one with affection is very soothing and is a powerful antidote \nagainst defeatism and frustration. The most terrible of all \nfeelings, I imagine, is to be alone, forgotten by others. \n\nBut, even so, how can one escape m this strange, unhappy \nworld z, feeling of frustration? How often everything seems to \ngo wrong, and though we carry on, doubts assail us when we \nsee the quality of human material around us. I am afraid I feel \nanger and resentment often enough at various happenings and \ndevelopments, and even at persons and groups. And latterly \nI have begun to resent more and more the drawing-room atti- \ntude to life, which ignores vital issues and considers it improper \nto refer to them, because they happen to touch one\u2019s pocket or \npet prejudices. With all this resentment and frustration and \n\u2018 cattishness I hope I have not yet lost the gift of laughing at \nmy own and other people\u2019s follies. \n\nI sometimes wonder at the feitb of people in a beneficent \nProvidence : how it survives shock after shock, and how disaster \nJrtseBf and disproof of benefictoce are considered but tests of \nthe soundness of that Those delightful lines of Gerard \nHopkins find an ecjio'ln many a heart: \n\n\n\nIMFASS\u00a3 \n\n\n \n\n\n\u201c Thou art indeed just, Lord, if I contend \nWith thee; but, sir, so what I plead is just. \n\ndo sinners\u2019 ways prosper? and why must \nDisappointment all I endeavour end? \n\nWert thou my enemy, O thou my friend. \n\nHow wouldst thou worse, I wonder, than thou dost \nDefeat, thwart me? Oh, the sots and thralls of lust \nDo in spare hours more thrive than I that spend, \n\nSir, life upon thy cause. . . \n\nFaith in progress, in a cause, in ideals, in human goodness \nand human destiny \u2014 are they not nearly allied to faith in a \nProvidence? If we seek to Justify them by reason and logic \nimmediately we get into difficulties. But something within us \nclutches to that hope and faith, for, deprived of them, life \nwould be a wilderness without an oasis. \n\nThe efFert of my propaganda itpspf nf \n\nmy colleagues of the Working Committee. They would have \nput up with me without complaint, as they had done for several \nyears during which I had been carrying on this propaganda, \nbut I was now frightening to some extent the vested interests \nin the country, and my activities could no longer be called \ninnocuous. I knew that some of my colleagues w'ere no \nSocialists, but I had always thought that, as a member of the \nCongress Executive I had perfect freedom to carry on socialist \npropaganda without committing the Congress to it. The realisa- \ntion that some members of the Working Committee did not \nthink that I had that freedom came as a surprise. I was putting \nthem in a false position and they resented it. But what was I to \ndo? I was not going to give up what I considered the most \nimportant part of my work. I would much rather resign from \nthe Working Committee if there was a conflict between the \ntwo. But how could I resign when the Committee was illegal \nand was not even functioning properly? \n\nThis difficulty faced me again later\u2014 I think it was towards \nthe end of December \u2014 when Gandhiji wrote to me from \nMadras, He sent me a cutting from the Madras Mail containing \nan interview he had given. The interviewer had asked him \nabout me and he had replied almost apologising for my acti- \nvities and expressing his faith in my rectitude: I would not \ncommit the Congress to these novel ways. I did not particu- \nlarly fancy this reference to me, but what upset me much more \nwas Gandhiji\u2019s defence, further on in the interview, of the big \nzamindari system,' He seemed to think that this was a very \ndesirable part of rural and national economy, This was a great \n\n\n\n JAWAIIARLAL NEHRU \n\nsurprise to me for the big zamindaris and taluqas have very \nfew defenders to-day. All over the world they have been broken \nup, and even in India most people recognise that they cannot \nlast long. Even taluqadars and zamindars would welcome an \nend of the system provided, of course, they got sufficient com- \npensation therefor.* The system is indeed sinking of its own \nweight. And yet Gandhiji was in favour of it and talked of \ntrusteeship and the like. How very different was his outlook \nfrom mine, I thought again, and I wondered how far I could \nco-operate with him in future. Must I continue to remain in \nthe Working Committee? There was no way out just then, and \na few weeks later the question became irrelevant because of my \nreturn to prison. \n\nMy domestic affairs took up a lot of my time. My mother\u2019s \nhealth continued to improve, but very slowly. She was still bed- \nridden, but she seemed to be out of danger. I turned to my \nfinancial affairs which had been long neglected and were in a \nmuddle. We had been spending much more than we could \nafford, and there seemed to be no obvious way of reducing our \nexpenditure. I was not particularly anxious about making \nboth ends meet. Almost I looked forward to the time when I \nwould have no money left. Money and possessions are useful \nenough in the modern world, but often they become a burden \nfor one who wants to go on a long journey. It is very difficult \nfor moneyed people to take part in undertakings which involve \nrisk; they are always afraid of losing their goods and chattels. \nWhat is the good of money or property if the Government can \ntake possession of it when it chooses, or even confiscate it? So \nI almost wished to get rid of what little I had. Our needs were \nfew and I felt confident of my ability to earn enough. My \nchief concern was that my mother, in the evening of her life, \nshould not suffer discomforts or any marked lowering of the \nstandard of living. I was also anxious that my daughter\u2019s \neducation should not be interfered with, and this, according to \nmy thinking, involved a stay in Europe. Apart from this, \n\n* Mr. P. N, Tagore, Chairman of the Reception Committee of the \nAll-Bengal Landholders\u2019 Conference, said in his address on Decem- \nber ,  : \u201c Personally I will not regret the day when lands of \nthe zamindars are nationalised, as ha.s been done in Ireland, upon \npayment of adequate compensation to the landlord.\u201d It should be \nremembered that the Bengal landholders, being under the Per- \nmanent Settlement, are better off than the landholders in the \nnon-permanently settled areas. Mr. P. N, Tagore\u2019s ideas about \nnationalisation appear to be vague. \n\n\n\nIMPASSE \n\n\n \n\nneither my wife nor I had any special need for money. Or so \nwe thought, being unused to the real lack of it. I am quite \nsure that when the time comes when we lack money, we shall \nnot be happy about it. One extravagance which I have kept \nup will be hard to give up, and this is the buying of books. \n\nTo improve the immediate financial situation we decided to \nsell off my wife\u2019s jewellery, the silver and other similar articles \nthat we possessed, as well as many cart-loads of odds and ends. \nKamala did not like the idea of parting with her jewellery, \nalthough she had not worn any of it for a dozen years and it \nhad lain in the bank. But she had looked forward to handing \nit on to our daughter. \n\nIt was January . Continued arrests of our workers in the \nvillages of the Allahabad district, although innocently em- \nployed, seemed to demand that we should follow in their steps \nand visit those villages. Rafi Ahmad Kidwai, our very effective \nsecretary of the U.P. Provincial Congress Committee, was also \nunder arrest. January th \u2014 ^Independence Day \u2014 ^was coming \nand it could not be ignored. Despite Ordinances and prohi- \nbitions it had been regularly observed in various parts of the \ncountry every year since . But who was to give the lead? \nAnd what was the lead to be? There was no one besides me \nwho was functioning, even in theorjr, as an official of the All- \nIndia Congress. I consulted some friends and almost all agreed \nthat something should be done, but there was no agreement as \nto what this something should be, I found a general tendency \nto avoid any action which might lead to arrests on a large scale. \nEventually I issued a brief appeal for the appropriate celebra- \ntion of Independence Day, the manner of doing so to be \ndecided by each local area for itself. In Allahabad we planned \na fairly widespread celebration all over the district. \n\nWe felt that the organisers of this Independence Day celebra- \ntion would be arrested on that day. Before I went back to \nprison again I wanted to pay a visit to Bengal. This was partly \nto meet old colleagues there, but really it was to be a gesture \nin the nature of tribute to the people of Bengal for their \nextraordinary sufferings during the past few years. I knew \nvery well that I could do nothing to help them. Sympathy and \nfellow-feeling did not go far, and yet they were very welcome, \nand Bengal was especially suffering from a sense of isolation, \nof being deserted by the rest of India in her hour of need. \nThat feeling was not justified, but nevertheless it was there. \n\nI had also to go to Calcutta with Kamala to consult our \ndoctors there about her tre-ntment. She had been far from well. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nbut we had both tried to overlook this to some extent and post- \npone recourse to a treatment which might involve a long stay \nin Calcutta or elsewhere. We wanted to be together as much \nas possible during my brief period outside prison. After I \nwent back to gaol, I thought, she would have plenty of time for \ndoctors and treatment. Now that arrest seemed near, I decided \nto have these consultations at least in my presence in Calcutta; \nthe rest could be attended to later. \n\nSo we decided to go to Calcutta, Kamala and I, on January \nth. We wanted to return in good time for our Independence \nDay meetings.  EARTHQUAKE \n\nIt was the afternoon of the th January, . I was stand- \ning in the veranda of our house in Allahabad addressing a \ngroup of peasants. The annual Magh Mela had begun, and we \nhad crowds of visitors all day. Suddenly I became unsteady on \nmy feet and could hardly keep my balance. I clung on to a \ncolumn near by. Doors started banging and a rumbling noise \ncame from the adjoining Swaraj Bhawan, where many of the \ntiles were sliding down the roof. Being unaccustomed to earth- \nquakes, I did not know at first what was happening, but I soon \nrealised it. I was rather amused and interested at this novel \nexperience and I continued my talk to the peasants and began \ntelling them about the earthquake. My old aunt shouted out \nto me from some distance to run out of the building. The idea \nstruck me as absurd. I did not take the earthquake seriously, \nand in any event I was not going to leave my bed-ridden motlier \nupstairs, and my wife, who was probably packing, also upstairs \nand seek safety for myself For what seemed quite an appre- \nciable time the shocks continued and then passed off. They \nprovided a few minutes\u2019 conversation and soon were almost \nforgotten. We did not know then, nor could we guess, what \nthose two or three minutes had meant to millions in Behar and \nelsewhere. \n\nThat evening Kamala and I left for Calcutta and, all un- \nknowing, we were carried by our train that night through the \nsouthern earthquake area. The next day there was little news \nin Calcutta about the disaster. The day after bits of news be^an \nto come in. On the third day we began to have a faint notion \nof the calamity. \n\nWe busied ourselves with our Calcutta programme. There \nwere plenty of doctors to be seen repeatedly, and it was finally \ndecided that Kamala was to come back to Calcutta for treat- \nment a month or two later. Then there were fi:iends and Con- \ngress colleagues whom we had not met for a long time. I had \na terrible sense of oppression all the time. People seemed to \nbe afraid of doing almost anything lest trouble should come \nto them; they had gone through much. Newspapers were more \ncautious than anywhere else in India. There was also, as else- \nwhere in India, doubt and confusion about future work. It was \n\nII  \n\n\n\nJAWAHAULAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nindeed this doubt, and not so much fear, that prevented any \neffective political activity. There were fascist tendencies much \nin evidence, and socialist and communist tendencies \u2014 all rather \nvague and running into each other. It was difficult to draw \nhard and fast lines between these groups. I had neither the \ntime nor the opportunity to find out much about the tefforist \nmovement, which was receiving a great deal of attention and \nadvertisement from official sources. As far as I could gather, it \nhad no political significance whatever, and the old members \nof the terrorist groups had no faith left in it. Thw were \nbeginning to think on different lines. Resentment at Govern- \nment action in Bengal had, however, led individuals here and \nthere to break loose and indulge in a kind of feud. Indeed, on \neither side this idea of a feud seemed to be dominant. On the \nside of the individual terrorists this was obvious enough. On \nthe side of the State also the attitude was far more that of \ncarrying on a feud, with occasional reprisals, than of calmly \ngrappling with an anti-social occurrence and suppressing it. Any \ngovernment faced by terroristic acts is bound to combat them \nand try to suppress them. But serene control is more becoming \nin a government than excessive action applied indiscriminately \nto guilty and innocent alike, and chiefly to the latter because \nthey are sure to be more numerous. Perhaps it is not easy to \nremain calm and collected in the face of such a threat. Ter- \nroristic acts were becoming rare, but the possibility of them \nwas ever present, and this was enough to upset the composure \nof those who had to deal with them. Such acts, it is patent \nenough, are not a disease but the symptoms of a disease. It is \nfutile to treat the symptoms and not the disease itself, \n\nI believe that a number of young men and women, who are \nsupposed to have dealings with terrorists, are really attracted by \nthe glamour of secret work. Secrecy and risk have always an \nappeal for the adventurous type of youth; the desire to be in the \nknow, to find out what all this shouting is about, and who are \nthese men behind the scenes. It is the call of the detective \nstory. These people have no intention of doing anything, \ncertainly not a terroristic act, but their mere association with \nsuspects in the eyes of the police is enough to make them sus- \npect also. Soon they are likely to find themselves in the ranks \nof the detenus, or in an internment camp, if a worse fate does \nnot await them. \n\nLaw and order, we are told, are among the proud achieve- \nments of British rule in India. My own instincts are entirely \nin favour of them. I Uke discipline in life, and dislike anarchy \n\n\n\nEARTHQUAKE \n\n\n \n\nand disorder and inefficiency. But bitter experience has made \nme doubt the value of the law and order that states and \ngovernments impose on a people. Sometimes the price one pays \nfor them is excessive, and the law is but the will of the domi- \nnant faction and the order is the reflex of an all-pervading fear. \nSometimes, indeed, the so-called law and order might be more \njustly called the absence of law and order. Any achievement \nthat is based on widespread fear can hardly be a desirable one, \nand an \u2018 order \u2019 that has for its basis the coercive apparatus of \nthe State, and cannot exist without it, is more like a military \noccupation than civil rule. I find in the Rajataranglni, the \nthousand-year-old rashmiri historic epic of the poet Xalhana, \nthat the phrase which is repeatedly used in the sense of law and \norder, something that it was the duty of the ruler and the State \nto preserve, is dhanna and abhaya \u2014 ^righteousness and absence \nof fear.- Law was something more than mere law, and order was \nthe fearlessness of the people. Hovy much more desirable is this \nidea of inculcating fearlessness than of enforcing ' order \u2019 on a \nfrightened populace! \n\nWe spent three and a half days in Calcutta and during this \nperiod I addressed three public meetings. As I had done before \nin Calcutta, I condemned and argued against terroristic acts, \nand then I passed on to the methods that the Government had \nadopted in Bengal. I spoke from a full heart, for I had been \ngreatly moved by accounts of occurrences in the province. \nWhat pained me most was the manner in which human dignity \nhad been outraged by indiscriminate suppression of whole \npopulations. The political problem, urgent as it was, took second \nplace before this human problem. These three\u2019 speeches of \nmine formed the three counts against me in my subsequent \ntrial in Calcutta and my present sentence is due to them. \n\nFrom Calcutta we went to Santiniketan to pay a visit to the \npoet Rabindra Nath Tagore. It was always a joy to meet him \nand, having come so near, we did not wish to miss him. I had \nbeen to Santiniketan twice before. It was Kamala\u2019s first visit, \nand she had come especially to see the place as we were think- \ning of sending our daughter there. Indira was going to appear \nfor her matriculation soon afterwards, and the problem of her \nfuture education was troubling us. I was wholly against her \njoining the regular official or semi-official universities, for I dis- \nliked them. The whole atmosphere that envelops them is \nofficial, oppressive and authoritarian. They have no doubt pro- \nduced fine men and women in the past, and they will continue \nto do so. But tiiese few exceptions cannot save the universities \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nfrom the charge of suppressing and deadening the fine instincts \nof youth. Santinikctan offered an escape from this dead hand, \nand so we fixed upon it, although in some ways it was not so \nup to date and well-equipped as the other universities. \n\nOn our way back we stopped at Patna to discuss with Rajen- \ndra Babu the problem of earthquake relief. He had just been \ndischarged from prison and, inevitably, he had taken the lead \nin unofficial relief work. Our arrival was unexpected, for none \nof our telegrams had been delivered. The house where we \nintended staying with Kamala\u2019s brother was in ruins; it was \na big double-storied brick structure. So, like many others, we \nlived in the open. \n\nThe next day I paid a visit to Muzafl\u2019arpur. It was exactly seven \ndays after the earthquake and little had so far been done to \nremove the debris, except from some of the main streets. As \nthese streets were cleaned corpses were being discovered, some in \ncuriously expressive attitudes, as if trying to ward off a falling \nwall or roof. The ruins were an impressive and terrifying sight. \nThe survivors were thoroughly shaken-up and cowed by their \nnerve-racking experiences. \n\nReturning to Allahabad, collections of funds and materials \nwere immediately organised, and all of us, of the Congress or \nout of it, took this up in earnest. Some of my colleagues were \nof opinion that because of the earthquake the Independence \nDay celebrations .should be called off. But other colleagues and \nI saw no reason why even an earthquake should interfere with \nour programme. So on the th January we had a large num- \nber of meetings in the villages of Allahabad district and a \nmeeting in the city, and we met with greater success than we \nhad anticipated. Most people expected police interference and \narrests, and on a minor scale there was some interference. But, \nmuch to our surprise, we survived the meeting. In some of our \nvillages and in some other cities arrests were made. \n\nSoon after returning from Behar I issued a statement about \nthe earthquake,' ending up with an appeal for funds. In this \nstatement I criticised the inactivity of the Behar Government \nduring the first few days after the earthquake. It was not my \nintention to criticise the officials in the earthquake areas, for \nthey had had to deal with a very difficult situation which would \nhave tried the stoutest nerves, and I was sorry that some of my \nwords were capable of this interpretation. But I did feel \nstrongly tliat the headquarters of the Behar Government had \nnot shown great competence to begin with, especially in the \nmatter of removal of debris, which might have saved lives. \n\n\n\nEARTHQUAKE \n\n\n \n\nThousands of people were killed in Monghyr city alone, and \nthree weeks later I saw a vast quantity of dehris still lying \nuntouched, although a few miles away at Jamalpur there was \na large colony of many thousands of railway workers, who \ncould have been utilised for this purpose within a few hours of \nthe catastrophe. Living people were unearthed even twelve days \nafter the earthquake. The Government had taken immediate \nsteps to protect property, but they had not been so expeditious \nin trying to rescue people who lay buried. The municipalities \nin these areas were not functioning. \n\nI think my criticism was justified, and I found later that the \ngreat majority of people in the earthquake areas agreed with \nit. But whether it was justified or not, it was honestly made, \nnot with the intention of blaming the Government, but of \nspeeding them up. No one acctaed them of any deliberate sins \nof commission or omission in this respect. It was a novel and \noverpowering situation and errors were excusable. The Behar \nGovernment, so far as I know (fi)r I have been in gaol), later on \nworked with energy and competence to repair the ravages of \nthe earthquake. \n\nBut my criticism was resented, and soon afterwards a few \npeople in Behar came out with a general testimonial in favour \nof the Government as a kind of counterblast. The earthquake \nand its demands Became almost a secondary matter. More im- \nportant was the fact that the Government had been criticised, \nand it must he defended by its loyal subjects. This was an \ninteresting instance of a widespread phenomenon in India \u2014 \nthe dislike of criticism of the Government, which is a common- \nplace in Western countries. It is the military mentality, which \ncannot tolerate criticism. Like the King, the British Govern- \nment in India and all of its superior officials can do no wrong. \nTo hint at any such thing is Itse majeste. \n\nThe curious part of it is that a charge of inefficiency and \nincompetence is resented far more than an accusation of harsh \ngovernment or tyranny. The latter might indeed land the \nperson making it in prison, but the Government is used to it \nand does not really mind it. After all, in a way, it mi^t almost \nbe considered a compliment to an imperial race. But to he \ncalled inefficient and wanting in nerve hurts, for this strikes at \nthe root of their selfiesteem; it disturbs the messianic delusions \nof the English officials in India. They are like the Anglican \nbishop who was prepared to put up meekly with a charge of \nunchristian behaviour, but who resented and hit out when \nsome one called him foolish and incompetent. \n\n\n\nJAWAIIARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nThere is a general belief among Englishmen, frequently \nasserted as if it was an incontrovertible maxim, that a change \nof government in India, involving a reduction or elimination \nof British influence, would result in a much worse and more \ninefficient government. Holding this belief, but generous in \ntheir enthusiasm, radicals and Englishmen of advanced views \nplead that good government is no substitute for self-government, \nand if Indians want to go to the dogs, they should be permitted \nto do so. I do not know what will happen to India when British \ninfluence is eliminated. Much depends on how the British \nwithdraw and who is in control in India then, and on a host \nof other considerations, national and international. I can quite \nconceive a state of affairs, established with the help of the \nBritish, which will be more inefficient and generally worse than \nanything that we can have to-day, for it will have all the vices \nof the present system without its virtues. I can conceive more \nreadily still a different state of affairs which, from the point of \nview of the Indian people, will be far more efficient and bene- \nficial than anything we have to-day. It is possible that the \ncoercive apparatus of the State may not be so efficient, and the \nadministrative apparatus not quite so shiny, but there will be \ngreater efficiency in production, consumption, and the activities \nwhich go to raise the physical, the spiritual;' and cultural stan- \ndards of the masses. I believe that self-government is good\u2019 for \nany country. But I am not prepared to accept even self- \ngovernment at the cost of real good government. Self-govern- \nment if it is to justify itself must stand ultimately for better \ngovernment for the masses. It is because I believe that the \nBritish Government in India, wliatever its claims in the past \nmay have been, is incapable of providing good government and \nrising standards for the masses to-day, that I feel that it has \noutlived its utility, such as it was, m India. The only real \njustification for Indian freedom is the promise of better govern- \nment, of a higher standard for the masses, of industrial and \ncultural growth, and of the removal of the atmosphere of fear \nand suppression that foreign imperialist rule invariably brings \nin its train. The British Government and the I.C.S., though \nthey may be strong enough to impose their will on India, are \nnot efficient or competent enough to solve India\u2019s problems of \nto-day, and even less of the future, because their foundations \nand assumptions are all wrong and they have lost touch with \nreality, A government or ruling class which is not competent \nenough, or which represents a passing order, cannot long con- \ntinue even to impose their will. \n\n\n\n\nTHE AUTHOR \n\n\n\nEARTHQUAKE  \n\nThe Allahabad Earthquake Relief Committee deputed me to \nvisit the areas affected by the earthquake and to report on the \nmethods of relief-work adopted there. I went immediatelyi \naloiie, and for ten days I wandered about those torn and ruined \nterritories. It was a very strenuous tour, and I had little sleep \nduring those days. From five in the morning till almost mid- \nnight we were up and about, motoring over the cracked and \ncrumpled-up roads, or going by little boats where the bridges had \ncollapsed and the roads were under water owing to a change in \nlevel. The towns were impressive enough with their extensive \nruins, and their roads torn up and twisted sometimes as by a \ngiant hand, or raised high above the plinth of the houses on \neither side. Out of huge cracks in these roads water and sand \nhad gushed out and swept away men and cattle. More even \nthan these towns, the plains of North Behar\u2014 the garden of \nBehar, they used to be called \u2014 had desolation and destruction \nstamped upon them. Mile upon mile of sand, and large sheets \nof water, and huge cracks and vast numbers of little craters \nout of which this sand and water had come. Some British \nofficers who flew over this area said that it bore some resem- \nblance to the battlefields of northern France in war-time and \nsoon after. \n\nIt must have been -a terrible experience. The earthquake \nbegan with strong side-to-side movements which knocked down \nany person who was standing. Then there were up-and-down \nmovements, and a vast rumbhng and reverberating noise as of \nan artillery bombardment or a hundred aeroplanes in the sky, \nand waters gushed out in innumerable places out of huge \nfissures and craters and rose to about ten or twelve feet. All \nthis probably lasted for three minutes or a litde more and then \nit died dovm, but those three minutes were terrible enough. \nIt is not surprising that many persons who saw this happen \nimagined that this was the end of the world. In the cities mere \nwas a noise of falling houses, and a rushing of waters, and an \natmosphere full of dust which made it impossible to see even \na few yards. In the rural areas there was not much dust and \none could see a little farther, but there were no calm-eyed \nspectators about. Those who survived lay flat on the ground, or \nrolled about, in an agony of terror. \n\nA little boy of twelve was dug out (I think in Muzaffarpur) \nalive ten days after the earthquake. He was greatly surprised. \nHe had imagined, when he was knocked down and imprisoned \nby falling material, that the world had ended and he was the \nsolitary survivor. \n\n\n\n jawaharlal nehru \n\nthat drew a vast sum of money from all over India. Weak in \nhealth, he threw himself into the work of relief. He over- \nworked himself, for he became the centre of all activity and \neverybody turned to him for advice. \n\nDuring my tour in the earthquake areas, or just before going \nthere, I read with a great shock Gandhiji\u2019s statement to the \neffect that the earthquake had been a punishment for the sin \nof untouchability. This was a staggering remark and I wel- \ncomed and wholly agreed with Rabindra Nath Tagore\u2019s answer \nto it. Anything more opposed to the scientific outlook it would \nbe difficult to imagine. Perhaps even science will not be abso- \nlutely dogmatic to-day about the effect of emotional states and \npsychic occurrences on matter. A mental shock may result in \nindigestion or something worse to the person concerned. But \nto suggest that a human custom or failing had its reactions on \nthe movements of the earth\u2019s crust is an astounding thing. The \nidea of sin and divine wrath and man\u2019s relative importance in \nthe affairs of the universe \u2014 they take us back a few hun- \ndred years, when the Inquisition flourished in Europe and \nburned Giordano Bruno for his scientific heresy and sent many \na witch to the stake I Even in the eighteenth century in \nAmerica leading Boston divines attributed earthquakes in Mas- \nsachusetts to the impiety of lightning rods. \n\nAnd if the earthquake was a divine punishment for sin, how \nare we to discover for which sin we are being punished? \u2014 for, \nalas I we have many sins to atone fijr. Each person can have his \npet explanation; we may have been punished for submitting to \nputting up with an unjust social system, \nthe Maharaja of Durbhanga, the owner of enormous estates, \nwas, financially, one of the major sufferers from the earth- \nquake. We might as well say that this was a judgment on the \nzammdari system. That would be nearer the mark than to \nsuggest that the more or leas innocent people of Behar were \nbeing made to suffer vicariously for the sins of untouchability \nof the people of South India. Wliy did not the earthquake visit \nthe land of untouchability itself? Or the British Government \nmight call the calamity a divine punishment for civil dis- \nobedi^ce, for, as a matter of fact, North Behar, which suffered \nmost from the earthquake, took a leading part in the freedom \nmovement. \n\nWe can go on speculating indefinitely in this manner. And \nthen\u2019 of course, the question arises why we should interfere \nwith the workings of Providence or try to lessen the effect of its \ndivine decrees by our humaue efforts. And we begin to wonder \n\n\n\nEARTHQUAKE \n\n\n \n\nwhy Providence has played this cruel joke on us : to make us \nfull of imperfections, to surround us with snares and pitfalls, to \ncreate a miserable and cruel world, to make the tiger and the \nlamb, and then to punish us. \n\n\u2018\u2018 When the stars threw down their spearo \nAnd v/ater\u2019d heaven with their tears, \n\nDare he laugh his work to see? \n\nDare he who made the lamb make thee? \u201d \n\nOn my last night in Patna I sat up till very late with many \nfriends and comrades who had gathered there from various \nprovinces to olFer their services for relief work. The U.P. was \nwell represented and some of our chosen men were there. We \ndiscussed a problem that was troubling us : how far must we \nallow ourselves to be involved in earthquake relief? That \nmeant, to that extent at least, a withdrawal from political work. \nRelief work was very exacting and we could not take it up \ncasually. Absorption in it might well involve a long period of \nabsence from the active political sphere, and that was bound to \nhave a bad effect politically on our province. Although there \nwere many in the Congress fold, the people who make a differ- \nence were always limited in number and could ill be spared. \nAnd yet the call of the earthquake could not be ignored. For \nmy part I had no intention of devoting myself exclusively to \nrelief work. I felt that there would be no lack of people for \nthat; there were few for more risky activities. \n\nSo we talked till far into the night. We discussed the last \nIndependence Day and how some of our colleagues had been \narrested then, while we had escaped. I told them laughingly \nthat I had discovered the secret of militant politics with perfect \nsafety. \n\nI got back home in Allahabad on February iith, dead \ntired after my tour. Ten strenuous days had made me look \nghastly and my people were surprised at my appearance. I tried \nto begin writing my report of the tour for the Allahabad Relief \nCommittee, but sleep overcame me. I spent at least twelve hours \nout of the next twenty-four in sleep. \n\nNext day, in the late afternoon, Kamala and I had finished \ntea and Purushottam Das Tandon had just then joined us. We \nwere standing in the veranda when a car drove up and a police \nofficer alighted. I knew immediately that my time had come. I \nwent up to him and said : \u201c Bahut dinon se apka intazar tha \n\u201c I have been waiting for you &r a long time,\u201d He was a little \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\napologetic and said that he was not to hlame. The warrant was \nfrom Calcutta. \n\nFive months and thirteen days I had been out, and now  \nwent back again to seclusion and loneliness. But the real burden \nwas not mine; it had to be shouldered, as always, by the women \nfolk \u2014 by my ailing mother, my wife, my sister. \n\n\n\nALIPORE GAOL \n\n\nAlready how am I so far \nOut of that minute? Must I go \nStill like the thistle-ball, no bar, \n\nOnward wherever light winds blow. \n\nFixed by no friendly star? \n\nRobert Browning \n\nThat very night I was taken to Calcutta. From Howrah station \na huge black Maria carried me to Lai Bazaar Police Station. \nI had read much of this famous headquarters of the Calcutta \npolice and I looked round with interest. There were large \nnumbers of European sergeants and inspectors to be seen, fer \nmore than would have been in evidence in any police head- \nquarters in Northern India. The constables seemed to be almost \nall from Behar or the eastern districts of the U.P. During the \nmany journeys I made in the big prison lorry, to court and back \nor from one prison to another, a number of these constables \nused to accompany me inside. They looked thoroughly un- \nhappy, disliking their job, and obviously full of sympathy for \nme. Sometimes their eyes glistened with tears. \n\nI was kept in the Presidency Gaol to begin with, and from \nthere I was taken for my trial to the Chief Presidency Magis- \ntrate\u2019s court. This was a novel experience. The court-room and \nbuilding had more the appearance of a besieged fortress than \nof an open court. Except for a few newspaper men and the \nusual lawyers, no outsiders were allowed anywhere in the neigh- \nbourhood. The police was present in some force. These arrange- \nments apparently had not been made especiaEy for me; that was \nthe daily routine. When I was taken to the court-room I had to \nmarch through a long passage ^side the room) which was \nclosely wired on top and at the side. It was like going through a \ncage. The dock was far from the magistrate\u2019s seat. The court- \nroom was crowded with policemen and black-coated and gowned \n\nused enough to court trials. Many of my previous trials \nhad taken place in gaol precincts. But there had always been \nsome friends, relatives, familiar faces about, and the whole \natmosphere had been a little easier. The police had usually \n\n\nlawyers \nI was \n\n\n\n jawaharlal nishru \n\nkept in the background and there had never been any cage-like \nstructures about. Here it was very different, and I gazed at \nstrange, unfamiliar faces between whom and me there was \nnothing in common. It was not an attractive crowd. I am \nafraid gowned lawyers en masse are not beautiful to look at, \nand police-court lawyers seem to develop a peculiarly unlovely \nlook. At last I managed to spot one familiar lawyer\u2019s face in \nthat black array, but he was lost in that crowd. \n\nI felt very lonely and isolated even when I sat on the balcony \noutside before the trial began. My pulse must have quickened \na little, and inwardly I was not quite so composed as I usually \nhad been during my previous trials. It struck me then that if \neven I, with so much experience of trials and convictions, could \nreact abnormally to that situation, how much more must young \nand inexperienced people feel the tension? \n\nI felt much better in the dock itself. There was, as usual, no \ndefence offered, and I read out a brief statement. The next \nday, February ith, I was sentenced to two years. My seventh \nterm of imprisonment had begun. \n\nI looked back with some satisfaction to my five and a half \nmonths\u2019 stay outside. That time had been fairly well occupied, \nand I had managed to get through some useful jobs. My \nmother had turned the corner and was out of immediate \ndanger. My younger sister, Krishna, had married.\u2019 My daugh- \nter's future education had been' fixed up. I had straighten, ed \nout some of my domestic and financial tangles. Many personal \nmatters that I had been long neglecting had been attended to. \nIn the field of public affairs I knew that no one could do much \nthen. I had at least helped a little in stiffening up the Congress \nattitude and in directing it to some extent towards social and \neconomic ways of thinking. My Poona correspondence with \nGandhiji, and later my articles in the Press, had made a differ- \nence. My articles on the communal question had also done \nsome good. And then I had met Gandhiji again after more \nthan two years, and many other firiends and comrades, and had \ncharged myself with nervous and emotional energy for another \nperiod. \n\nOne shadow remained to darken my mind\u2014Kamala\u2019s ill- \nhealth. I had no notion then how very ill she was, for she has a \nhabit of carrying on till she collapses. But I was worried. And \nyet I hoped that now I was in prison she would be free to devote \nherself to her treatment. It was more difficult to do so whilst I \nwas out and she was not willing to leave me for long. \n\nI had olie other regret.

And \nyet I hoped that now I was in prison she would be free to devote \nherself to her treatment. It was more difficult to do so whilst I \nwas out and she was not willing to leave me for long. \n\nI had olie other regret. I was sorry that I had not visited \n\n\n\nALIPORE GAOL \n\n\n \n\neven once the rural areas of Allahabad district. Many of my \nyoung colleagues had recently been arrested there for carrying \nout our instructions, and it seemed almost like disloyalty to \nthem not to follow them in the district. \n\nAgain the black Maria carried me back to prison. On our \nway we passed plenty of troops on the march with machine- \nguns, armoured cars, etc. I peeped at them through the tiny \nopenings of our prison van. How ugly an armoured car is, I \nthought, and a tank. They reminded me of prehistoric monsters \n\u2014 ^the dinosaurs and the like. \n\nI was transferred from the Presidency Gaol to the Alipore \nCentral Gaol, and- there I was given a little cell, about ten feet \nW nine. In front of it was a veranda and a small open yard. \nTne wall enclosing the yard was a low one, about seven feet, \nand looking over it a strange sight confronted me. All manner \nof odd buildings \u2014 single storey, double storey, round, rectangu- \nlar, curious roofings \u2014 ^rose all round, some over-topping the \nothers. It seemed that the structures had grown one by one, \nbeing fitted in anyhow to take advantage of all the available \nspace. Almost it looked like a jig-saw puzzle or a fiiturist \nattempt at the fantastic. And yet I was told that all the build- \nings had been arranged very methodically with a tower in the \ncentre (which was a church for the Christian prisoners) and \nradiating lines. Being a city gaol, the area was limited and \nevery little bit of it had to be utilised. \n\nI had hardly recovered from my first view of the seemingly \nfantastic structures around me when a terrifying sight greeted \nme. Two chimneys, right in front of my cell and yard, were \nbelching forth dense volumes of black smoke, and sometimes \nthe wind blew this smoke in my direction, almost suffocating \nme. They were the chimneys of the gaol kitchens. I suggested \nto the Superintendent later that gas-masks might be provided \nto meet this ofiFensive. \n\nIt was not an agreeable start, and the future was not inviting \n\u2014to enjoy the unchanging prospect of the red-brick structures \nof Alipore Gaol and to swallow and inhale the smoke of its \nkitchen chimneys. There were no trees or greenery in my yard. \nIt was all paved and puca and dean, except for the daily \ndeposit of smoke, but it was also bare and dieerless. I could \njust see the tops of one or two trees in adjoining yards. They \nwere barren of leaf or flower when I arrived. But gradually a \nmysterious change came over them and little bits of green \nwere peeping out all over their, branches. The leaves were \ncoming out of the buds; they grew rapidly and covered the \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nnakedness of the branches with their pleasant green. It was a \ndelightful change which made even Alipore Gaol look gay and \ncheerful. \n\nIn one of these trees was a kite\u2019s nest which interested me, \nand I watched it often. The little ones were growing and learn- \ning the tricks of the trade, and sometimes they would swoop \ndown with rapidity and amazing accuracy and snatch the bread \nout of a prisoner\u2019s hand, almost out of his mouth. \n\nFrom sunset to sunrise (more or less) we were locked up in \nour cells, and the long winter evenings were not very easy to \npass. I grew tired of reading or writing hour after hour, and \nwould start walking up and down that little cell \u2014 ^four or five \nshort steps forward and then back again. I remembered the \nbears at the zoo tramping up and down their cages. Some- \ntimes when I felt particularly bored I took to my favourite \nremedy, the shirshasana \u2014 standing on the head I \n\nThe early part of the night was fairly quiet, and city sounds \nused to float in \u2014 the noise of the trams, a gramophone, or some \none singing in the distance. It was pleasant to hear this faint \nand distant music. But there was not much peace at night, for \nthe guards on duty tramped up and down, and every hour \nthere was some kind of an inspection. Some officer came round \nwith a lantern to make sure that none of us had escaped. At \n a.m. every day, or rather night, there was a tremendous din, \nand a mighty sound of scraping and scrubbing. The kitchens \nhad begun functioning. \n\nThere were vast numbers of warders and guards and officers \nand clerks in the Alipore Gaol, as also in the Presidency. Both \nthese prisons housed a population about equal to that of Naini \nPrison\u2014  to  \u2014 but the staff in each must have been \nmore than double that of Naini. There were many European \nwarders and retired Indian Army officers. It was evident that \ndie British Empire functioned more intensively and more ex- \npensively in Calcutta than in the U.P, A sign and a perpetual \nreminder of the might of the Empire was the cry that prisoners \nhad to shout out when high officims approached them. \u201c Sarkar \nSalaam \u201d was the cry, lengthened out, and it was accompanied \nby certain physical movements of the body. The voices of the \nprisoners shouting out this cry came to me many times a day \nover my yard wall, and especially when the Superintendent \npassed by daily. I could just see over my seven-foot wall the top \nof the huge State umbrella under which the Superintendent \nmarched. \n\nWas this extraordinary cry\u2014 salaam \u2014 and the move- \n\n\n\nALIPORE GAOL \n\n\n \n\nmerits that went with it relics of old times, I wondered; or were \nthey the invention of some inspired English official? I do not \nknow, but I imagine that it was an Ei^lish invention. It has a \ntypical Anglo-Indian sound about it. .Fortunately this cry does \nnot prevail in the U.P. gaols or probably in any other province \nbesides Bengal and Assam. The way this enforced salutation to \nthe might of the sarkar is shouted out seemed to me very \ndegrading. \n\nOne change for the better I noticed with pleasure in Alipore. \nThe food of the ordinary prisoners was far superior to the U.P. \nprison food. In regard to gaol diet the U.P. compares unfavour- \nably with many provinces. . \n\n'fne brief winter was soon over, and spring raced by and \nsummer began. It grew hotter day by day. I had never been \nfond of the Calcutta climate, and even a few days of it had \nmade me stale and flat. In prison conditions were naturally far \nworse, and I did not prosper as the days went by. Lack of space \nfor exercise and long lock-up hours in that climate probably \naffected my health a little and I lost weight rapidly. How I \nbegan to hate all locks and bolts and bars and walls I \n\nAfter a tnonth in Alipore I was allowed to take some exercise, \noutside my yard. This was an agreeable change and I could \nwalk up and down under the main wall, morning and evening. \nGradually I got accustomed to Alipore Gaol and the Calcutta \nclimate; and even the kitchen, with its smoke and mighty din, \nbecame a tolerable nuisance. Other matters occupied my mind, \nother worries filled me. News firora outside was not good.  DEMOCRACY IN EAST AND WEST \n\nI WAS surprised to iind in Alipore that no daily paper would be \nallowed to me after my conviction. As an under-trial prisoner I \nreceived the daily Statesman, of Calcutta, but this was stopped \nthe day after my trial was over. In the U.P., ever since a, a \ndaily (chosen by the Government) was permitted to A Class or \nfirst division prisoners. So also in most other provinces, and I \nwas fully under the impression that the same rule was appli- \ncable in Bengal. Instead of the daily, however, I was supplied \nwith the weekly Statesman. This was evidently meant for retired \nEnglish officials or business men who had gone back to \nEngland, and it contained a summary of Indian news likely to \ninterest them. No foreign news at all was given and I missed it \nvery much, as I used to follow it closely. Fortunately I was \nallowed to have the Manchester Guardian Weekly, and this kept \nme in touch with Europe and international affairs. \n\nMy arrest and trial in February coincided with upheavals \nand bitter conflicts in Europe. There was the ferment in \nFrance resulting in Fascist riots and the formation of a \n\u2018 National \u2019 Government. And, far worse, in Austria Chancellor \nDolfuss was shooting down workers and putting an end to the \ngreat edifice of social democracy there. The news of the Aus- \ntrian bloodshed depressed me greatly. What an awful and \nbloody place this world was and how barbarous was man when \nhe wanted to protect his vested interests I All over Europe and \nAmerica Fasasm seemed to be advancing. When Hitler came \ninto power in Germany I had imagined that his regime could \nnot possibly last long, as he was offering no solution of Ger- \nmany\u2019s economic troubles. So also, as Fascism spread elsewhere, \nI consoled myself that it represented the last ditch of reaction. \nAfter it must come the breaking of the shacldes. But I began \nto wonder if my wish was not father to my thought. Was it so \nobvious that this Fascist wave would retire so easily or so \nquickly? And even if conditions became intolerable for the \nFascist dictatorships, would they not rather hurl their countries \ninto devastating war rather than give in? What would be the \nresult of such a conflict? \n\nMeanwhile, Fascism of various kinds and shapes spread. \nSpain, that new \u2018Republic of Honest Men \u2019 \u2014 los hombres \n\n \n\n\n\nDEMOCRACY IN EAST AND WEST  \n\nhonrados \u2014 the very Manchester Guardian of governments, as \nsome one called it, had gone far back and deep into reaction. \nAll the fine phrases of its honest Liberal leaders bad not kept \nit from sliding down. Everywhere Liberalism showed its utter \nineffectiveness to face modern conditions. It dung to words and \nphrases, and thought that they could take the place of action. \nWhen d crisis came it simply faded off like the end of a film \nthat is over. \n\n]^read the leading articles of the Manchester Guardian on the \nAustrian tragedy with deep interest and appreciation. \u201cAnd \nwhat sort of Austria emerges fi:om this bloody struggle? An \nAustria ruled with rifles and machine-guns by the most reac- \ntionary clique in Europe.\u201d \u201cBut why, if England stands for \nliberty, has its Prime Minister so little to say? We have heard \nhis praises of dictatorships : we have heard him say how they \n\u2018 mdte the soul of a nation live \u2019 and \u2018 bestow a new vision and \na new energy.\u2019 But a Prime Minister of England should have \nsomething to say of the tyrannies, in whatever country, which \nkill often the body, but more often, and with a worse death, the \nsoul.\u201d \n\nAnd why, if the Manchester Guardian stands for liberty, has \nit so little to jsay when liberty is crushed in India? We also \nhave known not only bodily suffering, but that far worse ordeal \nof the soul. \n\n\u201cAustrian democracy has been de.stroyed, although to its \neverlasting glory it went dovra fighting and so created a legend \nthat may re-kindle the spirit of European freedom some day in \nyears to come.\u201d \n\n\u201c The Europe that is unfree has ceased to breathe; there is no \nflow or counterflow of healthy spirits; a gradual suffocation has \nset in, and only some violent convulsion or inner paroxysm \nand a striking out to the right and left can avert the maital \ncoma that is approaching. . . . Europe from the Rhine to the \nUrals is one great prison.\u201d \n\nMoving passages which found an echo in my heart. But I \nwondered: what of India? How can it be that the Manchester \nGuardian or the many lovers of freedom who undoubtedly exist \nin England should be so oblivious to our fate? How can they \nmiss seeing here what they condemn with such fervour else- \nwhere? It was a great English Liberal leader, trained in the \nnineteenth-century tradition, cautious by temperament,, res- \ntrained in his language, who said twenty years ago, on the eve \nof the Great War: \u201cSooner than be a silent witness of the \ntragic triumph of force over law, I would see this country of \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nours blotted out of the page of history.\u201d A brave thought, \neloquently put, and the gallant youth of England went in their \nmillions to vindicate it. But if an Indian ventures to make a \nstatement similar to Mr. Asquith\u2019s, what fate is his? \n\nNational psychology is a complicated affair. Most of us \nimagine how fair and impartial we are; it is always the other \nfellow, the other country that is wrong. Somewhere at the back \nof our minds we are convinced that we are not as others are : \nthere U a difference which good breeding usually prevents us \nfrom emphasising. And if we are fortunate enough to be an \nimperial race controlling the destinies of other countries, it is \ndifficult not to believe that all is for the best in this best of all \npossible worlds, and those who agitate for change are self- \nseekers or deluded fools, ungrateful for the benefits they have \nreceived from us. \n\nThe British are. an insular race, and long success and pros- \nperity has made them look down on almost all others. For \nthem, as some one has said, \u201c les ncgres commenccnt a Calais \u201d. \nBut that is too general a statement. Perhaps the British upper- \nclass division of the world would be somewhat as follows: (i) \nBritain \u2014 a long gap, and then (a) the British Dominions (white \npopulations only) and America (Anglo-Saxons only, and not \ndagoes, wops, etc.), () Western Europe, () Rest of Europe, () \nSouth America (Latin races), a long gap, and then () the brown, \nyellow and black races of Asia and Africa, all bunched up more \nor less together. \n\nHow far we of the last of these classes arc from the heights \nwhere our rulers live I Is it any wonder that their vision grows \ndim when they look towards us, and that we should irritate \nthem when we talk of democracy and liberty? These words \nwere not coined for our use. Was it not a great Liberal states- \nman, John Morley, who had declared that he could not conceive \nof democratic institutions in India even in the far, dim future? \nDemocracy for India was, like Canada\u2019s fur coat, unsuited to her \nclimate. And, later on, Britain\u2019s Labour Party, the standard- \nbearers of Socialism, the champions of the under-dog, presented \nus, in the flush of their triumph, with a revival of the Bengal \nOrdinance in , and during their second government our \nfate was even worse. I am quite sure that none of them mean \nus ill, and when they address us in their best pulpit manner \u2014 \n\u2018 Dearly beloved brethren \u2019 \u2014 ^they feel a glow of conscious virtue. \nBut, to them, we are not as they are and must be judged by \nother standards. It is diflicult enough for an Englishman and a \nFrenchman to think alike because of linguistic and cultural \n\n\n\nDEMOCRACY IN EAST AND WEST OI \n\ndifferences; how much vaster must be the difference between an \nEnglishman and an Asiatic? \n\nRecently the House of Lords has been debating the question \nof Indian reform, and many illuminating speeches were de- \nlivered by noble lords. Among these was one by Lord Lytton, a \nfbrmer Governor of an Indian Province, who acted as Viceroy \nfor a while. He has often been referred to as a liberal and sym- \npathetic Governor. He is reported to have said^ that \u201cthe \nGovernment of India was far more representative of India as a \nwhole than the Congress politicians. The Government of India \nwas able to speak in the name of officials, the Army, the Police, \nthe Princes, the fighting regiments and both Moslems and \nHindus, whereas the Congress politicians could not even speak \non behalf of one of the great Indian communities.\u201d He went \non to make his meaning quite clear: \u201cWlien I speak of Indian \nopinion I am thinking of those on whose co-operation I had to \nrely and on whose co-operation the future Governors and Vice- \nroys will have to rely.\u201d \n\nTwo interesting points emerge firom his speech : the India that \ncounts means those who help the British; and the British \nGovernment of India is the most representative and, therefore, \ndemocratic body in the country. That this argument should be \nadvanced seriously shows that English words seem to change \ntheir meaning when they cross the Suez Canal. The next and \nobvious step in reasoning would be, that autocratic government \nis the most representative and democratic form because the \nKing represents everybody. We get back to the divine right of \nkings and \" V  tat, cVs# moi! \u201d \n\nAs a matter of fact, even pure autocracy has had a distin- \nguished advocate recently. Sir Malcolm Hailey, that ornament \nof the Indian Civil Service, speaking as Governor of the United \nProvinces at Benares on November , , pleaded for auto- \ncracy in the Indian States. The advice was hardly needed, for \nno Indian State is at all likely.fo part with autocracy of its own \nfree will. An interesting development has been the attempt to \npreserve this autocracy on the plea that democracy is failing in \nEurope. Sir Mirza Ismail, the Dewan of Mysore, lias expressed \nhis \"surprise that radical reforms are advocated when parlia- \n.mentary democracy is decaying everywhere.\u201d \"I am sure the \nconscience of the State feels that our present constitution is \nquite democratic enough for all practical purposes.'\u2019 * The * con- \nscience \u2019 of Mysore presumably is a metaphysical abstraction for \n\n* House of Lords, December . . \n\n\u00ae Mysore: June ai, . See also note on page , post. \n\n\n\nJAVMHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nthe Ruler and his Dewan. The democracy that prevails in \nMysore at present is indistinguishable from autocracy. \n\nIf democracy is not suited to India, it appears to be equally \nunsuitable for Egypt. I have just read a long despatch from \nCairo in the Statesman ^ (for this daily is supplied to me now in \nmy present gaol). We are told that the Premier, Nessim Pasha, \n\" has now aroused no little alarm in responsible-minded quarters \nowing to his declaration that he hoped to get the political parties \nto co-operate, especially the Wa\u00a3d, and either to have a national \nconference or elections for a constituent assembly, in cither case \nfor the elaboration of a new Constitution. This can only mean \nin the end ... a return to the regime of the popular democratic \ngovernment which history shows has always been disastrous for \nEgypt, since in the past it has ever pandered to the worst \npassions of the mob. . . . No one knowing anything of the inner \nWorking of Egyptian politics and of the people, doubts for one \nmoment that elections will again result in the return of the \nWafd with a majority. Unless something is done, therefore, to \nprevent this procedure, we shall within a short time be again \nsaddled with an ultra-democratic anti-foreign revolutionary \nregime.\u201d \n\nIt is suggested that the elections should be \u201c run \u201d by adminis- \ntrative pressure \u201cas a counterpoise to the Wafd,\u201d but, un- \nhappily, the Premier \" has too much the legal mind \u201d to do any \nsuch thing. The only other course that remains, we are told, is \nfor Whitehall to intervene and to \u201c let it be known that it will \nnot tolerate the return of a regime \u201d of this kind. \n\nWhat steps Whitehall may or may not take, or what will \nhappen in Egypt I do not know.* But this argument put for- \nward by presumably a liberty-loving Englishman does help us \nto understand a little, some of the complexities of the Egyptian \nand Indian situation. As the Statesman points out in a leading \narticle : \u201c The root evil has been that the way of life and atti- \ntude of mind of an ordinary Egyptian voter are inharmonious \nwith the sort of way of life and attitude of mind out of whieli \ndemocracy is developed.\" This want of harmony is illustrated \nfurther on : \u201c In Europe, democracies have often been brought \ndown because there were too many parties; in Egypt the diffi- \nculty has been there only being one party, the Ward.\u201d \n\nIn India we are told that our communal divisions come in the \nway of our democratic progress and, therefore, with incontro- \n\n* December , . \n\n*' There were widespread political riots in Egypt against the \nBritish occupation in November . \n\n\n\nDEMOCRACY IN EAST AND WEST  \n\nvertible logic, those divisions are perpetuated. We are further \ntold that we are not united enough. In Egypt there are no com- \nmunal divisions and it appears that the most perfect political \nunity prevails. And yet, this very unity becomes an obstacle in \nthe way of democracy and freedom! Truly the path of demo- \ncracy is straight and narrow. Democracy for an Eastern country \nseems to mean only one thing : to carry out the behests of the \nimperialist ruling power and not to touch any of its interests. \nSubject to that proviso, democratic freedom can flourish un- \nchecked.  DEHRA GAOL AGAIN \n\nI WAS not flourishing in Alipore Gaol. My weight had gone \ndown considerably, and the Calcutta air and increasing heat \nwere distressing me. There were rumours of my transfer to a \nbetter climate. On May  th I was told to gather my belongings \nand to march out of the gaol. I was being sent to Dchra Dun \nGaol. The drive through Calcutta in the cool evening air was \nvery pleasant after some months of seclusion, and the crowds at \nthe big Howrah station were fascinating. \n\n was glad of my transfer, and looked forward to Dehra Dun \nwith its near-by mountains. On arrival I found that all was not \nas it used to be nine months earlier, when I Wd left it &r Naini. \nI was put in a new place, an old cattle-shed cleaned up and \nfitted out. \n\nAs a cell it was not bad, and there was a little veranda \nattached to it. There was also a small yard adjoining, about \nfifty feet in length. The cell was better than the ancient \none I had had previously in Dehra, but soon I discovered that \nother changes were not for the better. The surroimding wall, \nwhich had been ten feet high, had just been raised, especially \nfor my benefit, by another four or five feet. The view of the \nhills I had so looked forward to was completely cut off and I \ncould just see a few tree-tops. I was in this gaol for over three \nmonths, and I never had even a glimpse of the mountains. I \nwas not allowed to walk outside in front of the gaol gate, as I \nused to, and my little yard was considered quite big enough for \nexercise. \n\nThese and other new restrictions were disappointing, and I felt \nirritated. I grew listless and disinclined to take even the little \nexercise that my yard allowed. I had hardly ever felt quite so \nlonely and cut off from the world. The solitary confinement \nbegan to tell on iny nerves, and physically and mentally I \ndeclined. On the other side of the wall, only a few feet away, I \nknew there was freshness and firagrance, the cool smell of grass \nand soft earth, and distant vistas. But they were all out of \nreach and my eyes grew weary and heavy, faced always by those \nwalls. There was not even the usual movement of prison life, \nfor I was kept apart and by myself. \n\nAfter six wee^ the monsoon broke and it rained in torrents; \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwe had twelve inches of rain during the first week. There was a \nchange in the air and whisperings of new life; the temperature \ncame down and the body felt relaxed and relieved. But there \nwas no relief for the eyes or the mind. Sometimes the iron door \nof my yard would open to allow a warder to come in or go out, \nand for a few seconds I had a sudden glimpse of the outside \nworld \u2014 ^green fields and trees, bright with colour and glistening \nwith pearly drops of rain\u2014 for a moment only, and then it all \nvanished like a flash of lightning. The door was hardly ever \nfully opened. Apparently the warders had instructions not to \nopen it if I was anywhere near, and even when they opened it, \nto do so just a little. These brief glimpses of greenery and \nfreshness were hardly welcome to me. That sight produced in \nme a kind of nostalgia, a heartache, and I would even avoid \nlooking out when the door opened. \n\nBut all this unhappiness was not really the fault of the gaol, \nthough it contributed to it. It vras the reaction of outside events \n\u2014 Kamala\u2019s illness and my political worries. I was beginning to \nrealise that Kamala was again in the grip of her old disease, \nand I felt helpless and unable to be of any service to her. \nI knew that my presence by her side would have made a \ndifference. \n\nUnlike Alipore, Dehra Dun Gaol allowed me a daily news- \npaper, and I could keep in touch with political and other \ndevelopments outside. In Patna the All-India Congress Com- \nmittee met after nearly three years (for most of this time it was \nunlawful), and its proceedings were depressing. It surprised me \nthat no attempt was made at this first meeting, after so much \nthat had happened in India and the world, to analyse the situa- \ntion, to have full discussions, to try to get out of old ruts. \nGandhiji seemed to be, from a distance, his old dictatorial self\u2014 \n\u201c If you choose to follow my lead you have to accept my con- \nditions,\u201d he said. His demand was perfectly natural, for one \ncould not both have him and ask him to act against his own \ndeeply-felt convictions. But there seemed too much of imposi- \ntion from above and too little of mutual discussion and \nhammering out a policy. It is curious how Gandhiji dominates \nthe mind and then complains of the helplessness of people. \nFew people, I suppose, have had more loyal devotion and obedi- \nence on the mass-scale than he has had, and it seems hardly fair \nto blame the masses for not coming up to the high standard he \nhad set for them. At the Patna meeting he did not even stay \ntill the end, as he had to continue his Harijan tour. He told the \nA.I.C.C. to be business-like and to adopt the resolutions placed \n\n\n\nDEHRA GAOL AGAIN \n\n\n \n\nbefore them by the Working Committee with speed, and then \nhe went away. \n\nIt is probably true that prolonged discussions would not have \nimproved matters. There was a confusion and want of clarity \namong the members, and though many were prepared to criti- \ncise, there were hardly any, constructive suggestions. Under the \ncircumstances this was natural, for the burden of the struggle \nhad largely fallen on these leaders from various provinces and \nthey were a little tired and mentally not fresh. Dimly it was felt \nthat they had to cry halt, civil disobedience had to be stopped; \nbut what then? Two groups took shape: one desiring purely \nconstitutional activities through the legislatures, the other think- \ning rather vaguely along socialistic lines. The majority of the \nmembers belonged to neither of these groups. They disliked a \nreversion to constitutionalism, and at the same time socialism \nfrightened them a little and seemed to them to introduce an \nelement which might split their ranks. They had no construc- \ntive ideas, and the one hope and sheet-anchor they possessed \nwas Gandhiji. As of old, they turned to him and followed his \nlead, even though many of them did not whoUy approve of \nwhat he said. Gandhi ji\u2019s support of the moderate constitutional \nelements gave them dommance in the Committee and the \nCongress. \n\nAU this' was to be expected. But the reaction took the Con- \ngress further back than I had thought. At no time during the \nlast fifteen years, ever since the advent of non-co-operation, had \nCongress leaders talked in this ultra-constitutional fashion. \nEven the Swaraj Party of the middle 'twenties, which itself was \nthe result of a reaction, was far in advance of the new leader- \nship, and there were no such commanding personalities now as \nthe Swaraj Party had. Many persons who had studiously kept \naloof from the movement so long as it was risky to join it, now \nstreamed in and assumed importance. \n\nThe proscription of the Congress was ended by the Govern- \nment and it became a legal organisation. But many of its asso- \nciated and subsidiary bodies continued to be illegal, such as its \nvolunteer department, the Seva Dal, as also a number of Ejsan \nSabhas, which were semi-independoxt peasant unions, and \nseveral educational institutions and youth leagues, including a \nchildren\u2019s organisation. In \u25a0 particular the \u2018IQiiudai Khidmat- \ngars or the Frontier Redshirts, as they are called, were still \noutlawed. This organisation had become a regular part of the \nCongress in , and represrated it in the Frontier Provinai/ \nThus, although the Congress had completely drawn off the \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\ndirect action part of the vStruggle and had reverted to constitu- \ntional ways, the Government kept on all the special laws meant \nfor civil disobedience, and even continued the proscription of \nimportant parts of the Congress organisation. Special attention \nwas also paid to the suppression of peasant organisations and \nlabour unions, while, it was interesting to note, high Govern- \nment officials went about urging the zamindars and landlords \nto organise themselves. Every fecility was offered to these land- \nlords\u2019 organisations. The two major ones in the United Pro- \nvinces have their subscriptions collected by official agency, \ntogether with the revenue or taxes. \n\nI am afraid I have never been partial to the Hindu or \nMoslem communal organisations, but an incident made me feel \nparticularly bitter towards the Hindu Mahasabha. One of its \nsecretaries actually went out of the way to approve of the \ncontinuation of the ban on the \u201c Redshirts \u201d, and to pat Govern- \nment on the back for it. This approval of the deprivation \nof the most elementary of civil rights, at a time when there was \nno aggressive movement on, amazed me. Apart from this ques- \ntion of principle, it was well known that these Frontier people \nhad behaved wonderfully during these years of struggle; and \ntheir leader, Rhan Abdul Ghaiffir Khan, one of the bravest and \nstraightest men in India, was still in prison\u2014 a State prisoner \nkept confined without any trial. It seemed to me that communal \nbias cotild hardly go further, and I expected that more promi- \nnent leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha would hasten to disown \ntheir colleague on this matter. But, so fax as I could discover, \nnot a single one of them said a word about it. \n\nI was much upset by this Hindu Sabha secretary\u2019s statement. \nIt was bad enough in itself, but to my mind it appeared as a \nsymbol of the new state of affairs in the country. In the heat of \nthat summer afternoon I dozed off and I remember having a \ncurious dream. Abdul Ghaffar Khan was being attacked on all \nsides and I was fighting to defend \u2019.im. I woke up in an ex- \nhausted state, feeling very miserable, and my pillow was wet \nwith tears. This surprised me, for in my waking state I was not \nliable to such emotional outbursts. \n\nMy nerves were obviously in a bad way in those days. My \nsleep became troubled and disturbed, which was vexj unusual \nfor me, and all manner of nightmares came to me. Sometimes \nI would shout out in my sleep. Once evidently the shouting had \nbeen more vigorous than usual, and I woke up with a start to \nfind two gaol warders standing near my bed, rather worried at \nmy noises. I had dreamed that I was being strangled. \n\n\n\nUEHRA GAOL AGAIN \n\n\n \n\nAbout this time a resolution of the Congress Working Com- \nmittee had also a painful effect on me. This resolution was \npassed, it was stated, \u201c in view of the loose talk about the con- \nfiscation of private property and necessity of class war \u201d, and it \nproceeded to remind Congressmen that the Karachi Resolution \n\u201c neither contemplates confiscation of private property without \njust cause or compensation, nor advocacy of class war. The \nWorking Committee is further of the opinion that confiscation \nand class war are contrary to the Congress creed of non- \nviolence \u201d. The resolution was loosely worded and exhibited a \ncertain amount of ignorance on the part of the framers as to \nwhat class war was. It was obviously aimed at the newly formed \nCongress Socialist Party. There had, as a matter of fact, been \nno talk of confiscation on the part of any responsible member \nof this group; there had, however, been frequent reference to \nthe existence of class war under present conditions. The Work- \ning Committee\u2019s resolution seemed to hint that any person be- \nlieving in the existence of this class conflict could not even be \nan ordinary member of the Congress. Nobody had ever accused \nthe Congress of having turned Socialist or of being against \nprivate property. Some members of it held those opinions, but \nnow it aj^peared that they had no place even in the rank and \nfile of this all-embracing national organisation. \n\nIt had often been stated that the Congress rCTresented the \nnation, including every group and interest in it, from prince to \npauper. National movements frequently make that claim, mean- \ning thereby presumably that they represent the great majority \nof the nation and that their policy is for the good of all in- \nterests. But the claim is on die face of it untenable, for no \npolitical organisation can represent conflicting interests without \nreducing itself to a flabby and unmeaning mass with no distinc- \ntive and distinguishing features. The Congress is either a \npolitical party with a definite (or vague) aim and philosophy of \nachieving political power and of utfrising it for the national \ngood, or it is just a benevolent and humanitarian organisation \nwith no views of its own and wishing well to everybody. It can \nrepresent only those who are in general agreement with that \naim and philosophy, and those who oppose this are likely to be \nconsidered by it as anti-national or anti-social and reactionary \nelements whose influence must be checked or eliminated, in \norder to give effect to its own philosophy. It is true that a \nnational anti-imperialist movement offers a wide basis for agree- \nment, as it does not touch the social conflicts. And so the \nCongress did represent in varying degrees the vast majority of \n\n\n\n JAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\nthe people of India, and it drew within its fold all manner of \nmutually differing groups who agreed only on the anti- \nimperialist issue, and even in regard to this there were great \ndifferences in stress. Those who, on this basic issue of anti- \nimperialism, held a contrary opinion kept out of the Congress \nand sided, also in varying degrees, with the British Government. \nThe Congress thus became a kind of permanent All-Parties \nCongress, consisting of large numbers of groups shading into \neach other and held together by one common faith and the \ndominating personality of Gandniji. \n\nThe Working Committee subsequently tried to explain its \nresolution on class war. The importance of that resolution lay \nnot so much in its language or what it definitely laid down, as \nin the fact that it was yet another indication of the way Con- \ngress was going. The resolution had obviously been inspired by \nthe new parliamentary wing of the Congress aiming at gaining \nthe support of men of property in the coming election to the \nLegislative Assembly. At their instance the Congress was look- \ning more and more to the Bight and trying to win over the \nmoderate and conservative elements in the country. Soothing \nwords were being addressed even to those who had beerx hostile \nto the Congress movements in the past and had sided with the \nGovernment during the continuance of civil disobedience. A \nclamorous and critical Left wing was felt to be a handicap in \nthis process of conciliation and \u2018 conversion and the Working \nCommittee's resolution, as weU as many other individual utter- \nances, made it clear that the Congress Executive were not going \nto be moved from their new path by this nibbling from.the Left. \nIf the Left did not behave it would be sat upon and eliminated \nfrom the Congress ranks. The manifesto issued by the Parlia- \nmentary Board of the Congress contained a programme which \nwas far more cautious and moderate than any that the Congress \nhad sponsored during the past fifteen years. \n\nThe Congress leadership, quite apart even from Gandhiji, con- \nsisted of many well-known persons with bright records in the \nnational struggle for freedom, men honoured throughout the \ncountry for their integrity and fearlessness. But the new orienta- \ntion of policy brought into the second ranks, and even the \nfront rank, of Congress many individuals who could hardly be \ndescribed as idealists. In the Congress ranks there were, of \ncourse, large numbers of idealists, but the door for careerists \nand opportunists was now more open than it had ever been \nbefore. Apart from Gandhiji\u2019s enigmatical and elusive person- \nality, which dominated the scene, the Congress seemed to \n\n\n\nx)!.hra gaol again  \n\npossess two faces ; a purely political side was developing like a \ncaucus, and the other aspect was that of a prayer meeting, full \nof pietism and sentimentality. \n\nOn the Government side there was an air of triumph, in no \nway concealed, at what they considered the success of their \npolicy in suppressing civil disobedience and its oflFshoots. The \noperation had been successful, and for the moment it mattered \nlittle whether the patient lived or died. They proposed to con- \ntinue the same policy, with minor variations, even though the \nCongress had been for the moment brought round to some \nextent. They knew that such changes in national policy could \nonly be temporary so long as the basic problem remained, and \nany relaxation on their part might lead to a more rapid growth \nthan otherwise. Perhaps they also thought that in continuing to \nsuppress the more advanced elements in the Congress or in the \nlabour and peasant ranks, they would not gready offend the \nmore cautious leaders of the Congress. \n\nTo some extent my thoughts in Dehra Dun Gaol ran along \nthese channels. I was really not in a position to form definite \nopinions about the course of events, for I was out of touch. In \nAlipore I had been almost completely out of touch, in Dehra \na newspaper of the Government\u2019s choice brought me partial \nand sometimes one-sided news. It is quite possible that contacts \nwith my colleagues outside and a closer study of the situation \nwould have resulted in my varying my opinions in some degree. \n\nDistressed with the present, I began thinking of the past, of \nwhat had happened politically in India since I began to take \nsome part in public affairs. How far had we been right in what \nwe had done? How far wrong? It struck me that my thinking \nwould be more orderly and helpful if I put it down on paper. \nThis would also help in engaging my mind in a definite task \nand so diverting it from worry and depression. So in the month \nof Ju ne  I began this ' autobiographical narrative\u2019 in \nDehra Gaol, and for the last eight months I have continued it \nwhen the mood to do so has seized me. Often there have been \nintervals when I felt no desire to write; three of these gaps were \neach of them nearly a month long. But I managed to continue, \nand now I am nearing the end of this personal journey. Most \nof this has been written under peculiarly distressing circum- \nstances when I was suffering from depression and emotional \nstrain. Perhaps some of this is reflected in what I have written, \nbut this very writing helped me greatly to pull myself out of \nthe present with all its worries. As I wrote,  was hardly think, - \ning of an outside audience; I was addressing myself, framing \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nquestions and answering them for my own benefit, sometimes \neven drawing some amusement from it. I wanted as far as \npossible to think straight, and I imagined that this review of \nthe past might help me to do so. \n\nTowards the end of July, Kamala\u2019s condition rapidly de- \nteriorated, and within a few days became critical. On August \nI ith I was suddenly asked to leave Dehra Gaol, and that night \nI was sent under police escort to Allahabad. The next evening \nwe reached Prayag station in Allahabad and there I was in- \nformed by the District Magistrate that I was being released \ntemporarily so that I might visit my ailing wife. It was six \nmonths to a day from the time of my arrest.  ELEVEN DAYS \n\nFor the Sword outwears its sheath, \n\nAnd the soul wears out the breast. \n\nByron, \n\nMy release was temporary. I was given to understand that it \nwas for a day or two or for such longer period as the doctors \nmight think absolutely necessary. It was a peculiar position, \nfull of uncertainty, and it was not possible for me to settle \ndown to anything. A fixed period would have enabled me to \nknow how I stood, and I would have tried to adjust myself to \nit. As it was, any day, at any moment, I might be taken back \nto prison. \n\nThe change was sudden and I was wholly unprepared for \nit. From solitary confinement to a crowded house with doctors, \nnurses, and relatives. My daughter Indira had also come from \nSantiniketan. Many friends were continually coming to see me \nand enquire aft\u00a7x\u00bb^.mala\u2019s health. The style of living was \nquite differentr there were home comforts, better food. And \ncolouring all this background was anxiety for Kamala\u2019s serious \ncondition. \n\nThere she lay frail and utterly weak, a shadow of herself, \nstruggling feebly with her illness, and the thought that she \nmight leave me became an intolerable obsession. It was \neighteen and a half years since our marriage, and my mind \nwandered back to that day and to all that tibese succeeding \nyears had brought us. I was twenty-six at the time and she \nwas about seventeen, a slip of a girl, utterly unsophisticated \nin the ways of the world. The difference in our ages was con- \nsiderable, but greater still was the difference in our mental out- \nlook, for I was far more grown-up than she was: And yet with \nall my appearance of worldly wisdom I was very boyish, and \nI hardly realised that this ddicatc, sensitive girl's mind was \nslowly unfolding like a flower and required gentle and careful \ntending. We were attracted to each other and got on well \nenough, but our backwoundS were different and there was a \nwant of adjustment. These maladjustments would sometimes \nlead to friction and there were many petty quarrels over \ntrivialities, boy-and-girl affairs which did not last long and \n\n fil \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nended in a quick reconciliation. Both had a quick temper, a \nsensitive nature, and a childish notion of keeping one\u2019s dignity. \nIn spite of this our attachment grew, though the want of ad- \njustment lessened only slowly. Twenty-one months after our \nmarriage, Indira, our daughter and only child, arrived. \n\nOur marriage had almost coincided with new developments \nin politics, and my absorption in them grew. They were the \nHome Rule days, and soon after came Martial Law in the \n/Punjab and Non-Co-operation, and more and more I was in- \nvolved in the dust and tumble of public affairs. So great \nbecame my concentration in these activities that, all uncon- \nsciously, I almost overlooked her and left her to her own \nresources, just when she required my full co-operation. My \naffection for her continued and even grew, and it was a great \ncomfort to know that she was there to help me with her sooth- \ning influence. She gave me strength, but she must have suf- \nfered and felt a little neglected. An unkindness to her would \nalmost have been better than this semi-forgetful, casual attitude. \n\nAnd then came her recurring illness and my long absences in \n\nE rison, when we could only meet at gaol interviews. The Civil \nUsobedience movement brought her in the front rank of our \nfighters, and she rejoiced when she too went to prison. We grew \never nearer to each other. Our rare meetings became precious, \nand we looked forward to them and counted the days that in- \ntervened. We could not get tired of each other or stale, for \nthere was always a freshness and novelty about our meetings \nand brief periods together. Each of us was continually making \nfresh discoveries in the other, though sometimes perhaps the \nnew discoveries were not to our liking. Even our grown-up \ndisagreements had something boyish and girlish about them. \n\nA.fter eighteen years of married life she had still retained her \ngirlish and virginal appearance; there was notlung matronly \nabout her. Almost she might have been the bride that came to \nour house so long ago. But I had changed vastly, and though \nI was fiit and supple and active enough tor my age \u2014 and, I was \ntold, I still possessed some boyish traits \u2014 ^my looks betrayed \nme. I was partly bald and my hair was grey, lines and furrows \ncrossed my face and dark shadows surrounded my eyes. The \nlast four years with their troubles and worries had left many \na mark on me. Often, in these later years when Kamala and \nI had gone out together in a strange place, she was mistaken, \nto my embarrassment, for my daughter. She and Indira looked \nlike two sisters. \n\nEighteen years of married life! But how many long years \n\n\n\nELEVEN DAYS \n\n\n \n\nout of them had I spent in prison-cell, and Kamala in hos- \npitals and sanatoria? And now again I was serving a prison \nsentence and out just for a few days, and she was lying ill, \nstruggling for life. I felt a little irritated at her for her care- \nlessness about her health. And yet how could I blame her, \nfor her eager spirit fretted at her inaction and her inability to take \nher full share in the national struggle. Physically unable to do \nso, she could neither take to work properly nor to treatment, \nand the fire inside her wore down the body. \n\nSurely she was not \u00a7oing to leave me now when I needed her \nmost? Why, we had just begun to know and understand each \nother really; our joint life was only now properly beginning. \nWe relied so much on each other, we had so much to do \ntogether. \n\nSo I thought as I watched her from day to day and hour \nto hour. \n\nColleagues and friends came to see me. They told me of much \nthat had happened of which I was unaware. They discussed \ncurrent political problems and asked me questions. I found it \ndifficult to answer them. It was not easy for my mind to get \naway firom Kamala\u2019s illness, and after the isolation and detach- \nment of gaolT was not in a position to face concrete questions \nsuddenly. Long experience had taught me that it is not pos- \nsible to appraise a situation from the limited information \navailable in gaol. Personal contacts were necessary for a proper \nmental reaction, otherwise the expression of opinion was likely \nto be purely academic and divorced from reality. It seemed \nalso unfiiir to Gandhiji and my old colleagues of the Congress \nWorking Committee for me to say anything definite regarding \nCongress policy before I had had the opportunity to discuss \neverything with them. My mind was full of criticisms of much \nthat had been done, but I was not prepared to make any \npositive suggestions. Not expecting to come out of prison just \nthen I had not thought along these lines. \n\nI had also a feeling that in view of the courtesy shown by \nthe Government in allowing me to come to my wife, it would \nnot be proper for me to take advantage of this for political \npurposes. I had given no undertaking or assurance to avoid \nany such activity, nevertheless I was condnually being pulled \nback by this idea. \n\nI avoided issuing any public statements except to contradict \nfalse rumours. Even m private I refi'ained firom committing \nmyself to any definite line of policy, but I was free enough \nwith my criticisms of past events. The Congress Socialist Party \n\n\n\n JAWAHARI,AL NEHRU \n\nhad recently come into existence, and many of my intimate \ncolleagues were associated with it. So far as I had gathered, its \ngeneral policy was agreeable to me, but it seemed a curious and \nmixed assemblage and, even if I had been completely free, I \nwould not have suddenly joined it. Local politics took up some \nof my time, for in Allahabad, as in several other places, there \nhad been an extraordinarily virulent campaign during the \nelections for the local Congress Committees. No principles were \ninvolved, it was purely a question of personalities, and I was \nasked to help in settling some of the personal quarrels that had \narisen. \n\nI had no desire whatever to go into these matters, nor had I \nthe time. In spite of this some of the facts came to my notice \nand caused me great distress. It was surprising that people \nshould get so vastly excited over local Congress elections. \nAmong the most prominent were those who had retired during \nthe struggle for various private reasons. With the withdrawal \nof civil disobedience those reasons ceased to have weight, and \nthey emerged suddenly and carried on a fierce and often vulgar \ncampaign against each other. It was extraordinary how the \nordinary canons of decency were fiirgotten in the passionate \ndesires to down the other party. I was especially grieved at the \nfact that Kamala\u2019s name and even her illness had been ex- \nploited for the purposes of these local elections. \n\nAmong the wider questions that were discussed was the \nCongress decision to contest the coming elections to the Legisla- \ntive Assembly. Many of the younger groups opposed this \ndecision because they thought it was a return to parliamentary \nand compromising methods, but they suggested no effective \nalternative. Some of these opponents on grounds of high \nprinciple had, curiously enough, no objection to organisations \nother than the Congress running the elections. Their object \nseemed to be to leave the field clear to communal organisations. \n\nI felt disgusted with the local squabble and the kind of \npolitics which were rapidly developing. I felt out of tune with \nthem and a stranger in my own dty of Allahabad. What could \nI do, I wondered, in this environment when the time came for \nme to attend to such matters? \n\nI wrote to Gandhiji about Kamala\u2019s condition. As I thought \nI would be going back to prison soon and might have no other \nchance to do so, I gave him also some glimpse into my mind. , \nRecent events had embittered and distressed me greatly, and \nmy letter carried a faint reflection of this. I did not attempt \nto suggest what should be done or what should not be done; \n\n\n\nELEVEN DAYS \n\n\n \n\nall I did was to interpret some of my reactions to what had \nhappened. It was a letter full of barely suppressed emotion, \nand I learnt subsequently that it pained Gandhiji considerably. \n\nDay after day went by and I waited for the summons to \nprison or some other intimation from Government. From time \nto time I was informed that further directions would be issued \nthe next day or the day after. Meanwhile the doaors were \nasked to send a daily hulletia of my wife\u2019s condition to Govern- \nment. Kamala had slightly improved since my arrival. \n\nIt was generally believed, even by those who are usually in \nthe confidence of the Government, that I would have been Mly \ndischarged but for two impending events\u2014 the full session of \nthe Congress that was taking place in October in Bombay and \nthe Assembly Elections in November. Out of prison I might \nbe a disturbing factor at these, and so it seemed probable that \nI might be sent back to prison for another three months and \nthen discharged. There was also the possibility of my not \nbeing sent back to gaol, and this possibility seemed to grow as \nthe days went by. I almost decided to settle down. \n\nIt was the eleventh day after my release, August ajrd. The \npolice car drove up and the police officer came up to me and \ntold me that my time was up and I had to acconmany him to \nNaini Prison. I hade good-bye to my people. As I was getting \ninto the police car my ailing mother ran up again to me with \narms outstretched. That face of hm haunted me for long.  SOME RECENT HAPPENINGS \n\nDawn reddens in the wake of night, but the days of our life \nreturn not. \n\nThe eye contains a far horizon, but the wound of spring lies \ndeep in the heart. \n\nLi Tai-Po. \n\nI FOLLOWED from the newspapers supplied to me the proceed- \nings of the Bombay session of the Congress. I was naturally \ninterested in its politics and personalities. Twenty years\u2019 in- \ntimate association had tied me up so closely with it that my \nindividuality had almost become merged in it, and far stronger \nthan the claims of office and responsibility were the invisible \nbonds that tied me to that great organisation and to thousands \nof my old comrades. And yet I felt it difficult to get excited \nover its proceedings; in spite of some important decisions the \nwhole session seemed to me a dull affair. The subjects that in- \nterested me were hardly discussed. What would I have done if \nI had been there, I wondered. I did not know for certain; I \ncould not say how I would have reacted to the new conditions \nand my surroundings. And I saw no reason why I should force \nmy mind to come to a difficult decision in prison when such a \ndecision was wholly unnecessary then. The time would come \nwhen I would have to face the problems of the day and decide \non my course of action. It was needless foUy to anticipate that \ndecision, even in the recesses of my mind, for circumstances \nwould change before that choice was forced on me. \n\nThe two outstanding features of the (^n gres s. as fer as I \ncould make out from my distant and secluded abode cn the \nmountains, were; the dominant personality of Gandhiji and \nthe exceedingly poor show that the communal opposition under \nPandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Mr. Aney put up. To all \nwho have knowledge of the inner workings of the Indian mass- \nmind, as well as me middle-class mind, it was no surprise to \nfind that Gandhiji continues to be far and away the master \nfigure in India. Government officials and some secluded \npoliticians often imagine, making the wish the father to the \nthought, that he is pkyed out in the political field or, at least, \nthat his influence has greatly declined. And then when he \n\n \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nemerges again with all his old energy and influence they are \ntaken aback and search for fresh reasons for this apparent \nchange. He dominates the Congress dnd the country not so \nmuch because of any opinions he holds, and which are gener- \nally accepted, but because of his unique personality. Person- \nality counts for much everywhere; in India it plays an even \nmore dominant role than elsewhere. \n\nHis retirement from the Congress was a striking feature of \nthe session and outwardly it marked the end of a great chapter \nin Congress and Indian history. But, essentially, its significance \nwas not great for he cannot rid himself, even if he wanted to, \nof his dominating position. He did not owe that position to \nany office or other tangible tie. The Congress to-day reflects \nalmost as much his view-point as it has ever done before, and \neven if it should wander away from his path, Gandhiji, even \nunconsciously, would continue to influence it and the country \nto a very great extent. He cannot divest himself of that \nburden and responsibility. In considering the objective condi- \ntions prevailing in India his personality forces itself on one\u2019s \nattention and cannot be ignored. \n\nHe has, for the present, retired from the Congress presumably \nto avoid embarrassing the Congress. Perhaps he contemplates \nsome kind of individual direct action which will necessarily \nlead to a conflict with Government. He does not want to make \nthis a Congress issue. \n\nI was glad that the Congress had adopted the idea of a Con \n.tdi tuent As^- mhly for settling the constitution of the country. \nIt seemed to me that there was no other way of solving the \nproblem, and I am sure that sometime or other some such \nAssembly will have to meet. Manifestly it cannot do so without \nthe consent of the British Government, unless there has been \na successful revolution. It is equally manifest that this consent \nis not likely to be forthcoming under present circumstances. A \nreal Assembly can therefore not meet till enough strength has \nbeen evolved in the country to force the pace. This inevitably \nmeans that even the political problem will remain unsolved till \nthen. Some of the Congress leaders, while accepting the idea \nof the Constituent Assembly, have tried to tone it down and \nmade it not very unlike a large All-Parties Conference after the \nold model. This would be an utterly futile proceeding and the \nsame old people, selfchosen mostly, would meet and disagree. \nThe whole idea behind the Constituent Assembly is that \nit should be elected on a veiy wide mass basis, drawing \nIts strength and inspiration from the masses. Such a gather- \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS \n\n\n \n\ning will immediately face real problems, and will not remain \nin the communal and other ruts in which we have so often \nstuck. \n\nIt was interesting to watch the reactions of Simla and London \nto this idea. It was made known semi-officially that Govern- \nment would have no objection; they gave it a patronising ap- \nproval, evidently looking upon it as an old type of All-Parties \nConference, foredoomed to failure, which would strengthen \ntheir hands. Later they seem to have realised the dangers \nand possibilities of the idea, and they began opposing it vigor- \nously. \n\nSoon after the Bombay Congress came the Assembly elections. \nWith all my lack of en&usiasm for the Congress parliamentary \nprogramme, I was greatly interested and I ivished the Congress \ncandidates success, or to put it more correctly, I hoped for the \ndefeat of their opponents. Among these opponents was a curi- \nous assortment of careerists, communalists, renegades, and \npeople who had staunchly supported the Government in its \npolicy of repression. There was little doubt that most of these \npeople would be swept away, but unfortunately the Communal \nAward obscured the issue and many of them took shelter under \nthe widespread wings of the communal organisations. Despite \nthis the Congress met with remarkable success, and I was \npleased that a good number of undesirables had been kept \nout. \n\nThe attitude of the so-called Congress Nationalist Party \nstruck me as particularly deplorable. One could understand \ntheir vehement opposition to the Cnmimmal Award but, in \norder to strengthen their position, they allied themselves with \nthe extreme communal organisations, even the Sanatanists, than \nwhom there is no more reactionary group in India, both politi- \ncally and socially, as well as numerous political reactionaries of \nthe most notorious kind. Except in Bengal, where for special \nreasons a strong Congress group supported them, many of \nthem were largely anti-Congress in every way. Indeed they \nwere the most prominent opponents of the Congress. In spite \nof this varied assortment of forces opposed to it, which included \nlandlords, liberals and, of course, omcials, the Congress candi- \ndates succeeded to a remarkable extent. \n\nThe Congress attitude to the Communal Award was extraor- \ndiniuy, and yet under the circumstances it could hardly have \nbeen very different. It was the inevitable outcome of their past \nneutral and rather feeble policy. A strong line adopted at an \nearlier stage and followed regarmess of immediate consequences \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n ^ \n\nwould have been more dignified and correct. But as the Con- \ngress had been unwilling to take that up there was no other \ncourse open to it except the one it took. The Communal Award \nwas a patent absurdity, and it was impossible of acceptance \nbecause, so long as it existed, any kind of freedom was unat- \ntainable. This was not because it gave too much to the Mus- \nlims. It was perhaps possible to give them, in a different way, \nalmost all they wanted. As it was, the British Government \ndivided up Inma into any number of mutually exclusive com- \npartments, each balancing and neutralising the other, so that \nthe foreign British element could remain supreme. It made \ndependence on the British Government inevitable. \n\nIn Bengal especially, where heavy weightage had been given \nto the small European element, the position was exceedingly \nunfair to the Hindus. Such an award or decision, or whatever \nit might be called (objection has been taken to its being called \nan award), was bound to be bitterly resented, and even though \nit might be imposed, or for political reasons tolerated tem- \nporarily, it is likely to be a continuing source of friction. Per- \nsonally I think that its very badness is a thing in its favour, for \nas such it can never become the permanent basis for anything. \n\nThe Nationalist Party, and even more so the Hindu Maha- \nsabha and other communal organisations, naturally resented \nthis infliction, but their criticism was really based, as that of \nthe supporters, on an acceptance of the British Government\u2019s \nideology. This led them, and is leading them further, to the \nadoption of a strange policy, which must be very pleasing to \nthe Government. Obsessed by the Award, they are toning dovm \ntheir opposition to other vital matters, in the hope of bribing \nor cajoling the Government into varying the Award in their \nfavour. The Hindu Mahasabha has gone farthest in\u2019 this direc- \ntion. It does not seem to strike them that this is not only a \n/humiliating position to take up, but is calculated to make any \nalteration of the Award most difficult, for it merely irritates \nthe Muslims and drives them farther away. It is impossible for \nthe British Government to win over the nationalist elements; \nthe distance is too great and the conflict of interests too \nmarked. It is also impossible for them, on the narrower issue \nof communal interests, to please both the Hindu and the \nMyslim communalists. They had to choose and, from their \npoints of view, they chose rightly in favouring Muslim com- \nmunalism. Are they to upset this well-settled and .profitable \npolicy and offend the Muslims for the sake of winning over \na handful of Hindu comnuin\u2018\u00bbli\u00ab-t*i? \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENtNdS \n\nThe very fact that the Hindus, as a group, are more advanced \npolitically and more clamant for national freedom is bound to \ngo against them. For petty communal concessions (and they \ncannot be other than petty) will not make much difference to \ntheir political hostility; such concessions will however make a \ntemporary difference to the Muslim attitude. \n\nThe Assembly elections threw a revealing light on the people \nat the back of the Hindu Mabasabha and the Muslim Con- \nference \u2014 ^the two most reactionary communal bodies. Their \ncandidates and supporters were drawn from the big landlords \nor the rich banker class. The Mahasabha also showed its soli- \ncitude to the banker class by its. vehement opposition to the \nrecent Relief from Indebtedness Bills. These small sections at \nthe top of the Hindu social strata constitute the Hindu Maha- \nsabha, and a fraction of them, together with some professional \npeople, form the Liberals. They do not carry great weight \namong the Hindus because the lower middle class is politically \nawake. The industrial leaders also stand apart &om them \nbecause there is some clash between the demands of rising \nindustry and the semi-feudal elements. Industrialists, not daring \nto indulge in direct action or other risky methods, try to keep \non good terms with both nationalism and the Government. \nThey do not pay much attention to the liberal or communal \ngroups. Industrial advance and profits are their governing \nmotives. \n\nAmong the Muslims this lower middle-class awakening is \nstill to come, and industrially also they are backward. Thus \nwe find the most hopelessly reactionary and feudal and \nex-official elements not only controlling their communal \norganisations, but exercising considerable influence over the \nco mmuni ty. The Muslim Conference is quite a galaxy of \nknights, ex-ministers and big landlords. And yet I think that \nthe Muslim rank and file has more potentialily in it, perhaps \nbecause of a certain freedom in social relations, than the Hindu \nmasses, and is likely to go ahead faster in a socialist direction, \nonce it gets moving. Just at present the Muslim intelligentsia \nseems to be paralysed, intellectually as well as physically, and \nhas no push in it. It dare not challenge its old guard. \n\nEven the leadership of the Congress, politically the most \nadvanced big group, is flir more cautious than the condition of \nthe masses might necessitate. They ask the masses for support, \nbut seldom them for their opinion or set about enquiring \nwhat ails them. Prior to the Assembly elections they made \nevery effort to tone down their programme in an attempt to win \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARI.AT, NEHRU \n\nover various moderate non-Congress elements. Even their atti- \ntude to such measures as the Temple Entry Bill was varied, and \nassurances were given to soothe the more orthodox in Madras. \nA straightforward, aggressive election programme would have \ncreated more enthusiasm and helped greatly in educating the \nmasses. Now that the Congress has committed itself to a par- \nliamentary programme there will be still more accommodation \nof politically and socially reactionary interests, in the hope of \ngetting a few odd votes in a division, and a greater widening of \nthe breach between the Congress leadership and the masses. \nEloquent speeches will be delivered, and the best pirliamentary \netiquette followed, and from time to time the Government will \nbe defeated \u2014 defeats which the Government will calmly ignore \nas it has previously done. \n\nDuring the past few years, when Congress was boycotting the \nLegislatures, we were often told by official spokesmen that the \nAssembly and the Provincial Councils were truly representative \nof the people and mirrored public opinion. It is interesting to \nfind that now, when more advanced elements dominate the \nAssembly, the official view-point has changed. Whenever a \nreference is made to the Congress success at the elections, we \nare told that the electorate is a very small one, only three \nmillions out of nearly three hundred or thereabouts. The dis- \nfranchised millions apparently, according to official opinion, \nstand solidly behind the British Government. The remedy is \nobvious. Give adult suffrage and then we shall know at least \nwhat these people think. \n\nSoon after the Assembly elections the Report of the Joint \nParliamentary Committee on Indian Constitufional Reform was \nissued. Among the varied and widespread critidsims to which \nit was_ subjected, stress was often laid on tlie fact that it showed \n\u2018 distrust ' and \u2018 suspicion \u2019 of the Indian people. This seemed \nto me a very strange way of looking at our national and sodal \nproblems. Were there no vital conflicts of interests between \nBritish imperial policy and our national interests? The \nquestion was which was to prevail. Did we want freedom \nmerely to continue that imperial policy? Apparently that was \nthe British Government\u2019s notion, for we were informed that \nthe \u2018 safeguards \u2019 would not be used so long as we behaved and \ndemonstrated our fitness for self-rule by doing just what British \npolicy required. If British policy was to be continued in India, \nw]^ all this shouting about getting the reins in our own hands? \n/ Tlte Ottawa agreements, it is well known, have not been of \ngreat benefit to England economically except in regard to \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS  \n\nIndian trade. \u2018 British trade with India has certainly benefited, \nat the cost, according to Indian political and commercial \nopinion, of India\u2019s wider interests. The position is reversed in \nregard to the Dominions, especially Canada and Australia.\u00ae \nThey struck a hard bargain with Britain and got most of the \nadvantages at Britain\u2019s expense. In spite of this fact, continuous \nattempts are being made by them to get away from Ottawa \nand its entanglements in order to develop their own industries \nas well as their trade with other countries.* In Canada a leading \npolitical party, the Liberals, who are likely to be in power before \nlong, are definitely committed to ending the Ottawa pact.\"* In \n\n* \u201cReferring to Indian trade. Sir William Currie said that the \nOttawa agreements had been a definite advantage to Britain.\u2019\u2019 Sir \nWilliam was presiding over the meeting of the P. and O. Shipping \nCompany in London on Dec. , . \n\n* The London Economist (June ipjA says that the Ottawa Con- \nference \" could only have been justified if it had increased the \nvalue of inter-imperial trade without diminishing the value of the \nEmpire\u2019s trade with the rest of the world. In fact, it has merely \nincreased very slightly the proportion that inter-imperial trade \nhears to the dwindling total of the Empire\u2019s trade. And this diver- \nsion has been much more in the interests of the Dominions than \nof Great Britain. Our imports from the Empire increased from \n^,, in  to ;f,ooo,ooo in , but our exports de- \ncreased from  ,, to jCi,joo,odo. And the fact remains \nthat between  and  our exports to the Empire declined by \n\n. per cent., while our imports from the Empire declined only \n\n. per cent. The decline in our exports to foreign countries was \nnot quite so great, but the decline in our imports from these \ncountries was much greater.\u201d \n\n* The Melbourne Age does not like the Ottawa Agreement. In \nits view Ottawa is \u201c acting as a constant irritant and is being in- \ncreasing^ recognised as an egregious blunder.\" (Quoted in Man- \nChester Guardian Weekly, October , .) \n\n* Even Mr. Bennett, the present Conservative Prime Minister \nof Canada, has been a thorn in ihe side of the British Government \nin trade matters. He is talking now in terms of \u2018 New Deals \u2019 and \nrecords a surprising conversion. Owing to the dangerous influence \nof Mr. Litvinov, Sir Stafford Cripps and Mr. John Strachey, he has \nturned collectivist. This should be a sign and a warning to all \nConservatives, Liberals, I.C.S. men, etc., to avoid thinking or asso- \nciating with those who do so, or else they might themselves become \nconverts to dangerous doctrines. (Since writing the above, the \nLiberal Party in Canada, under the leadership of Mr. King, has \nswept the polls and come into power.) \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nAustralia strained interpretations of Ottawa have led to an \nincrease of tariffs on certain classes of piece goods and yarns, \nand this has been bitterly resented by the Lancashire cotton \nindustry and denounced by them as a breach of the Ottawa \nAgreement. As a protest and a reprisal, a movement for the \nboycott of Australian goods was inaugurated in Lancashire. \nThis threat had little effect on Australia, where an aggressive \nattitude was taken up.\u2019 \n\nThe economic conflicts are obviously not due to any ill-will \nthat the people of Canada and Australia may have for Britain, \nthough in Ireland's case that ill-will is apparent. Conflicts \noccur because interests clash, and wherever such clashes might \ntake place, the object of ' safeguards \u2019 in India is to see that \nBritish interests prevail. The recent Indo-British Trade Agree- \nment, arrived at secretly over the heads and despite the protests \nof Indian business and industry, although British industrialists \nwere kept informed, rejected by the Legislative Assembly and \nyet persisted in by the Government, is a gentle indication of \nwhat ' safeguards ' would lead to. Such \u2018 safeguards ' seem to be \nurgently needed in Canada, Australia and South Africa to pre- \nvent the people of those Dominions from going astray not only \nin trade matters but in matters of greater concern to the safety \nand cohesion of the Empire.\u2019* \n\nEmpire, it has been said, is Debt, and the \u2018 safeguards \u2019 have \nbeen devised to enable the imperial moneylender to keep his \nstranglehold on his unfortunate debtor, and to keep all his \n.special interests and powers intact. A curious doctrine, often \n\n\n\u2019 The Melbourne Age declared that if the proposed Lancashire \nboycott is not dropped, Australia must hit harder at whatever \ntrade with Lancashire still remains. Lancashire is to be answered \n\"with unwavering reiteration.\u201d (Quoted in Manchester Guardian \nWeekly, November , .) \n\n\u00ae Mr, O. Pirow, Minister for Defence of the Union of South Africa, \nstated that the Union would not take part in any general scheme of \nImperial Defence, nor would it participate in an overseas war even \nthough Britain might be at war. \"If the Government attempted \nrashly to commit South Africa to participate in another overseas \nwar there would be large-scale disturbances, possibly civil war. \nHence Government would not participate in any general scheme \nof Imperial Defence.\u201d (Reuter message dated Cape Town, February \n> *'), General Hertzog, the Prime Minister, has confirmed this \ndeclaration and stated that it represents the Union Government\u2019s \npolicy. \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS  \n\nrepeated officially, is that Gandhiji and the Congress have \nagreed to the idea of such safeguards because \u2018 safeguards in \nthe interests of India \u2019 were accepted in the Delhi Pact of . \n\nOttawa and the safeguards dealing with trade and commerce \nare after all relatively minor matters/ What is far more im- \nportant is the series of provisions which aim at perpetuating \nevery vital political and economic hold on the Indian people \nwhich has in the past and present helped in the exploitation of \nthe country. So long as these provisions and ' safeguards \u2019 re- \nmain, real progress in any direction is impossible, and there is \nno place left for constitutional attempts at change. Every such \nattempt will come up against the blank wall of the \u2018safe- \nguards \u2019, and make it more and more clear that the only possible \ncourse is not constitutional. From the point of view of political \nchanges this proposed constitution, with its monstrous Federa- \ntion, is an absurdity: it is far worse from the social and eco- \nnomic view-point. The way to socialism is deliberately barred. \nA great deal of responsibility has apparently been transferred \n(but even that largely to \u2018 safe \u2019 classes) but not the power or \nmeans to do anything worth while. Britain retains the power \nwithout the responsibility. There is not even the proverbial \nfig-leaf to cover the nakedness of autocracy. Everybody knows \nthat the essential need in these times is extreme flexibility and \nadaptation in constitutions to meet a rapidly changing situation. \nQuick decisions are necessary, and the power to enforce them. \nEven so it is doubtful if parliamentary democracy, as it func- \ntions in a few of the Western countries to-day, is capable of \nbringing about the changes essential for the proper functioning \nof the modern world. But that question does not arise here, \nfor movement is deliberately checked by chains and fetters, and \na barred and bolted door confronts us. We are provided with \na car, all brakes and no. pngines. It is a constitution designed \nby people whose ever-present background is Martial Law. To \na man of force there is no real alternative to Martial Law \nexcept collapse. \n\nThe measure of liberty that this proposed gift of Britain \noffers to India can be taken from the fact that even the most \nmoderate and politically backward groups in India have \n\n\u2018The London Economist (October ) has pointed out: \"But \nfor the future it appears that among the benefits of British rule the \ndoubtful privilege of buying expensively from Lancashire is to be \nforced upon the 'native' in many corners of the globe.\" Ceylon \nhas been the most flagrant recent example of this. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ncondemned it as reactionary. The habitual and persistent \nsupporters of Government have had to combine criticisms \nof it with their usual genuflections. Others have been more \nvehement. \n\nIn view of these proposals the Liberals found it difficult to \nretain in full measure their abiding faith in the inscrutable \nwisdom of Providence in placing India under British dominion. \nThey offered strong criticism, but disdainful of reality and \nenamoured of phrases and fine \u2018 gestures they laid the greatest \nstress on the absence of the words \u201cDominion Status\u201d from \nthe Report and the Bill. There was a great outcry about this, \nand now that Sir Samuel Hoare has made some kind of a state- \nment on the subject, honour will largely be satisfied. The \nDominion Status may be an insubstantial shadow haunting an \nunknown future \u2014 a Never-Never land which we may never \nreach, but we can dream about it at least and grow eloquent \nover its many beauties. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, troubled per- \nhaps by doubts about the British Parliament and the British \npeople, has sought refuge in the Crown. Eminent lawyer that \nhe is, he has laid down a novel constitutional doctrine : \u201c What- \never the British Parliament and people may or may not do for \nIndia,\u201d he said, \u201c over and above them stood the Crown that \nlooks after the interests of Indian subjects and India\u2019s peace \nand prosperity.\u201d * It is a comforting doctrine which saves us \nfrom troubling ourselves about constitutions, laws, and political \nand social changes. \n\nBut it would be unfair to suggest that the Liberals have \nlessened their opposition to the scheme. Most of them have \nmade it perfectly clear that they prefer present conditions, bad \nas they are, to this imwanted gift that is being thrust on India. \nBejrond stressing that, their very principles forbid them from \ndoing anything, and it may be presumed that they will go on \nlaying stress. For their motto they might well have that \nmodern adaptation of an ancient saying: \" If at first you don\u2019t \nsucceed, cry again! \u201d \n\nA certain hopeful reliance is placed by Liberal leaders, and \nprobably by many others including some\u2019 Congressmen, on the \nvictory of the Labour Party in Britain and the formation of \na Labour Government there. There is absolutely no reason why \nIndia should not endeavour to go ahead with the co-operation \nof advanced groups in Britain, or should not try to profit by \nthe advent of a Labour Government. But to rely helplessly on \n\n\u2019 Speaking at a public meeting at Lucknow on January , . \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS \n\n\n\u00ab \n\na change in fortune\u2019s wheel in England is hardly dignified or \nin consonance with national honour. Dignity apart, it is not \ngood common sense. Why should we expect much from the \nBritish Labour Party? We have had two Labour Governments \nalready, and we are not likely to forget their gifts to India. Mr. \nRamsay MacDonald may have left the Labour ranks, but his \nold colleagues do not seem to have changed much. At the \nSouthport Labour Party Conference held in October , a \nresolution was submitted by Mr. V. K. Krishna Menon \u201cex- \npressing the conviction that it is imperative that the principle \nof self-determination for the establishment of full self-govern- \nment for India should be implemented forthwith.\u201d Mr. Arthur \nHenderson urged the withdrawal of the resolution and, very \nfrankly, refused to give an undertaking on behalf of the \nExecutive to carry out its policy of self-determination for India. \nHe said : \u201c We have laid down very clearly that we are going \nto consult if possible all sections of the Indian people. That \nought to satisfy anybody.\u201d The satisfaction will perhaps be \ntempered by the fact that exactly this was the declared policy \nof the last Labour Government and the National Government, \nresulting in the Round Table Conference, the White Paper, the \nJoint Committee Report, and the India Act. \n\nIt is perfectly dear that in matters of imperial policy there \nis little to choose between Tory or Labour in England. It is \ntrue that the Labour rank and file is far more advanced, but it \nhas little influence on its very conservative leadership. It may \nbe that the Labour Left wing gather strength, for conditions \nchange rapidly nowadays, but do national or social movements \ncurl themselves up and go to sleep, waiting for problematical \nchanges elsewhere? \n\nThere is a curious aspect to this reliance of our Liberals on \nthe British Labour Party. If, by any chance, this Party went \nLeft and gave effect in England to its socialistic programme, \nwhat would be the reactions in India and on the Liberals and \nother Moderate groups here? Most of them are sodally Con- \nservatives of the deepest dye. They will dislike Labour\u2019s social \nand economic changes, and fear their introduction in India. \nIt may even happen that their love of the British connection \nmay undergo a sea-change, when this connection becomes a \nsymbol of social upsets. It may also happen then that persons \nlike me, who want national independence and severance of that \nconnection, may change their minds and prefer close association \nwith a socialist Britain. None of us surely has any objection \nto co-operating with the British people; it is their imperialism \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nthat we object to, and once they have shed this, the way to \nco-operation will he open. Wliat of the Moderates then? Prob- \nably they will accept the new order as another indication of \nthe inscrutable wisdom of Providence. \n\nOne of the notable consequences of the Round Table Con- \nference and the proposal to have a Federation, is to push the \nIndian Princes very much to the forefront. The solicitude of \nthe Tory die-hards for them and their \u2018 independence \u2019 has put \nnew life into them. Never before have they had so much im- \nportance thrust on them. Previously they dared not say no to \na hint from the British Resident, and the Government of \nIndia\u2019s attitude to the numerous highnesses was openly dis- \ndainful. There was continual interference in their internal \naffairs, and often this was justified. Even to-day a large number \nof the States are directly or indirectly being governed by British \nofficers \u2018lent\u2019 to the States. But Mr. Churchill\u2019s and Lord \nRothermere\u2019s campaign seems to have unnerved the Govern- \nment of India a little, and it has CTOwn cautious about inter- \nfering with their decisions. The Princes also now talk in a \nmuch more superior way. \n\nI have tried to follow these superficial developments in the \nIndian political scene, but I cannot help feeling that they are \nunreal, and the background in India oppresses me. The back- \nground is one of continual repression of every kind of free- \ndom, of enormous suffering and frustration, of distortion of \ngoodwill, and encouragement of many evil tendencies. Large \nnumbers lie in prison and spend their young lives, year after \nyear, eating their hearts out.* Their families and friends and \nconnections and thousands of others grow bitter, and a \nnauseating sense of humiliation and powerlessness before brute \nstrength takes possession of them. Numerous organisations are \noutlawed even in normal times, and \u2018 Emergency Powers \u2019 and \n'Tranquillity Acts\u2019 make for themselves almost a permanent \n\n* Sir Han-y Haig, Home Member, stated in the Legislative As- \nsembly on July , , that the total number of detenus in \n-gaols and special camps were: in Bengal,  to ioo; in Deoli \ncamp, . Total, aooo to aioo. This is the figure for detenus; that \nis, untried and unconvicted prisoners. It does not include political \nconvicts. In the case of convicts sentences are usually very heavy. \nIn a recent Calcutta case the Associated Press (Dec. , ) states \nthat the High Court gave a sentence of nine years\u2019 rigorous im- \nprisonment, the offence being the unlicensed possession of arms \nand ammunition. The accused had been arrested with a revolver \nand six cartridges. \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS  \n\nhome in the Government\u2019s armoury. Exceptions in the matter \nof restrictions of liberties rapidly becomes the general rule. Large \nnumbers of books and periodicals are proscribed or prevented \nentry by a \u2018 Sea Customs Act and the possession of ' danger- \nous ' literature may lead to a long term of imprisonment. A \nfrank expression of opinion on the political or economic prob- \nlems of the day, or a favourable report of social and cultural \nconditions in Russia meets with the strong disapproval of the \ncensor. The Modem Review was warned by the Bengal Govern- \nment because it published an article by Dr. Rabindra Nath \nTagore on Russia, an article written after a personal visit to that \ncountry. We are informed by the Under-Secretary for India in \nParliament that \u201cthe article gave a distorted view of the \nachievements of British rule in India,\u201d and hence action was \ntaken against it.* The judge of these achievements is the \ncensor, and we may not have a contrary opinion or give ex- \npression to it. Objection was also taken by Government to the \npublication of a brief message from Rabindra Nath Tagore to \nthe Dublin Society of Friends. If a sage like Tagore, interested \nin cultural matters and deliberately keeping aloof from politics, \nrevered in India and world famous, is suppressed in this way, \nwhat of humble folkj; Worse even than the actual instances of \nsuppression' is the atmosphere of fear they create- It is not \npossible to have honest journalism under these circumstances, \nor a proper consideration or teaching of history, economics, \npolitics or current affairs. This is a strange background for the \nintroduction of reforms and responsible government and the \nlike. \n\nEvery intelligent person knows that the world is in a state of \nintellectual turmoil to-day, and that there is a vague or acutely- \n\n* November , . \n\n* On September , , an official statement was made in \nthe Legislative Assembly regarding the working of the Press laws \nin India. It was stated that from  onwards  newspapers had \nbeen affected by Government demands for securities and by con- \nfiscations. Of these,  newspapers stopped publication because \nthey could not give further securities;  newspapers gave securi- \nties amounting to Rs. ,. \n\nRecently (in the latter hdf of ) a number of laws suppressing \ndvil liberties have again been enacted for a further long period. \nThe prindpal one\u2014 The Criminal Law Amendment Act\u2014 applies \nto the whole of India. It was thrown out by the Legislative As- \nsembly and later certified by the Governor-General. Many pro- \nvinces have also passed such laws. \n\n\n\n JAWAHAKLAL NEHRU \n\nfelt, but in any case a tremendous, dissatisfaction with existing \nconditions. Far-reaching changes are taking place before our \neyes, and the future, whatever shape it might take, is not a \nremote, far-off thing which arouses a purely academic interest \nin the detached minds of philosophers, sociologists and econo- \nmists. It is a matter which affects every human being for better \nor for worse, and surely it is every citizen\u2019s duty to try to under- \nstand the various forces at play and decide on his own course \nof action. A world is coming to an end, and a new world is \ntaking shape. To find an answer to a problem it is necessary \nto know what it is. Indeed it is as important to know the \nproblem as to seek a solution for it. \n\nUnhappily there is an astonishing ignorance or indifference \nto world happenings among our politicians. Probably this \nignorance extends to the great majority of the official element \nin India, for the Civil Service lives happily and complacently in \na narrow world of its own. Only the topmost of our officials \nhave to consider these problems. The British Government of \ncourse has to keep world events in view and to develop its policy \naccordingly. It is common knowledge that British foreign \npolicy has been considerably influenced by the possession and \n\n rocection of India. How many Indian politicians consider that \napanese imperialism, or the growing strength of the Soviet \nUnion, or the Anglo-Russo-Japanese intrigues in Sinkiang, or \nthe events in Central Asia or Afghanistan or Persia, have an \nintimate bearing on Indian politics? The Central Asian situa- \ntion obviously affects the position of Kashmir and makes it a \npivot of British policy and defence. \n\nEven more important are the economic changes that are \nrapidly taking place the world over. We must realise that the \nnineteenth-century system has passed away, and has no appli- \ncation to present-day needs. The lawyer\u2019s view, so prevalent in \nIndia, of proceeding from precedent to precedent is of little \nuse when there are no precedents. We cannot put a bullock- \ncart on rails and call it a railway train. It has to give way and \nbe scrapped as obsolescent material. Even apart ftom Russia, \nthere is talk of New Deals and vast changes. President Roose- \nvelt, with every desire to retain and strengthen the capitalist \nsystem, has with great courage inaugurated enormous schemes \nwhich may change American life. He talks of \u201c weeding out \nthe over-privileged and effectively lifting, up the under-privi- \nleged \u201d. He may or may not succeed, but the courage of the \nman and his desire to pull his country out of the ruts are \nundeniable. He is not afraid of changing his policy or of \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS  \n\nadmitting mistakes. In England Mr. Lloyd George has come \nout with his \u2018 New Deal \u2019. We want many New Deals in India \ntoo. The old assumption that \u201c whatever is worth knowing is \nalready known, and whatever is worth doing has already been \ndone,\u201d is perilous nonsense. \n\nWe have to face many questions, and we must face them \nboldly. Has the present social or economic system a right to \nexist if it is unable to improve greatly the condition of the \nmasses? Does any other system give promise of this wide- \nspread betterment? How far will a mere political change bring \nradical improvement? If vested interests come in the way of \nan eminently desirable change, is it wise or moral to attempt \nto preserve them at the cost of mass misery and poverty? \nSurely the object is not to injure vested interests, but to prevent \nthem from injuring others. If it was possible to come to terms \nwith these vested interests, it would be most desirable to do so. \nPeople may disagree with the justice or injustice of this, but \nfew will doubt the expediency of a settlement. Such a settlement \nobviously cannot be the removal of one vested interest by \nthe creation of another. Whenever possible and desirable, \nreasonable compensation might be given, for a conflict is likely \nto cost far more. But, unhappily, all history shows that vested \ninterests do not accept such compromises. Classes that have \nceased to play a vital part in society are singularly lacking \nin wisdom. They gamble for all or nothing, and so they fade \naway. \n\nThere is a great deal of ' loose talk \u2019 (as the Congress Working \nCommittee put it) about confiscation and the like. Confiscation, \npersistent and continual, is the basis of the existing system, and \nit is to put an end to this that social changes are proposed. \nThere is the daily confiscation of part of the labour product of \nthe worker; 'a peasant\u2019s holding is ultimately confiscated by \nraising his rent or revenue to such an extent that he cannot \npay it. Formerly common lands were confiscated by individuals \nand made into big estates; peasant proprietors were also wiped \nout in this way. Confiscation is the basis and life-breath of the \npresent system. \n\nTo remedy this partly, society tries various expedients which \nare themselves of the nature of confiscation \u2014 ^heavy taxes, \ndeath-duties, laws for the relief firom indebtedness, inflation, etc. \nRecently we have seen national repudiation of debt on an enor- \nmous scale, not only by the Soviet Union but by leading \ncapitalist countries; the most notable instance of this being the \nBritish repudiation of their debt to the United States\u2014 a \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ndangerous example to place before India! But all these con- \nfiscations and repudiations help only to a minor extent, and do \nnot get rid of 'the basic cause. To build anew, that root cause \nhas to be removed. \n\nIn considering a method for changing the existing order we \nhave to weigh the costs of it in material as well as spiritual \nterms. We cannot afford to be too shortsighted. We have to \nsee how far it helps ultimately in the development of human \nhappiness and human progress, material and spiritual. But we \nhave always to bear in mind the terrible costs of not changing \nthe existing order, of carrying on as we do to-day with our \nenormous burden of frustrated and distorted lives, starvation \nand misery, and spiritual and moral degradation. Like an \never-recurring flood this present economic system is continually \noverwhelming and carrying away to destruction vast numbers \nof human beings. We cannot check the flood or save these \npeople by some of us carrying water away in a bucket. Em- \nbankments have to be built and canals, and the destructive \npower of the waters has to be converted and used for human \nbetterment. \n\nIt is obvious that the vast changes that socialism envisages \ncannot be brought about by the sudden passing of a few laws. \nBut the basic laws and power are necessary to give the direction \nof advance and to lay the foundation of the structure. If the \ngreat building-up of a socialised society is to proceed, it cannot \nbe left to chance nor can it be done in fits and starts with \nintervals of destruction of what has been built. The major \nobstructions have thus to be removed. The object is not to \ndeprive, but to provide; to change the present scarcity to future \nabundance. But in doing so the path must necessarily be \ncleared of impediments and selfish interests which want to hold \nsociety back. And the path we take is not merely a question of \nwhat we like or dislike or even of abstract justice, but what is \neconomically sound, capable of progress and adaptation to \nchanging conditions, and likely to do good to the largest num- \nber of \u2018human beings. \n\nA clash of interests \u25a0seems inevitable. There is no middle path. \nEach one of us will have to choose our side. Before we can \nchoose, we must know and understand. The emotional appeal \nof socialism is not enough. Thia.must be supplemented by an \nintellectual and reasoned appeal based on facts and arguments \nand detailed criticism. In the West a great deal of this kind \nof literature exists, hut in India there is a tremendous lack of \nit, and many good books are not \u2018allowed entry here. But to \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS  \n\nread books from other countries is not enough. If socialism is \nto be built up in India it will have to grow out of Indian con- \nditions, and the closest study of these conditions is essential. \nWe want experts in the job who study, and prepare detailed \nplans. Unfortunately our experts arc mostly in Government \nservice or in the semi-official universities, and they dare not go \nfar in this direction. \n\nAn intellectual background is not enough to bring socialism. \nOther forces are necessary. But I do feel that without that \nbackground we can never have a grip of the subject or create \na powerful movement. At the present moment the agrarian \nproblem is far the most important in India, and it is likely to \nremain so. _ But industry is of little less importance, and it \ngrows. What is our objective : a peasant State or an industrial \none? Of course we are bound to remain predominantly agri- \ncultural, but one can and, I think, must push on industry. \n\nOur captains of industry are quite amazingly backward in \ntheir ideas; they are not even up-to-date capitalists. The masses \nare so poor that they do not look upon them as potential con- \nsumers, and fight bitterly against any proposal to increase wages \nor lower hours of work. Recently hours of work have been \nreduced from ten to nine in the cotton mills. This has led the \nAhmedabad mill-owners to reduce the wages of labour, even \npiece-work labour. Thus the reduction of hours of work has \nmeant a lower income and a yet lower standard for the poor \nworker. Rationalisation, however, proceeds apace, increasing the \npressure on the worker and his fiitigue, without any propor- \ntionate increase in wages. The whole outlook of the industry is \nan early nineteenth-century one. They make stupendous profits \nwhen they have the chance and the worker continues as before; \nif there is a slump the owners complain that they cannot carry \non without reducing wages. Not only have they the help of the \nState, but also usually the sympathy of our middle-class \npoliticians. And yet the lot of the cotton worker in Ahmedabad \nis better than that of a similar worker in Bombay and else- \nwhere. The cotton workers, on the whole, arc better off than \nthe jute workers of Bengal and the miners. The workers of the \nsmall disorganised industries are lowest in the industrial scale. \nTo compare the magnificent palaces of the jute millionaires and \nthe cotton lords, with their ostentatious display of pomp and \nluxury, with the wretched hovels where their semi-naked \nworkers live, should be an education of the most impressive \nkind. But we take these contrasts for granted and pass them by, \nnnaflFected and unimpressed. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nBad as is the lot of the Indian industrial worker, it is, from \nthe income point of view, far better than the peasant\u2019s lot. The \npeasant has one advantage ; he lives in fresh air and escapes the \ndegradation of the slums. But so low has he sunk that he often \nconverts even his open-air village into a \u2018 dung-heap \u2019, as Gand- \nhiji has called it. There is no sense of co-operation in him or \nof joint effort for the good of the community. It is easy to \ncondemn him for this, hut what is the unhappy creature to do \nwhen life presents itself to him as a bitter and unceasing indi- \nvidual struggle with every man\u2019s hand raised against him? How \nhe lives at all is an almost incredible wonder. It has been found \nthat the average daily income of typical farmers in the Punjab \nwas about nine annas (roughly ninepence) per head in -. \nThis fell in - to nine pies (three farthings) per head! \nThe Punjab peasant is considered to be far more prosperous \nthan the peasantry of the U.P. Behar and Bengal. In some of \nthe eastern districts of the U.P. (Gorakhpur, etc.) in prosperous \ntimes before the slump, the daily field wage was two annas (two- \npence). To talk of improving these staggering conditions by \nphilanthropy or local efforts in rural uplift is a mockery of the \npeasant and his misery. \n\nHow are we to get out of this qupgmire? Means can no doubt \nbe devised, although it is a difficult task to raise masses of \npeople who have sunk so low. But the real difficulty comes from \ninterested groups who oppose change, and under imperialist \ndomination the change seems to be out of the question. In \nwhat direction will India look in the coming years? Com- \nmunism and fascism seem to be the major tendencies of the \nage, and intermediate tendencies and vacillating groups are \ngradually being eliminated. Sir Malcolm Hailey has prophesied \nthat India will take to National Socialism, that is, some form of \nfascism. Perhaps he is right so far as the near future is con- \ncerned. There are already clearly marked fascist tendencies in \nIndia\u2019s young men and women, especially in Bengal, but to \nsome extent in every province, and the Congress is beginning \nto reflect them. Because of fascism\u2019s close connection with \nextreme forms of violence, the elders of the Congress, wedded \nas they are to non-violence, have a natural horror of it. But the \nso-caUed philosophical background of fascism \u2014 the Corporate \nState with private property preserved and vested interests curbed \nbut not done away -with\u2014 will probably appeal to them. It \nseems to be at first sight a golden way of reta inin g the old and \nyet having the new. Whether it is possible both to have the \ncake and eat it is another matter. \n\n\n\nROME RECENT HAPPENINGS \n\n\nJI \n\nBut the real drive towards fascism will naturally come from \nthe younger members of the middle class. Actually, at present, \nit is part of the middle class in India that is revolutionary, not \nso much the workers or the peasantry, though no doubt the \nindustrial workers are potentially more so. This nationalist \nmiddle class is a favourable field for the spread of fascist ideas. \nBut fascism cannot spread here in the European sense so long \nas there is a foreim government. Indian fascism must neces- \nsarily stand for Indian independence, and cannot therefore ally \nitself with British imperialism. It will have to seek support \nfrom the masses. If British control were wholly removed, \nfascism would probably grow rapidly, supported as it would \ncertainly be by the upper middle class and the vested interests. \n\nBut British control is not likely to go soon, and meanwhile \nsocialistic and communistic ideas are also spreading in spite of \nsevere repression by the British Government. The Communist \nParty is illegal in India, and the term is interpreted in 'a loose \nway to include even sympathisers and labour unions with \nadvanced programmes. \n\nAs between fascism and communism my sympathies are \nentirely with communism. As these pages will show, I am very \nfar from being a communist. My roots are still perhaps partly \nin the nineteenth century, and I have been too much influenced \nbj^'the humanist liberal tradition to get out of it completely. \nThis bourgeois background follows me about and is naturally a \nsource of irritation to many communists. I dislike dogmatism, \nand the treatment of Karl Marx\u2019s writings or any other books \nas revealed scripture which cannot be ch^lenged, and the regi- \nmentation and heresy hunts which seem to be a feature of \nmodem communism. I dislike also much that has happened in \nRussia, and especially the excessive use of violence in normal \ntimes. But still I incline more and more towards a communist \nphilosophy. \n\nMarx may be wrong in some of his statements, or his theory \nof \u2018yalue; this I am not competent to judge. But he seems to \nme to. have possessed quite an extraordinary degree of insight \n'in^jylocial phenomena, and this insight was apparently due to \npHe scientific method he adopted. This method, applied to past \nhistory as well as current events, helps us in understanding \nthem far more than any other method of approach, and it is \nbecause of this that the most revealing and keen analysis of the \nchanges that are taking place in the world to-day come fi:om \nMarxist writers. It is easy to point out that Marx ignored or \nunderrated certain subsequent tendencies, like the rise of a revo- \n\n\n\n JAWAHABLAL NEHRU \n\nlutionary element in the middle class, which is so notable to- \nday. But the whole value of Marxism seems to me to lie in its \nabsence of dogmatism, in its stress on a certain outlook and \nmode of approach, and in its attitude to action. That outlook \nhelps us in understanding the social phenomena of our own \ntimes, and points out the way of action and escape. \n\nEven that method of action was no fixed and unchangeable \nroad, but had to be suited to circumstances. That, at any rate, \nwas Lenin's view, and he justified it brilliantly by fitting his \naction to changing circumstances. He tells us that: \u201cTo at- \ntempt to answer ' yes \u2019 or \u2018 no \u2019 to the question of the definite \nmeans of struggle, without examining in detail the concrete \nsituation of a given moment at a given stage of its develop- \nment, means to depart altogether from the Marxian ground.\u201d \nAnd again he said ; \u201c Nothing is final; we must always learn \nfrom circumstances.\u201d \n\nBecause of this wide and comprehensive outlook, the real \nunderstanding communist develops to some extent an organic \nsense of social life. Politics for him cease to be a mere record of \nopportunism or a groping in the dark. The ideals and objectives \nhe works for give a meaning to the struggle and to the sacrifices \nhe willing^ faces. He feels that he is part of a grand army \nmarching forward to realise human fate and destiny, and he has \nthe sense of ' marching step by step with history \u2019. \n\nProbably most communists are far from reeling all this. \nPerhaps only a Lenin had this organic sense of life in its fullness \nwhich made his action so effective. But to a small extent every \ncommunist, who has understood the philosophy of his move- \nment, has it. \n\nIt is difficult to be patient with many communists; they have \ndeveloped a peculiar method of irritating others. But they are \na sorely tried people and, outside the Soviet Union, they have to \ncontend against enormous difficulties. I have always admired \ntheir great courage and capacity for sacrifice. 'They suffer \ngreatly, as unhappily untold millions suffer in various ways, but \nnot blindly before a malign and all-powerful fate. They suffer \nas human beings, and there is a tragic nobility about such \nsuffering. \n\nThe success or failure of the Russian social experiments do \nnot directly affect the validity of the Marxian theory. It is con- \nceivable, though it is highly unlikely, that a set of untoward \ncircumstances or a combination of powers mighf upset those \nexperiments! But the value of those mighty social upheavals \nwill still remain. \"With all my instinctive dislike for much that \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS  \n\nhas happened there, I feel that they offer the greatest hope to \nthe world. I do not know enough and I am not in a position to \njudge their actions. My chief fear is that the background of \ntoo much violence and suppression might bring an evil trail \nbehind them which it may be difhcult to get nd of. But the \ngreatest thing in favour of the present directors of Russia\u2019s \ndestiny is that they are not afraid to learn from their mistakes. \nThey can retrace their steps and build anew. And always they \nkeep their ideal before them. Their activities in other countries, \nthrough the Communist International, have been singularly \nfutile, but apparently those activities have been reduced to a \nminimum now. \n\nComing back to India, communism and socialism seem a far \ncry, unless the rush of external events force the pace here. We \nhave to deal not with communism but, with the addition of an \nextra syllable, with communalism. And communally India is in \na dark age. Men of action waste their energies on trivial thin gs \nand intngue and manoeuvre and try to overreach each other. \nFew of them are interested in tr  dng to make the world a better, \nbrighter place. Perhaps this is a temporary phase that will pass \nsoon. \n\nThe Congress has at least largely kept out of this communal \ndarkness, but its outlook is petty oourgeois, and the remedy it \nseeks for this as for other problems is in terms of the petty \nbourgeoisie. It is not likely so succeed that way. It represents to- \nday this lower middle-class, fr>r that is the most voceu and revo- \nlutionary at present. But it is nevertheless not as vital as it \nappears to be. It is pressed on either side by two forces\u2014 one \nentrenched, the other still weak but growing rapidly. It is pass- \ning through a crisis of its existence at present; what wiU happen \nto it in the future it is difficult to say. It cannot go over to thfe \nside of the entrenched forces before it has fulfilled its historic \nmission of attaining national freedom. But before it succeeds \nin that, other forces may grow powerful and influence it in their \ndirection, or gradually msplace it. It seems likely, however, that \nso long as a large measure of national freedom is not obtained, \nthe Congress wl play a dominant rfile in India. \n\nAny violent activity seems to be out of the question, injurious \nand waste of effort. That, I think, is generally recognised in \nIndia, in spite of rare instances of futile and sporadic violence. \nThat way cannot lead us anywhere except into a hopeless maze \nof violence and counter-violence out of which it will be difficult \nto emerge. \n\nWe are often told that we must unite among ourselves and \n\nQO \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\npresent a \u2018united front\u2019. Mrs. Sarojini Naidu pleads for it \neloquently with all her poetic ardour. She is a poet and entitled \nto lay stress on the beauty of harmony and concord. Obviously \na \u2018 unjted front \u2019 is always desirable, provided it is a front. An \nanalysis of this phrase leads one to the conclusion that what is \naimed at is a pact or compromise between various individuals at \nthe top. Such a combination will necessarily mean that the \nmost cautious and moderate will determine the objective and \nlay down the pace. As some of them are well known to dislike \nall movement, the result will be a united standstill. Instead of \na united front there will be a united and extensive display of \nback. \n\nIt is, of course, absurd to say that we will not co-operate with \nor compromise with others. Life and politics are much too \ncomplex for us always to think in straight lines. Even the \nimplacable Lenin said that \u201cto march forward without com- \npromise, without turning frona the path\u201d was \"intellectual \nchildishness and not the serious tactics of a revolutionary \nclass.\u201d Compromises there are boimd to be, and we should not \nworry too much about them. But whether we compromise or \nrefuse to do so, what matters is that primary things should \ncome first always and secondary things should never take pre- \ncedence over them. If we are dear about our principles and \nobjectives, temporary compromises will not harm. But danger \nlies in our slurrini; oyer those prin^les and objectives for fear \nof offending our weaker brethren. To mislead is far worse than \nto ofrend. \n\nI write vaguely and somewhat academically about current \nevents, and try to play the part of a detached onlooker. I am \nnot usually considered a looker-on when action beckons; my \noffence, I am often told, is that I rush in foolishly without \nsufficient provocation. VS^at would I do now? What would I \nsuggest to my countrymen to do? Perhaps the instinctive \ncaution of a person who dabbles in public affairs comes in the \nway of my committing myself prematurely. But, if I may \nconfess the truth, I really do not know and I do not try to \nfind out. When I cannot act, why should I worry? I do worry \nto a large extent, but that is inevitable. At least, so long as \nI am in prison, I try to save myself from coming to grips with \nthe problem of immediate action. \n\nAll activity seems to be far away in prison. One becomes the \nobject of events, not the subject of action. And one waits and \nwaits for something to happen. I write of political and social \nproblems of India and the world, but what are they to this \n\n\n\nSOME RECENT HAPPENINGS J \n\nlittle self-contained world of gaol which has long been my \nhome? Prisoners have only one major interest: the date of \ntheir release. \n\nIn Naini Prison and here in Almora many prisoners have \ncome to me to enquire anxiomly about the jugli. I could not \nat first make out what it was, but then I discovered that the \nword was jubilee. They were referring to the rumours of \nKing George\u2019s Silver Jubilee celebrations, but they did not \nknow this. For them past associations had invested the word \nwith one meaning only : it was a partial gaol delivery or a \nsubstantial reduction of sentences. Every prisoner, and especi- \nally the long-term ones, are therefore interested in the coming \njugli. For them the jugli is far more important than constitu- \ntional reforms and Acts of Parliament and Socialism and \nCommunism.  PARADOXES \n\nPeople who do not know Gandhiji personally and have only \nread his writings are apt to think that he is a priestly type, \nextremely puritanical, long-feced, Calvinistic, and a kill-joy, \nsomething like the \u201c priests in black gowns walking their \nrounds.\u201d But his writings do him an injustice ; he is far greater \nthan what he writes, and it is not quite fair to quote what he \nhas written and criticise it. He is the very opposite of the \nCalvinistic priestly type. His smile is delightful, his laughter \ninfectious, and he radiates light-hcartedness. There is some- \nthing childlike about him which is full of charm. When he \nenters a room he brings a breath of fresh air with him which \nlightens the atmosphere. \n\nHe is an extraordinary paradox.  suppose all outstanding \nmen are so to some extent. For years I have puzzled over this \nproblem : why with all his love and solicitude for the underdog \nhe yet supports a system which inevitably produces it and \ncrushes it; why with all his passion for non-violence he is in \nfayour of a political ^nd social stnlcture which is wholly, based \non violence and coercion? Perhaps it is not correct to say that \nhe IS in favour of such a system; he is more or less of * a philo- \nsophical anarchist. But as the ideal anarchist state is too far \noff stiH and cannot easily be conceived, he accepts the present \norder. It is not I think a question of means, that he objects, as \nhe does, to the use of violence in bringing about a change. Quite \napart from the methods to be adopted for changing the existing \norder, an ideal objective can be envisaged, something that is \npossible of achievement in the not distant future. \n\nSometimes he calls himself a socialist, but he uses the word \nin a sense peculiar to himself which has little or nothing to do \nwith the economic framework of society which usually goes \nby the name of socialism. Following his lead a number of \nprominent Congressmen have taken to the use of that word, \nmeaning thereby a kind of muddled humanitarianism. They err \nin distinguished company in the use of this vague political ter- \nminology, for they are but following the example of the Prime \nMinister of the British National Government.* I know that \n\n* Mr., Ramsay MacDonald in the course of his message to the \nFederation of Conservative and Unionist Associations at Edinburgh \n\n\n\ni jawaharlal nehru \n\nGandhiji is not ignorant of the subject, for he has read many \nbooks on economics and socialisni and even Marxism, and has \ndiscussed it with others. But I am becoming more and more \nconvinced that in vital matters the mind by itself does not \ncarry us far. \u201c If your heart does not want to,\u201d said William \nJames, \u201cyour head will assuredly never make you believe.\u201d \nThe emotions govern the general outlook and control the mind. \nOur conversations, whether they are religious, political or \neconomic, arc really based on emotion or instinct. As Schopen- \nhauer has said : \u201c Man can do what he wills, but he cannot will \nwhat he will will.\u201d \n\nGandhiji underwent a tremendous conversion during his early \ndays in South Africa, and this shook him up greatly and altered \nhis whole outlook on life. Since then he has had a fixed basis \nfor all his ideas, and his mind is hardly an open mind. He \nlistens with the greatest patience and attention to people who \nmake new suggestions to him, but behind all his courteous \ninterest one has the impression that one is addressing a closed \ndoor. He is so firmly anchored to some ideas that everything \nelse seems unimportant. To insist on other and secondary \nmatters would be a distraction and a distortion of the larger \nscheme. To hold on to that anchor would necessarily result in \n^proper adjustment of these other matters. If the means are \n\u2022'ri^t, the end is bound to be right. \n\n^That, I think, is the main background of his thought. He \nsuspects also socialism, and more particularly Marxism, because \nof their association with violence. The very words \u2018 class war \u2019 \nbreathe conflict and violence and arc thus repugnant to him. \nHe has also no desire to raise the standards of the masses \nbeyond a certain very modest competence, for higlier standards \nand leisure may lead 'to selfiindulgehce and sin. It is bad \nenough that the handful of the well-to-do are self-indulgent, it \nwould be much worse if their, numbers were added , to. \u2018 Some \nsuch inference can be drawn from a letter he wrote in . \nThis was in answer to a letter that came to him from England \nduring the great coal lock-out or strike. His correspondent was \nadvancing the argument that the miners will be beaten in the \nstruggle because there are too many of them and thdy should \ntherefore use contraceptives and limit their numbers. In the \ncourse of his reply Gandhiji said ; \u201c Lastly, if the mine-owners \n\nin January  said: \u2018\"ITie difficulties of the times make integra- \ntion and concentration essential for every people. This is the true \nSocialism, as it is also the true NationaUsm \u2014 and, for that matter, \nthe true Tndividti-li'rn \" \n\n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n \n\nare in the wrong and still win, they will do so not because the \nminers overbreed, but because the miners have not learnt the \nlesson of restraint all along the line. If the miners had no \nchildren, they would have no incentive for any betterment and \nno provable cause for a rise in wages. Need they drink, gamble, \nsmoke? Will it be any answer to say that mine-owners do \nall these things and yet have the upper hand? If the miners \ndo not claim to be better than the capitalist, what right have \nthey to ask for the world\u2019s sympathy? Is it to multiply capi- \ntalists and strengthen capitalism? We are called upon to pay \nhomage to democracy under a.promise of a better world when \nit reigns supreme. Let us not reproduce on a vast scale the \nevils we choose to ascribe to capitalist and capitalism.\u201d \u2018 \n\nAs I read this, the starved and pinched faces of the English \nminers and their wives and children came before me, as I had \nseen them in that summer of , struggling helplessly and \npitifully against the monstrous system that crushed them. \nGandhiji\u2019s facts are not quite correct, for the miners were not \nasking for a rise in wages; they were fighting against a reduc- \ntion and had been locked out. But this need not concern us \nnow. Nor need the question of the use of contraceptives by \nminers concern us, although it was a somewhat remarkable \nsuggestion for the solution of industrial conflicts. I have \nquoted from Gandhiji's reply to help in the understanding of \nhis outlook on labour matters and the usual demand for a rise \nin the workers\u2019 standard of living. That outlook is as far \nremoved from the socialistic, or for the matter of that the \ncapitalistic, as anything can Iw. To say that science and indus- \ntrial technique to-day can demonstrably feed, clothe and house \neverybody and raise their standards of living very greatly, if \nvested interests did not intervene, does not interest him much, \nfor he is not keen on those results, beyond a certain limit. The \npromise of socialism therefore holds no attraction for him, and \ncapitalism is only partly tolerable because it circumscribes the \nevil. He dislikes both, but puts up with the latter for the pre- \nsent as a lesser evil and as something which exists and of which \nhe has to take cognizance. \n\nI may be wrong perhaps in imputing these ideas to him, but \nI do feel that he tends to diink in this manner, and the para- \ndoxes and confusions in his utterances that trouble us are really \ndue to entirely different premises from which he starts. He does \nnot want people to make an ideal of over-increasing comfort \n\n* This letter is quoted in Self-Restraint vs. Self-Indulgence, by \nM riandbi \n\n\n\nJl JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nand leisure, but to think of the moral life, give up their bad \nhabits, to indulge themselves less and less, and thus to develop \nthemselves individually and spiritually. And those who wish to \nserve the masses have not so much to raise them materially as \nto go down themselves to their level and mix with them on \nequal terms. In so doing inevitably they will help in raising \nthem somewhat. That, according to him, is true democracy. \n\u201cMany have despaired of resisting me,\u201d he writes in a state- \nment he issued on th September, . \u201c This is a humiliating \nrevelation to me, a born democrat. I make that claim, if com- \n\nS dete identification with the poorest of mankind, longing to \nive no better than they, and a corresponding conscious elfort \nto approach that level to the best of one\u2019s ability, can entitle \none to make it.\u201d \n\nWith this argument and outlook probably no modern demo- \ncrat, capitalist, or socialist, will agree, except in so far as it is \nindecent and improper to cut ourselves off from the masses \nand flaunt our luxury and far higher standards in the faces of \nthe vast majority of those who lack the barest necessities. But \na man with the old religious outlook may find some agreement, \nfor both are emotionally tied up with tne past and are always \nthinking in terms of that past. They think more of what has \nbeen that of what is or what is going to be. There is all the \ndifference in the world between the psychological urge to the \npast and to the future. In the old world it was difficult to \nthink of raising the general material level of the masses. The \npoor were always with us. The handful of rich men were then \nan essential part of the social febric, they were necessary to the \nproductive system. And so the moralist, the reformer, and the \nsensitive man, accepted them, but at the same time tried to \nimpress them with their obligations to their needy brethren. \nThey were to be the trustees of the poor. They were to be \ncharitable. And charity became one of the major virtues \nordained by religion. Gandhiji is always laying stress on this \nidea of trusteeship of the feudal prince, of the big landlord, of \nthe capitalist. He follows a long succession of men of religion. \nThe Fope has declared that \u2018^the rich must consider them- \nselves the servants of the Almighty as well as the guardians \nand the distributors of his wealth, to whom Jesus Christ him- \nself entrusted the fate of the poor.\u201d Popular Hinduism and \nIslam repeat this idea and are al'tmys camng upon the rich to \nbe charitable, and they respond by building temples or mosques \nor dharamshalas, or giving, out of their abundance, coppers or \nsilver to the poor and feeling very virtuous in .consequence. \n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n* \n\nA striking passage illustrating this old-world religious attitude \noccurs in the famous Encyclical Rerum Novarum of Pope Leo \nXIII issued in May . Continuing his argument dealing \nwith the new industrial conditions, he says : \n\n\" To suffer and to endure, therefore, is the lot of humanity: \nlet men try as they may, no strength and no artifice will ever \nsucceed in banishing from human life the ills and troubles \nwhich beset it. If any there are who pretend differently \u2014 who \nhold out to a hard-pressed people freedom from pain and \ntrouble, undisturbed repose and constant enjoyment\u2014 they cheat \nthe people and impose upon them, and their lying promises \nwill only make the evil worse than before. There is nothing \nmore useful than to look at the world as it really is \u2014 ^and at \nthe same time look elsewhere for a remedy to its troubles.\u201d \n\nFurther on we are told where this ' elsewhere \u2019 is : \n\n\u201cThe things of the earth cannot be understood or valued \nrightly without taking into consideration the life to come, the \nlife that will last for ever. . . . The great truth which we learn \nfirom Nature herself is also the grand Christian dogma on \nwhich religion rests as on its base\u2014 that when we have done \nwith this present life then we shall really begin fo live. God has \nnot created us for the perishable and transitory things of the \nearth, but for things heavenly^ and everlasting; He has given us \nthe world as a place of exile, and not as our true country. \nMoney and the other things which men call good and desirable \n\u2014 ^we may have them in abtmdance or we may want them alto- \ngether; as far as eternal happiness is concerned, it is no \nmatter. ...\u201d \n\nThis religious attitude is bound up with the world of long \nago when me only possible escape fi'om present misery was in \nthe hope of a world to come. But though conditions changed \nand raised the human level in material prosperity beyond the \nwildest dreams of the past, the stranglehold of that past, con- \ntinued, the stress nhw being laid on certain vague, unmeasur- \nable spiritual values. The ^tholics look back to the twelfth \nand thirteenth centuries\u2014 the ve^ period which is called the \n'Dark Age' by others \u2014 as the Golden Age of Christianity, \nwhen saints flourished, and Christian rulers sallied forth to \nfight in the Crusades, and Gothic cathedrals grew up. That \nvras the age, according to them \u201c of true Christian democracy \nwhich was then realised under the control of the medieval \n^Ids, more fully than it has ever been before or since.\u201d \nMuslims look back with longing to the \u201c democracy of Islam \u201d \nunder the early Khalifa, and to their amazing career of viaory. \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nHindus think likewise of the Vedic and Epic Periods, and \ndream of a Rama Raj. And yet all history tells us that the \ngreat masses of the people lived in utter misery in those past \ndays, lacking food and the barest necessaries of life, A handful \nof people at the top may have indulged in the spiritual life, \nhaving leisure and means to do so, but for the others, it is \ndifficult to imagine them doing anything but struggling for \nbare sustenance. To a person who is starving, cultural and \nspiritual progress is highly unlikely; his thoughts will be con- \ncentrated on food and how to get it. \n\nThe industrial age has brought many evils that loom large \nbefore us; but tye are apt to forget that, taking the world as a \nwhole, and especially the parts that are most indu.strialised, it \nhas laid down a basis of material well-being which makes cul- \ntural and spiritual progress fiir easier for large numbers. This \nis not all evident in India or other colonial countries as we have \nnot profited by industrialism. We have only been exploited by \nit and in many respects made worse, even materially, and more \nso culturally and spiritually. The fault is not of industrialism \nybut of foreign domination. The so-called Westernisation in \nIndia has actually, for the time being, strengthened feudalism, \nand instead of solving any of our problems has simply intensi- \nfied them. \n\nThat has been our misfortune, and we must not allow it to \ncolour our vision of the world to-day. For under present con- \nditions the rich man is no longer a necessary or a desirable part \nof the productive system or of society as a whole. He is re- \ndundant and he is always coming in the way. And the old \nbusiness of the priest to ask the rich to be charitable and the \npoor to be resigned, grateful for their lot, thrifty and well- \nbehaved, has lost its meaning. Human resources have grown \ntremendously and can face and solve the world\u2019s problems. \nMany of the rich have become definitely parasitical and the \nexistence of a parasite class is not only a hindrance but an \nenormous waste of these resources. That class and the system \nthat breeds them actually prevent work and production and \nencourage the worklcss at either end of the scale, both those \nwho live on other people\u2019s labour and those who have no work \nto do and famish. Gandhiji himself wrote some time ago: \n\" To a people famishing and idle, the only acceptable form in \nwhich God dare appear is work and promise of food as wages. \nGod created man to work for his food, and said that those who \n\n+e without work Were thieves.\" \n\nTo try to understand the complex problems of the modern \n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n \n\nworld by an application of ancient methods and &rmulae when \nthese problems did not exist, to use out-of-date phrases in regard \nto them, is to produce confiision and to invite failure. The \nvery idea of private property, which seems to some people one \nof the fundamental notions of the world, has been an ever- \nchanging one. Slaves were property at one time, and so were \nwomen and children, the seigneur\u2019s right to the bride\u2019s first \nnight, roads, temples, ferries, bridges, public utilities, air and \nland. Animals are still property, though legislation has in many \ncountries limited the rights of ownership. During war-time \nthere is a continuous infringement of property rights. Property \nto-day is becoming more and more intangible, the possession of \nshares, a certain amount of credit, etc. As the conception of \nproperty changes, the State interferes more and more, public \nopinion demands, and the law enforces, a limitation of the \nanarchic rights of property-owners. All manner of heavy \ntaxes, which are in the nature of confiscation, swallow up indi- \nvidual property rights for the public good. The public good \nbecomes the basis of public policy, and a man may not act \ncontrary to this public good even to protect his property rights. \nAfter all, the vast majority of people had no property rights in \nthe past, thjcy were themselves property owned by others. Even \nto-day a very small number have such rights. We hear a great \ndeal of vested interests. To-day a new vested interest has come \nto be recognised, that of everj man and woman, to live and \nlabour and enjoy the fruits of labour. . Because of these \nchanging conceptions property and capital do not vanish, they \nare diffiised, and the power over others, which a concentration \nof them gave to a few, is taken back by society as a whole. \n\nGandhiji wants to improve the individual internally, morally \nand spiritually, and thereby to change the external environ- \nment; He wants people to pve up bad habits and indulgences \nand to become pure. He lays stress on sexual abstinence, on the \ngiving up of drink, smoking, etc. Opinions may differ about \nthe relative wickedness of these indulgences, but can there be \nany doubt that even from the individual point of view, and \nmuch more so from the social, these personal failings are less \nharmful than covetousness, selfishness, acquisitiveness, the fierce \nconflicts of individuals for personal gain, the ruthless struggles \nof groups and classes, the inhuman suppression and exploita: \ntion of one group by another, the terrible wars between \nnations? Of course he detests all this violence and degrading \nconflict. But are they not inherent in the acquisitive society of \nto-day with its law that the strong must prey on the weak, and \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nits motto, that, as of old, \u201c they shall take who have the power \nand they shall keep who can \u201d? The profit motive to-day inevit- \nably leads to conflict. The whole system protects and gives \nevery scope to man\u2019s predatory instincts; it encourages some \nfiner instincts no doubt, but much more so the baser instincts \nof man. Success means the knocking down of others and \nmounting on their vanquished selves. If these motives and \nambitions are encouraged by society and attract the best of our \npeople, does Gandhi ji think that he can achieve his ideal \u2014 the \nmoral man \u2014 in this environment? He wants to develop the \nspirit of service; he will succeed in the case of some individuals, \nbut so long as society puts forward as exemplars the victors of \nan acquisitive society and the chief urge as the personal profit \nmotive, the vast majority will follow this course. \n\nBut the problem is no longer merely a moral or an ethical \none. It is a practical and urgent problem of to-day, for the \nworld is in a hopeless muddle, and some way out must be found. \nWe cannot wait, Micawber-lUce, for something to turn up. Nor \ncan we live by negation alone criticising the evil aspects of \ncapitalism, socialism, communism, etc., and hoping vaguely for \nthe golden mean, which will produce a happy compromise com- \nbining the best features of all systems, old and new. The \nmalady has to be diagnosed and the cure suggested and worked \nfor. It is quite certain that we cannot stand where we are, \nnationally and internationally; we may try to go back or we \nmay push forward. Probably there is no choice in the matter, \nfor going back seems inconceivable. \n\nAnd yet many of Gandhiji\u2019s activities might lead one to \nthink that he wants to go bade to the narrowest autarchy, not \nonly a self-sufficient nation, but almost a self-suffident village. \nIn primitive communities the village was more or less self- \nsufficient and fed and clothed itself and otherwise provided for \nits needs. Of necessity that means an extremdy low standard \nof living. I do not think Gandhiji is permanently aiming at \nthis, for it is an impossible objective. The huge populations of \nto-day would not be able even to subsist in some countries, thw \nwould not tolerate this reversion to scardty and starvation. It \nis possible, I think, that in an agricultural country like India, so \nvery low is our present standard, that there might be a slight \nimprovement for the masses wifh the development of village \nindustries. But we are tied up, as every country is tied up, with \nthe rest of the world, and it seems to me quite impossible for \nus to cut adrift. We must think, therefore, in terms of the \nworld, and in these terms a narrow autardxy is out of the \n\n\n\nPAKAUOaJiIS \n\n\n* \n\nquestion. Personally I consider it undesirable from every point \nof view. \n\nInevitably we are led to the only possible solution\u2014the estab- \nlishment of a soeialigt order, first within national boundaries, and \neventually in the world as a whole, with a controlled production \nand distribution of wealth for the public good. How this is to \nbe brought about is another matter, but it is clear that the \ngood of a nation or of mankind must not be held up because \nsome perale who profit by the existing order object to the \nchange. If political or social institutions stand in the way of \nsuch a change, they have to be removed. To compromise with \nthem at the cost of that desirable and practical ideal would be \na gross betrayal. Such a change may partly be forced or expe- \ndited by world conditions, but it can hardly take place without \nthe willing consent or acquiescence of the great majority of the \npeople concerned. They have therefore to be converted and \nwon over to it. Conspiratorial violence of a small group will \nnot help. Naturally' efforts must be made to win over even \nthose who profit by the existing system, but it is highly unlikely \nthat any large percentage of flrem will be converted. \n\nThe khadi movement, hand-spinning and hand-weaving, \nwhich is Gandhiji\u2019s special favourite, is an intensification of \nindividualism in production, and is thus a throw-back to the \n\n{ >re-industrial age. As a solution of any vital present-day prob- \n^ it cannot he taken seriously, and it produces a mentality \nwhich may become an obstacle to growth in the right direction. \nNevertheless as a temporary measure I am convinced that it has \nserved a useful purpose, and it is likely to be helpful for some \ntime to come, so long as the State itself does not undertake the \nrightful solution of agrarian and industrial problems on a \ncoimtry-wide scale. There is tremendous unrecorded unemploy- \nment in India and even greater partial unemployment in rural \nareas. No attempt has been made by the State to combat this \nunemployment, or help in any way the unemployed. Econo- \nniically khadi has been of some little help to these wholly and \npartially imemployed, and because this improvement has come \nfrom their own efforts, it has raised their self-respect and given \nthem some feeling of confidence. The most marked result has \nindeed been a psychological one. Khadi tried with some success \nto bridge the gap betwera the city and the village. It brought \nnearer to each other the middleclass intelligentsia and ^e \npeasantry. Clothing has a marked psychological effect on &e \nwearer as well as the beholder, and the adoption of the simple \nwhite khadi dress by the middle-classes resulted in a growth of \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nsimplicity, a lessening of vulgarity and ostentation, and a feel- \ning of unity with the masses. Tlie lower middle classes no \nlonger tried to ape the richer classes in the matter of clothes or \nfeel humiliated in their cheaper attire. Indeed they felt not \nonly dignified but a little superior to those who still Haunted \nsilks and satins. Even the poorest felt something of this dig- \nnity and self-respect. It was difficult in a large khadi-clad \ngathering to distinguish between the rich and the poor, and \na spirit of camaraderie grew up. Khadi undoubtedly helped \nthe Congress to reach the masses. It became the uniform of \nnational freedom. \n\nKhadi also became a check on the ever-present tendency of \nthe mill-owners to raise the prices of their stuffs. These mill- \nowners in India were only kept in check in the past by foreign \ncompetition, especially that of Lancashire. Whenever this com- \npetition ceased, as during the World War, cloth prices soared \nup in India to extraordinary heights and vast sums were made \nby the Indian mills. The swadeshi and foreign-cloth boycott \nmovements later on also helped these mills greatly, but the \npresence of khadi made a difference and prices could not go \nup as high as they might otherwise have done. Indeed the \nmills exploited the kham sentiment of the people (and so did \nJapan) by manufacturing coarse cloths which were almost indis- \ntinguishable from the hand-spun and hand-woven article. In \nthe event of another emergency arising, like a war, resulting in \na stoppage of foreign cloth, it is unlikely now that the Inman \nmill-owners will he able to exploit the consumers to the extent \nthey did from  onwards. The khadi movement will prevent \nthat, and the khadi organisation has the capacity in it to spread \nout at short notice. \n\nIn spite of all these present-day advantages of the khadi \nmovement in India it seems to me after all a transitional affair. \nIt may continue even later on as an auxiliary movement easing \nthe change-over to a higher economy. Btit .the main drive m \nfuture will have to be a complete overhauling of the agrarian \nsystem and the growth of industry. No tinkering wUh the \nland, and a multitucifi of commissions costing lakhs of rupees \nand suggesting trivial changes in the superstructure, will do the \nslightest good. The land system which we have is collapsing \nbefore our eyes, and it is a hindrance to production, distribution \n\u25a0 and any rational and large-scale operations. Only a radical \nchange in it, putting an end to the little holdings and intro- \nducing organised collective and co-operative enterprises, and \nthus increasing the yield greatly with much less effort, will meet \n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n \n\nmodem conditions. The land will not and cannot absorb all \nour people, and large-scale operations will (as Gandhlji fears) \nlessen the workers required on the land. The others must turn, \npartly it may be, to small-scale industry, but in the main to \nlarge-scale socialised industries and social services. \n\nKhadi has certainly brought some relief in many areas, but \nthis very success that it has attained has an element of danger. \nIt means that it is propping up a decaying land system and \ndelaying, to that extent, the change-over to a better system. \nThe effect is not substantial enough to make a marked \ndifference, but the tendency is there. For the tenant or the \nsmall peasant proprietor, his share of the produce of the land \nis no longer enough to keep him going even on the very low \nlevel he has reached. He has to find extraneous aids to his \nmeagre income or, as he does usually, get more into debt, in \norder to pay his rent or revenue. The additional income thus \nhelps the landlord or the State to realise their share which \notherwise they might be unable to do. In the event of the \nadditional income being substantial enough it is likely eventu- \nally the rent will rise and catch up to it. Under the present \nsystem most of the additional labour of the tenant and his \nattempts to be thrifty will ultimately benefit the landlord. As \nfar as I can remember, Henry George in his Progress and \nPoverty has dealt with this point, giving instances, especially of \nIreland. \n\nGandhiji\u2019s attempt to revive village industries is an extension \nof his khadi programme. It will do immediate good, part of it \nmore or less permanent, most of it temporary. It will help the \nvillager in his present distress and revive certain artistic and \ncultural values which were in danger of dying. But in so far \nas it is a revolt against machinery and industrialism it will \nnot succeed. In a recent article on Village Industries in the \nHarijan Gandhi ji writes: \"Mechanisation is good when hands \nare too few for the work intended to be accomplished. It is an \nevil when there are more hands than required for the work, as \nis the case of India. . . . The problem with us is not how to \nfind leisure for the teeming millions inhabiting our villages. \nThe problem is how to utilise their idle hours, which are equal \nto the working days of six months in the year.\u201d This objection \napplies in varying measure to all the countries suffering ftom \nunemployment. But the fault surely is not that there is not \nwork to do, but that under the present profit system the work \nis not profitable enough to the employers. There is an abim- \ndance of work simply calling out to be done \u2014 ^the building of \n\n\n\n^ JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nroads, irrigation schemes, houses, the spread of sanitation and \nmedical facilities, of industry, electricity, social and cultural \nservices, education, and the provision of the scores of necessary \narticles that the people lack. All our millions can work hard \nfor the next fifty years without exhausting the present possi- \nbilities. But that can only be done if the urge is social im- \nprovement and not the profit motive, and if the community \norganises it for the general good. The Russian Soviet Union, \nwhatever other shortcomings it may possess, has no unem- \nployed. Our people are idle not fijr lack of work, but because \nno facilities for work and cultural improvement are provided \nfor them. The abolition of child labour, the provision of com- \npulsory education up to a reasonable age, would take boys and \ngirls oif from the ranks of labour or the unemployed, and \nrelieve the labour market of the weight of tens of millions of \nprospective workers. \n\nGandhiji has tried, with some success, to improve the charkha \nand the takli and increase their productive capacities. That is \nan attempt to improve the tool and the machine, and if the \nimprovement continues (it is quite conceivable to have cottage \nindustries worked by electricity), the profit motive will agam \nstep in and produce what is cdled over-production and unem- \nployment. Village industries without being tacked on to som^ \nmodern industrial technique can never provide even the essen- \ntial material and cultural goods that we need to-day. And they \ncannot compete with the machine. Is it desirable or possible fiir \nus to stop the functioning of big-scale machinery in our \ncountry? Gandhiji has said repeatedly that he is not against \nmachinery as such; he seems to think that it is out of place \nin India to-day. But can we wind up the basic industries, \nsuch as iron and steel, or even the lighter ones that already \nexist? \n\nIt is obvious that we cannot do so. If we have railways, \nbridges, transport facilities, etc., we must either produce them \nourselves or depend on others. If we want to have the means \nof defence we must not only have the basic industries but a \nhighly developed industrial system. No country to-day is really \nindependent or capable of resisting aggression unless it is indus- \ntrially developed. One basic industry demands another for its \nsupport and as a complement to it, and finally we have the \nmachine-building industry itself. With all these basic industries \nfunctioning it is inevitable that the lighter industries should \nspread. There is no stopping this process, for not only is our \nmaterial and cultural progress bound up with it, but also our \n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n* \n\nfreedom itself. And the more big industry spreads the less can \nsmall-scale village industries compete with it. They may have \nsome chance of survival under a socialist system, but none under \ncapitalism, and even under sodalism they can only exist as \ncottage industries specialising in particular goods which are not \nmanufactured on a mass scale. \n\nSome Congress leaders are frightened of industrialisation, \nand imagine that the present-day troubles of the industrial \ncountries are due to mass production. That is a strange mis- \nreading of the situation.^ If the masses lack anything, is it bad \nto produce it in sufficient quantities for them? Is it preferable \nfor them to continue in want rather than have mass produc- \ntion? The fault obviously is not in the production but in the \nfolly and inadequacy of the distributive system. \n\nAnother difficulty wliich the promoters of village industries \nhave to face is the dependence of our agriculture on the world \nmarket. The peasant is forced to grow commercial crops and to \ndepend on world prices. While these prices vary he has to \npay his rent or revenue in hard cash. He has to raise this \nmoney somehow, or at any rate he tries to do so, and so he \nsows the crops which he thinks will bring him the best price. \nHe cannot afford to grow what he himself needs to make \nhimself and his family self-sufficient even in the matter of \nfood. \n\nIn recent years the fall in agricultural prices of most food \ngrains and other articles suddenly led millions of the peasantry, \nespecially in the U,P, and Behar, to cultivate sugaivcane. A \ntariff on sugar had resulted in sugar factories cropping up like \nmushrooms, and sugar-cane was in great demand. But the \nsupply was soon far in excess of the demand, and the factory \nowners cruelly exploited the peasantry, and the price fell. \n\nThese few considerations and a host of others seem to me to \nexclude' the possibility or the desirability of any narrow \nautarchichal solution of our agrarian and industrial problems. \nIndeed they affect every phase of our national life. We cannot \ntake refuge in vague and emotional phrases, but must face these \nfacts and adapt ourselves to them, so that we may become the \nsubjects of history instead of being its helpless objects. \n\n Sardar VaUabhbhai Patel speaking at Ahmedabad on January \n, : \u2018\u201cIVue socialism lies in the development of village indus- \ntries, We do not want to reproduce in our country the chaotic \nconditions prevalent in the Western countries consequent on mass- \nproduction.\u201d \n\n\n\na JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nA^ain I think of the paradox that is Gandhiji.* With all his \nkeen intellect and passion for bettering the downtrodden and \noppressed, why does he support a system, and a system which \nis obviously decaying, which creates this misery and waste? He \nseeks a way out, it is true, but is not that way to the past \nbarred and bolted? And meanwhile he blesses all the relics of \nthe old order which stand as obstacles in the way of advance \u2014 \nthe feudal States, the big zamindaris and taluqadaris, the \npresent capitalist system. Is it reasonable to believe in the theory \nof trusteeship \u2014 to give unchecked power and wealth to an \nindividual and to expect him to use it entirely for the public \ngood? Are the best of us so perfect as to be trusted in this way? \nEven Plato\u2019s philosopher-kings could hardly have borne this \nburden worthily. And is it good for the others to have even \nthese benevolent supermen over them? But there are no super- \nmen or philosopher-kings; there are only frail human beings \nwho cannot help thinking that their own personal good or the \nadvancement of their own ideas is identical with the public, \ngood. The snobbery of birth, position, and economic power is \nperpetuated, and the consequences in many ways are disastrous. \n\nAgain, I would repeat that I am not at present considering \nthe question of how to effect the change, of how to get rid of \nthe obstacles in the way, by compulsion or conversion, violence \nor non-violence. I shall deal with this aspect later. But the \nnecessity for the change must be recognised and clearly stated. \nIf leaders and thinkers do not clearly envisage this and state it, \nhow can they expect even to convert anybody to their way of \nthinking, or develop the necessary ideology in the people? \nEvents are undoubtedly the most powerful educators, but events \nhave to be properlp understood and interpreted if their signifi- \ncance is to be realised, and properly directed action is to result \nfrom them. \n\n^ In one of his speeches at the Round Table Conference in \nLondon in , Gandhiji said: \u201cAbove all, the Congress repre- \nsents, in its essence, the dumb semi-starved millions scattered over \nthe length and breadth of the land in its , villages, no matter \nwhether they come from Briti^ India or what is called Indian \nIndia (Indian States), Every interest which, in the opinion of the \nCongress, is worthy of protection has to subserve the interests of \nthese dumb millions; and so you do find now and again apparently \na dash between several interests, and if there is a genume real \nclash, I have no hesitadon in saying, on behalf of the Congress^ \nthat the Congress will sacrifice every interest for the sake of the \ninti'\u00bb'i*\u00abt of thpoe dnmh millioTi\",\u201d \n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n \n\nI have often been asked by hricnds and colleagues who have \noccasionally been exasperated by my utterances : Have you not \ncome across good and benevolent princes, charitable landlords, \nwell-meaning and amiable capitalists? Indeed I have. I myself \nbelong to a class which mixes with these lords of the land and \nowners of wealth. I am a typical bourgeois, brought up in \nbourgeois surroundings, with all the early prejudices that this \ntraining has given me. Communists have called me a petty \nbourgeois with perfect justification. Perhaps they might label \nme now one of the \" repentant bourgeoisie.\u201d But whatever I \nmay be is beside the point. It is absurd to consider national, \ninternational, economic and social problems in terms of isolated \nindividuals. Those very friends who question me are never tired \nof repeating that our quarrel is with the sin and not the sinner. \nI would not even go so far. I would say that my quarrel is with \na system and not with individuals. A system is certainly em- \nbodied to a great extent in individuals and groups, and these \nindividuals and groups have to be converted or combated. But \nif a system has ceased to be of value and is a drag, it has to go, \nand the classes or groups that cling to it will also have to \nundergo a transformation. That process of change should \ninvolve as little suffering as possible, but tmhappily suffering and \ndislocation are inevitable. We cannot put up with a major evil \nfor fear of a far lesser one, which in any event is beyond our \npower to remedy. \n\nEvery type of human association \u2014 ^political, social or economic \n\u2014 ^has some philosophy at the back of it. When these associa- \ntions change this philosophical foundation must also change in \norder to fit in with it and to utilise it to the best advantage. \nUsually the philosophy lags behind the course of events, and \nthis lag creates all the trouble. Democracy and capitalism grew \nup together in the nineteenth century, but they were not mutu- \nally compatible. There was a basic contradiction between them, \nfor democracy laid stress on the power of the many, while \ncapitalism gave real power to the few. This ill-assorted pair \ncarried on somehow because political parliamentary democracy \nwas in itself a very limited kind of democracy and did not \ninterfere much with the growth of monopoly and power concen- \ntration. \n\nEven so, as ,the spirit of democracy grew a divorce be? \ncame inevitable, and the time for that has come now. Parlia- \nmentary democracy is in disrepute to-day, and as a. reaction \nfrom it all manner of new slogans fill the air.' Because of this, \nthe British Government in India becomes, more reactiontuy still \n\n\n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nand makes it an excuse for withholding from us even the outer \nforms of political freedom. The Indian Princes, strangely \nenoug)i, make this a justification for their unchecked autocracy \nand stoutly declare their intention of maintaining medieval \nconditions in their domains such as exist nowhere else in the \nworld.* But the failure of parliamentary democracy is not that \nit has gone too far, but that it did not go far enough. It was not \ndemocratic enough because it did not provide for economic \ndemocracy, and its methods were slow and cumbrous and un- \nsuited to a period of rapid change. \n\nThe Indian States represent to-day probably the extremest \ntype of autocracy existing in the world. They are, of course, \nsubject to British suzerainty, but the British Government inter- \nferes only for the protection or advancement of British interests. \nIt is really astonishing how these feudal old-world enclaves have \ncarried on with so little change right into the middle of the \ntwentieth century. The air is heavy and still there, and the \nwaters move sluggishly, and the newcomer, used to change and \nmovement and a little weary of them perhaps, feels a drowsi- \nness, and a faint charm steals over him. It all seems unreal, like \na picture where time stands still and an unchanging scene meets \n\n* The Maharaja of Patiala, Chancellor of the Chamber of \nPrinces, speaking in tire Chamber at Delhi on January aand, , \nreferred to the opinion of Indian politicians who favour Federation \nin the hope that the Princes would be forced by circumstances to \nintroduce democratic forms of government. He went on to say that \n\u201cwhile the Princes of India have always been willing to do what \nwas best for their people, and will be ready to accommodate them- \nselves and their constitutions to the spirit of the times, we must \nfrankly say that if British India is hoping to compel us to wear on \nour healthy body politic the Nessus shirt of a discredited political \ntheory, they are Mving in a world of unreality.\u201d (See also p.  ante \nfor Mysore Dewan\u2019s speech.) Speaking on the same day in the \nChamber of Princes, the Maharaja of Bikaner said: \u201cWe, the \nRulers of the Indian States, are not soldiers of fortune. And I take \nthe liberty of stating that we who, through centuries of heredity, \ncan claim to have inherited the instincts of rule and, I trust, a \ncertain measure of statesmanship, should take the utmost care to \nsafeguard against our being stampeded in a hurry to any hasty or \nUl-considcred decision. . , . May I in all modesty say that the Princes \nhave no intention of allowing themselves to be destroyed by any- \nbody, and that should the time unfortunately come when the \nCrown is unable to afford the Indian States the necessary protection \nin fulfilment of its treaty obligations, the Princes and States will die \nfighting to the bitter end.\u201d \n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n \n\nthe eye. Almost unconsciously he drifts back to the past and to \nhis childhood\u2019s dreams, and visions of belted and armoured \nknights and fair and brave maidens come to him, and turreted \ncasdes and chivalry and quixotic ideas of honour and pride and \nmatchless courage and scorn of death. Especially if he happens \nto be in Rajputana, that home of romance and of vain and im- \npossible deeds. \n\nBut soon the visions fade and a sense of oppression comes; it \nis stifling and difficult to breathe, and below the still or slow- \nmoving waters there is stagnation and putrefaction. One feels \nhedged, circumscribed, bound down in mind and body. And \none sees the utter backwardness and misery of the people, con- \ntrasting vividly with the glaring ostentation of the prince\u2019s \npalace. How much of the wealth of the State flows into that \npalace for the personal needs and luxuries of the prince, how \nlittle goes back to the people in the form of any service! Our \npi inces are terribly expensive to produce and to keep up. What \ndo they give back for this lavish expense on them? \n\nA veil of mystery surrounds these States. Newspapers are not \nencouraged there, and at the most a literary or semi-official \nweekly might flourish. Outside newspapers are often barred. \nUteracy is very low, except in some of the Southern States \u2014 \nTrivancore, Cochin, etc.\u2014 -where it is far higher than in British \nIndia. The principal news that comes from the States is of a \nViceregal visit, with all its pomp and ceremonial and mutually \ncomplimentaij speeches, or of an extravagantly celebrated \nmarriage or birthday of the Ruler, or an agrarian rising. Special \nlaws protect the princes from criticism, even in British India, \nand within the States the mildest criticism is rigorously sup- \npressed. Public meetings are almost unknown, and even meet- \nings for social purposes are often banned.^ Leading public men \n\n\u2018 A Press message from Hyderabad, Deccan, dated October rd, \n, states : \" A public meeting to celebrate Mi, Gandhi's birthday \nannounced to be held in the local Vivekvardini Theatre yesterday \nhad to be abandoned. The meeting was organised by the Hydera- \nbad Harijan Sevak Sangh (Servants of the Untouchables Society). \nThe secretary of the soaety, in a letter to the Press, .stated that  \nhours before the time of the meeting the authorities demanded that \npermission to hold the meeting could only he granted on condition \nthat a cash security of Rs.  was furnished and an undertaking \ngiven that no speeches of a political nature should be ddivCTed, \nand no official actions of Government officers should be criticised. \nAs this gave the convener insufficient time to readjust matters with \nthe authorities the meeting had to be abandoned.\" \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nfrom outside are frequently prevented from entering the States. \nIn the middle \u2019twenties Mr. C. R. Das was very ill and he de- \ncided to go to Kashmir to recuperate. He was not on a political \nmission. He journeyed right up to the Kashmir border, but was \nstopped there. Even Mr. M. A. Jinnah was debarred from enter- \ning Hyderabad State, and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, whose home is \nin Hyderabad city, was not permitted to go there for a long \nperiod. \n\nWhen such conditions prevail in the States it would have \nbeen natural for the Congress to stand up for the elementary \nrights of the people of the States and to criticise their whole- \nsale suppression. But Gandhiji fathered a novel policy on the \nCongress in regard to the States\u2014 the \u201cpolicy of non-interference \nin the internal administration of the States.\u2019\u2019 This hush-hush \npolicy has been adhered to by him in spite of the most extra- \nordinary and painful occurrences in the States, and in spite of \nwholly unprovoked attacks by the States\u2019 governments on the \nCongress. Apparently the fear is that Congress criticism might \noffend the Rulers and make it more difficult to \u2018 convert \u2019 them. \nIn a letter written in July  by Gandhiji to Mr. N. C. Kelkar, \nthe President of the States Subjects\u2019 Conference, he reiterated \nhis conviction that the policy of non-interference was both wise \nand sound, and the view he took of the legal and constitutional \nposition of these States was most extraordinary. \" The States,\u2019\u2019 \nhe wrote, \u201care independent entities under British law. That \npart of India which is described as British has no more power \nto shape the policy of the States than it has, say, that of \nAfghanistan or Ceylon.\u201d It is not surprising that even the mild \nand moderate Indian States\u2019 People\u2019s Conference and the \nLiberals took exception to his views and his advice. \n\nBut these views were welcome enough to the Rulers of the \nStates, and they took advantage of them. Within a month the \nTravancore Government banned the National Congress in its \nterritories and stopped all its meetings and its enrolment of \nmembers. In doing so, it stated that ^responsible leaders \u2019 had \nthemselves given this advice\u2014 obviously hinting at Gandhiji\u2019s \nstatement. This ban, it might be noted, was after the with- \ndrawal of the Civil Disobemence movement in British India \n(the States had never been involved in the movement) and when \nthe Congress' had been declared a legal organisation again by \nthe Government of India. It is also interesting to note that the \nchief political adviser of the Travancore Government at the \ntims was (and still is) Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar, once a \nGeneral Secretary of the Congress as well as of the Home Rule \n\n\n\nPARADOXES \n\n\n \n\nLeague, later a Liberal, and the holder of high office in the \nGovernment of India and the Madras Government. \n\nIn accordance with the Congress policy, following Gandhiji\u2019s \nadvice, not a word was said in public about this unprovoked \nattack on the Congress in normal times by the Travancore \nGovernment.* Some of the Liberals even protested against it \nvigorously. Indeed, Gandhiji\u2019s position in regard to the States is \nfar more moderate and restrained than that of the Liberals. \nPerhaps among the leading public men only Pandit Madan \nMohan Malaviya, with his close contacts with numerous \nPrinces, is equally restrained and solicitous of not offending the \nsusceptibilities of the Rulers. \n\nGandhiji was not always so cautious in regard to the Indian \nPrinces. On a famous occasion in February , during the \ninauguration ceremonies of the Hindu University at Benares, \nhe addressed a meeting presided over by one of the Princes and \nattended by a host of other Princes. He had freshly returned \nfrom South Africa, and the burden of all-India politics was not \nyet on his shoulders. Earnestly and with a prophet\u2019s fire he \naddressed them and told them to mend their ways and give up \ntheir vain pomp and luxury. \"Princes I Go and sell your \njewels I \u201d he said; and though they may not have sold their \njewels, they certainly went. In great consternation, one by one \nand in small groups, they left me hall, and even the president \ntrooped out, leaving the speaker to carry on by himself. Mrs. \nAnnie Besant, who was present then, was also ofended at Gand- \nhiji\u2019s remarks and withdrew fiom the meeting. \n\nIn his letter to Mr. N. C. Kelkar, Gandhiji says further : \" I \nwould like the States to grant autonomy to their subjects, and \nwould like the Princes to regard themselves and be, in tact, \ntrustees for the people over vffiom they rule. . . .\" If there is \nanything in this idea of trusteeship, why should we object to the \nclaim of the British Government that they are trustees for the \nGovernment of India? Except for the fact that they are^ \nforeigners in India, I see no difference. There are almost equally \nmarked differences as regards the colour of the skin, racial origin \nand culture between various peoples in India. \n\n* Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel laid stress on this non-intervention , \npolicy in a speech at Baroda on January th, . He is reported to \nhave said \" that workers in Indian States should do their work with \nall the limitations inmosed by the State, and instead o\u00a3 criticising \nthe administration, efforts should be made to keep up cordial rela- \nTinn'' hptwe'*n the ruler and the ruled.\u201d \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nDuring the past few years there has been a rapid permeation \nof British officials in Indian States, often thrust on an unwilling \nbut helpless Ruler. The Government of India always exercised \na great deal of control over the States from above; now in ad- \ndition to this there is an internal grip on some of the most im- \nportant States. So that when these States speak it is often the \nGovernment of India speaking with another voice, but taking \nfull advantage of the feudal background. \n\nI can understand that it is not always possible to indulge in \nthe same activities in the States as elsewhere. Indeed, there \nare considerable differences \u2014 ^agrarian, industrial, communal, \ngovernmental \u2014 between the various British Indian provinces, \nand a uniform policy is not always feasible. But though action \nmust depend on circumstances, our general policy should not \nvary in diflFerent localities, and what is bad in one place must \nbe bad in another. Otherwise the charge will be made, and it \nhas been made, that we have no consistent policy or principles, \nand all we are out for is to gain power for ourselves. \n\nA great deal of criticism has been directed, and quite rightly, \nagainst separate electorates for religious and other minorities. \nIt has been pointed out that they are quite inconsistent with \ndemocracy. It is, of course, not possible to have democracy, \nor what is called responsible government, if the electorate is \ndivided , up into watertight religious compartments. But the \nmost earnest and persistent of the critics, like Pandit Madan \nMohan Malaviya and the leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha, \nare singularly acquiescent in regard to the conditions in the \nStates, and are apparently prepared to have a federal union be- \ntween the autocracy of the States and the democracy (so it is \ncalled) of the rest of India. A more incompatible and absurd \nunion it is difficult to imagine, but this is swallowed without an \neffort by the champions of democracy and nationalism in the \nHindu Mahasabha. We talk of logic and consistency, but our \nbasic urges continue to be emotional. \n\nAnd- so I come back to the paradox of the Congress and the \nStates. My mind travels to Thomas Paine and the phrase he \nused about Burke nearly a century and a half ago: \u2018^He pities \nthe plumage, but forgets the dying bird.\" Gandhiji certainly \nnever forgets the dying bird. But why so much insistence on \nthcplumage? \u2022 \n\nMore or less the same considerations apply to the taluqadari \n. and big zamindari system. It hardly seems a matter for argu- \nment that this semi-feudal system is out of date and is a great \nhindrance to production and general progress. It conflicts even \n\n\n\nPARADOAiS \n\n\nJ \n\nwith a developing capitalism, and almost all over the world \nlarge landed estates have gradually vanished and given place to \npeasant proprietors. I had always imagined that the only pos- \nsible question that could arise in India was one of compen- \nsation. But to my surprise I have discovered during the last \nyear or so that Gandhiji approves of the taluqudari system as \nsuch and wants it to continue. He said in July  at Cawn- \npore \" that better relations between landlords and tenants could \nbe brought about by a change of hearts on both sides. If that \nwas done both could live in peace and harmony. He was never \nin favour of abolition of the taluqardari or zamindari system, \nand those who thought that it should he abolished did not \nknow their own minds.\u201d (This last charge is rather unkind.) \n\nHe is further reported to have said : \u201c I shall be no party to \ndispossessing propertied classes of their private property with- \nout just cause. My objective is to reach your hearts and convert \nyou [he was addressing a deputation of big zamiiidars] so that \nyou may hold all your private property in trust for your tenants \nand use it primarily for their welfare. . . . But supposing that \nthere is an attempt unjustly to deprive you of your property \nyou will find, me fighting on your side. . . . The socialism and \ncommunism of the West is based on certain conceptions which \nare fundamentally different &om ours. One such conception is \ntheir belief in the essential selfishness of human nature. . . . \nOur socialism and communism should therefore be based on \nnon-violence and on the harmonious co-operation of Labour \nand Capital, landlord and tenant.\u201d \n\nI do not know if there are any such differences in the basic \nconceptions of the East and West. Perhaps there are. But an \nobvious difference in the recent past has been that the Indian \ncapitalist and landlord have ignored far more the interests of \ntheir workers and tenants than their Western prototypes. There \nhas been practically no attempt on the part of the Indian land- \nlord to interest himself in any social service for the tenants\u2019 \nwelfare. A Western observer, Mr. H. N. Brailsford, has re- \nmarked that \u201cIndian usurers and landlords are the most \nrapacious parasites to be found in any contemporary social \nsystem.\u201d \u2018 The fault, perhaps, is not the Indian landlord\u2019s. Cir- \ncumstances have been too much for him and he has gone down \nprogressively, and is now in a difficult position firom which he \ncan hardly extricate himself. Many landlords have been de- \nprived of their lands by moneylenders and the smaller ones \n\n* H. N. Brailsford: Property or Peaeef \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\n\n \n\nhave sunk to the position of tenants in the land they once \nowned. These moneylenders from the city advanced money on \nmortgages and foreclosed, and blossomed out into zamindars, \nand, according to Gandhiji, they are now the trustees for the \nunhappy people whom they have themselves dispossessed of \ntheir lands, and are to be expected to devote their income \nprimarily for the welfare of their tenantry. \n\nIf the taluqardari system is good, why should it not be intro- \nduced all over India? Large tracts of India have peasant pro- \nprietors. I wonder if Gandhiji would be agreeable to the \ncreation of large zamindaris and taluquas in Gujrat? I imagine \nnot. But then why is one land system good for the U.P. or \nBehar or Bengal, and another for Gujrat and the Punjab? Pre- \nsumably there is not any vital difference between the people of \nthe north and ea.st and west and south of India, and their basic \nconceptions, are the same. It comes to this, then, that whatever \nis should continue, the status quo should be mainained. There \nshould be no economic enquiry as to what is most desirable or \nbeneficial for the people, no attempts to change present con- \nditions; all that is necessary is to change the people\u2019s hearts. \nThat is the pure religious attitude to life and its problems. It \nhas nothing to do with politics or economics or sociology. And \nye Gandhiji goes beyond this in the political, national, sphere. \n\nSuch are some of the paradoxes that face India to-day. We \nhave managed to tic ourselves up into a number of knots, and \nit is difficult to get on till we untie them. That release will not \ncome emotionally. What is better, Spinoza asked long ago: \n\" Freedom through knowledge and understanding, or emotional \nbondage? \u201d He preferred the former. \n EPILOGUE \n\nWc are enjoined to labour; but it is not granted to us to \ncomplete our labours. \n\nThe Talmud. \n\nI HAVE reached the end of the story. This egotistical nar- \nrative of my adventures through life, such as they are, has \nbeen brought up to to-day, February , , District Gaol, \nAlmora. Three months ago to-day I celebrated in this prison \nmy forty-fifth birthday, and I suppose I have still many years \nto live. Sometimes a sense of age and weariness steals over me, \nat other times I feel full of energy and vitality. I have a fairly \ntough body, and my mind has a capacity for recovering from \nshock, so I imagine I shall yet survive for long unless some sud- \nden fate overtakes me. But the future has to be lived before it \ncan be written about. \n\nThe adventures have not been very exciting perhaps; long \nyears in prison can hardly be termed adventurous. Nor have \nthey been in any way unique, fer I have shared these years with \ntheir ups and downs with tens of thousands of my country- \nmen and countrywomen; and this record of changing moods, \nof exaltations and depressions, of intense activity and enforced \nsolitude, is our common record. I have been one of a mass, \nmoving with it, swaying it occasionally, being influenced by it; \nand yet, like the other units, an individual, apart from the \nothers, living my separate life in the heart of the crowd. We \nhave posed often enough and struck up attitudes, but there \nwas something very real and intensely truthful in much that \nwe did, and this lifted us out of our petty selves and made us \nmore vital and gave us an importance that we would otherwise \nnot have had. Sometimes we were fortunate enough to ex- \nperience that fullness of life which comes from attempting to \nfit ideals with action. And we realised that any other life in- \nvolving a renunciation of these ideals and a tame submission \nto superior force, would have been a wasted existence, full of \ndiscontent and inner sorrow. \n\nTo me these years have brought one rich gift, among many \nothers. More and more I have looked upon life as an adventure \nof absorbing interest, where there is so much to learn, so much \n\n\u2022SOO \n\n\n\nEPILOGUE \n\n\n \n\nto do. I have continually had a feeling of growing up, and \nthat feeling is still with me and gives a zest to my activities as \nwell as to the reading of books, and generally makes life worth \nwhile. \n\nIn writing this narrative I have tried to give my moods and \nthoughts at the time of each event, to represent as far as I \ncould my feelings on the occasion. It is difficult to recapture \na past mood, and it is not easy to forget subsequent happenings. \nLater ideas thus must inevitably have coloured my account of \nearlier days, but my object was, primarily for my own benefit, \nto trace my own mental growth. Perhaps what I have written \nis not so much an account of what I have been but of what \nI have sometimes wanted to be or imagined myself to be. \n\nSome months ago Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar stated in \npublic that I did not represent mass-feeling, but that I was all \nthe more dangerous because of my sacrifices and idealism and \nthe fervour of my convictions, which he characterised as \u2018 self- \nhypnotisation \u2019. A person suffering from self-hypnosis can \nhardly judge himself, and, in any event, I would not presume \nto join issue on this personal matter with C.P. We have not \nmet &r many years, but there was a time, long ago, when we \nwere joint secretaries of the Home Rule League. Since then \nmuch has happened, and C.P. has risen by ascending spirals \nto dizzy heights and I have remamed of the earth, earthy. \nThere is little now in common between us except our common \nnationality. He is to-day a full-blooded apologist of British \nrule in India, especially during the last few years; an admirer \nof dictatorship in India and elsewhere, and himself a shining \nornament of autocracy in an Indian State. We disagree about \nmost things, I suppose, but we agree on one somewhat trivial \nsubject. He is absolutely right when he says that I do not \nrepresent mass-feeling. I have no illusions on that point. \n\nIndeed, I often wonder if I represent any one at all, and I \nam inclined to think that I do not, though many have kindly \nand friendly feelings towards me. I have become a queer mix- \nture of the East and West, out of place everywhere, at home \nnowhere. Perhaps my thoughts and Mproach to life are more \nfiTfin to what is called Western than Eastern, but India clings \nto me, as she does to all her children, in innumerable ways; \nand behind me lie, somewhere in the subconscious, racial \nmemories of a hundred, or whatever the number may be, \ngenerations of Brahmans, I cannot get rid of either that past, \ninheritance or my recent acquisitions. They are both part of \nme, and, though they help me in both the East and the West, \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nthey also create in me a feeling of spiritual loneliness not only \nin public activities but in life itself I am a stranger and alien \nin the West. I cannot be of it. But in my own country also, \nsometimes, I have an exile\u2019s feeling. \n\nThe distant mountains seem easy of access and climbing, \nthe top beckons, but, as one approaches, difficulties appear, \nand the higher one goes the more laborious becomes the \njourney and the summit recedes into the clouds. Yet the \nclimbing is worth the effort and has its own joy and satis- \nfaction. Perhaps it is the struggle that gives value to life, not \nso much the ultimate result. Often it is difficult to know which \nis the right path; it is easier sometimes to know what is not \nright, and to avoid that is something after all. If I may \nquote, with all humility, the last words of the great Socrates : \n\" I know not what death is \u2014 ^it may be a good thing, and I am \nnot aftaid of it. But I do know that it is a bad thing to desert \none\u2019s past, and I prefer what may be good to what I know to \nbe bad.\u201d \n\nThe years I have spent in prison! Sitting alone, wrapped \nin my thoughts, how many seasons I have seen go by, follow- \ning each other into oblivion  How many moons I have watched \nwax and wane, and the pageant of the stars moving along \ninexorably and majesticaUyl How many yesterdays of my \nyouth lie buried here; and sometimes I see the ghosts of these \ndead yesterdays rise up, bringing poignant memories, and \nwhispering to me : \" Was it worth while? \u201d There is no hesita- \ntion about the answer. If I were given the chance to go through \nmy life again, with my present knowledge and experience \nadded, I would no doubt try to make many changes in my \npersonal life; I would endeavour to improve in many ways on \nwhat I had previously done, but my major decisions in public \naffairs would remain untouched. Indeed, I could not vary them, \nfor they were stronger than myself, and a force beyond my \ncontrol drove me to them. \n\nIt is almost exactly a year since my conviction; a year has \ngone by out of the two years of my sentence. Another full \njrear remains, for there are no remissions this time, as simple \nimprisonment carries no such deductions. Even the eleven days \nthat I was out in August last have been added on to the period \nof my sentence. But this year too will pass, and I shall go \nout\u2014 -and then? I do not know, but I have a feeling that a \nchapter of my fife is over and another chapter will , begin. \nWhat this is going to be I cannot clearly guess.

After her departure there were no more visits to \nBhowali for me, no more fortnightly outings and drives on \nthe mountain roads. I missed them, and Almora Gaol seemed \nto be drearier than before. \n\nNews came of the Quetta earthquake, and for a while all \nelse was forgotten. But not for long, for the Government of \nIndia does not allow us to forget it or its peculiar ways. Soon \nwe learnt that Rajendra Prasad, the Congress President, and the \nman who knew more about earthquake relief work than almost \nany other person in India, was not permitted to go to Quetta \nand help in relief. Nor could Gandhiji or any other public man \nof note. Many Indian netvspapers had their securities con- \nfiscated for writing articles on Quetta. \n\nEverywhere the military mentality, the police outlook\u2014 in the \nAssembly, in civil government, in bombing on the Frontier. \nAlmost it would seem that the British Government in India is \npermanently at war with large sections of' the Indian people. \n\nThe police are a useful and a necessary force, but a world full \nof policemen and the police bludgeon may not, perhaps, be a \ndesirable place to live in. It has often been said that an unre- \nstrained use of force degrades the user of it as it humiliates \nand degrades the object of it. Few things are more striking \nto-day in India than the progressive deterioration, moral, and \nintellectual, of the higher services, more especially the Indian \nCivil Service. ' This is most in evidence in the superior officials, \nbut it nms like a thread throughout the services. Whenever \noccasion arises fi)r making a firesh appointment to the higher \nranks, the person who represaats the new spirit best is inevit- \nably chosen. \n\nOn September th I was suddenly discharged ftom Almora \nGaol as news had come that my wife\u2019s condition was critical. \nShe was under treatment in Badenwdler in the SchwarEwald \nin Germany. My sentence iras ' suspended ', I was told, and I \n\nQO \n\n\n\nO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwas released five and half months before my time. I hurried \nto Europe by air. \n\nEurope in turmoil, fearful of war and tumult and with \neconomic crises always on the horizon; Abyssinia invaded and \nher people bombed; various imperialist systems in conflict and \nthreatening each other; and England, the greatest of the im- \nperialist Powers, standing up for peace and the League Covenant \nwhile it bombs and ruthlessly oppresses its subject peoples. But \nhere in the Black Forest it is c^m and peacenil, and even the \nswastika is not much in evidence. I watch the mists steal up \nthe valley and hide the distant frontier of France and cover \nthe landscape, and I wonder what lies behind them. ",
    "1937-1941": " WANDERINGS AMONG THE KISANS \n\nI SPENT three days in the villages, came back to Allahabad, and \nthen went again. During these brief visits we wandered about a \ngreat deal from village to village, feeding with the peasants, living \nwith them in their mud huts, talking to them for long hours, \nand often addressing meetings, big and small. We had originally \ngone in a light car and the peasants were so keen that hundreds \nof them, working overnight, built temporary roads across the \nfields so that our car could go right into the interior. Often the \ncar got stuck and was bodily lifted out by scores of willing hands. \nBut we had to leave the car eventually and to do most of our \njourneying by foot. Everywhere we went we were accompanied \nby pohcemen,C.I.D. men, and a Deputy Collector from Lucknow. \nI am afraid we gave them a bad time with our continuous march- \ning across fields and they were quite tired out and fed up with us \nand the kisans. The Deputy Collector was a somewhat effeminate \nyouth from Lucknow and he had turned up in patent leather \n\nra l He begged us sometimes to restrain our ardour and \na he ultimately dropped out, being unable to keep up \nwith us. \n\nIt was the hottest time of the year, June, just before the mon- \nsoon. The sun scorched and blinded. I was quite unused to \ngoing out in the sun and ever since my return from England I \nhad gone to the hills for part of every summer^ And now I was \nwandering about all day in the open sun with not even a sun-hat, \nmy head being wrapped in a small towel. So full was I of other \nmatters that I quite forgot about the heat and it was only on my \nreturn to Allahabad, when I noticed the rich tan I had developed, \nthat I remembered what I had gone through. I was pleased with \nmyself for I realised that I could stand the heat with the best \nof them and my fear of it was wholly unjustified. I have found \nthat I can bear both extreme heat and great cold.vnthout much \ndiscomfort, and this has stood me in good stead in my work as \nwell as in my periods in prison. This was no doubt due to my \ngeneral physical fitness and my habit of taking exercise, a lesson \nI learnt from my father, who was a bit of an athlete and, almost \nto the end of his days, continued his daily exercise. His head be- \ncame covered with silvery hair, his face was deeply furrowed and \nlooked old and weary with thought, but the rest of his body, to \n\n\n\nWANDERINGS AMONG THE KISANS  \n\nwithin a year or two of his death, seemed to be twenty years \nyounger. \n\nEven before my visit to Partabgarh in June  ,  had often \npassed through villages, stopped there and talked to the peasants. \nI had seen them in their scores of thousands on the banks of the \nGanges during the big melas and we had taken our Home Rule \npropaganda to them. But someliow I had not fully realised what \nthey were and what they meant to India, Like most of us, I \ntook them for granted. This realisation came to me during these \nPartabgarh visits and ever since then my mental picture of \nIndia always contains this naked, hungry mass. Perhaps there \nwas some kind of electricity in the air, perhaps I was in a recep- \ntive frame of mind and the pictures I saw and the impressions I \ngathered were indelibly impressed on my mind. \n\nThese peasants took away the shyness from me and taught me \nto speak in public. Till then I hardly spoke at a public gathering ; \nI was frightened at the prospect, espeaally if the speaking was to \nbe done m Hindustani, as it almost always was. But I could not \npossib^ avoid addressing these peasant gatherings, and how \ncould I be shy of these poor tmsophisticated people? I did not \nknow the arts of oratory and so I spoke to them, man to man, \nand told them what I had in my mind and in my heart. Whether \nthe gathering consisted of a few persons or of ten thousand or \nmore I stuck to my conversational and rather personal method \nof speaking, and I found that, whatever might be lacking in \nit, I could at least go on. I was fluent enough. Perh^s many of \nthem could not tmderstand a great deal of what I said. My \nlanguage or my thought was not simple enough for them. Many \ndid not hear me when the gathering was very large for my voice \ndid not carry far. But all this did not matter much to them when \nonce they had given their confidence and faith to a person, \n\nI went back to Mussoorie to my mother and wife but my mind \nwas full of the hisans and I was eager to be back. As soon as I \nreturned I resumed my visits to the villages and watched the \nagrarian movement grow in strength. The down-trodden kisan \nbegan to gain a new confidence in himself and walked straighter \nwith head up. His fear of the landlords\u2019 agents and the police \nlessened, and when there was an ejectment from a holding no \nother kisan would make an offer for that land. Physical violence \non the part of the zamindars\u2019 servants and illegal exactions be- \ncame infrequent, and whenever an instance occurred, it was im- \nmediately reported and an attempt at an inquiry was held. This \nchecked the zamindars\u2019 agents as well as the police. The talu- \nqadars were frightened and . were on the defensive and the \n\n\n\n JAWAHABLAL NEHRU \n\nprovincial government promised an ainendment of the Oudh \nTenancy Law. \n\nThe taluqadars and the big zamindars, the lords of the land, \nthe \" natural leaders of the people \u201d, as they are proud of calling \nthemselves, had been the spoilt children of the British Govern- \nment, but that Government had succeeded, by the special educa- \ntion and upbringing it provided or failed to provide for them, in \nreducing them, as a class, to a state of complete intellectual \nimpotence. They did nothing at all for their tenantry, such as \nlandlords in other countries have to some little extent often \ndone, and became complete parasites on the land and the people. \nTheir chief activity lay in endeavouring to placate the local \nofficials, without whose favour they could not exist for long, and \ndemanding ceaselessly a protection of their special interests and \nprivileges. \n\nThe word \u2018 zamindar \u2019 is rather deceptive, and one is apt to \nthink that all zamindars are big landlords. In the ryotwari pro- \nvinces it means the peasant proprietor. Even in the typical \nzamindari provinces, it includes in its fold the relatively few big \nlandlords, thousands of middle landowners, and hundreds of \nthousands of persons who live in extreme poverty and are no \nbetter than tenants. In the United Provinces, so far as I can re- \nmember, there are a million and a half persons classed as zamin- \ndars. Probably over ninety per cent, of these are almost on the \nsame level as the poorest tenants, and another nine per cent, are \nonly moderately well off. The biggish landowners are not more \nthan five thousand in the whole province, and of this number, \nabout one-tenth might be considered the really big zamindars \nand taluqadars. In some instances the bigger tenants are better \noff than the destitute petty landowners. Both these poor land- \nowners and the middle landlords, though often intellectually \nbackward, are as a whole a fine body of men and women, and, \nwith proper education and training, can be made into excellent \ncitizens. They have taken a considerable part in the nationalist \nmovement. Not so the taluqadars and the big zamindars, barring \na few notable exceptions. They have not even the virtues of an \naristocracy. As a class they are physically and intellectually \ndegenerate and have outlived their day; they will continue only \nso long as an external power like the British Government props \nthem up. \n\nRight through the year * I'continued my visits to the rural \nareas, but my field of activity grew till it comprised the whole of \nthe United Provinces. Non-co-operation had begun in earnest \nand its message had reached the remotest village. A host of \n\n\n\nWANDERINGS AMONG THE KISANS  \n\nCongress workers in each district went about the rural areas with \nthe new message to which they often added, rather vaguely, a \nremoval of kisan grievances. Swaraj was an all-embracing word \nto cover everything. Yet the two movements \u2014 ^non-co-operation \nand the agrarian \u2014 ^wcre quite separate, though they overlapped \nand influenced each other greatly in our province. As a result of \nCongress preaching, litigation went down with a rush and \nvillages established their pancliayats to deal with their disputes. \nEspecially powerful was the influence of the Congress in favour \nof peace, for the new creed of non-violence was stressed wherever \nthe Congress worker went. This may not have been fully appreci- \nated or understood but it did prevent the peasantry ftom taking \nto violence. \n\nThis was no small result. Agrarian upheavals are notoriously \nviolent, leading to jacqueries, and the peasants of part of Oudh \nin those days were desperate and at white heat. A spark would \nhave lighted a flame. Yet they remained amazingly peaceful. \nThe only instance of physical violence on a taluqadar that I \nremember was when a peasant went up to him as he was sitting \nin his own house, surrounded by his Mends, and slapped him on \nthe face on the ground that he was immoral and inconsiderate \nto his own wifel \n\nThere was violence of another kind later which led to conflicts \nwith the Government. But this conflict was bound to come, for \nthe Government could not tolerate this growing power of a \nunited peasantry. The kisans took to travelling in railway trains \nin large numbers without tickets, especially when they had to \nattend their periodical big mass meetings which sometimes con- \nsisted of sixty or seventy thousand persons. It was difficult to \nmove them and, unheard of thing, they openly defied the rail- \nway authorities, telling them that tlie old days were gone. At \nwhose instigation they took to the free mass travelling i do not \nknow. We had not suggested it to them. We suddenly heard that \nthey were doing it. Striaer railway control prevented this later. \n\nIn the autumn of igao (when I was aww in Calcutta attending \nthe special session of the Conmess) a few kisan leaders were \narrested for some petty offence, ^ey were to be tried in Partab- \ngarh town but on the day of the trial a huge concourse of \npeasants filled the court compound and lined the route to the \ngaol where the accused leaders were kept. The magistrate\u2019s nerve \ngave way and he postponed the trial to the next day. But the \ncrowd grew and almost surrounded the gaol. The kisans can \neasily carry on for a few days on a handfiil of parched nam. \nUltimately the kisan leaders wfere discharged, perhaps after a \n\n\n\no JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nformal trial inside the gaol. I forget how this came about but for \nthe hisans this was a great triumph and they began to- think that \nthey could always have their way by weight of numbers alone. \nTo the Government this position was intolerable and soon after \na similar occasion arose and this time it ended differently. \n\nIt was at the beginning of January a i . I had just returned to \nAllahabad from the Nagpur Congress when I received a telegram \nfrom Rae Bareli asking me to go there immediately as trouble \nwas expected. I left the next day. I discovered that some leading \nkisans had been arrested some days back and had been lodged in \nthe local gaol. Remembering their success at Partabgarh and the \ntactics they had then adopted, the peasants marched to Rae \nBareli town for a mass demonstration. But this time the Govern-, \nment was not going to permit it and additional police and mili- \ntary had been collected to stop the kisans. Just outside the town \non the other side of a little river, the main body of the kisans \nwas stopped. Many of them, however, streamed in from other \ndirections. On arrival at the station I learnt of this situation and \nimmediately I proceeded straight to the river where the military \nwere said to face the peasants. On the way I received a hurriedly \nwritten note from the District Magistrate asking me to go back. \nI wrote my reply on the back of it enquiring under what law and \nwhat section he was was asking me to go back and till I heard \nfrom him I proposed to go on. As I reached the river sounds of \nfiring could be heard from the other side. I was stopped at the \nbridge by the military and as I waited there I was suddenly sur- \nrounded by large numbers of frightened kis,ans who had been \nhiding in the fields on this side ofthe river. So I held a meeting \nof about a couple of thousand peasants on the spot and tried to \nremove their fear and lessen their excitement. It was rather an \nunusual situation with firing going on on their brethren within \na stone\u2019s throw across a little stream and the military in evidence \neve^ujhere. But the meeting was quite successful and took away \n, the edge from the kisans^ fear. The District Magistrate then re- \nturned from the firing line and, at his request, I accompanied \n\u25a0 him to his bouse. There he kept me, under some pretm or other, \njfor over two hours, evidently wanting to keep me away from the \nkisans and my colleagues in the city. \n\nWe found later that many-men had been killed in the firing. \nThe kisans had refused to msperse or to go back but otherwise \nthey had been perfectly peaceful. I am quite sure that if I or \nsome one else they trusted had been there and had asked them to \ndo so they would have dispersed. They refused to take th eir \norders from men they did ndt trust. Some one actually suggested \n\n\n\nWANDERINGS AMONG THE KISANS l \n\nto the Magistrate to wait for me a little but he refused. He could \nDot permit an agitator to succeed where he had failed. That is \nnot the way of foreign governments depending on prestige. \n\nFiring on kisans took place on two occasions in Rae Bareli \ndistrict about that time and then began, what was much worse, a \nreign of terror for every prominent kisan worker or member of a \npanchayat. Government had decided to crush the movement. \nHand-spinning on the charkha was then spreading among the \npeasantry at the instance of the Congress. A charkha therefore \nbecame the symbol of sedition and its owner got into trouble, \nthe charkha itself being often burnt. Thus the Government tried \nto crush by hundreds of arrests and other methods both the \nagrarian and the Congress movements in the rural areas of Rae \nBareli and Partabgarh. Most of the principal workers were com- \nmon to the two movements. \n\nA little later, in the year ipai, Fyzabad district had its dose of \nwidespread repression. The trouble started there in a peculiar \nway. The peasants of some villages went and looted the property \nof a taluqadar. It transpired subsequently that they had been in- \ncited to do so by the servants of another zamindar who had some \nkind of feud with the taluqadar. The poor ignorant peasants \nwere actually told that it was the wish of Mahatma Gandhi that \nthey should loot and they vrillingly agreed to carry out this be- \nhest, shouting \u2018\u2018 Mahatma Gandhi ki jai \u201d in the process. \n\nI was very angry when I heard of this and within a day or two \nof the occurrence I was on the spot, somewhere near Akbarpur \nin Fyzabad district. On arrival I called a meeting for the same \nday and within a few hours five or six thousand persons had \ncollected from numerous villages within a radius of ten miles. I \nspoke harshly to them for the shame they had brought on them- \nselves and our cause and said that the guilty persons must confess \npublicly. (I was full in those days of what I conceived to be the \nspirit of Gandhi ji\u2019s Satyagraha). I called upon those who had par- \nticipated in the looting to raise their hands, and strange to say, \nthere, in the presence of numerous police officials, about two \ndozen hands went up. That meant certain trouble for them. \n\nWhen I spoke to many of them privately later and heard their \nartless story of how they had been misled, I felt vtxj sorry for \ntlipm and I began to regret having exposed these foolish and \nsinmle folk to long terms of imprisonment. But the people who \nsufifoed were not just two or three dozen. The chance w^ too \ngood to be lost and full advantage was tak^ of the occasion to \ncrush the agrarian movement in that district. Over a thousand \narrests were made, and the district gaol was overcrowded, wd the \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\ntrial went on for the best part of a year- Many died in prison \nduring the trial. Many others received long sentences and in later \nyears, when I went to prison, I came across some of them, boys \nand young men, spending their youth in prison. \n\nThe Indian kisans have little staying power, little energy to \nresist for long. Famines and epidemics come and slay them in \ntheir millions. It was surprising that they had shown for a whole \nyear great powers of resistance against the combined pressure of \ngovernment and landlord. But they began to weary a little and \nthe determined attack of the Government on their movement \nultimately broke its spirit for the time being. But it continued \nstill in a lower key. There were not such vast demonstrations \nas before, but most villages contained old workers who had not \nbeen terrorised and who carried on the work in a small way. All \nthis, it must be remembered, was prior to the gaol-going which \nthe Congress started at the end of . Even in this the kisans \ntook a considerable part, in spite of all they had suffered during \nthe previous year. \n\nFrightened by the agrarian movement, the Government had \nhurried on with tenancy legislation. This promised some im- \nprovement in the lot of the kisan but the measure was toned \ndown when it was found that the movement was already under \ncontrol. The principal change it affected was to give a life ten- \nancy to the kisan in Oudh. This sounded attractive to him but, \nas he has found out subsequently, his lot is in no way better. \n\nAgrarian troubles continued to crop up in Oudh but on a \nsmaller scale. The world depression which began in , how- \never, again created a great crisis owing to the fall in prices.  TRADE UNION CONGRESS \n\nThe Simon Commission boycott and the All Parties Conference \nbulked largely politically in the country that year, but my own \ninterest and activities lay largely in other directions. As working \nGeneral Secretary of the Confess, I was busy in looking after \nand strengthening its organisation, and I was particularly in- \nterested in directmg people\u2019s attention to social and economic \nchanges. The position gained in Madras in regard to Inde- \npendence had also to be consolidated, especially as the tendency \nof the All Parties Conference was to pull us back. With this \npurpose in view I travelled a great deal and addressed many im- \nportant gatherings. I presided, I think, over four provincial \nconferences in igaS \u2014 ^in the Punjab, in Nl^abar in the South, in \nDelhi, and in the United Provinces \u2014 as well as over Youth \nLeagues and Students\u2019 Conferences in Bengal and Bombay. From \ntime to time I visited rural areas in the U.P. and occasionally I \naddressed industrial workers. The burden of my speeches was \nalways much the same though the fiirm varied according to local \ncircumstances and the stress draended on the kind of audience I \nhappened to be addressing. Everywhere I spoke on political \n.hidependence and social freedom and made the former a step \ntowards the attainment of the latter. I wanted to spread the \nideology^f .socia lism especially among Congress workers and \nthe intelligentsia, for these people, who were the backbone of the \nnational movement, thought largely in terms of the narrowest \nnationalism. Their speeches laid stress on the glories of old \ntimes; the injuries, material and spiritual, caused by alien rule; \nthe sufrerings of our people; the indignity of foreign domination \nover us and our national honour demanding that we should be \nfree; the necessi^ for sacrifice at the altar of the motherland. \nThey were familiar themes which found an echo in every Indian \nheart, and the nationalist in me responded to them and was \nmoved by them (though I was never a blind admirer of ancient \ntimes in India or elsewhere). But though the truth in them re- \nmained, they seemed to grow a little thin and thread-bare with \nranstant use, and their ceaseless repetition prevented the con- \nsideration of other problems and vital aspects of our struggle. \nThey only fostered emotion and did not encourage thought. \ny I was by no means a pioneer in the socialist field in India. In- \n\n\n\nTRADE UNION CONGRESS  \n\ndeed I was rather backward and I had only advanced painfully, \nstep by step, where many others had gone ahead blazing a trail. \nThe workers' trade union movement was, ideologically, definitely \nsocialist, and so were the majority of the Youth Leagues. A \nvague confused socialism was already part of the atmosphere of \nIndia when I returned from Europe in December , and even \nearlier than that there were many individual soci^sts. Mostly \nthey thought along utopian lines, but Marxian theory was in* \nfluencing them increasingly, and a few considered themselves as \nhundred per cent. Marxists. This tendency was strengthened in \nIndia, as in Europe and America, by developments in the Soviet \nUnion, and particularly the Five-Year Plan. \n\nSuch inmortance as I possessed as a socialist worker lay in the \nfact that X happened to be a prominent Congressman holding \nimportant Congress offices. There were many other well-known \nCongressmen who were beginning to think likewise. This was \nmost marked in the U.P. Provincial Congress Committee, and in \nthis Committee we even tried, as early as , to draw up a mild \nsocialist programme. We are a zamindari and taluqadari pro- \nvince, and the first question we had to face was that of the \nland. We declared that the existing land system must go and \nthat there should be no intermediaries between the State and the \ncultivator. We had to proceed cautiously, as we were moving in \nan atmosphere which was, till then, unusued to such ideas. \n\nThe next year, , the U.P. Provincial Congress Committee \nwent a step further and made a recommendation, definitdy on \nsocialist lines, to the All-India Congress Committee. This latter \nCommittee, meeting in Bombay in the summer of , adopted \nthe preamble of the U.P. resolution and thus accepted the prin- \nciple of socialism underlying the whole resolution. The con- \nsideration of the detailed programme given in the UJP. resolution \nwas postponed for a later date. Most people seem to have for- \ngotten these resolutions of the A.I.C.C. and the U.P.P.C.G. and \nimagine that the subject of socialism has suddenly cropped up in \nthe Congress during the last year or so. It is true, however, that \nthe A.I.C,C. passed that resolution without giving much thought \nto it and most members probably did not realise what they were \ndoing. \n\nThe U.P. branch of the Independence for India League (con- \nsisting entirely of principal Congress workers in the province) \nwas definitely sociahstic and it went a little further than a mixed \nbody like the Congress Conunittee could go. Indeed one of the \nobjects of the Independence League was socialfisedom. We had \nhoped to build up a strong League organisation all over India \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nand utilize it for propaganda in favour of independence and \nsocialism. Unhappily, and much to my disappointment, the \nLeague never got going except to some extent in the U,P. This \nwas not because of lack of support in the country. But most of \nour workers were also prominent workers in the Congress, and, \nthe Congress having adopted Independence in theory at least, \nthey could always work through the Congress organisation. \nAnother reason was that some of the original sponsors of the \nLeague did not take it seriously enough as an organisation to be \ndeveloped. They looked upon it as something to be used for \nbringing pressure to bear on the Congress executive, or even for \ninfluencing the elections for the Congress Working Committee. \nSo the Independence League languished, and as the Congress \ngrew more aggressive, it drew all the dynamic elements towards \nItself and the League grew weaker. With the coming of the Civil \nDisobedience struggle in J, the League got merged into the \nCongress and disappeared. \n\nIn the second hilf of  and in  there was frequent talk \nof my arrest. I do not know what reality lay behind the press \nreferences and the numerous private warnings I received from \nfriends who seemed to be in the know, but the warnings pro- \nduced a feeling of uncertainty in me and I felt I was always on \nthe verge of it. I did not mind this parricularly as I knew that, \nwhatever the fiimre held for me, it could not be a settled life of \nroutine. The sooner I got used to uncertainty and sudden changes \nand visits to prison the better. And I think that on the whole I \nsucceeded in getting used to the idea (and to a much lesser extent \nmy people also succeeded) and whenever arrest came I took it \nmore casually than I might otherwise have done. So rumours of \narrest were not without compensation; they gave a certain ex- \ncitement and a bite to my daily existence. Every day of freedom \nwas something precious, a day gained. As a matter of fact I \nhad a long innings in  and , and arrest came at last as \nTate as April . Since then my brief periods outside prison \nhave had a measure of unreality about them, and I have lived in \nmy house as a stranger on a short visit, or moved about uncer- \ntamly, not knowing what the morrow would hold for me, and \nwith the constant expectation of a call back, to gaol. \n\nAs  approached its appointed end, the Calcutta Congress \ndrew near. My fether was to preside over it. He was full of the \nAll Parties Conference and of his Report to it and wanted to \npush this through the Congress. To this he knew that I was not \nagreeable, because I , was not prepared to compromise on the \nIndependence issue, and this irritated him. We did not argue \n\n\n\nTRADE UNION CONGRESS S \n\nabout the matter much, but there was a definite feeling of mental \nconflict between us, an attempt to pull tlifFerent w'ays. Dif- \nferences of opinion we had often had before, vital differences \nwhich had kept us in different political camps. But I do not \nthink that at any previous or subsequent occasion the tension had \nbeen so great. Both of us were rather unhappy about it. In \nCalcutta matters came to this, that my father made it known \nthat if he could not have his way in the Congress \u2014 ^that is, if he \ncould not have a majority for the resolution in favour of the \nAll Parties Report \u2014 ^he would refuse to preside over the Congress, \nThat was a perfectly reasonable and constitutional course to \nadopt. None the less it was disconcerting to many of his oppo- \nnents who did not wish to force the issue to this extent. There \nhas often been a tendency in the Congress, and elsewhere, I \nsuppose, to criticise and condemn and yet shrink from accepting \nresponsibility; there is always a hope that the criticism will make \nthe other party change its course to our advantage without cast- \ning on us the burden of piloting the boat. Where responsibility \nis withheld from us and there is an irremovable and irresponsible \nexecutive, as there is in the Government of India to-day, criticism \nis all that is open to us (apart, of course, from action), and that \ncriticism is bound to be negative criticism. Even so, if that \nnegative criticism is to be effective, there must he behind it \nthe mental preparation and preparedness to assume full con- \ntrol and responsibility whenever the opportunity offers itself \n\u2014 control over every department of government, civil and mili- \ntary, internal and foreign. To ask for partial control only, as, \nfor instance, the Liberals do in the matter of the army, is to \nconfess our inability to run the show and to take the sting out \nof the criticism. \n\nThis attitude of criticism and condemnation and yet a shrink- \ning back fiom the natural consequences thereof, has been frequent \nin the case of Gandhiji\u2019s critics. There have been a number of \npeople in the Congress who dislike many of his activities and \ncriticise them strongly but who are not prepared to drive him out \nof the Congress. This attitude is easy to understand but it is \nhardly fair to either party. \n\nSome such difficulties arose at the Calcutta Congress. There \nwere negotiations between the two groups, and a compromise \nformula was announced, and then this fell through. It was all \nrather confusing and not very edifying. The main resolution of \nthe Congress, as it was finally adopted, accepted the All Parties \nReport -but intimated that if the British Government did not \nagree to that constitution within a year, the Congress would \n\n\n\nl JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nrevert to Independence. It was an otter of a year\u2019s grace and a \n' polite ultimatum. The resolution was no doubt a come-down \nfrom the ideal of independence, for the All Parties Report did \nnot even ask for full Dominion Status. And yet it was probably \na wise resolution in the sense that it prevented a split when no \none was ready for it, and kept the Congress together for the \nstruggle that began in . It was clear enough that the British \nGovernment were not going to accept the All Parties Constitu- \ntion within a year. The struggle was inevitable and, as matters \nstood in the country, no such struggle could be at all effective \nwithout Gandhiji\u2019s lead. \n\nI had opposed the resolution in the open Congress, though I \ndid so half-heartedly. And yet I was again elected General \nSecretary  Whatever happened I managed to stick on to the \nsecretaryship, and in the Congress sphere I seemed to act the \npart of the famous Vicar of Bray. Whatever president sat on \nthe Congress throne, still I was secretary in charge of the organi- \nsation. \n\nA few days before the Calcutta Congress, the All-India Trade \nUnion Congress was held at Jhaiia, the centre of the coal mine \narea. I attended and participated in it for the first two days and \nthen had to go away to Calcutta. It was my first Trade Union \nCongress and I was practically an outsider, though my activities \namonrat the peasantry, and lately amongst the workers, had \ngained for me a measure of popularity with the masses. I found \nthe old tussle going on between the reformists and the more \nadvanced and revolutionary elements. The main points in issue \nwere the question of afiiliation to one of the Internationals, as \nwell as to the League against Imperialism and the Pan-Pacific \nUnion, and the desirabuity of sending representatives to the \nInternational Labour Office Conference at Geneva. More impor- \ntant than these questions was the vast difference in outlook \nbetween the two sections of the Congress. There was the old \ntrade union group, moderate in politics and indeed disprusting \nihe intrusion of politics in industrial matters. They believed in \nindustrial action only and that too of a cautious character, and \naimed at the gradual betterment of workers\u2019 conditions. \u201eThe \nleader of this grotro was N. M. Joshi, who had often represented \nIn^an labour at Geneva. Hie other group was more militant, \nbelieved in political action, and opemy proclaimed its revolu- \ntionary outlook. It was influencea, though by no means con- \ntrolled, by some Communists and near-Communists. Bombay \ntextile labour had been captured by this group, and under their \nleadership there, had been a great, and partly successful, textile \n\n\n\nTRADE UNION CONGRESS  \n\nStrike in Bombay. A new and powerful textile union had risen \nin Bombay, the Girni Kamgar Union, which dominated the \nlabour situation in Bombay. Another powerful imion under \nthe influence of the advanced group was the G.I.P. Railway \nUnion. \n\nEver since the inception of the Trade Union Congress the \nexecutive and the office had been in the control of N. M. Joshi \nand his close colleagues, and Joshi had been responsible for \nbuilding up the movement. The radical group, though more \npowerful in the rank and file, had little opportunity of in- \nfluencing policy at the top. This was an unsatisfactory position \nand it did not reflect the true state of affairs. There was dissatis- \nfaction and friction and a desire on the part of the radical \nelements to seize power in the T.U.C. At the same time there \nwas a disinclination to carry matters too far, for a split was \nfeared. The trade union movement was still in its early youth in \nIndia; it was weak and was largely being run by non-worker \nleaders. Always, under such circumstances, there is a tendency \nfor outsiders to exploit workers and this was obvious enough in \nthe Indian T.U.C. and labour unions. N. M. Joshi had, however, \nproved himself, by years of work, a sound and earnest trade \nunionist, and even those who considered him politically back- \nward and moderate, acknowledged the worth or his services to \nthe Indian Labour movement. This could be said of few others, \nmoderate or advanced. \n\nMy own sympathies at Jharia were with the advanced group \nbut, being a newcomer, I felt a little at sea in these domestic \nconflicts of the T.U.C. and I decided to keep aloof from them. \nAfter I had left Jharia the annual T.U.C, elections took place, \nand I learnt at Cdcutta that I had been elected president for the \nnext year. I had been put forward by the moderate group, \nprobably because they felt that I stood the best chance of defeat- \ning the other candidate who was an actual worker (on the \nrailways) and who had been put forward by the radical group. \nIf I had bem present at Jharia on the day of the election I \nam sure that I would have withdrawn in favour of the worker \ncandidate. It seemed to me positively indecent that a newcomer \nand a non-worker should be suddenly thrust into the president- \nship. , This was in itself a measure ot the infancy and weakness \nof the trade union movement in India. \n\nNineteen twenty-eight had been full of labour disputes and \nstrikes; nineteen twenty-nine carried on likewise. Bombay textile \nlabour, miserable and militant, took the lead in these strikes. \nThere was a big general strike in the Bengal Jute Mills. There? \n\n\n\nj JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nwere also strikes in the Iron Works at Jamshedpur, and, I think, \non the railways. A long drawn out struggle, bravely carried on \nfor many months, took place in the Tin Plate Works in Jam- \nshedpur. In spite of great public sympathy, the workers were \ncrushed by the powerful company (connected with the Burma \nOil Company) ow'ning these works. \n\nAltogether the two years were fiiU of industrial unrest, and \nthe conditions of labour were deteriorating. The post-war years \nhad been boom years for industry in India and the most \nstupendous profits had been made. For five or six years the \naverage dividend in the jute or cotton mills exceeded a hundred \nper cent, and was often   per cent, per annum. All these huge \nprofits went to the owners and shareholders, and the workers \ncontinued as before. The slight rise in wages was usually counter- \nbalanced by a rise in prices. During these days when millions \nwere being made feverishly, most of the workers continued to \nlive in the most miserable of hovels, and even their women- \nfolk had hardly clothes to wear. The conditions in Bombay \nwere bad enough, but perhaps even worse was the lot of the \njute workers, within an hour\u2019s drive of the palaces of Calcutta. \nSemi-naked women, wild and unkempt, working away for the \nbarest pittance, so that a broad river of wealth should flow \nceaselessly to Glasgow and Dundee, as well as to some pockets \nin India. \n\nIn the boom years all went well for industry, though the \nworkers carried on as before and profited little. But when the \nboom passed and it was not so easy to make large profits, the \nburden, of course, fell on thC' workers. The old profits were \nforgotten; they had been consumed. And if profits were not now \nsufficient, how could industry run? And so there was industrial \nunrest and labour troubles and the gigantic strikes in Bombay \nwhich impressed everybody and fidghtened both the employers \nand Government. The Labour Movement was becoming class- \nconscious, militant and dangerous, both in ideology and in \norganisation. The political situation was also developing fast, \nand, though the two were separate and unconnected, they were \npartly parallel, and the Government could not contemplate the \nfuture with any satisfaaion. \n\nIn March  the Government struck suddenly at organised \nlabour by arresting some of its most prominent workers firom the \nadvanced groups. The leaders of the Bombay Girni Kamgar \nUnion were taken, as well as labour leaders horn Bengal, the \nU.P. and the Punjab. Some of these were communists, others \nwere near-communists, yet others were just trade unionists. This \n\n\n\nTRADE UNION CONGRESS S \n\nwas the beginning of the famous Meerut trial which lasted for \nfour years and a half. \n\nA defence committee was formed for the Meerut accused, of \nwhich my father was chairman. Dr. Ansari and others, including \nmyself, were members. We had a difficult task. Money \nwas not easy to collect; it seemed that the moneyed people had \nno great .sympathy for commtmists and socialists and labour \nagitators. And lawyers would only sell their services for a full \npound of somebody\u2019s flesh. We had some eminent lawyers on \nour Committee, my father and others, and they were always \navailable for consultation and general guidance. That did not \ncost us anything, but it was not possible for them to sit down in \nMeerut for months at a time. The other lawyers whom we \napproached seemed to look upon the case as a means of making \nas much money as possible. \n\nApart firom the Meerut Case I have been connected with some \nother defence com m ittees \u2014 ^in M. N. Roy\u2019s case and others. On \neach occasion I have marvelled at the cupidity of men of my own \nprofession. My first big shock came during the Punjab Martial \nLaw trials in  when a very eminent leader of the profession \ninsisted on his full fee\u2014and it was a huge fee \u2014 firom the victims \nof Martial Law, one of them even a fdlow-lawyer, and many \nof these people had to borrow money or sell property to pay him. \nMy later experiences were even more painful. We had to collect \nmoney, often in coppers from the poorest workers, and pay \nout ftit cheques to lawyers. It went against the grain. And \nthe whole process seemed so futile for, whether we defended a \npolitical or labour case or not, the result was likely to be the \nsame. In a case like the Meerut trial a defence was, of course, \nobviously called for from many points of view. \n\nThe Meerut Case Defence Committee did not have an easy \ntime with the accused. There were different kinds of people \namong these, with different types of defences, and often there was \nan utter absence of harmony among them. After some months \nwe wound up the formal committee, but we continued to help \nin our individual capacities. The development of the political \nsituation was absorbing more and more of our attention, and in \n all of us were ourselves in gaol.  A SOUTHERN HOLIDAY \n\nMy doctors urged me to take some rest and go for a chtmge, \nand I decided to spend a month in Ceylon. India, huge as the \ncountry is, did not offer a real prospect of change or mental \nrest, for wherever I might go, I would probably come across \n\ng olitical associates and the same problems would pursue me. \n\nleylon was the nearest place within reach of India, and so to \nCeylon we went \u2014 ^Kamala, Indira and I. That was the first \nholiday I had had since our return from Europe in , the \nfirst time since then that my wife and daughter and I holidayed \ntogether peacefully with little to distract our attention. There \nhas been no repetition of that experience, and sometimes I \nwonder if there will be any. \n\nAnd yet we did not rea% have much rest in Ceylon, except \nfor two weeks at Nuwara Eliya.. We were fairly overwhelmed \nby the hospitality and firiendliness of all classes of people there. \nIt was very pleasant to find all this goodwill, but it was often \nembarrassing also. At Nuwara Eliya groups of labourers, tea- \ngarden workers and others would come dail^, walking many \nmiles, bringing gracious gifts with them\u2014 wild flowers, vege- \ntables, home-made butter. We could not, as a rule, even con- \nverse together; we merely looked at each other and smiled. \nOur little house was fiiU of these precious gifts of theirs, which \nthey had given out of their poverty, and we passed them on to \nthe local hospital and orphanages. \n\nWe visited many of the fttmous sights and historical ruins \nof the island, and Buddhist monasteries, and the rich tropical \nforests. At i^uradhapura, I liked greatly an old seated statue \n\u2022of the Buddha. A year later, when I was in Dehra Dun Gaol, a \nfriend in Ceylon sent me a picture of this statue, and I kept it \non my little table in my cell. It became a precious companion \nfor me, and the strong, calm features of Buddha\u2019s statue \nsoothed me and gave me strength and helped me to overcome \nmany a period of depression. \n\nBuddha has always had a great appeal for me. It is diflScult \nfor me to analyse this appeal, but it is not a religious appeal, \nand I am not interested m foe dogmas that have grown up \nround Buddhism. It is the personality that has drawn me. So \nalso the personality of Christ has attracted me greatly. \n\n* \n\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NtHRU \n\n\n \n\nI saw manj Buddhist hhikhus (monks) in their monasteries \nand on the highways, meeting with respect wherever they went. \nThe dominant expression of almost all of them was one of \npeace and calm, a strange detachment from the cares of the \nworld. They did \"not have intellectual faces, as a rule, and \nthere was no trace of the fierce conflicts of the mind on their \ncountenances. Life seemed to be for them a smooth-flowing \nriver moving slowly to the great ocean. I looked at them with \nsome envy, with just a faint yearning for a ha!ven, but I knew \nwell enough that my lot was a different one, cast in storms and \ntempests. There was to be no haven for me, for the tempests \nwithin me were as stormy as those outside. And if perchance I \nfound myself in a safe harbour, protected from the fury of the \nwinds, would I be contented or happy there? \n\nFor a little while the harbour was pleasant, and one could lie \ndown and dream and allow the soothing and enervating charm \nof the tropics to steal over one. Ceylon fitted in with my mood \nthen, and the beauty of the island filled me with delight. Our \nmonth of holiday was soon over, and it was with real regret \nthat we bade good-bye. So many memories come back to me \nof Ae land and her peoplej they have been pleasant com- \npanions during the long, empty days in prison. One little inci- \ndent lingers in my memory; it was near JafEna, I think. The \nteachers and boys of a school stopped our car and said a few \nwords of greeting. The ardent, eager faces of die boys stood \nout, and then one of their number came to me, shook hands \nwith me, and without question or argument, said : \" I will not \nfilter.\u2019' That bright young face with shining eyes, full of deter- \nmination, is imprinted in iny mind. I do not know who he was; \n\nI have lost trace of him. But somehow I have the conviction \nthat he will remain true to his word and will not falter when he \nhas to face life\u2019s difficult problems. \n\nFrom Ceylon we went to South India, right to the southern \ntip at Cape Comorin. Amazingly peaceful it was there. And \nffien through Travancore, Cochin, Malabar, Mysore, Hydera- \nuB-d \u2014 ^mostly Indian States, some the most progressive of their \nkind, some the most backward. Travancore and Cochin educa- \ntionally far in advance of British India; Mysore probably ahead \nindustrially; Hyderabad almost a perfect feudal relic. We re- \nceived courtesy and welcome everywhere, both from the people \nand the authorities, but bdiind that welcome I could sense \nthe armety of the latter lest our visit might lead the people \nto think dangerously, Mysore and Travancore seemed to give \nsome avil liberty and opportunities of political work at the \n\n\n\n\nINDIRA PRIYADARSHINI \nJawaharlal\u2019s daughter \n\n\n\nA SOUTHERN HOLIDAY \n\n\ntime; in Hyderabad even this was wholly absent; and I felt, in \nspite of the courtesy that surrounded us, stifled and suffocated. \nLatterly the Mysore and Travancore governments have with- \ndravm even the measure of civil liberty and political activity \nthat they had previously permitted. \n\nIn Bangalore, in the Mysore State, I had hoisted at a great \ngathering a national flag on an enormous iron pole. Not long \nafter my departure this pole was broken up into bits, and the \nMysore government made the display of the flag an offence. \nThis ill-treatment and insult of the flag I had hoisted pained \nme greatly. \n\nIn Travancore to-day even the Congress has been made an \nunlawful association, and no one can enrol ordinary members \nfor it, although in British India it is now laivful since the with- \ndrawal of civil disobedience. Thus both Mysore and Travan- \ncore are crushing ordinary peaceful political activity and have \ntaken back some facilities they had previously allowed. They \nhave moved backwards. Hyderabad had no necessity for going \nback or withdrawing facilities, for it had never moved forward \nat all or given any facility of the kind. Political meetings are \nunknown in Hyderabad, and even social and religious gather- \nings are looked upon with suspicion, and specid permission \nhas to be taken for them. There are no newspapers worthy of \nthe name issued there, and, in order to prevent the germs of \ncorruption from coming from outeide, a large number of news- \npapers published in other parts of India are prevented entry. \nSo strict is this policy of exclusion that even Moderate journals \nare excluded. \n\nIn Cochin we visited the quarter of the \u2018White Jews\u2019, as \nthey are called, and saw one of the services in their old taber- \nnade. The little community is very andent and very unique. \nIt is dwindling in numbers. The part of Cochin they live in, \nwe were told, resembled andent Jerusalem. It certainly had an \nandent look about it. \n\nWe also visited, along the backwaters of Malabar, some of \nthe\" towns inhabited chiefly by Christians belonging to the \nSyrian churches. Few people realise that Christianity came to \nIndia as early as the first century after Christ, long beft>re \nEurope turned to it, and established a firm hold in' South India. \nAlthough these Christians have their religious head in Antioch \nor somewhere in Syria, their Christianity is practically indi- \ngenous and has j^w outside contacts. \n\nTo my surprise, we also came across a colony of Nestorians in \nthe South; I was told by their bishop that there were ten thou- \n\nT \n\n\n\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU \n\nsand of them. I had laboured under the impression that the Nes- \ntorians had long be.en absorbed in other sects, and I did not \nknow that they had ever flourished in India. But I was told \nthat at one time they had a fairly large following in India, \n.extending as far north as Benares. \n\nWe had gone to Hyderabad especially to pay a visit to Mrs. \nSarojini Naidu and her daughters, Padmaja and Leilamani. \nDuring our stay with them a small purdanashin gathering of \nwomen assembled at their house to meet my wife, and Kamala \napparently addressed them. Probably she spoke of women\u2019s \nstruggle for freedom against man-made laws and customs (a \nfavourite topic of hers) and urged the women not to be too \nsubmissive to their menfolk. Ihere was an interesting sequel \nto this two or three weeks later, when a distracted husband \nwrote to Kamala from Hyderabad and said that since her visit \nto that city his wife had behaved strangely. She would not \nlisten to him and fall in with his wishes, as she used to, but \nwould argde with him and even adopt an aggressive attitude. \n\nSeven weeks after we had sailed from Bombay fer Ceylon we \nwere back in that dty, and immediately I plimged again into \nthe whirlpool of Congress politics. There were meetings of the \nWorking Committee to consider vital problems\u2014 a rapidly- \nchanging and developing situation in India, the U.P. agrarian \nimpasse, the phenomenal growth of the \u2018 Redshirt \u2019 movement \nin the Frontier province under Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan\u2019s \nleadership, Bengal in an extreme state of tension and sup- \npressed anger and unrest, the ever-present communal problem, \nand petty local conflicts, over a variety of issues, between Con- \ngressmen and Government oflSdals, involving mutual charges \nof breaches of the Delhi Pact. And then there was the ever- \nrecurring question: was the Congress to be represented at the \nsecond Round Table Conference? Should Mahatma Gandhi go \nthere? "
