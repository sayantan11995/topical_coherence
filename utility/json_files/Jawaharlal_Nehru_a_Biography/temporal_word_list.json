    "1912-1916": " Unformative Years\nThe broad details of the early life of Jawaharlal Nehru are by now well known.\nHe himself, in his Autobiography, looked back with an untinted eye and pro\u00ac\nvided a fairly detached, and even critical, account which has since been fre\u00ac\nquently paraphrased, and sometimes embroidered, by later writers. He was\nborn at . p.m. on  November  at Allahabad, to which place his\nfather, Motilal Nehru, had moved three years earlierTrom Kanpur. Jawahar\u00ac\nlal \u2014 the name was one which its owner never greatly fancied \u2014 was doted on\nby his parents; and this is not surprising, as Motilal had lost both a wife and\nson, had married again, and had lost another son before Jawaharlal, who re\u00ac\nmaided an only child for eleven years.\nNothing, therefore, was going to be denied to Jawaharlal. A pampered\nchild surrounded by luxury, with a private swimming pool and tennis court,\nJawaharlal ran the risk of being smothered by devotion and affluence. Though\nMotilal\u2019s explosive temper frequently mitigated his spoiling of his son, there\nwere no checks on the adulation Jawaharlal received from his mother, Swaruprani Nehru. As so often happened in Indian families of those days, the lack of\ncompanionship between husband and wife led to the mother building her\nlife and her affections round her son.\nThe mother\u2019s influence ensured an Indian environment. The atmosphere\nof Hindu custom and folklore was not lacking in the Nehru home, and\nJawaharlal picked up a great deal of legend from the women and indulged in\ntemple-going and Ganga-bathing. When, in , the father bought what was\nlater known as Swaraj Bhawan, the boy was no doubt often told that this was\non the site where, according to story, the rishi Bharadwaja hoi had his uni\u00ac\nversity, and that across the road where once the Ganga had flowed Rama was\nreported to have halted on his way toexile. But the Nehru family was never fully\nintegrated into the high-caste Hindu society of Allahabad, for not only was\nMotilal a relative newcomer but he had been excommunicated in  for\nhis refusal to make atonement for having travelled overseas. This insulated\n*rom t^le rev\u2018valism then rampant in Hindu orthodox circles in\nAllahabad, and even cut them off from the more orthodox sections among\n\nUNFORMATIVE YEARS \nthe Kashmiri Pandits. Even as late as , there was always a problem about\nthe women of the Nehru household dining together with other Kashmiri\nwomen at weddings and other ceremonies.\nHowever, the Kashmiri Pandit community derived certain incidental\nadvantages which distinguished it from the other Hindus. Among the Hindus\nof Kashmir, there were no castes below the Brahmins; and so while the\nPandits were very conscious of their status, inter-caste antagonisms did not\nenter deeply into their lives. There was also, among the Kashmiri Pandits,\noften little feeling of separateness from the Muslims. A small enclave com\u00ac\nmunity totalling never more than five to seven per cent in a State where the\nmajority was Muslim, many of its members learnt Persian and sought official\nservice. This eclectic, cosmopolitan tendency continued even among those\nwho migrated southwards to the plains. Motilal himself was, like his ancestors,\nmore fluent in Arabic and Persian and in Urdu than in any other Indian langu\u00ac\nage. The chief retainer of his household was a Muslim, and it wasfrom Mubarak\nAli that .Jawahkrlal heard innumerable stories of heroism and tragedy of the\nyears of the revolt.\nThe fortunes of the Nehrus had for generations been tied to Muslim patrons.\nThere is no evidence for saying that in the early eighteenth century, Farruksiyar,\nthe Mogul emperor, had invited Raj Kaul to join his court at Delhi. All that we\ndo know is that Raj Kaul came to Delhi, and gradually the Kauls assumed the\ndouble-barrelled name of Kaul-Nehrus, because, it is said, their house was\nsituated on the banks of a canal (nahar in Urdu). Then, after the revolt of\n, and the final collapse of the Mogul, the Kaul-Nehrus moved to Agra.\nThey had left the canal, but it was the Kaul part of the name that gradually\ndropped out. The use of surnames in India was the result of British influence,\nand it is possible that as the Kaul-Nehrus were drawn into the British adminis\u00ac\ntrative network, they began to use that surname which was less indicative of\ntheir caste origins. Ifthis be so, it hides an irony. The use ofthe surname Nehru\ndid not become common till much later, and even after.it did, both father and\nson were commonly addressed as Pandit Motilal and Pandit Jawaharlal. Hard\nas he tried, Jawaharlal could nevershake off this prefix which he found distaste\u00ac\nful, and was referred to respectfully by his countrymen as \u2018Panditji\u2019.\nThe Nehrus were one of the many Indian families who took advantage of\nthe conditions and opportunities created by the raj. At Delhi their landed estate\nhad gradually dwindled, and Motilal\u2019s father, Ganga Dhar Nehru, was a minor,\npolice official. A portrait of him that exists depicts him in Mogul costume. He\n\u2022 \u2022\u00bb \u2022 . \u2019 *\u2022 ^\nAUtmiiaHaksar, The Future That Way(pehi, ),-p.Z. ^' .*\nSeeT. N. Madan, Family and Khtship, a study of the Pandits of rural Kashmir !London, ),\np. . \u201d\n*This was Motilal\u2019s theory, to which Jawaharlal gave currency in his Autobiography, but oil the\nother hand, it has to be remembered that there were Nehrus even in Kashmir.\nAs late as  the list of delegates to the Congress session at Allahabad mentions not Motilal\nNehru but \u2019Pandit Motilal, Hindu, Brahmin, Vakil High Court, North West Provinces.'\nvJi\u2019 denotes respect.\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\ndied in , three months before the birth of Motilal, but the two older\nbrothers, who themselves had taken service directly under the British or in a\nneighbouring Indian state, saw to it that Motilal received a proper education\nin the English language. He was a bright pupil, though he never graduated,\nand set up legal practice, first inKanpur and then in Allahabad. The vast web of\nlitigation created in the North-West Provinces by the talukdari system, debt,\nalienation, succession and transfers, and the enforcements of the revenue law\nmade the province a paradise for an ambitious lawyer. Specializing in these\nbranchesofthe civil law, with many clients among the zamindars and talukdars\nand links doubtless with the Kashmiri Pandits who had infiltrated into the\nlanded estates, soon Motilal became one of the leaders of the Allahabad Bar.\nThough Motilal had been born poor, had acquired many responsibilities at\nan early age as head of a large Hindu joint family, and was professionally equip\u00ac\nped rather than generally educated, he had no complexes. A cheerful extrovert,\nfull of the confidence and inner balance that come from self-made success, he\nset about living the life of an English gentleman. A photograph taken in \nshows him attired in English style, his wife, who was from an orthodox family\nof Lahore, in traditional Kashmiri dress, and his five-year-old son in a sailor\nsuit. It is the kind of photograph a bourgeois English family would have had\ntaken on a visit to Brighton.\nEven the fact that his country was under alien rule did not subdue Motilal.\nHe was too busy making Money, and enjoying what money could buy. As soon\nas he could, he moved tw ay from the traditional residential area of the Hindu\nmiddle class, and, till he bought a house of his own, lived in theCivil Lines where\nhis neighbours were mostly British. He entertained generously, and his natural\ncourtesy enabled him to overcome the restrictions of Anglo-Indian society and\ntomake a numberof English friends. His house wasfitted with the latest gadgets\nimported from Europe. Like most members of the educated Indian dlite, he\ntook an interest in politics and dutifully attended as many sessions of the Indian\nNational Congress as he could. But these were the years when the Congress\nwas a loyalist organization, interested not in subverting British rule, not even\nin extracting concessions from it, but in pleading for greater opportunities for\nservice.\nSo it was but natural that Motilal should want for his son the best that\nBritish education could offer. He first engaged two English governesses, and\nthen sent his son for a few months to a local convent and finally decided on\nprivate instruction at home. The great Sanskrit scholar, Pandit Ganganatha\nJha, tried, with no noticeable success, to teach Jawaharlal Sanskrit. But the\nmain emphasis was on a British tutor. A young and ardent Irish-French theosophist, F. T. Brooks, who had been recommended by Mrs Annie Besant, wasin\ncharge of Jawaharlal\u2019s education from  to . Brooks would seem to\n\u2018See the chapter 'The Frustration of Legal Remedy\u2019 in E. Whitcombe.\u2019aA^rawa* Conditions in\nNorthern Mia, vol.  (Los Angeles, ), pp. ff.\nJP- J.

He introduced him to English poetry\nand literature and developed in him an interest in science by improvising a tiny\nlaboratory in his rooms. He also, by allowing Jawaharlal to be present at his\nregular discourses on theosophy, planted in the boy\u2019s mind the idea that there\nmight be more in religion than myth and miracle. The concept of ethics is what\nJawaharlal perhaps rather vaguely comprehended when, at Brooks's instance,\nhe read the not-too-easy Upantshods and the Bhagavad Gita. Certainly he was\nsufficiently engaged to seek and secure, at the age of thirteen, his father\u2019s per\u00ac\nmission to become a theosophist; and Mrs Besant herself initiated him at a\nsolemn ceremony in Banaras. Motilal was right in not taking thisseriously, and\nsoon, once Brooks\u2019s influence was removed, Jawaharlal forgot all about the\nepisode. But it was, in fact, more than a charade, and indicative of the delicacy\nof the young mind and spirit. Theosophy would also seem to have had a more\npermanent, though not major, influence, probably at a subconscious level,\nthan Jawaharlal ever acknowledged. He always, for instance, unlike his father,\nfavoured an austerity of diet.\nDissatisfied with private tuition, and in particular with Brooks, in May \nMotilal took his family to Britain and secured admission for his son at Harrow.\nJawaharlal was now a boy of fifteen. Not very tall, and slightly built, he was\nhandsome with a fair skin, clear features and well-brushed black hair which\nwas, however, never very thick. For some time he sported a moustache, not so\nmuch because he fancied it as to please his father, who, did not like his son\u2019s\nshaven face. In other words, you look like a fool.\u2019 He was good at his school\nwork and impressed his teachers. \u2018He looks very well and happy\u2019 wrote the\nheadmaster to his father, \u2018and is doing remarkably well in every way, being\nagain head of his form, and winning golden opinions from his masters for his\nindustry and ability.\u2019 The school report in October  read, \u2018Inaccurate in\nFrench grammar, Latin poor, but he prepares well. English subjects excellent.\nProgress good \u2014 has brains.\u2019 In fact Jawaharlal was clever and diligent, and\nthis was his best academic phase. He never fulfilled academically, in later years\nat Cambridge or the Bar, the promise he showed at Harrow. The reason was\nthat he was not very keen, did not share his father\u2019s ambition for such prizes as\nthe senior wranglership and did well at school merely because there was at this\ntime very little else that interested him. He carried out his fagging duties, joined\nthe chess club, played football and cricket, ran in the half-mile and mile races\nand in the cross-country steeplechase and was often in the gymnasium and on\nthe ice-rink \u2014 but all in a rather desultory way. Only the Officers Training\nCorps roused any enthusiasm.\nJawaharlal was not unhappy at Harrow, and when he left after two years,\nTheosophy in India (), p..\nMotilal to Jawaharlal,  December .\nDrJoseph Wood to Motilal,  March , Motilal Nehru papers, Nehru Memorial Museum\nand Library, New Delhi, (hereafter N. M. M. L. ). \u2022\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\non the last night, he tells us, his pillow was covered with tears. But none of\nhis teachers had any lasting influence on him, nor did \u2018Joe\u2019 Nehru, while gene\u00ac\nrally liked, make any deep and enduring friendships. Lord Alexander of Tunis,\nwho was his contemporary, remembered him as merely \u2018an average popular\nboy\u2019, not outstanding in any respect, and with no close friends or enemies.\nSir James Butler, who was in the Headmaster\u2019s house with Jawaharlal, could\nonly say that he had not been particularly distinguished and had made no great\nmark in the House. Jawaharlal was a quiet and somewhat lonely boy, and\nthough, once he had settled down, he was not particularly homesick, he never\nquite fitted in nor felt at ease with his schoolfellows. The English boys he found\nmostly immature and childish, while the few Indians, belonging to the princely\nfamilies, who were there, he heartily disliked. So he looked forward eagerly to\nIndian visitorswith whom he could talk freely and in his own language; and the\nnostalgia for things Indian may explain his habit in his schooldays \u2014 which\nhe  ter discarded \u2014 of chewing betel-nut, which his mother sent him from\nhome. In his adult years Jawaharlal was very conscious of his Harrovian con\u00ac\nnexions. While in prison in the\u2019thirties, he stuck pictures of Harrow in his\ndiaries and drew up lists of poets and politicians who had been to Harrow. He\neven sensed a certain affinity with Byron on the ground that they had both been\nto Harrow and Trinity, and he used to sing the school songs with the younger\nmembers of the family. As Prime Minister he attended an old boys\u2019 dinner in\nLondon, and in  visited the school and received an enthusiastic welcome.\nBut all this did not come very naturally, and he was doubtless far happier as an\nold Harrovian-than in his actual years at that school.\nJawaharlal\u2019s arrival at Harrow coincided with startling events in India and\noutside, and it was now that he began, for the first time, to take an interest in\npolitics and world affairs. In  he had attended the Congress session at\nBombay with his father, an occasion that, not surprisingly, had left no impres\u00ac\nsion on him; but the situation was now very different. In  the Viceroy,\nLord Curzon, had, by his heavy-handed partitioning of the province of Bengal,\nforced the transition in India from the era of supplication to that of pressure.\nThe broad-based agitation in Bengal found vigorous support in every other\npart of India because the partition was regarded not as a minor administrative\nreform but as a deliberate attempt to weaken the growing forces of Indian\nnationalism. So the Swadeshi movement, or the insistence on the use of arti\u00ac\ncles of Indian manufacture, and the boycott of British goods, inaugurated in\nBengal, spread far and wide and even, to Jawaharlal\u2019s surprise, reached distant\nKashmir. Motilal too, normally no admirer of the \u2018oily babus\u2019 of Bengal, was\nstirred to sympathy and appreciation, and thought that they had after all justi\u00ac\nfied themselves. \u2018The Bengali reigns supreme throughout Bengal.. .

The\nExtremists under Tiiak were not revolutionaries who sought a violent end to\nBritish rule. Even their remote ideal was only a confederacy of Indian pro\u00ac\nvinces with a measure of autonomy and the reservation of all Imperial ques\u00ac\ntions for the British Government. All that they wanted immediately was to\nimpress on public opinion in England that all was not well in India, and this\npurpose was shared by the Moderates. The only difference was as to the way\nthat thisshould be done. While Gokhale and his followers believed in speeches,\nmeetings and deputations, the slogan of Tiiak was self-reliance. Jawaharlal\nfound himself in sympathy with the Extremists, and Tiiak seemed to him the\nembodiment of Indian nationalism struggling for freedom. But it was a vague\nsympathy. The ideas were unformed and the emotion imprecise, going no\nfurther than, under the influence of Trevelyan\u2019s Garibaldi, swashbuckling\nfantasies. His political enthusiasm was still a form of idealized chivalric\nromance.\nHowever, it was not only developments in India that excited Jawaharlal\u2019s\ninterest. He followed, far more closely than most of the other boys at Harrow,\nthe general election in  in Britain, which swept the Liberal Party into\npower and enabled Campbell-Bannerman to form his government. Even more\nabsorbing were the changes in Asia. On the day Jawaharlal landed in Britain,\nnews came of Japan\u2019s decisive naval victory over Russia at Tshushima. Feeling\nrelatively a stranger in a British public school, and with his mind full of reports\nof the grow ing estrangement between the British rulers and the Indian people,\nhe thrilled to this evidence of the new strength of an Asian nation. It was at this\ntime that he came across Meredith Townsend\u2019s Asia andEurope; and his mind\nwas particularly receptive. For the thesis of that book, shorn of its crudities\nsuch as that caste was a form of socialism and that India would gradually\nbecome a Muslim country, was that Asia and Europe were separate in every\nsense. Neither could conquer the other with permanence, nor would the\npeoples of the two continents really come together, for there was an inherent\nantipathy between them. Europe had never enduringly influenced Asia and\nwas unlikely ever to do so; in fact, Europe had received from Asia far more\n Letter to Jawaharlal,  November .\nThis was an F.nRhs.h-owned newspaper of Lucknow.\n Letter to Jawaharlal. i January .\n See his message on Tiiak.  June .\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nthan she had given. About India in particular, Townsend was firmly of the\nview thattheBritish hadwon nogenuine loyalty from any section ofthe people,\nand their empire, which came in a day, would disappear in a night. The effort\nwhich the British had put forward in  to hold their authority could never\nbe repeated, for the British people had lost the energy and the unscrupulous\u00ac\nness to maintain government by slaughter; but India could not be retained in\nany other way. Jawaharlal was willing to be convinced.\nBored with Harrow, Jawaharlal sat for the entrance examinations to Cam\u00ac\nbridge in the spring of , a year before his father and his headmaster\nthought he should, and went up to Trinity that October. In the intervening\n' summer he had spent a few weeks in Ireland. He missed the rioting in Belfast\nand was disappointed that Dublin was quiet during his stay. But he had felt,\nfirst-hand, the force of nationalist agitation and wasimpressed by the Sinn Fein\nmovement. He recommended to his father a book just then published, The\nNew Irelandby Sydney Brooks, which saw in Ireland the rebirth of an ancient\nnation and commended the Sinn Feinmovement for its revolt against \u2018thimble\u00ac\nrigging\u2019 politics and its belief that nothing could be secured from England by\nwhining. Such gains as Ireland had made in the past had been by extortion. The\nonly sound policy' for Ireland to follow was that which caused England the\ngreatest annoyance. But there was no need for violence; all that was required\nto thwart the alien ruler was to ignore him and boycott his merchandise. The\nparallel in India was, of course, obvious, and Jawaharlal\u2019s visit to Ireland and\nhis understanding of her politics seem to have strengthened his Extremist\nsympathies. The result wasthat he became more critical of his father\u2019s attitude\nin politics. He accused Motilal of being \u2018immoderately moderate\u2019, and a later\nlight-hearted reference to the Government demonstrating their satisfaction\nwith \u2018the insulting offer of a Rai Bahadurship\u2019 hurt Motilal so deeply thaf\nJawaharlal had to apologize.\nTheextremism, however, was confined tohisletterstohisfather. Jawaharlal\ndid not plunge intoche student politics of Cambridge. He never spoke at the\nUnion, though he was a member and used the club rooms. He joined the\nMagpie and Stump, the debating society of his own college, within a week of\ncoming up, his name having been proposed by St John Philby and seconded by\nCharles Darwin. However, although failure to speak throughout a term meant\npayment of a fine, during his three years Jawaharlal spoke only once, for two\nminutesthirty seconds on  May  on the motion \u2018This house approves of\nthepresent public school system. Unfortunately, the minutes do not disclose\nwhether Jawaharlal spoke for or against the motion. Nor does he seem to have\ntaken part in the debates in doggerel, mode trials and pageants and smoking\nconcerts organized by this club.\niLetter,  December ,SslscttdWorks ofJaw*b*rlslNtbru (hereafter S.W.) vol. l,(Ddb.\n), p. .\n*Letter,  January , S.W., vol. , p. . \u2022\n*Minutes of the Magpie and Stump Debating Society, Trinity College Library.\nUNFORMATIVE YEARS \n. As for the other undergraduate societies, Jawaharial was a member of the\nMajlis, the society of Indian students which he joined despite his father\u2019s dis\u00ac\napproval. He seems to have attended many of its meetings and dinners but,\nagain, rarely spoke. The only report we have of a speech was at an Jd dinner,\nwhere he spoke reluctantly but when he did is said to have spoken well. Palme\nDutt, a schoolboy in those days, remembers Jawaharial occasionally attending\nthe meetings of the Majlis which used to be held in his father\u2019s house, but the\nimpression thatJawaharial had left on him was that of being an aesthetic rather\nthan a political type.\nTherein, perhaps, lies part of the answer. Jawaharial was wincingly shy,\nand public speaking must have seemed to him a nightmare. But, in addition,\nthe passionate debates that went on among the Indian students on the relative\nmerits of moderation and extremism must also have seemed to him rather\nvulgar. He had, for example, warmly defended in his letters Bepin Pal, one of\nthe Extremist leaders, when Motilal had sneered at him as \u2018the great bathroom\nhero of Barisal\u2019; but Pal\u2019s speech at Cambridge when, apart from adopting a\nnarrowly Hindu attitude and speaking of India as God\u2019s chosen country, he had\nthundered to a small audience as if he were at a public meeting, embarrassed\nJawaharial acutely. So he wrote to Allahabad welcoming the split in the Con\u00ac\ngress at Surat and expressing his firm belief that in a very few years there\nwould hardly be any Moderates left; but in Cambridge he successfully kept his\nopinions to himself.\nThese opinions, it should be added, were still not deep-seated or transform\u00ac\ning his whole outlook. They were but a natural part of the general posture of\ndilettantism which Jawaharial deliberately cultivated. Though he told no one\nbut hisfather of these views, the occasional assertion doubtless gave him inner\nsatisfaction. But that was all. There was no greater hint of the rebel about him\nor about his view of his own future. He showed at thistime no real signs of any\nsort of fire or distinction, and did not stand out among his generation. He\naccepted the values and ambitionsof his class, and was quite at ease in the vapid\nsociety of Indian middle-class convention. He did not, despite his epistolary\nextremism, resist the hopes which his father had nurtured from the strut of\nentombing him in the Indian Civil Service. In fact, it was Motilal who, early in\n, abandoned the idea of Jawaharial sitting for the I.C.S. examination,\nmainly because he could not brook the prospect of his only son serving for long\nyears in remote districts away from home, and had a growing feeling that the\nexaminers were biased against Indian candidates. But neither father nor, more\nstartlingly in the light of later events, son resented the thought of serving\nthe British rulers. They had not yet recognized the necessity of freedom.\nIn , after listening to Fenner Brockway urging that India should move on\n Syed Mahmud, \u2018Jawaharial Nehru as I knew himIslamic Institute files. I owe this reference\nto Mr David Page.\nInterview with the author,  November .\n*Letter,  October .\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nto independence, Jawaharlal criticized the speaker privately for his extremist\nspeech.\nThe impression Jawaharlal gives as an undergraduate is of a man only halfawakened and waiting for further experience and comprehension. He attend\u00ac\ned, in his first term, a lecture by Bernard Shaw on Socialism and theUniversity\nMan, but more to see the speaker than to hear him. Shaw\u2019s plays, and even\nmore his prefaces, had already begun to fill him with excitement, and to the\nend of his days Shaw \u2019occupied a niche in my mind and I have sought his com\u00ac\npany to my great advantage\u2019.But it was, one suspects, Shaw the social crusader\nrather than the political reformer who so appealed to Jawaharlal. Fabianism,\nwith its hopes of reforming capitalism and imperceptibly gliding to socialism,\nwas at thistime popularin Cambridge, but it seems to have attracted Jawaharlal\nlittle, and there is no reason to believe that he was a member of the Cambridge\nFabian Society. Hugh Dalton, also at Cambridge at this time and prominent\nin the Fabian Society and the Union, knew Jawaharlal slightly but does not\nremember much else about him. He clearly made no impact in left-wing\ncircles. But Jawaharlal was, as we know, interested in William Morris, and\nbought a full set of the collected works, which began to be issued from .\nThere was clearly greater affinity with Morris than with Shaw. The revolt of\nMorris against the ugliness of industrial capitalism and its impoverished\nhuman relationships had led on to a frontal attack on class exploitation and the\nevils of imperialism. The life of Morris was the story of the evolution of a revo\u00ac\nlutionary, the progress from aestheticism to the basic question of class power;\nand Jawaharlal may have been, in his own context, moving in the same direc\u00ac\ntion. His moral sensibility and fastidiousness were beginning to develop in the\nsocial context. His awareness of the class issue is indicated by a trivial fact: his\nkeenness to dance with a waitress to discover what she would talk about.\nLooking back on these years, Jawaharlal described his primary mood as a\nvague kind of Cyrenaicism. But even the assiduous cultivation of pleasure\nseems to have been only half hearted. Cambridge in those days was an exciting\nplace, but Jawaharlal never got into its full swing. In his own college, admit\u00ac\ntedly a large one with about  members, he hardly seems to have been\nnoticed. He lived the first year in lodgings, at  Green Street, and then in\nWhewell Court, in what he described as \u2018probably the rottenest rooms in the\nwhole college\u2019, with the only advantage that they were near the baths. He got\non well with his tutor, Sir Walter Fletcher, but neither Fletcher nor any other\nsenior member of the university had a great influence on him. He took as his\n>Lord Brockway in a B.B.C. broadcast. See Personality and Power (B.B.C. publication, ),\np. .\nzTo S. S. Dbavan  July .

Thompson, written in . Nehru papers. *\nAutobiography (Indian edition, ), p. .\nUNFORMATIVE YEARS \nsubjects chemistry, geology and physics but soon gave up physics for botany,\nand in the final tripos was placed in the second half of the second class. This\nwas an achievement well below the level of his talent, but Jawaharlal was not\nby temperament an academic,^and appears to have done very little work. How\u00ac\never, he had so diligently prepared his family for an outright failure that the\nresult was received with champagne. The type of education provided at Cam\u00ac\nbridge and Oxford seemed to him of little value to an Indian. He was not there\u00ac\nfore greatly concerned at the proposal to restrict the admission of Indians to\nCambridge, and took no part in the controversy that raged fiercely on this issue\nduring his years at the university. He believed that it would be an advantage if\nsuch restriction forced Indian students to go to universities in Europe and else\u00ac\nwhere, and thus be better fitted for the world.\nOutside the laboratories and lecture rooms, Jawaharlal led a busy life, even\nif it was unspectacular. He played tennis, rode a great deal and applied for\nadmission to the University Mounted Infantry. He was summoned to a riding\ntest but did not go, ostensibly for lack of time but probably because he knew\nthat as an Indian he would be rejected, for at that time Indians were not\nadmitted. He joined the Trinity Boat Gub and being only  st.  lb. in\nweight was made cox. He had not looked forward to this, but proved efficient\nenough. In the third-division trials his boat won easily. \u2018Nehru coxed well*,\nsays the record.

As for his vacations they were spent frequently\nin hydros, which were hotels meant mainly for invalids. Where, then, was\nthe successful pursuit of egoistic hedonism, the deliberate achievement of\nsensation? It was obviously a pose to cover an emptiness in his life. Jawaharlal\nhad opinions but needed a cause; there stretched before him a future secure\nbut with no purpose. He accepted the ennui of bourgeois stability for want of\nanything more demanding. He went through his years at Cambridge without\ndemur, although its attractions had little to offer him.\nEven before his final tripos examination, Jawaharlal had joined the Inner\nTemple, and the fond father believed that the son had followed his aptitude*\n Trinity Boat Qab minutes, Trinity College Library. \u2022\na To his nephew Marsha Hutheesing,  August .

He had failed to realize thatJawaharlal\nhad no enthusiasm for the law and joining the Inner Temple was merely part\nof hisgeneral policy, at thistime, of drift. He was bored with Cambridge, which\nwas \u2018becoming too full of Indians\u2019, and wanted a change; but it was Oxford\nrather than London that he had preferred. When Motilal opposed this because\nhe wanted Jawaharlal, in addition to qualifying for the Bar, to work in the\nchambers of a senior lawyer and attend the law courts, he at last had an\ninkling into his son\u2019s mind. He would much rather, wrote Jawaharlal, risk\nhis success at the Bar than go through life as a mere lawyer with no interest\nin anything save the technicalities and trivialities of law.\nHowever, as usual, Jawaharlal gave way to his father's wishes and moved\nto London. The only sop given him was permission to join the London School\nof Economics. 'Politics are inseparable from law and economics the soul of\npolitics.\u2019 But being forced to do what he disliked resulted, as was to be\nexpected, in Jawaharlal leading a life of idleness. But before that he had nearly\nsucceeded in killing himself. On a holiday in Norway with a friend, while\ntrekking somewhere north of Bergen, he plunged into an ice-cold fjord for\na bath and became numb. Hisfootslipped and he wasswept away by the current.\nHis companion pulled him out on the brink of a waterfall. But Jawaharlal\nwas always a man of physical courage, and proximity to death pleased rather\nthan sobered him.\nFor the next two years Jawaharlal was caught up in the whirl of London\nlife. Renewing contact with some old school acquaintances, he was very much\nthe gay man of fashion \u2014 \u2018very well-dressed, well-mannered, almost Euro\u00ac\npean\u2019. Music concerts, golf at Crowborough, tennis at the Queen\u2019s Club,\nwatching cricket at Lord\u2019s and waltzing on ice-rinks, rather than attending\nlectures at the LS.E. and devilling at the law, took up his time. The pas\u00ac\ntimes seem to have been innocent but they were expensive. Never over\u00ac\nloaded with money, Jawaharlal now found himself often in debt, was forced\nto pawn his watch and chain, sometimes had no money even for bus or tube\nfare, and more and more frequently approached his father for supplementary\n Motilal to his brother  January .

Motilal was\nalarmed. Far from carrying offthe scholarships and prizes at the Bar examina\u00ac\ntions, Jawaharlal just managed to pass, and seemed more interested in con\u00ac\ncerts. \u2018Your papers at the last exam, must have been very musical.  hope the\nexaminers had the sense to appreciate them. It would perhaps be an improve\u00ac\nment in future to let the musical treat follow* the exam, instead of allowing\nthe two to overlap.\u2019 And when, the next year, Jawaharlal passed the Bar\nfinals, Motilal expressed hisgreatrelief. \u2018Ido not look upon it as a great achieve\u00ac\nment. But you have eminently succeeded in investing the event with an im\u00ac\nportance which it did not possess.\u2019\nt Suchheavy sarcasm irritated Jawaharlal, and when his father wrote a brus\u00ac\nque letter demanding to see his accounts, Jawaharlal replied with such acidity\nthat this time it was Motilal\u2019s turn to apologize. The fact was that Jawaharlal\nwasspendingmuch but enjoying himself little. He was bored and listlessrather\nthan immersed in extravagant dissipation, and the gaiety was very much on\nthe surface. Never in perfect harmony with the British environment, he was\nquite happy to return in August  to what Motilal termed \u2018this land of\nregrets\u2019. In his Autobiography Jawaharlal described himself at that time,\na young man of , as \u2018a bit of a prig with little to commend me\u2019 ,It was a\nharsh self-judgment. In fact he seems to have been a rather vague and un\u00ac\npractical person, dominated, even suppressed, by a doting and determined\nfather. Jawaharlal had done all the things he had been told to do, but with no\ngreat enthusiasm. His deep attachment to hisfather had the defect that it made\nhim almost passive. He was willing to conform and to leave the major deci\u00ac\nsions of his life to be made by his father. He had emerged from seven years in\nEngland, having passed through the mill of a traditional education, with no\nconfidence in himself or interest in the world. But his mind and character had\nbeen trained not for a profession but for the call which was to come in the\nyears ahead.

He returned to India\nwith a nurtured mind and imagination. *\nIn addition, he brought back with him attachments to Britain, and the\nvalues he considered British, which were never to leave him. They moulded\nhis outlook, sustained him in his struggles and influenced his policies in the\ndays of his power. Throughout his life, Britain was a country with which\nJawaharlal identified extensively in the personal sense. He himself was aware\nof this.\nLess than ten years ago | he told the judge at his trial in May   I\nreturned from England after a lengthy stay there. I had passed through\nthe usual course of public school and university. I had imbibed most\nof the prejudices of Harrow and Cambridge and in my likes and dislikes\nI was perhaps more an Englishman than an Indian. I looked upon the\nworld almost from an Englishman\u2019s standpoint. And so I returned to\nIndia as much prejudiced in favour of England and the English as it\nwas possible for an Indian to be.\nIndeed, he felt that his reaction to foreign rule would be that, in similar\ncircumstances, of any average Englishman uncontaminated by imperialism.\nAddressing an audience of schoolchildren he advised them to emulate the\nspirit of adventure and patriotism which inspired the English schoolboy and\nimpressed upon them how the ancestors of the British had risked their lives\nin the past. That spirit was the possession of free nations but in India it had\ndied during the past one hundred and fifty years of slavery.\n>  April .\n S.W.', voi. , pp. -.\n} Address to the Tilak Vidyalaya, Allahabad,  April , U.

    "1917-1921": " Marking Time\nBack in India, Jawaharlal slipped without resistance into the vacuous, para\u00ac sitic life of upper-middle-class Indian society in Allahabad. He joined his father\u2019s chambers and Motilal saw to it that work came his way. \u2018An over- zealous client sent a money order for Rs. to you as your fee and it has been redirected to Mussoorie. The first fee your father got was Rs.  (five only). You are evidently a hundred times better than your father. I wish I were my son instead of being myself. Rao Maharajsingh has several cases pending in the High Court and I do not know In which of them he intends to retain you. But the money is yours . . .\u2019 Clearly, though the father\u2019s pride forbade him to recognize it, Jawaharlal was being paid handsomely to keep Motilal happy. Jawaharlal toiled fairly hard and had the advantages of his father\u2019s sponsor\u00ac ship and of social contacts with judges, eminent lawyers like Sapru and Rash Behari Ghose and the leading landlords and industrialists of the U. P. But he could whip up no enthusiasm for the law, was shy of speaking, and found the work tedious.\u2019Reading books written by great lawyers\u2019, he wrote long after, \u2018is apt to make one think of big and intricate cases. But the average lot of the lawyer, especially a junior one, is to deal with petty and rather dull cases.\u2019 So it is doubtful whether, even if politics had not seduced him, he would have developed into one of the leading lawyers of the U.P. or India. It is more likely, as he himself thought, that if he had continued at the Bar he would have led a comfortable existence and retired as a judge, \u2018highly respectable and solemn looking\u2019, but probably of no great distinction.\nApart from professional work, Jawaharlal continued in Allahabad the life of a man-about-town which he had led in his last years in London. He enjoyed the lavish entertainments of his father; and there are, in addition, reports of his own late-night parties and revels.

He left his cards at the homes of English judges and officials, and they in turn called on him, \u2018Called on  English families\u2019, runs the entry in his pocket diary for  March , and again three days later/Called on  English families\u2019. *\nHowever, the great event of that year was his marriage on  February . This question had been worrying Motilal and his wife ever since their son went to Harrow. For even though their son was then only a boy of fifteen, Motilal was concerned lest Jawaharl&l begin to show interest in women, particularly in view of the entanglement of one of his friends. Writing, as he said, not as a father but as his dearest friend, Motilal invited confidences, warned against passing passions, and condemned the concept of love at first sight.\nMotilal had nocause for worry. His son, apart from showing little interest in women, declared that he had never been in favour of marrying a European and had, during his years in England, seen no reason to change his opinion. He sometimes gave expression to idealized views about marriage.\nWould you like me to marry a girl whom I may not like for the rest of my life and who may not like me? Rather than marry in that way, I would greatly prefer to remain unmarried. After all, I have to spend my whole life with my wife. Is it surprising, then, if I wish to marry a girl whom I like? I am not obliged to like a girl of a good family, nor is it to be taken for granted that every educated girl would come up to my expectations.\nI accept that any girl selected by you and father would be good in all res\u00ac pects, but still, I may not be able to get along well with her. In my opin\u00ac ion, unless there is a\u2019degree of mutual understanding, marriage should not take place. I think it is unjust and cruel that a life should be wasted merely in producing children.\nBut there is, in the number of letters he wrote on this subject, little evi\u00ac dence of a desire in his own life for an intense and romantic experience. Once, while still at Harrow, he evinced an upsurge of restlessness which qurte sur\u00ac prised his father.\nThe sooner it is done the better it will be. I.am in no hurry to get married or even engaged but it is most tiring and annoying not to know what is going to happen. If no one had ever mentioned anything about my marri\u00ac age I would have been quite contented and happy, but now that all this fuss and trouble has been taken I cannot rest till something is done.\nBut in fact it was irritation rather than impatience. Jawaharlal was tired of\n Letters to Jawaharlal,  March  and  September . rJawaharlal to his father,  September . *\ni Letter to his mother,  March  (Original in Hindi).

With an odd detachment he wanted his father to settle his engagement so that there need be no further discussion.\nThis suited Motilal, who took, as of natural right and with Jawaharlal\u2019s consent, the decisions in this as in all other major matters in his son\u2019s life. 'It is all right my boy. You may leave your future happiness in my hands and rest assured that to secure that is the one object of my ambition.\u2019 Hie conditions of Indian life, he assured Jawaharlal, were so different to those prevailing in Europe and elsewhere that Jawaharlal\u2019s happiness could not be secured by leaving him to act independently of his parents. There were only two points which Jawaharlal suggested rather weakly: that he need not necessarily marry within the Kashmiri community, and that the engagement need not be fixed while he was still in England and had hardly had the chance to know the girl.\n hope\u2019, he hastened to add, \u2018you will take my objections into consideration before arriving at a decision, which of course lies with you.\u2019 But Kashmiri Pandits, even those who had migrated to Allahabad, had a strong sense of exclusiveness, and in this respect Motilal was no more immune than the rest. So he preferred a Kashmiri if he could find a suitable one and he surveyed the Kashmiri girls everywhere, even those settled in Madras, for one who was neither an illiterate beauty nor a plain blue-stocking, but combined good looks with education. 'I asked Jawahar if he preferred books to looks or vice versa. His answer was that I might as well ask if he preferred a nose to eyes \u2014 they were both necessary.\u2019 There was no obvious \u2018Blue Bird\u2019 to be found who would not require a special course of preparation and instruction before she fully qualified to be Jawaharlal\u2019s wife; but Motilal could see no far superior person outside the community either, and this strengthened his feeling akin to prejudice against it. However, the lack of an obvious candidate enabled Motilal to yield to his son\u2019s second suggestion, that he should see the girl before the final selection.\nAfter years of search, in , just before Jawaharlal\u2019s return to India, Motilal chose Kamala Kaul, a young girl of thirteen belonging to a Kashmiri Brahmin middle-class family who rah a flour mill in Delhi. Jawaharlal, being nearly ten years older, thought she was too young for him. Nor did he think he could marry her for another six to seven years, till she was at least eighteen or nineteen. But this did not worry him as he was not, as he observed, \u2018in a matrimonial state of mind at present'; and it suited Motilal as it provided time to mould the young girl into a proper wife for Jawaharlal. She had been educated at home and spoke Hindi and Urdu; and after the engagement she\n* Motilal to Jawaharlal,  February .\n Idem,  December .\n Letter to his father,  October .\n*C(.

When she was seventeen the marriage was celebrated in Delhi on a munificent scale, with special trains carrying the guests to the \u2018Nehru marriage camp\u2019.\nThat summer Jawaharlal spent in Kashmir. He went in pursuit of bear and shot one as well as a large number of pigeons and marmots. He also had his second brush with death. Trekking up to the top of the ZojiTa, a very stiff climb of about three and a half miles, he then attempted to go over the Amar- nath shoulder into the head of the valley above the cave. From Matayan he and his friends moved to Gumba and went up to the Gumba ravine and glacier. After climbing a veiy steep gradient for miles, they arrived at the top of the glacier and then set off, at about , feet, in bad weather, to cross a large ice-field covered with fresh snow. Trying to hop across a crevasse, Jawaharlal slipped and fell in, and was pulled out by the rope. As there were many other such crevasses and it was still snowing, the party turned back.\nAlong with high life and shikar, there was the usual ostentatious public service. For three or four years Jawaharlal served as one of the provincial secretaries of the St John Ambulance Association. He was also one of the joint secretaries of the U.P. South Africa Committee for the collection of funds for Gandhi\u2019s passive resisters in South Africa, but this was not an dnti-Government activity, for the Governmentof India had frequently expressed their support for the Indian community in South Africa. He was willing to join the Indian Defence Force, constituted on the lines of the territorial army, and encourage other young Indians to do the same. It was decided to constitute a strong and representative committee in Allahabad for this purpose, and an invitation to all who were interested was published in the local newspapers.\nWithin a week, however, the situation underwent a marked change. For many years the Indian national movement had been at a low ebb. The Congress was controlled by the Moderates who were satisfied with the annual adoption of academic resolutions. Jawaharlal and others like him in the U.P. had no great interest in such activity nor were they drawn into Extremist agitation. Tilak and Mrs Besant, failing to secure the re-admission of the Extremists into the Gongress, had set up Home Rule Leagues. Mrs Besant\u2019s plan was to agitate on the lines of British radical movements in the nineteenth century, and in April  she had presided over the U.P. Provincial Conference. Jawaharlal had taken no interest in this. His first public speech was on  June , to protest against the Press Act and the demand from Mrs Besant of security under that Act, but this intervention would seem to have been\n Diary entries from  August to  September ; letter to S.

It was no sparkling performance, and all that his father could say, after reading the report in the press, was that the speech, though not very informative, had the rare merit of being free from commonplaces, which was the besetting sin of all Indian speakers, at least in the U. P. Hehadnot been anything more than a silent spectator at the Lucknow Congress in December . But what Mrs Besant and Tilak had failed to achieve on their own was accomplished by the Government.\nThe Home Rule Leagues of Mrs Besant were intended to be primarily educative \u2014 to argue the case for Home Rule, hold classes and seminars, cir\u00ac culate literature, collect funds and organize social work. But the Government teared Mrs Besant\u2019s influence. She was first expelled from Bombay and then from the Central Provinces and finally, in June , interned at a hill station by the Madras Government. This panicky step caused resentment throughout India; and among those roused to annoyance was Jawaharlal. He was, at long last, beginning,to find his role. The meeting for considering the expansion of the Indian Defence Force was promptly cancelled; and Jawaharlal withdrew his own application for enlistment. A Home Rule League was formed in the U. P. with Motilal as president and Jawaharlal as one of the joint secretaries. The internment of Mrs Besant seemed to him a sign of the madness which had befallen the bureaucracy and presaged its fall. \u2018Home Rule has come and we have but to take it if we stand up like men and falter not.\u2019 Mere protest meetings and representations were the politics of cowards and opium-eaters: what was now needed was non-co-operation with the Government till they re\u00ac versed their folly.\nSuch vehemence showed that despite the superficiality of his yay of living, his spirit was not dead and he was keen on action. He had been greatly moved by Roger Casement\u2019s speech at his trial. \u2018It seemed he said years later, to point out exactly how a subject nation should feel. In August , when Motilal called on the British public, \u2018the sole tribunal appointed by Providence\u2019, to mediate between the Indian people and the bureaucracy, someone from the audience shouted \u2018Question\u2019. Motilal lost his temper and challenged the heckler tocomeout in the open. There was complete silence. What is of inter\u00ac est is that wenowknow that the timid heckler was Jawaharlal. But what action should be taken, what form non-co-operation should be given, was not clear to him. He had no startling ideas of his own.

In fact his mind, for lack of anything better, fell into Moderate grooves, and he objected to the refusal by the Government to permit deputa\u00ac tions to proceed to England to plead the cause of Home Rule  At this time, unlike the year before, it was Motilal who was the stauncher revolutionaiy, and he pointed out to Jawaharlal that the work which lay before them in India was far more important than anything that deputations could achieve in England.\nSo Jawaharlal, even in his late twenties, was a man who had yet to know his mind, discontented with his lot of comfort and affluence, dissatisfied with merely helping to run The Independent, the newspaper started by his father in February  to give voice in the U. P. to the viewpoint of the Congress, and groping for some form of action which would provide mental and emotional satisfaction. When, therefore, the call of Gandhi came he could respond to it not merely at a political but at a human level. Long after, looking back on these fallow years, he remarked that it was the acceptance of Gandhi\u2019s leader\u00ac ship, and the civil disobedience and jail-going which had followed, that had made a man of him. Life now had meaning in the service of a cause.\n See his letter to A.M. Khwaja,  December .  Resolution moved by Jawaharlal at the U.P. Political Conference, TJ* laarfsr,  October .

Immersion in Politics\nThe Independent began its career with severe criticism of the Rowiatt Bills, wherebythe Government of India established summary procedures for dealing with political agitation; and Jawaharlal did not rule out the possibility of his arrest. \u2018That too would be preferable to the present state of doubt and despair.\u2019 This did not happen. Jawaharlal was one of the signatories of the satyagraha vow, formulated by Gandhi, pledging refusal to obey cer tin laws, and, a mem\u00ac ber of the committee formed at Allahabad to organize satyagraha in that dis\u00ac trict and to get in touch with other districts to constitute a provincial com\u00ac mittee. After the massacre at Amritsar, he assisted the Congress Inquiry Committee, and visited Amritsar and the Punjab to take depositions and collect material for the speeches in the Assembly of his father and Pandit Malaviya, a moderate Congress leader, about the actual firing, the atrocities under martial law and the \u2018general misbehaviour of tommies\u2019. He also helped in relief work, though the Government believed that any distinction between such humanitarian effort and political agitation was fanciful. The Allahabad Seva Samiti, or relief organization, raised over a lakh of rupees for the work and Jawaharlal took some volunteers with him to the Punjab to help in organ\u00ac izing such relief. A chance encounter with General Dyer on atrain led to a classic piece of description:\n To Padmaja Naidu,  February . *Tba Leader,  April - Satyagraha, or \u2019truth-force', was Gandhi's name for his technique of passive resistance. *Notes on the Occurrence in the Punjab, April-June .

One of them was holding fbrth in an aggressive and triumphant tone and soon I discovered that he was Dyer, the hero of Jallianwala Bagh, and he was describing his Amritsar ex\u00ac periences. He pointed out how he had the whole town at his mercy and he had felt like reducing the rebellious city to a heap of ashes, but he took pity on it and refrained. He was evidently coming back from Lahore after giving his evidence before the Hunter Committee of Enquiry. I was greatly shocked to hear his conversation and to observe his callous manner. He descended at Delhi station in pyjamas with bright pink stripes, and a dressing-gown.\nJawaharlal wrote to the press in rather stilted language in defence of Malaviya and Motilal when the Punjab Government accused them of not substantiating their charge that some police officers had taken bribes. \u2018It would be weariness to the flesh to controvert all the misstatements which Mr. Thompson managed to compress in his (wo speeches in Council.\u2019 Jawa\u00ac harlal met the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar on  September on his father\u2019s behalf and said the data in Motilal\u2019s possession regarding police bribery would be disclosed on condition that those who had provided the evidence would be publicly assured immunity; but the Punjab Government were willing to give no more than private assurances. Jawaharlal also challenged the official figure that only  persons had been killed in the Jallianwala Bagh. A few days later Jawaharlal wrote another letter to the press pointing out that the \u2018crawling order\u2019 was not, as Gandhi had suggested, a \u2018hands and knees\u2019 order; people had in fact been made to crawl \u2018on their bellies after the manner of snakes and worms\u2019.\nLater that month, at the U.P.

If these facilities were not granted, the Hunter Commission should -be boycotted.\nYet, as in the case of Mahatma Gandhi and many others in India, it was not the happenings at Amritsar and the attitude of Dyer at the time and later before the official commission of inquiry which upset Jawaharlal as much as the re\u00ac action in England to these events. 'This cold-blooded approval of that deed\u2019, he wrote many years later, \u2018shocked me greatly. It seemed absolutely immoral, indecent; to use public school language, it was the height of bad form. I realized then, more vividly than I had ever done before, how brutal and immoral impe\u00ac rialism was and how it had eaten into the souls of the British upper classes.\u2019 Till now he had been in the stream of Indian moderate tradition, expecting favours from the benign British rulers; and his conversion was part of the general realization that freedom could never be a gift but only the achievement of struggle and resistance.\nIn February  Jawaharlal participated in the Allahabad district confer\u00ac ence at Bahadurganj, and in July he was elected vice-president of the Allahabad district congress committee. Meantime, Gandhi had taken up the cause of the Khilafat. To men like Jawaharlal, while active opposition to Government was welcome, such a prime facie religious issue did not fit in with their secular political attitude. So attempts were made in The Independent to provide political arguments for supporting the Khilafat movement. It was contended that the Caliph had been set aside because Britain and the other European powers wished to divide the Turkish Empire amongst themselves and the Khilafat movement was part of the political struggle for the freedom of Asia. The agitation in Allahabad city itself was intense. There was considerable fraternizing between Hindus and Muslims, and the U.P. Government reported that \u2018the extremists appear to have got most of the city on their side.\u2019\n,Motilal, however, disliked greatly the idea of boycott of the Councils and, not expecting that the Congress would accept this programme of Gandhi for non-co-operation, planned the election campaign in the United Provinces for the Congress against the Moderates. Jawaharlal helped in drafting the elec\u00ac tion manifesto, and Motilal was seriously considering the choice of a suitable constituency for his son. 'You ought to select a constituency from which you are sure to be returned. I am more keen on your going into the Council than mine [\u00abc].\u2019 He finally decided on Fatehpur and was disappointed that Jawa\u00ac harlal turned it down, preferring to follow Gandhi\u2019s lead. \u2018So far as your follow\u00ac ing the request of Gandhiji is concerned, there is nothing to be said.

Congress Committee met at Motilal\u2019s residence and resolved, with not more than two or three members voting against, that the usual methods of agitation hitherto followed were wholly insufficient to meet the intolerable situation created by official policy in regard to the Punjab and the Khilafat questions, and whole-heartedly recommended the principle of non-co-operation with the Government 'at the greatest sacrifice possible\u2019. As regards the steps to be taken in the first stage of non-co-operation, it was decided after prolonged discussion to suggest the renunciation of titles, arbitra\u00ac tion instead of recourse to law courts, the promotion of national education by establishment of national schools and colleges and gradual withdrawal of students from Government institutions, resignation from all honorary non\u00ac elective posts in public bodies, refusal to buy government loans and attend official functions and boycott of British goods. The Committee then considered the boycott of councils. Jawaharlal pointed out that this could not mean enter\u00ac ing the councils even to obstruct but refusal either to participate in elections or to attend the councils after the elections. He expressed his own preference for boycott of even the elections, but finally the Committee recommended, by a narrow majority of about two, the boycott of councils, thus leaving open the question of participation in elections.\nJawaharlal was satisfied. \u2018The real question of principle, to my mind, was that we should not enter the Councils and take the oath of allegiance. The rest was a matter of tactics.\u2019 But he regretted that the Committee had not gone further along the lines laid down by Gandhi and advocated total renunciation of legal practice, immediate withdrawal from educational institutions, and rejection even of elective places in official bodies. \u2018I am an ardent believer in non-co-operation with all that it implies and I am firmly convinced that non- co-operation and no other course will bring us victory. That victory will not come in aday or ayear, butcome it will and must, ruat coelum. \u2019 Later, a special session of the Congress decided by an overwhelming majority in favour of complete boycott of the councils and called on voters to abstain from voting.\nMotilal fell into line with no great enthusiasm. He knew that his destiny and that of his son were scrambled together, but he did not always relish it. Austerity and puritanism did not come naturally to him, and watching Jawa\u00ac harlal embrace Gandhian rigours caused him intense pain. \u2018This is a time\u2019, he remarked with tears when he saw Jawaharlal boarding a third-class railway compartment, \u2018when he should be enjoying himself, but he has given up every\u00ac thing >nd has become a sadbuHe gave up his legal practice at a time when his services were in demand in various parts of the country, and he was con\u00ac cerned about the future. \u2018Have you had any time to attend to the poor cows in\nAnand Bhavan.

You can easily understand how I feel with all these matters troubling me and with the prospect of a beggarship after turning away from me a stream of gold flowing at my very feet.\nWhen Jawaharlal sought permission to transfer his warbonds worth Rs. , to the Tilak Swaraj fund and meantime announced it as an'anonymous dona\u00ac tion in The Independent, Motilal in great irritation replied that he was plan\u00ac ning to resume practice. ,\ni\nt\nSwaraj or no swaraj the one thing which I will not willingly permit is the possibility of any child or grandchild of mine having to depend for main\u00ac tenance on any other person in the world however near or dear, or that of their being a charge on the nation. If to avoid this it is necessary to make more money I would resume my practice today in spite of all that has happened ... I do not think that a man who is capable of starving his own children can be of much good to the nation.\nAnd he added brutally, stressing that it was his affluence that made possible Jawaharlal\u2019s political involvement: \u2018You cannot have it both ways: Insist on my having no money and yet expect me to pay you money/\nThese financial worries, however, Jawaharlal left to his father. Gandhi had at last given India a lead in action, and Jawaharlal was enthusiastic. His main preoccupation was the task of organizing non-co-operation in the U.P., and he was soon among its recognized leaders. To introduce some discipline into the movement, he organized drill for the volunteers and had plans for linking upthe various local organizations. He was elected President of the Etah district Congress conference; and though the Government banned the procession and sought to\u2018prevent the conference, Jawaharlal was welcomed by large crowds\n Motilal to Jawaharlal,  September .\n Idem,  September .\n Motilal to Jawaharlal,  June .\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nat every wayside station and he delivered his address as scheduled. No report of his speech exists, but the general tenor of his advocacy can be gleaned from a speech he delivered to students at Allahabad a few weeks later. It was not, he said, a time to weigh losses and gains; to enter the movement with a mathe\u00ac matical mind would only be to hinder it. The existing system had Jp be destroy\u00ac ed; there was no middle course left; oik was with either the pountiy or its enemies, either with Gandhi or with the Government. If on account of their lack of enthusiasm the cause was defeated, future generations would curse them.\nThe hold which Gandhi had acquired on Jawaharlal and which he was never to lose is, at first view, incongruous. Gandhi was Christ-like in his seizure of men; but his conversion of Jawaharlal is capable of rational explanation. What appealed to the younger manwas Gandhi\u2019s strength, his rock-like commitment to India's freedom, the way in which he had perfected his character and person\u00ac ality so as to make himself an effective instrument of political change in India \u2014 \u2019Indian leadership, Indian style\u2019. He was.above all a man of action, of enor\u00ac mous restlessness and energy, with a will to power and a touch of ruthlessness. He functioned with a shrewd grasp of whatever context he found himself in, and was a saint who placed his halo at the service of his secular aspirations. He repeatedly stressed that God appears not in person but in action. Throughout his life he functioned primarily in politics; and if, curious about his body and his spirit, he experimented constantly, he acknowledged that it was from 'experiments in the spiritual field that I derived such power as I possess for working in the political field\u2019.\n\u2019 It was this primacy of action, and successful action at that, that throughout Gandhi\u2019s life retained Jawaharlal ultimately in thrall. At this time he was quite captivated and, along with Gandhi\u2019s political leadership, willingly accepted all his other teachings. As the years passed, Jawaharlal realized that Gandhi had no use for systematic thinking on economic problems and that, while he had secured a hold on the masses by living and working among them and being ab\u00ac sorbed by them, he made no effort to inspire and rouse then^on anything other than political and social reform movements. But still he clung to Gandhi; and this one-to-one relationship, in which Gandhi specialized, was based on the call to battle with alien rule which Gandhi gave.\nJawaharlal\u2019s first direct dash with the Government, however, came about in an entirely fortuitousway and had nothing to do with Gandhi. In the summer of , he had taken the family up to Mussoorie, a hill station, and was spend\u00ac ing hiS time teaching his wife and sisters when, as he wrote to his father, great\u00ac ness was thrust on him by the Government. An Afghan delegation was staying at the same hotel and the authorities well knew that Jawaharlal had, during the period of over a fortnight when he was there, not seen anything of them.\n The Independent,  October .\nt Ibid..  November . %\n M\u00aby . S.W., vol. , p. .\nIMMERSION IN POLITICS\n\nYet suddenly the local superintendent of police called on him and asked him either to furnish a positive undertaking not to get into touch with the Afghan delegation or to leave Mussoorie on his own. The police official was, in fact, carrying out a decision of the Government of India. Alarmed by the rumours in the Punjab that the Afghan delegation had come to India to support the Khilafat movement with which the Anilr was believed to be in full sympathy, suspecting even men like Rajagopalachari, an extremely conservative follower ofGandhi, of pro-Bolshevik sympathies and of clandestine contacts with emigri Indians in Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, and disturbed by the police report that Indian malcontents were flocking to Mussoorie, the Home Depart\u00ac ment drew up a list of twenty-three persons who should be excluded from Mussoorie. Jawaharlal\u2019s name was on this list, and it was then realized that he was already in Mussoorie. The police at once jumped to the conclusion that the purpose of his visit was to secure an interview with the Afghans. Hence the sudden visit of the police officer.\nJawaharlal, faced with this unnecessary provocation, refused to bind him\u00ac self not to meet the Afghans or to leave Mussoorie on his own. However, he departed after an expulsion order had been served on him. He made no effort to resist expulsion, nor, on his return to the plains, did he seek to break the order and return to Mussoorie \u2014 inaction which pleased his father.\nWe have in all conscience suffered enough during the last six months and I would not court further trouble by a provocative act. The consequ\u00ac ences are so obvious both from the public and private points of view that it is hardly necessary to discuss them. It will mean the final break up of the family and the upsetting of all private, public and professional work. One thing will lead to another and something is sure to turn up which will compel me to follow you to the jail or something similar. I would leave well alone. We have certainly scored so far and should wait for further developments.\nIt is hard to believe that the Jawaharlal of later years would have so mildly complied with such an \u2018insensate\u2019order and been satisfied with a mere refusal to give an undertaking. Even at this time, when there was a deterioration in his mother\u2019s health, he might have returned to Mussoorie in defiance of the order and courted arrest, had not the U.P. Government, genteel as ever, with\u00ac drawn the order in view, as they said, of the health of the ladies of the family.\n> Weekly Reports of the Special Bureau of Information, , cited in Z.

Among the Peasants\nMore crucial to Jawaharlal\u2019s development than his expulsion was his involve\u00ac ment in the peasant unrest in the United Provinces. The importance of bringing the peasants, with their tradition of agitation, into the national movement had been underlined by Gandhi's successful organization of resistance to the indigo planters in Champaran in Bihar in T; and towards the end of that year Malaviya and a few others in Allahabad established the United Provinces Kisan Sabha (peasant association). The sponsors are in themselves testimony to the moderate objectives of this association; and it was reported that the Home Rule League had provided Rs , for its organization. Its avowed objectives were fo check the growing antagonism between peasants and zamindars (landowners) and establish friendly relations, educate the peasants and inform them of their political and social rights, promote legislation benefi\u00ac cial to them and amend statutes prejudicial to their interests, protect them from unlawful actions, establish village panchayats (councils), further mutual trust and cordiality between the rulers and the ruled and adopt such constitu\u00ac tional measures as might be conducive to their welfare. Branches of the Kisan Sabha were set up in many villages and tehsils (revenue sub-divisions) and attempts were made to establish similar organizations in other provinces and link them up with the National Congress. Peasant delegates were mustered in considerable numbers at the Congress sessions of  -and , by which time Gandhi had led another peasant campaign, this time against the Govern\u00ac ment, at Kaira in Gujarat. At the Congress session in , the U.P. Kisan Sabha submitted a draft resolution which was surprisingly radical, urging the Government, among other things, to declare peasants all over India to be actual owners of the soil they cultivated; but the Congress did no more than direct the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) to investigate the various revenue systems and the condition of the peasantry.\nThe special cause of agrarian distress in Avadh (Oudh) was the inelastic\niCircular No.  of the Criminal .Investigation Department, United Provinces.

Gearly, with the great rise in prices of consumer goods, landlords would try to circumvent the rigidity of the stat\u00ac ute by demanding payment of other dues; and the lack of occupancy rights ena\u00ac bled them to collect these dues by holding out the threat of eviction. Actual evictions were frequent, both because landlords saw an advantage, with the rising price of foodgrains, in cultivating the land themselves and enforcing their customary right to free or ill-paid labour, and because, with the apparent imminence of an amendment of the law granting fixity of tenure, it appeared worth while to terminate tenancy of any duration. In Pratabgarh district, for example, there were  notices for eviction in -; this figure rose to , in -, , in - and , in -. But more often the threat to evict was utilized to compel the tenant to pay higher cesses or nazarana in addition to the rent; and this had become a regular form of income to the landlords. Tenants could only secure renewals of their leases by borrow\u00ac ing heavily from money-lenders or from their relatives \u2014 or from the landlords themselves \u2014 in order to pay nazarana. \u2018Fathers have sold their daughters for nazarana money to husbands of advanced years/ Sometimes the holding was divided into two parts and settled with two competitors both of whom had paid substantial nayirana; and frequently a lease was terminated because another bidder had made a more tempting offer.\nHowever, these kisans (peasants), never wholly lacking in some form of power in at least some estates, were no longer unaware of anything better; and there was a growing resentment at working for, ami paying heavy cesses to, distant and unknown landowners at the bidding of foul-mouthed middle\u00ac men. Nor was there much faith left in the efficacy of the law courts as a means of obtaining redress, it being firmly believed that a poor man had no chance against a rich one in a contest in the courts; \u2018and who will say that there is not some truth in this under the system of civil and criminal justice as it has come to be practised in India?\nThe situation was particularly critical in Pratabgarh district.

They had to pay a higher rental than Brahmin or Kshatriya tenants. Nor were there underproprietors to act as a breakwater between the landlords and these low-caste tenants. While, for example, in Sultanpur there were many ..nants of the same caste as the land\u00ac lords who enjoyed a certain measure of protection from the head of the family, in Pratabgarh the Kurmis had to deal directly with the landlords.\nHowever, if the repression of the tenants was more severe in Pratabgarh than in other districts of Avadh, there were other balancing reasons which made a peasant outbreak more probable here than elsewhere. The Kurmis had a tradition of defiance; as far back as  they had risen in revolt, and they had never lost their social coherence and capacity for organization. It was of course easier to organize concerted action within a caste, however low, than to draw tenants of high and low caste together. Moreover, the Kurmi peasants of Pratabgarh could not fail to notice the occupancy rights enjoyed by the tillers, after twelve years of continuous cultivation, in the neighbouring dis\u00ac tricts of Allahabad and Jaunpur (which were part of the Agra division); and their kinsmen in these districts were reluctant to enter into marriage relations with persons who might overnight be reduced to the level of beggars at the whim of their landlord. The proximity of Allahabad city was also a source of strength, for the tenants of Pratabgarh could derive leadership and advice from urban politicians, who had by now begun to realize the value to them of peasant support.\nTrouble began in Pratabgarh from April , the beginning of the season of notices of eviction and of ejectment. At first the leadership of the Kurmis of Pratabgarh was assumed by a millenarian figure of shadowy antecedents, Baba Ram Chandra, who addressed large crowds, calling on them to stand up for their rights and resist the landlords, to pay their rents but not illegal cesses. He then, in June , led about  of his followers to Allahabad in the hope of meeting Gandhi. They failed to find Gandhi, but instead met Jawaharlal, who happened to be there because of his expulsion from Mussoorie, and per\u00ac suaded him to return with them to Pratabgarh. So casual circumstance thrust Jawaharlal into the problem of the Indian peasantry and gave a new and perma\u00ac nent dimension to his outlook.

And I, who for long believed in the doctrine of the sword, have been converted by the kisans to the doctrine of non-violence. I have come to believe that non-violence is ingrained in them and is part of their very nature.\nJawaharlal now gave publicity to the grievances of the kisans, objecting even to donations to the proposed University of Lucknow by estates under the management of the Court of Wards. \u2018It is bad enough for illegal exactions and oppression to take place in the domains of illiterate and self-seeking talukdars who manage their own estates. It is far worse for the Government as repre\u00ac sented by the Court of Wards to encourage such practices.\u2019 But in Pratabgarh itself, where he was accompanied by Gauri Shankar Misra, a follower of Pandit Malaviya and much more conservative even than the Jawaharlal of those days, the general effect of their presence was, as the Commissioner acknow\u00ac ledged, \u2018to bring a number of vague demands into a coherent shape and to a certain extent to moderate it\u2019. They encouraged the peasants to organize themselves into village kisan sabhas and to formulate their demands for re\u00ac strictions on evictions and forced labour, leases for fourteen years, payment of cesses at only customary rates, cessation of fines and free access to landlords \u2014 demands which could hardly be regarded as extreme. When the authorities arrested a few kisans for \u2018highhandedness\u2019, Jawaharlal and another colleague from Allahabad, Purushottam Das Tandon, met the Deputy Commissioner and, while not approving of the conduct of the men arrested, suggested that the cases be withdrawn so that the relations between zamindars and tenants might not worsen.\nBy now, however, with the non-co-operation movement in full swing, Jawaharlal began to feel that some of his colleagues were taking their modera\u00ac tion too far. They had set up, with the blessings of the district authorities, a Kisan Hitkarini Sabba, ostensibly to serve as a forum for landlords and ten\u00ac ants to discuss and settle their problems; but Jawaharlal had no use for it. \u2018Its sole function appears to be to collect a few talukdars and their dependents and then to curse with bell, book and candle the irresponsible agitators who have the effronteiy to visit the tenantry. I have little doubt that this must be a com\u00ac forting, though somewhat fruitless, operation.

What, in fact, Jawaharlai hoped for was to link kisan discontent with nationalist politics. He had made no study of economic and land problems and he had no clear ideas about pea\u00ac sant participation. It was not his intention to provide a revolutionary dimen\u00ac sion to Indian nationalism. But this contact with the kisan* was satisfying psychologically, as it gave him the, feeling that he was re-Indianizing himself and functioning in a wholly Indian situation; and politically it was important, for it provided an opportunity to do in hisown province what Gandhi had done elsewhere, harnessing peasant strength in the interests of the Congress.\nPratabgarh and Rae Bareli were more suited for Jawaharlal\u2019s effort than Allahabad district itself, for there the presence of many Muslim landlords would give communal overtones to any kisan agitation, and this was hardly to be desired while the Khilafat agitation was at its height. At a meeting held in Pratabgarh in October to federate the numerous village sabhas into an Oudh Kisan Sabba, the objectives were defined, in a harmless enough manner, as being to improve the condition of the tenantry,,to promote amity between khans and zamindars, to do everything to advance the cause of the country and to establishpanchayats for the settlement of all disputes between tenants. The Deputy Commissioner attended the meeting;* but was obliged to walk out when Jawaharlai advised his kisan audience to boycott elections to the Coun\u00ac cils and stressed that the only moral to be drawn from the Punjab and Khilafat events was that the Government was an utterly unjust one which cased little for the lives, honour and even the religion of the Indian people. The non-co- operation programme was approved by the Sabba and the Congress urged to 'stick to it'. But this effort to associate the kisan sabhas with the Congress programme led to a split in the parent U.P. Khan Sabba itself. At a meeting of its executive committee held on  October  a majority of its members refused to subscribe to non-co-operation and decided to remain neutral on tke issue; and by February  there were two U.P. Kisan Sabhas, each claim\u00ac ing to be the legitimate organization.\nThroughout the winter months of - the efforts to harness tenant power* to the non-co-operation movement continued. Jawaharlai spoke to large kisan audiences and was struck above all by their discipline.

The Kisan Con* gross, meeting at Fyzabad in December, attracted more persons from a few dis\u00ac tricts than the National Congress meeting at Nagpur attracted horn the whole of India. The landlords also helped by utilizing what they believed was their last opportunity to push through a rush of enhancements. This enraged the lower tenantry, who were now joined by landless labourers, suddenly caught by the rise in prices and diminished prospects of employment.\nThe distress which, as even discerning officials realized, was genuine and very great, began to assume political overtones.\nThe Indian peasants\u2019 chief idea about the war is that they supplied the men and the money and the zamindars got the credit. Government took their money and issued them bits of paper instead. It will be noticed that these notions distinctly smack of Bolshevism, and it would be interesting to know whether they are in some way the indirect result of Bolshevik propaganda, or have arisen from the same causes as have produced them in other countries. The Bolshevik idea is also rapidly spreading ... that it is the cultivators who plough, sow, irrigate and reap and are thus en* titled to the whole of the produce of the land. There is no need of, and no right to be, such things as zamindars. Here again the contention of the cultivators is very hard to refute, as there is no denying the fact that the Indian landlord is singularly backward in the performance of his duties.\nIt was still, however, not the Congress nor their own strength but the Government whom the kisans looked to for an improvement of their condi\u00ac tion. Their discontent was entirely with the landlords and was not in any way anti-British or anti-Government. Their objectives might have seemed Bolshevik to alarmed officials; but their methods were as yet the opposite of revolutionary. \u2018They have their grievances and their miseries and it is up to Government to put things right.

Legislative Council, Tba Laedar,  January . This Is a common feature of peasant revolts. Engels noted that the Russian peasants often\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\naudience, according to official reports, melted away. The most that the Kisan Sabhas could do was to secure the defeat of some zamindar candidates in the elections of December . But the U. P. Government threw away its chance and, by its reckless handling of the situation, gave a strong fillip to the move ment, so that throughout the year  many districts in Avadh wejae shaken by explosions of agrarian unrest.\nEarly in January local ruffians in Rae Bareli district took advantage of the tension to burn crops grown on the sir (personal) lands of the zamindars and to loot shops in the bazaars; and there was probably some ground for the belief that a few of these miscreants had been encouraged by the zamindars themselves in order to bring the kisans and their organizations into disrepute. On the th three of the kisan leaders were arrested, and a large crowd began to drift towards Rae Bareli town in the hope of seeing these leaders. Encourage\u00ac ment for this move wasprovided by the deputy commissioner\u2019s assurance to the kisans that he would listen at Rae Bareli to their grievances which had been heightened by the failure of the kharif{autumn) harvest and the holding off of the winter rains. However, on the th the police opened fire on a crowd at Fursatganj, ten miles to the east of Rae Bareli, killing between four and six people; and the next day there was heavy firing at Munshiganj, two miles south of the town, with at least nine dead and a large number wounded.\nOn both occasions the authorities had clearly panicked. At Munshiganj neither the deputy commissioner nor the superintendent of police had given the order to fire, and it was generally believed that the firing had been started by the local talukdar, on a crowd which was not interested in looting and had done no more than throw a few stones. Butler, the Lieutenant-Governor, reported to the Government of India that \u2018the Deputy Commissioner was a poet and had lost his head\u2019; and to avoid his cross-examination in court the U.P. Govern\u00ac mentdecided not to prosecute TheIndependent for its scathing articles on these events. It would have been difficult to explain away what even the deputy com\u00ac missioner accepted, that a large proportion of the injuries received by members of the crowd were in the back.But to the public it waspretended that the firings alone had saved the whole of the south of Rae Bareli district from widespread looting and the rapid attainmentof a state of anarchy; and Butler sent a telegram of congratulations to the district authorities and the talukdar.\nIt was the wanton firing on the th near Rae Bareli which brought the kisans into direct collision with the authorities. Even the crowd at Fursatganj on the\nrevolted against the nobility but never against the Tsar. Chinese historians speak of a \u2018peasant monarchism', the peasants being unable to conceive of any alternative to seeking salvation from an emperor. See J. P.

A first\u00ac hand account in The Independent asserted that the 'kisan sabhas are not in the least concerned with the disturbances, for which a few confirmed vagabonds and convicts are responsible\u2019. However, to many officials the differences be\u00ac tweendacoits, kisans and non-co-operatorswere becoming increasingly blurred. \u2018Ignorant peasantry\u2019, alleged a Government communique, \u2018had been persuaded by perambulating agitators that not only talukdar but British raj would shortly cease to exist and that under the beneficent rule of Mr Gandhi they would enter on a golden age of prosperity in which they would be able to buy good cloth at  annas per yard and other necessaries of life at similar cheap rates.\u2019\nThis confusion in the official outlook suited the talukdars; but it worried the kisan representatives, some of whom came to see Jawaharlal at Allahabad on the th and requested him to visit the Rae Bareli district. Jawaharlal was reluc\u00ac tant, as he had just returned from the Congress session at Nagpur; nor was he willing to see the Congress and kisan organizations associated with the looting that had occurred. But on hearing from a well-known citizen of Rae Bareli the next day that the situation was serious, and knowing that the local kisans had no capable leader, Jawaharlal left by the night train, reaching Rae Bareli at  p.m. on the  th. He then heard of the firing at Fursatganj the previous day, and of the confrontation between the officials and the large kisan crowd at Munshiganj. He promptly went to the scene with the intention of directing the crowd to disperse, and told the kisans he met on the way to go home. But mean\u00ac time he received a pencilled note from the deputy commissioner: \u2018Pt Jawahar\u00ac lal Nehru. You are hereby informed that your presence in this district is not desired\u2014you are directed to leave by the next train.\u2019 Jawaharlal sent his reply on the back of the slip: \u2018I should like to know if this is a formal order or a mere request. If it is the former then it should be drawn up in a formal manner mentioning the section etc. Until such an order is served on me I propose to remain here.\u2019 Stopped by policemen from crossing a bridge on the other side of which the firing was taking place, Jawaharlal addressed such of the kisans as came across, impressing on them the need to be both non-violent and fearless. It was obviously a deep experience for Jawaharlal.\nThey behaved as brave men, calm and unruffled in the face of danger.\n do not know how they felt but I know what my feelings were.

The Lieutenant-Governor also, eager to dear the talukdars of responsibility for agrarian distress and the Government tor their clumsy handling of the situation, encouraged this kind of sloppy thinking. 'The agrarian disturbances which were largely due to local agitators acting as non-co-operators have been firmly dealt with and order has been.restored.' Butler's Minute  March . Home Dept.

I spoke to them in all humility on non* violence \u2014 I who needed the lesson more than they \u2014 and they heeded me and peacefully dispersed. On the other side of the river, hqwever, men lay dead and dying. It was a similar crowd with a similar object. Yet they poured their hearts* blood before they would disperse.\nThe deputy commissioner, who had by now come back across the bridge, sent for Jawaharlal and informed him that meetings were prohibited. Though aware that Jawaharlal was using his influence against violent agitation, yet the officials were unwilling to let him speak to the crowd; for as they said to him, they were not there to increase his prestige. Jawaharlal, abiding by this order, dissolved the meeting after addressing it for a few minutes. The deputy com\u00ac missioner thanked Jawaharlal for his talk which had had a good effect on the kisans, and took Jawaharlal in his car, along with the local talukdar, to his house, where they had a desultory, inconsequential conversation. Told that every effort to disperse the kisans had been in vain, Jawaharlal replied that he perhaps might have succeeded where they had failed.\nThe Rae Bareli firing was of major significance. The sense of tenant wrong had converged with an awareness of tenant strength. \u2018For the first time in his\u00ac tory, they had begun to realize the power of an united peasantry \u2014 to realize that they themselves had the remedy of the most flagrant of their wrongs, the illegal exactions of their landlords, in their own hands. If they stood together, nazarana, began and other oppressive taxes would automatically cease.\u2019 And in the exercise of this new-found power, they had now the leadership of the Congress, whose influence over the kisans had been strengthened by the Gov\u00ac ernment: \u2018there is nothing to choose locally between a gathering under the auspices of the kisan sabha or of the Khilafat Committee. Both movements appear to have been completely captured by the non-co-operating party, and there is one movement only in progress at the present time and that is the non- co-operation movement.\u2019\nJoined by his father the next day, Jawaharlal visited the wounded in hospital and then left for Allahabad. His dispatches, signed and unsigned, to The Independent were sharply critical of the Government and the local talukdar, but his conduct at Rae Bareli itself was far from being that of a \u2018firebrand\u2019, as\n*The Rae Bareli Tragedy\u2019, Tba lnd*p*nd*nt,  January .*\nSee Jawaharlal\u2019s article in Tb* lndtp*nd*\u00bbt,  January .\n*Report of Shirreff,  January , Hone Dept.

This implied that Jawaharlal would stir the kisans- to further violence and give them a wider cause. But he had at this time noeconomic ideology to offer, and he had certain\u00ac ly no intent of securing any weapons for these kisans to sustain their revolt. His whole influence was thrown on the side of moderation, in urging the kisans to be quiet and peaceful, to abide by whatever orders were issued by the local officials and to go back to their homes. A few days later, when disturbances began in Fyzabad division, where too, as in Pratabgarh, the small tenants were low-caste men employed by Brahmin zamindars, he went to Unchahar to call off the meeting, which had been announced long before to inform the kisans of the decisions of the Nagpur Congress, and persuaded the kisans who had collected from various parts of Avadh to disperse; and the commissioner arranged for their free transport to their home by train. The Finance Member of the U.P. Government noted smugly that \u2018it looks as if the agitators were getting cold feet'.\nThen, when news came in of sporadic renewal of looting, Jawaharlal was asked by local leaders to visit Fyzabad district; and he addressed large meetings exhorting kisans, if they were serious and earnest about sitfaraj, to take a pledge not to resort to violence or looting. Often, after he had spoken, men got up to confess to looting, knowing well that this would lead to their arrest. At Akbar- pur, criticizing the 'babas\u2019 or messianic leaders like Ram Chandra and his imi\u00ac tators who were preaching extremism, Jawaharlal warned the kisans not to believe that every person in coloured clothes was a real sadhu and a messenger of Gandhi; for Gandhi would never advise irreligious or unlawful activities. Those who had taken part in dacoities should purge themselves of their sin by expressing their sympathy with those robbed and their hatred of the robbers. Every kisan should take a vow not to rob anyone or abuse anybody. Jawaharlal glamorized the kisans and saw them as brave men uncontaminated by city life or text-book education; but he was not deeply moved by their economic wretch\u00ac edness. He saw in them a sturdy peasantry which would be the backbone of a successful nationalist movement, and he wished to enlist them wholly for the political struggleas it was being waged by the Congress; but he did not envisage the co-ordination of these scattered outbursts against local misery and the devel\u00ac opmentof a large-scale peasant revolt and even perhaps a revolution. He agreed with Gandhi and the other leaders of the Congress that the kisans should pay their rents and devote their full attention to the non-violent smuggle for swafuj.

Indeed, later Jawaharlal even preached kisan-zamindar unity; and on the issue of eject\u00ac ment, which, more than any other, agitated the kisans of the U. P., all he could say was that this was but a minor part of the major issue of ejectment of the British from India. ' #\nAt this time Jawaharlal had not considered carefully whether economic and social change should be part of, or even parallel to, the political revolution; and he was willing to accept without thought the suggestion that economic issues should not be allowed to hinder political activity. His idea of freedom was purely political \u2014 ridding the British of their control over finance, the army and the police. Freedom was spinning, the wearing of hand-spun cloth, justice, prohibition, removal of untouchability and all such moral virtues; and foreign rule was the opposite of these. There was very little economic connotation. But even this concept of \u2018politics in command\u2019 was narrow and limited. The kisan sabhasoi the Congress during this period were very different from Mao\u2019s peasant Associations in China a few years later. These associations did not undertake drastic land reforms but they at least organized the peasants and attacked the social domination of the landlords. Jawaharlal\u2019s political ideas in these years tended in the same direction, for they were a curious, unformed mixture of anarchism and village government, of Gandhi and Bertrand Russell. Representative institutions and democracy as found in Western countries had proved failures, and the problem was to free democracy from the malign in\u00ac fluences of capital, property, militarism and an overgrown bureaucracy. Ortho\u00ac dox socialism also did not give much hope, and the war had shown that an all-powerful state was no lover of individual liberty. Life under socialism would be a joyless and a soul-less thing/ regulated to the minutest detail by bureaucratic rules and orders. Jawaharlal was at this time a great believer in devolution and as little centralization as possible. Swaraj was to him panchayat raj and he favoured giving these village councils considerable powers even in civil and criminal matters. But all this lay in the future. It did not strike him to take any immediate steps such as setting up village schools and co-operatives or demand\u00ac ing even the minimum redressal of tenant wrong.\nWhether Jawaharlal was aware of it or not, his attitudes at this time implied informal collaboration with the Government in the maintenance of law and order; and the U.P. Government were shrewd enough to realize this. As they\n The Independent,  January .\n Speech at Tanda,  March .\n* Speech at Pratabgarh,  April . Cf.

Ram Chandra was arrested, a serious riot broke out. Gandhi and Jawaharlal were then in Banaras, and Jawaharlal urged the excited crowd to obey Gandhi and allow Ram Chandra to be arrested quietly. The U.P. Government now prohibited public meetings in the five districts of Avadh and decided to prosecute three local agitators and the officials of village panchayats \u2014 though not Jawaharlal or any other promi\u00ac nent leader. The situation was, from the Government\u2019s point of view, deepening into a crisis. Kisan unrest was widespread and, in parts of the Fyzabad district, embraced the bulk of the rural population. In the affected areas, few were now on the side of the Government. It was possible for leaders to collect at a very short notice enormous crowds who were prepared to carry out any instructions without question. Where the kisan sabha movement had spread, the authority of the talukdars had crumbled at a stroke; and very few of them did anything else but shut themselves up in their houses or leave for the nearest town. The kisans had to a large extent lost all fear of the police, and the efforts of the Con\u00ac gress had succeeded to the extent that the kisans were now prepared to defy not just the landlords but even the Government. It was believed by the officials that the leaders of the non-co-operation party had built up an enormous organization which they could start working whenever they pleased, and that they were steadily using their influence to instil hatred of Europeans and Indian officials. No longer could the authorities comfort themselves with the belief that the kisans had no grudge against them but sought redress from them. In one vil\u00ac lage, Tajuddinpur, for a few weeks swarajwas proclaimed and a parallel govern\u00ac ment set up.\nThe Government were baffled. \u2019There is undoubtedly a conspiracy behind the whole movement which we have not yet managed to unravel. The C.I.D. appear to know nothing about it.' The suspicion, though baseless, made the Government all the more anxious that the leadership of this movement should remain with men like Gandhi and Jawaharlal, who advised the tenants to pay\n Administration Report of the United Provinces, -, supplementary chapter.\n General Dept.

The strengthening of the moderate Congress influ\u00ac ence was part of the same policy as marching troops through the district; they were both intended to keep the kisans from passing wholly under the influence of the extremist agitators. *\nThe arrest of these agitators cleared the way for the strengthening of Cong\u00ac ress influence over the kisans. The Government were relieved to find that though the leaders of the Congress formally recorded their protest at these arrests, they placed less emphasis on inflammatory propaganda and concen\u00ac trated their efforts on organization and the collection of funds. In Fyzabad division the tenants were directed to remain quiet and avoid disturbances and meetings; they should pay their subscriptions and leave it to Gandhi to win swaraj in a few months. Motilal Nehru drafted a leaflet for distribution to the kisans, urging them to join the Congress, take up spinning, settle disputes in their own pancbayats and not in the law courts, subscribe to the swaraj fund and promote caste and communal harmony. Nothing was said about rents or evictions, and a positive directive was given to avoid gatherings in districts where public meetings hoi been prohibited. \u2018But above all it is most necessary that all kisans should follow the path of righteousness, should speak the truth, should not indulge in any looting and should refrain from every violence in word and deed, and should commit no excesses of any kind.\u2019\nThese instructions, far from being revolutionary, were to the benefit of the authorities. Yet the Government arrested six young men who were distribut\u00ac ing the pamphlet and sentenced them to jail for six months on the ground that the pamphlet attempted to excite disaffection and to bring the Government into hatred and contempt. The harsh action was clearly meant to proclaim that the Government had recovered their nerve, and intended no longer to tolerate intervention by Congressmen in kisan affairs. The pamphlet itself was later proscribed; but significantly no action was taken against its author, Motilal Nehru, or against Jawaharlal who distributed the pamphlet in the court room itself and wrote formally to the magistrate that he would continue to give the widest possible publicity to the pamphlet which gave expression to his views.\nThe failure to be arrested, at a time when his followers were receiving savage sentences for carrying out his orders, acutely embarrassed Jawaharlal; and his predicament was not lessened by Gandhi\u2019s article in Young India dis\u00ac approving of any radical demands by the kisans. There is little doubt that the kisans ... are not making wise use of their newly found power . .. Whilst we will not hesitate to advise the kisans when the moment comes to suspend payment of taxes to the Government, it is not contemplated that at any stage of non-co-operation we would seek to deprive the zamindars of their rent.

Cesses also continued to be exacted, while some landlords refused to give receipts for rents paid, as they were collecting more than was recorded in the village accounts. In November , the AICC permitted full civil dis\u00ac obedience including non-payment of taxes (but not of rents); and though the Congress had little to do with the Eka Movement in Hardoi, Sitapur and Lucknow, which was a revival of kisan agitation in a new form, the Eka asso\u00ac ciations soon began to pass political resolutions. But Jawaharlal himself took little part in this kisan resurgence, being preoccupied elsewhere.\n> May .\nReport of Lt.-Col. J. C. Faunthorpe on the Eka Movement,  April . U. P. Government The Moderate Disciple of Gandhi\nJawaharlal had by now begun to take an interest in all-India affairs. He planned to accompany Gandhi on his tour of the Central Provinces, and he had visited Calcutta in January  to address the Postal Peons Union and advise the men as to how a labour union could be utilized as a political weapon against the Government. But he gave close attention to the development of the non-co- operation campaign in his own province, and this afforded him no great satis\u00ac faction. \u2018I am afraid all we can do is to try to carry on. The conditions of the experimentaresuch that it is exceedingly difficult for the U.P. to to fulfil them. The Government were of a similar opinion, and therefore complacent. It was true that there was a spirit of unruliness and unrest which had to some extent loosened authority, weakened the sense of law and order and depressed officials and loyalists. But the campaign of non-co-operation appeared to have generally failed, and the U.P. Government felt no need for special measures to control it or for the arrest of national leaders. It seemed adequate to prohibit meetings, protect loyalists from social boycott, organize propaganda against non-co- operation in every district and rely on the preventive sections of the ordinary law. In fact, even these measures were not always thought to be necessary and the Government permitted the holding of a political, a Khilafat and various other conferences at Dehra Dun.\nJawaharlal presided over the political conference, and urged his audience not to cease from fighting till swaraj had been won. There could be no half\u00ac measures, no compromise on vital issues. A new spirit of liberty, sacrifice and self-purification was abroad in the country, and the Government were in a state of \u2018blue funk\u2019. Their policy of repression was a sure presage of coming victory. He appealed to students to leave Government schools and colleges\n\u2018See extracts from the weekly report of the DIB,  January .\nTo Syed Mahmud,  April .\nG.B.

It provided an easy source of supplementary income to the starving millions in the countryside and helped to restore their self-confidence; and the use of the cbarka or spinning-wheel by all Congressmen could prove a binding link between the town-dwellers and the kisans. To create a market for this hand- spun yarn, Gandhi made compulsory the wearing of khaddar, or cloth woven of this yarn. Khaddar, in Jawaharlal\u2019s later phrase, became the \u2018livery of freedom\u2019.\nJawaharlal organized the Allahabad district conference, presided over by Maulana Mahomed Ali and attended by Gandhi and other leaders, and proposed that at least , persons in the district should be registered as members of the Congress, special eftorts being made to enlist women. But Jawaharlal was not prepared to recommend a no-tax campaign in Allahabad city without consultation with their leaders until the other items in the non- co-operation campaign had been completed, as he did not believe this could be properly carried out.* He then undertook a tour of the districts of U.P. to strengthen the Congress and Khilafat movements. He travelled by train, car and ekka (horse carriage) and even on one occasion ran between two places  precedents for the election campaigns he was to undertake years later in all parts of India. Once he reached a railway station too late and missed the train. The stationmaster, an official but a patriot, provided him with a trolley to cover the twenty or thirty miles to the next junction, and was dismissed for his pains.*\nYet, despite all this energetic effort of Jawaharlal and his colleagues, the non-co-operation campaign failed to gather impetus in the United Provinces. Over , panchayats, encouraged to take the place of the law courts for settling disputes, were functioning, but nearly , panchayats in north\u00ac eastern Avadh were suppressed by the Seditious Meetings Act. District courts, which had worn a deserted appearance at the beginning of , now once again were crowded, though mostly by friends and relatives of defendants.

From July  the U.P. Congress concentrated on promoting the making ofyam by the use of the charka and the weaving of cloth from this yarn. Most district committees formed special swadeshi departments and put their best workers in charge of them. Charkas were distributed widely, and the weavers were encouraged to utilize the yarn spun from these charkas. Model weaving-schools were esta\u00ac blished, and almost every national school had its spinning and weaving depart\u00ac ment. A large amount of yarn was also sent to other provinces. The converse of this propagation of swadeshi was the campaign against foreign cloth. Most towns and large villages had their bonfires of such cloth. Merchants and tailors were asked to take a pledge not to sell or use it; and here again the success was considerable, even without resort to large-scale picketing. *\nThis boycott now claimed Jawaharlal\u2019s full attention. While he still demanded militant action and declared that the place of every Indian was in\u00ac side jail, yet the emphasis was on boycott offoreign cloth. In Allahabad city he was one of those who went round from house to house collecting foreign clothes.\nAt the U.P. political conference in October  Jawaharlal moved the resolution on swadeshi. At this time an unqualified Gandhian, he argued that as the attainment of swaraj depended on the use of swadeshi cloth, the people should be asked to discard, burn or export foreign cloth and use home-made cloth instead. He was as impatient to drive out the English from India as any\u00ac one else, but he had not till now discovered any new method of doing so except swadeshi. He did not agree with those who advocated the use of the sword. In the last resort they would all come to the conclusion that they could win and retain swaraj only by the use of swadeshi cloth. \nThis was indeed moderation, which the Government could got seriously quarrel with; and it was further emphasized by the resolutions passed under Jawaharlal\u2019s presidency at the Rae Bareli district conference in November. Strict non-violence, the maintenance of Hindu-Muslim unity and the removal of the evil of untouchability were stated to be the appropriate preparations for civil disobedience.\nReport of the U.P.

The talukdars were also asked to boycott the visit of the Prince of Wales to Lucknow. The one non-platitudinous resolution of the conference was the insistence on the \u2018instant universal use\u2019 of khaddar and on the manu\u00ac facture of khaddar on a considerable scale.\nJawaharlal was also very careful at this time to abide by the various orders of the Government. There was little defiance in his mood. At Shikarpur, for example, when an order under S.  prohibiting a meeting was served on him while he was speaking, he immediately stopped and turned his attention to the collection of foreign clothes and subscriptions for the swaraj fund. When a similar order was served on him at Bhiti, he marched with the whole audience of about a thousand to the next district four and a half miles away and held the meeting there.\nHowever, for some time the U.P. Government had been collecting material for taking action against The Independent for its articles, and against Jawahar\u00ac lal for seditious speeches. But as the case against the Ali brothers was thought to be the stronger one, Jawaharlal\u2019s case was held over till a decision Had been taken by the Government of India on that case and that of The Independent. Opinion at Simla was in favour of giving The Independent an opportunity to express regret; and the U.P. Government, although (excepting one mini\u00ac ster) of the view that there was no alternative to taking proceedings, decided to give a similar opportunity to Jawaharlal. So, on  June , Jawaharlal was informed that no proceedings would be taken against him if he undertook not to deliver speeches directly or indirectly inciting to violence or calculated to create an atmosphere of readiness for violence. Similar notices were sent the same day to the editor and printer of The Independent.\nJawaharlal promised the Collector of Allahabad, who had forwarded the Government\u2019s notice, to send a reply within a week; but his father, who was at Ramgarh near Naini Tai in the hills, telegraphed direct to the Collector that a reply would only be sent after due consideration.

He decided, as he told Jawaharlal, to act the boss, as he believed he had every right to do, and rectify by his interference \u2014 \u2018vis major\u2019 \u2014 Jawaharlal's mistake in making promises. Jawaharlal now drafted his reply with great care \u2014 at least three drafts exist \u2014 and took it to Ramgarh to have ft reviewed by his father. Motilal was of course fully aware that he and Jawaharlal sooner or later would find themselves in gaol, and he was unflinching. He had spurned the suggestion that he might meet Harcourt Butler or proceed to Simla to see the Viceroy. \u2018I would not for the life of me approach Sir H. in the interest of Jawahar or myself or for that matter any other individual. . . Jawahar and I both know what is coming and are fully prepared for it.\u2019 But he saw no reason to make the Government\u2019s task easier, and tightened up his son\u2019s draft so as to make it more precise without, being any the less defiant, removing any suggestion that Jawaharlal could still be regarded by anyone else but him as an \u2018impressionable youngster easily carried away by anything that he reads\u2019. The accuracy of police reporting of Jawaharlal's speeches was questioned, and any apology or undertaking was refused; if he had erred by saying any\u00ac thing which was untrue or exaggerated or had produced the impression that he was condemning the whole British people, he would apologize, but only to the public.\nThe Home Member and his department agreed with the U.P. Government that Jawaharlal should now be prosecuted. But the Viceroy, as Motilal had expected, viewed this in the all-India context and, as part of the delaying tactics he was employing against the Congress, decided to ignore Jawaharlal. The U.P. Government were instructed to proceed only against the editor and printer of The Independent. Butler now agreed.\nIf they start civil disobedience, they will put themselves in the wrong,\nwhereas if we run in prominent leaders, we may drive a good deal of\nsympathy to their side. It is a choice of evils, and I think the lesser evil is\nto hold one\u2019s hand for the present.\nBy November  the Government of India were ready to take drastic action against the non-co-operation campaign, which was now developing new manifestations and frequently erupting in violence.

There, thanks chiefly to Jawaharlal, the volunteer squads had become well-drilled units which successfully organized a complete hartal (strike) in Lucknow, Allahabad, Kanpur and theotherprincipal towns and wereeffectively picketing shops selling foreign goods. Even the Viceroy conceded this success, particularly in Allahabad.\nThe non-co-operators put forward the full strength of an undoubtedly powerful organization and yet, save in Allahabad, have really not suc\u00ac ceeded anywhere, although, surveying the situation impartially, I am bound to admit that they have at places managed to prevent the visit [of the Prince of Wales] being the unqualified and triumphant success it would otherwise have been.\nThe U.P. Congress had also announced its intention of preparing selected tehsils for civil disobedience; and though the Government did not take this seriously, it was obvious that, if civil disobedience were started, trained volunteers would be utilized for this purpose. Every district Congress com\u00ac mittee had been directed to constitute a volunteer board immediately. So the volunteer organization in the U.P. was declared unlawful, and Jawaharlal, the converter and secretary of the U.P. volunteer board, and his father were arrested on  December for their connection with this activity. Motilal was delighted togo to jail with his son, and departed in a mood of exaltation. Jawa\u00ac harlal too was happy to secure, as the accolade of patriotism, a sentence of six months\u2019 simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs  or a further month in jail. Father and son and a few others, who were being treated better than the rank and file of Congress prisoners, wrote to the jail superintendent declining these special privileges. 'We wish to recognize no class distinction in our army of Swaraj.' A fellow Congressman who saw the Nehrus in jail a week after reported that 'the smiling and happy countenance of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru stood out in relief amongst the persons in the lock-up.\u2019 He continued to direct from jail the work of the U.P. Congress, and drew up plans to ensure that it did not cease to function despite official suppression and that it demons\u00ac trated its authority by filling the jails.\nBecause of some technical defect in his sentence, Jawaharlal, to his own\n\u2018Hone Dept, circular to local governments,  November .

By now Gandhi had called off the civil disobedience campaign because of the increasing violence. Jawaharlal, like most others, was bitterly disappointed, especially as the campaign in his own province had been mustering strength. Even the Government had been worried by the widespread tension and pre\u00ac parations for intensification of civil disobedience. 'The situation is rapidly deteriorating and getting more out of control. His Excellency in Council has no doubt that the deterioration will spread and have alarming developments, unless action is taken to stop the agitation at its source.\u2019 Volunteer units in uniform were attempting to replace the police, while Congressmen in certain districts set up theirown schools, courts and cattle pounds. The Commissioner of Allahabad reported that the establishment of Congress tbanas (police stations) with men performing point duty and other police functions \u2018was not so much an organized movement run by the nominal leaders as a more or less spontaneous movement of the lower castes, Muhammadans more especially. This made it all the more likely to spread, and the Commissioner thought that there was danger of its developing into a general strike or boycott of Europeans.\u2019 The U.P. Government had therefore proposed legislation to prevent usurpation of the functions of the police,\nGandhi\u2019s action enabled the Government to relax and made' Jawaharlal\u2019s task in sustaining the morale of Congressmen so much the harder. \u2018I have only to say this \u2014 keep fighting, continue to work for independent India and do not stop. Do not abandon your creed. Do not accept false compromises. Continue to follow your great leader Mahatma Gandhi and remain true to Congress. Be efficient, be well organised and above all remember the charka and ahimsa. \u2019 He attended Gandhi\u2019s trial at Ahmedabad, and then returned to organize spinning, boycott and picketing in the United Provinces. The suggestion that he should visit England as a member of the Khilafat delegation appealed to his father who was still in jail.\nI would readily welcome the opportunity of your having to spend some time on the sea and in Europe in the interest of all \u2014 yourself, myself and the country at large. As you know I am unable to follow the politic- religious philosophy of Gandhiji beyond a certain point... in any case some understandable service from outside is far preferable in my opinion to the very douibtful merit supposed to flow from rotting in jail to expiate the crime of Chauri Chaura.

It was the incident at Chauri Chaura, a village in the United Provinces, where a mob set fire to a police station and  ftmstables lost their lives, that led Gandhi to call off civil disobedience.\nTHE MODERATE DISCIPLE OF GANDHI\n\nBut the idea of leaving India at this time could not have been attractive to Jawaharlal. However much he might deplore Gandhi\u2019s latest action, he had, unlike his father, no reservations about Gandhi\u2019s leadership and believed he had enough to do even outside political action.\nYou will be glad to learn that work is flourishing. We are laying sure foundations this time. God willing, our next march forward will end in victory. Rest assured that there will be no relaxation, no*lessening in our activities and above all there will be no false compromise with Government. We stand for the truth. How can we tamper with anything which has been soiled by the touch of falsehood?\nAs the Government recognized, \u2018quiet propaganda work\u2019 organized by Jawaharlal from Allahabad was widespread. He addressed public meetings in the city and elsewhere and circulated Hindi pamphlets. The voice through\u00ac out was Gandhian. The atmosphere, he said, was calm but this did not mean that non-co-operation was dead. It could never die until the goal was reached; and the great war raging in the country could have only one result \u2014 an Indian victory. So they should go forward trusting God. The practical work to be done was promotion of swadeshi and spinning, removal of untouchability, sub\u00ac scription to the Tilak fund and enrolment of volunteers and of Congress mem\u00ac bers, the age limit for which had been reduced from twenty-one to eighteen. But all violence was to be avoided and there should be no forcible closing of shops. Students should not court arrest but if arrested should gladly meet their fate.\nThe advice Jawaharlal gave to the students he himself for a time followed. While his activity was open and effective, he did not at first go out of his way to court arrest. Hegave the lead in organizing hartals of mourning on  April, at the start of the National Week, in lament for lack of freedom, and on  April, to. commemorate Jallianwala Bagh. But he advised the organizers of the political conference at Dehra Dun to abide by the prohibitory order of Government. However, he began to feel that concentration on constructive work was becoming almost impossible because of official oppression and terrorism. He and a colleague visited Sitapur district to inquire into one in\u00ac stance of such allegations, and the atrocities committed there, said Jawaharlal in a public speech, were such as to make the occurrences in the Punjab pale. So it might be necessary to start individual civil disobedience again of some kind. The organization should therefore be perfected, tours planned and\n^Jawaharlal to Syed Mahmud,  April .\n Chief Secretary U.P. to Home Secretary,  May , Home Dept. Pol. .

The Govern\u00ac ment reacted, and on  May the Congress offices and Anand Bhawan were searched. Clearly arrest was imminent, and Jawaharlal issued another circular to Congress committees, written while the search was being conducted, \u2018almost in the shadow of the police'. The people had shown enthusiasm and courage, and only organization was necessary to achieve success. Non-co- operation had gained India a new status in the eyes of the world. \u2018That has been the achievement of a few months. Truly a wonderful record for which let us, in all humility, thank the Giver of all.\u2019\nAweek later, on  May, Jawaharlal was arrested on a charge of organizing picketing and advocating it in his writings and speeches. As a non-cooperator he refused to plead, cross-examine the witnesses or offer any defence, but he made a long statement. He pointed out that though he was being tried for criminal intimidation and extortion the prosecution could not produce any witness to suggest that the picketing had not been peaceful. On the other hand, it was the Government which had, throughout the province, been guilty of in\u00ac timidation and terrorism. However, he was grateful to the authorities for fram\u00ac ing this particular charge, for it gave publicity to the boycott of foreign cloth. The people of Allahabad and the U.P. 'would know that the salvation of India and her hungry millions demanded the use of the cbarka and the weaving of khaddar, and they would cast out all foreign cloth and consign them to the flames or to the dustbin.\u2019\nJ awaharlal also referred to the wider issue of British rule. Fond as he was of England \u2014 and perhaps because of his fondness \u2014 he had now become a rebel and all his activities had but one end in view.\nJail has indeed become a heaven for us, a holy place of pilgrimage since our saintly and beloved leader was sentenced ... I marvel at my good fortune. To serve India in the battle of freedom is honour enough. To serveher under a leader like Mahatma Gandhi is doubly fortunate. But to suffer for the dear country! What greater good fortune could befall an Indian, unless it be death for the cause or the full realisation of our glorious dream.\nHis heart-warming statement of nationalist passion, with its loyalty to Gandhi's leadership Mended with romantic echoes of the Risorgimento, was heard far beyond the district court and Jawaharlal's own province. The Gov\u00ac ernment were deluding themselves with the belief that, while the doth-dealer witnesseshad respectfully saluted the accused, the case had attracted little public attention. Jawaharlal had in mind a wider audience, and the first of his trial statements secured for him a national audience and became the manifesto of\nCircular,  May .\naChief Secretary U.P. to Hone Dept,  June . Home Dept. ftl. , File .\nTHE MODERATE DISCIPLE OF GANDHI\n\nthe educated youth of India. Motilal was delighted to find, on an all-India tour later in the year, that his son\u2019s influence was widespread; and he was much moved when a large crowd in Delhi cheered him and his wife as the father and motherof Jawaharlal. As Motilal saw, the points of law in the statement were weak and could be improved upon. It was not sufficient to say that picketing had been peaceful in order to disprove the charge of extortion; an association of cotton merchants had been levying fines on those who had been selling foreign cloth, and Jawaharlal should have established that he and the Congress had nothing to do with this organization. But these deficiencies in legal argument did all the more credit to Jawaharlal\u2019s heart and to his intense patriotism and enhanced the value of the statement from the viewpoint of the Congress and non-co-operation. \u2019On reading your statement I felt I was the proudest father in the world. In its firm and simple dignity it would bear comparison with the best productions of the Master himself.\u2019\nJawaharlal had expected and hoped for a long sentence; he had been some\u00ac what galled by his earlier premature release, especially as his father was still in jail. \u2018One feels almost lonely outside the jail, and selfishness prompts a quick return.\u2019 He was not disappointed, the sentence being  months\u2019 rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs  and  months\u2019 further imprisonment in case of default. He was placed in Lucknow district jail \u2014 a fact which worried his father, who did not believe Jawaharlal could bear extreme heat and would have preferred his son to join him in Naini Tal jail or to be sent to Almora. Jawaharlal\u2019s health was at this time none too good and he continued in jail homoeopathic treatment, which consisted mainly of arsenic and sulphur. His diet was frugal and vegetarian \u2014 curds, bread and butter, milk and fruit, apart from rice, chapatis, dal and vegetables for lunch, which was his only sub\u00ac stantial meal.\nBecause the jail superintendent and warders harassed visitors-and subjected themto petty indignities, Jawaharlal and his companions for some months gave up interviews and saw no friendly face from outside. He did not even visit other barracks during this period. But on the whole Jawaharlal was content with his existence. The mere fact of being confined boosted his self-respect. He hoped too that jail life, with its deprivations, would harden him, and enjoyed his enforced leisure to' the full.\nIt is those who work and labour outside who deserve sympathy, not we who laze and eat and sleep. Soon the pleasant autumn days will come and it will be delightful to be under the trees. And what can be pleasanter than freedom from worry? We have no appointments to keep, no piling up of work with which we cannot cope, no speechifying, no hurry.

He was allowed two, daily news\u00ac papers, The Leader and The Englishman, till  November, when the jail authorities discontinued them. He started learning Urdu. The journals he received were the Nation, the New Statesman and the Modem Review. But Jawaharlal was not greatly concerned with current developments outside. His interests ranged far and wide, and he was determined to refurbish his mind which had rusted since his return from England. He was not greatly interested in philosophy or religious thought and his speculations in these matters never progressed beyond the superficial. He read in jail the Koran and Arnold\u2019s Light ofAsia as well as the Bhagavad Gita in Mrs Besant\u2019s translation; but he was at this time basically an unthinking, conventional Hindu theist. His attitude was almost platitudinous and lacking in humour. \u2018It is a redeeming feature that the jail authorities have not the power to keep God and His nature out of jail.\u2019 He expressed his gratitude for having such parents and near relatives as held up a lofty ideal before him and always added to his strength and spirit; and he was sure that the life they were leading now was much better than what they had abandoned. \u2018Now\u2019, he added, \u2018I understand a little what Jesus meant when he asked us to forsake the world and save our soul.\u2019 He observed his birthday in jail according to his mother\u2019s directives, even setting aside five rupees for dis\u00ac tribution to the poor.\nHis special interests were history, travel and poetry. It was now that he began to collect the facts and thoughts which later went into the making of Glimpses of World History. Among the books he specially asked for were Havell\u2019s Aryan Rule in India \u2014 which appealed to him through its idealiza\u00ac tion of India\u2019s past \u2014 and Bryce\u2019s Holy Roman Empire, the memoirs of Babar and Bernier\u2019s travels. He also read Sven Hedin\u2019s books, and, hugging to himself a private dream-world, he drew up an itinerary of a journey he would undertake after swaraj was won, via Kashmir and Ladakh to Manasarovar and Kailas and the famous cities of central Asia, and then across Afghanistan, Iran and Arabia to Europe.\nIn poetry his interests were romantic \u2014 Keats, Shelley, Swinburne, Tenny\u00ac son\u2019s Idylls of the King; and his long letters to his family also bear a marked streak of romanticism. He relished the idea of being in the thick of a nationalist struggle, and was full of Italian precedents. \u2018In the golden days to come when the history of our times and our country comes to be written the present will occupy a glorious chapter. And shall we not think of the good old days? Shall we not remember the great men who showed us the way and filled us with the fire of faith?\u2019 And then he quotes Meredith, replacing \u2018Italia\u2019 with \u2018India\u2019:\n Jawaharlal to Motilal,  September . *\nTHE MODERATE DISCIPLE OF GANDHI \u20ac\nWe who have seen India in the throes,\nHalf risen but to be hurled to the ground, and now,\nLike a ripe field of wheat, where once drove plough,\nAll bounteous as she is fair, we think of those Who blew the breath of life into her frame.\nThis was adolescent exaltation, yet to be channelled by hard thinking. There is, in all his letters of this time, the glow of virginal suffering and a complacent absence of reflection. Jawaharlal was so excited by the situation in which he found himself, so much in love with sacrifice and hardship, so self-conscious about the immediate context that he gave no thought to the way or the goal. He had made a cradle of emotional nationalism, and rocked himself in it. The special correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, who was permitted by the superintendent of the jail to interview Jawaharlal, was not unfair in reporting that what had struck him most in Jawaharlal\u2019s own account of his life was the steady growth of an impulse to do something, he knew not what, for his country, and the deep satisfaction he felt when Gandhi at last showed him definite things to do; but these were acts of self-sacrifice.\nThe desire to make a sacrifice hid evidently been and still, I think, was very strong in him . . . But though the man\u2019s intelligence, refinement and patriotism were very apparent, I failed to get from him any clear idea of how he proposed to win Swarajor what he proposed to do with it when he had won it.\nSelfishness, Jawaharlal had written, would hardly favour a quick discharge. However, once again he was released before serving his full sentence. He was set free on  January , as part of a general amnesty declared by the U.P. Government without consulting the Government of India, in order to give effect to a resolution of the Provincial Legislative Council recommending such a measure. Welcoming the release of these  political prisoners, The Leader wrote: The greatest among these patriotic souls, the true disciple of Mr Gandhi, is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who moves on a very high plane of thought indeed, who hates none but loves his country with the intensity of a pure nature and a feeling heart.\nThe Leader went on to hope that Jawaharlal would abandon the policy of useless sacrifice and suicidal courses in favour of political action. What it seems to have had in mind was that Jawaharlal should join the Moderates and help in the functioning of dyarchy.\n Report of interview in October, reprinted in Tbt Bombay CbronicU,  December .\n To his father,  November .\n* See Home Dept. Pol. , File .\n* January .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nThe essence of non-co-operation consists in teaching the people the lesson of self-help. Such a lesson cannot be inculcated by laying stress merely on handspinning, or fay promulgating doctrines of hatred. In the field of agriculture, of industries, of co-operation, of education, of local self-government and social service, there is unlimited scope forpreaching the gospel of self-help.\nThe same suggestion was made by the well-meaning Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, Sir Grimwood Mears. He wrote to Motilal three days before Jawaharlal\u2019s release that he wished to establish friendly relations with the latter \u2018and I honestly think I could make life happier for him if he would let me try\u2019. Then, when he met Jawaharlal, Mears hinted to him that a minister- ship could come his way if he wished.\nIt seems astounding that this could even be thought of, and is of interest only as showing how, despite his two terms in jail, Jawaharlal was generally thought of, at least in his home province, as basically a moderate nationalist. It was true that Jawaharlal was fay no means a revolutionary extremist, but he was not an incipient loyalist and the career of a man like Surendranath Ban\u00ac nerjee, whohad left the Congress to become a leading-Moderate and a minister in Bengal, was not likely to be his model. He had not, as yet, far-reaching ideo\u00ac logical commitments, and violent techniques were abhorrent to him; but office under the British certainly could not lure him. Reading was shrewder in his assessment of Jawaharlal as \u2018fanatical in his hostility to Government\u2019.\nJawaharlal, therefore, wasted little time in politely rejecting these sugges\u00ac tions. What gave him greater concern was the sharp difference of opinion within the Congress itself. With Gandhi in jail, the Congress leadership was almost equally split on the issue of entry into Councils. The Gvil Disobedience Inquiry Committee set up by the Congress had stated the arguments of both sides \u2014 of those who were for contesting the elections due to be held in  as well as of those who opposed it. Those in favour believed that with civil dis\u00ac obedience called off, it would be unwise to let the Moderates have a monopoly of the Councils. The Congress should win theelections and control the working of these assemblies. 'Knock these Councils on the head, and you will achieve what millions spent in foreign propaganda cannot achieve.\u2019 But those who opposed any such step argued that it would enhance Government\u2019s prestige; any wrecking of official marhinety should he done from outside. G R. Das Mid Motilal were the leaders of the group favouring Council entry which they envisaged as a new form of non-co-operation \u2014 Congressmen should contest the elections and present the country\u2019s legitimate demands in the Councils; if these were not granted within a reasonable time Congressmen should adopt a policy of uniform, continuous and consistent obstruction with a view to make\ni Sir G. Mean to Motilal,  January .\n Autobiography, pp. -.\n*To Montagu,  July . Reading papers, vol. .\nTHE MODERATE DISCIPLE OF GANDHI\n\ngovernment through Councils impossible. At the annual session of the Con\u00ac gress in December  this policy was rejected by a considerable majority. Das, who was president of the session, was persuaded not to resign; but he and Motilal formed, within the Congress, the Swaraj Party to further their policy of Council entry. It was hoped that this would enable constitutionalists like M. A. Jinnah, who had left the Congress in , to return to the fold.\nThe predicament of Jawaharlal was that, while he was emotionally attached to the leaders of the Swaraj Party, his mind was inclined to agree with those opposed to entering the Councils. In his first speech after his release, he de\u00ac clared that he still stuck to his conviction that non co-operation was the only path which could lead them to self-government. They should continue their fight and indeed further intensify it till their object had been attained. On the specific moveof Council entry he declined to express his opinion on the ground that he was not in touch with current politics; but he emphasized that the desti\u00ac nation and road of both groups were the same, though their conveyances might differ. *  It worried him too that the differences within the Congress might weaken the organization as a whole. So he, with a few others, sought not so much a compromise \u2014 the positions were irreconcilable \u2014 as\u2018an atmosphere of charity and goodwill\u2019 in which both sides could function. At the session of the AICC in Allahabad towards the end of February, he and Maulana Azad persuaded the two groups to suspend all propaganda till the end of April. He himself spent this period of truce touring some of the districts of the United Provinces, collecting funds for the Congress and urging discipline and the wearing of khaddar. But there was little heart in his speeches, and even the U.P. authorities were satisfied that his utterances were mild. At Allahabad, on  April, addressing a meeting to inaugurate the National Week, he was reported to have said no more than that everyone should examine for himself the events of the past four years and pray for guidance. It is not surprising that his election at this time as chairman of the Allahabad Municipal Board caused no alarm in official circles. \u2018He is reported as inclined to be reasonable, but as insisting that his duty to the nationalist cause must precede his obligation to the ratepayers.'\nJawaharlal. was at this time, in fact, rudderless, with no dear ideas as to what he should do.

Congress politics too were once again heading to a collision; the truce was over, and in the first days of May both Motilal and Rajagopalachari, the leader of the no-changers, as they were called, issued manifestos drawing up the lines of battle. Jawaharlal was concerned to avoid this clash, if only to save the Congress, which seemed to him to have practically ceased, during the past four months, to function. \u201cEffective political work has ceased in every province and if this state of affairs is prolonged for some time the Congress would cease to exist. It is undeniable that the most imperative necessity at the present time is to restore the Con\u00ac gress to its original prestige.\u2019 Jawaharlal\u2019s opinion was shared by the Viceroy, who reported smugly at about the same time that non-co-operation as an effec\u00ac tive force was practically dead.\nHie solution favoured by Jawaharlal was one which would give the Swaraj Party the substance and its opponents only the shadow. The decision taken by the Congress in December  against Council entry would still hold, but nopropaganda should be done in its favour; in other words, its operation would be suspended, and those who wished to contest the elections would be face to do so. This formula deceived nobody; but it was accepted by the U.P. Con\u00ac gress committee, and then by the AICC at Bombay in the last week of May. Six members of the Working Committee who were opposed to Council entry promptly resigned. Jawaharlal, whose purpose was to fend off final decisions while allowing the Swarajists to have their way, suggested that these resigna\u00ac tions be not accepted; his resolution was carried by a large majority but the no-changers were firm. In the circumstances, it was agreed that Das also should resign the presidency, and the party executive be manned by those uncommitted to either side, such as Jawaharlal.\nThiswas Jawaharlal\u2019s achievement \u2014 one which even he had not expected. It was the first time he had functioned decisively on the national plne, and we have an interesting first-hand account of the impact he made on his audience.\nHe is no orator, has no tricks of manner of speech. He is sparing in the \u2022wise of words, but the words are carefully chosen, for which his Harrow and Cambridge education are perhaps responsible. His voice is feeble\n\u2018An intercepted letter to Sampumanand dated  April , quoted in C.

When he speaks, sincerity exudes from him as per\u00ac spiration from the body in the month of May in Bombay. He succeeds in impressing his audience probably because he does not consciously try to do so. His anxiety is merely to explain his attitude and to lay bare the processes of the working of his mind and he sometimes overdoes it. He should remember that people are mostly interested in the finished article and not in the processes of its manufacture. His modesty is a virtue; he should be careful not to convert it into a vice. He is sometimes impatient when the audience does not rise to his intellectual level but let him remember there are hordes of people in this world who have to managewith alowerlevel of mental equipment than himself and he should sympathize with them.\nNo polished orator, but one thinking on his feet; modest, stumbling along, but with sincerity intense and transparent \u2014 these remained his characteristics as a public speaker through the years. The only respect in which he did change, and for the better, was that incessant contact with the masses rid him of the early trait of talking down to his audience. In later years his hearers could follow him effortlessly, step by step, in the argument, and never felt that he was preaching to them.\nHowever, the hollow compromise fashioned by Jawaharlal soon crumbled. Rajagopalachari repudiated it while Das toured southern India, Rajagopal- achari\u2019s home ground, campaigning for Swarajist policy. Jawaharlal did not believe that entry into Councils would achieve anything substantial or impor\u00ac tant, but he blamed Rajagopalachari for violating the arrangement. Vallabh- bhai Patel, oneofthe no-changers, pointed out the contradiction of Jawaharlal\u2019s position in agreeing with them but sympathizing with the Das party: \u2018I wonder why you would not allow those who are in the right to have their own way and prefer, to allow those who are in the wrong to do so . . . How do you expect us to quickly reach [sic] with equanimity the rapid demolition of the magnificent edifice that had been erected by the combined sacrifice of so many in this land.* In Nagpur in July the AICC rejected by a majority of two votes Jawaharlai's resolution advocating disciplinary action against those provincial Congress committees which had defied the compromise resolution of May. Thereupon Jawaharlal, along with his colleagues, resigned from the Working Committee and is reported to have expressed a desire to retire from the AICC as well. \u2018 wish\u2019, he remarked to a friend, \u2018we would not hurt each other's hearts so easily and so constantly.\u2019 He had already, on  June, resigned his secretary\u00ac ship of the U.P. provincial Congress committee.\n\u2018Simplex\u2019 in Tba Bombay CbronicU,  May .\n Interview in Aaj, * June .\n*  June .\n Tba Ludar,  July .\n\u2019Sri Prelum's oral testimony, N.M.M.L.",

As irksome to him as the lack of discipline of the no-changers was the resistance of the Swarajists to working through the Congress machinery. 'Are you going to keep the Congress intact or let it go to pieces?* At the Congress session in Delhi iq September the no\u00ac changers conceded defeat by agreeing to the entry into Councils of such Con\u00ac gressmen \u2018as have no religious or other conscientious objection\u2019 to it; but Jawa\u00ac harlal took little part in arriving sfi this decision. His attention was given wholly to such opportunities for \u2018cold-blooded action\u2019 as came his way. \u2018I am weary\u2019, he wrote to a friend in August,^ \u2018and sick at heart. Nagpur has been a most painful experience for me. I came here with the intention of wandering about in the interior for a while away from the haunts of man.\u2019 Strengthening of the party organization and extension of its network, the training and discipline of volunteers and the creation in the country of a general atmosphere of resistance and of indifference to the Government\u2014these were to him the important tasks. He recognized that mass civil disobedience was out of the question for the time being, but Ik helped to organize the satyagraba campaign that developed in Nagpurover the refusal of the district magistrate to allow a Congress procession to carry the national flag. Volunteer squads from different parts of the country were sent to reinforce the local workers till the authorities gave way and permit\u00ac ted a Congress procession with the flag to pass. Again in need of some issue to occupy him, Jawaharlal went to Nabha for a first-hand view of the Akali agitation.\nThe Sikhs had for long been a group favoured by the British Government. They were encouraged to remain a separate community and not to merge in the general Hindu fold. Sikh soldiers were required to keep the five distinctive symbols, and the premium placed on Sikh recruitment led many Hindus to\n Report in Tb* Bombay Cbronielt,  July .  Interview in Aaj,  June . * To Mahadeva Desai.\n\nIN NABHA JAIL \nbecome Sikhs. The  reforms extended separate representation to Sikhs. However, at the end of the First World War, certain sections of the Sikh com\u00ac munity wished to reform the management of the Sikh temples {gurdwaras), which were believed to have become \u2018dens of drunken vice and debauchery\u2019, and the reformers sought to takeover the shrines. The Punjab Government saw in this Akali movement a threat to law and order, and the resistance that the Akalis encountered led to their efforts developing into a widespread mass move\u00ac ment. A plan for religious reform had been converted, despite itself, into a political campaign. A semi-military organization, the Akali Dal, was formed, not merely to evict the corrupt managers of the Sikh shrines but also to accept the challenge of the Government.\nIt was natural that the Akali movement should, at this stage, evoke the in\u00ac terest of the National Congress. This was not because, as Sir Malcolm Hailey later suggested, the Congress had always been looking for a party of physical force to replace their own \u2018somewhat backboneless agitation\u2019, and it would be a godsend to them to secure the Akalis \u2018as a kind of spearhead to their very wobbly staff\u2019. Rather, influenced by Gandhi\u2019s leadership of the non-co-operation cam\u00ac paign, the Sikhs had pledged themselves to non-violence; and they abode by their pledge despite severe provocation. In February , the authorities of Nankana, the shrine at Guru Nanak\u2019s birthplace, were alleged to have poured oil on about two hundred Sikh pilgrims and burned them alive, and officials near by had not intervened. But this did not stop the volunteers of the Akali Dal from proceeding to this and other shrines in protest at mismanagement. In  a jatha (squad) of  Sikh dissenters proceeded daily to the Guru-ka-bagh temple, there to be beaten up by the police; and this continued for about three weeks, resulting in about , Sikhs being beaten without their attempting to defend themselves. Thereafter the police, tired of lathi charges, summarily arrested the volunteers, and in time about , found themselves in jail.\nSo, whatever the original motivation, the Akalis were now acting in the spirit of the Congress campaign, and the Congress in turn took an interest in them. The movement was of special interest to Jawaharlal, for he attached importance to discipline, and was impressed by the organization of the Akali Dal, which maintained order among its recruits and provided for the upkeep of the families of those injured or arrested. He attended conferences, at Lahore and Amritsar in June and July , of Congress, Khilafat and Sikh League workers, and urged them not tobe distracted by such sterile issues as communal representation on district boards and municipalities. The Congress regarded the principle as essentially evil, and local bodies were not of any importance;\ni'll was almost a daily^occurrence for\u2014say\u2014Ram Chand to enter our office and leave it as Ram Singh\u2014Sikh recruit.\u2019 H, L O.

And in September, when in Delhi for the special Congress session, Jawaharlal heard that Sikh jathas were daily proceeding to Nabha state, the deposition of whose maharaja in July for mal\u00ac administration was strongly resented by the Sikhs; and he decided to go there to see for himself the Akalis in action.\nOn the night of the th September, Jawaharlal, with two companions, Gidwani and Santanam, left Delhi for Muktesar, an Akali centre, and after ad\u00ac dressing a meeting there on the th, commending the Akali struggle, he entered Nabha state on the morning of the st, along with a Sikhjatha, at Jaito. There he and his two friends sat down under a tree to watch proceedings and intended to return to Delhi by the evening train. Wilson Johnston, the British official who was serving as the administrator of the state, on hearing that Jawaharlal had set out for Nabha, had obtained the permission of the Viceroy and the Home Member to serve an order on Jawaharlal at the frontier of Nabha state forbidding him to enter the state for two months; but he had not anti\u00ac cipated that Jawaharlal would come by road on horseback. The result was that Jawaharlal was well within the state before the order was served on him not to enter Nabha on the ground that he and some of his companions were members of the AICC and their presence was likely to lead to a disturbance of the peace. Jawaharlal replied that he had already entered Nabha and could not vanish into thin air, but that he had no intention of leaving the state; and he and his two friends, on whom an oral order had been served, sat down in a rest-house near by. A prohibitory order incapable of enforcement was ipso facto invalid, and an oral order was of no worth at all; but clearly the Nabha Government, even though now headed by a British official, attached no importance to legality. Although the presence of Jawaharlal had led to no disturbance, he and his companions were arrested, handcuffed and chained together, and marched to the railway station. They were brought by the night train, in a crowded third-class compartment, to Nabhatown, and the chains and handcuffs were only removed twenty hours after, by noon the next day, after they were locked up in Nabha jail.\nThe conditions in this jail were, even by official admission, \u2018horrible\u2019; and Wilson Johnston reported that though the jail department left much to be desired any immediate improvement was out of the question as the Akali agita\u00ac tionwaskeeping their hands full. Theprisoners were prevented from seeing or communicating with persons outside, denied all books and papers, and for two days not even allowed to bathe or change. Their trial was held in camera by a\n Report of Jawaharlal\u2019s speech in The Tribune,  July . a Home Dept. Pol. , File I.K.W. aSee Home Dept. Pol.

Thelatterhad by now realized that, even in Nabha, Jawaharlal could not be convicted for entering the state before he had been prohibited from doing so, and decided to alter the charge to one of being in the company of an Akalijatha and therefore of being a member of an unlawful assembly. On the th fresh proceedings were casually started before another magistrate, and Jawaharlal and the others were charged with being members of the jatha and forcibly resisting dispersal. The straight thing to do\u2019, wrote Jawaharlal in his draft statement which waslater revised by his father and these sentences excis\u00ac ed, \u2019is to run me in for sedition and I shall gladly and joyfully admit the charge. But the ways of the Nabha administration are not straight. They are crooked.\u2019\nAs soon as Motilal heard of his son\u2019s arrest he left for Nabha and informed the Viceroy that his sole object was to see Jawaharlal. He had so far taken no part in the Akali agitation and expected that there would be no interference in the exercise of his \u2018natural right\u2019. The Administrator of Nabha gave orders forbidding Motilal\u2019s entry but was overruled by the Government of India, who ordered that Motilal should be permitted to enter Nabha provided he undertook not to engage in political activities in the state and to leave it immediately after his interview with his son. Even this was an indefensible attitude and demon\u00ac strates that Wilson Johnston was not wholly responsible for all the arbitrary actions of the Nabha administration. Motilal naturally refused to give any such undertakings and, on being ordered to leave the state, did so without meeting Jawaharlal. Wilson Johnston described Motilal\u2019s reaction as one of \u2018veiled insolence\u2019, but the Secretary of State, Lord Olivier, later remarked that this was what any self-respecting professional man in his position in any other civilized country would have done. In fact, the Governmentof India realized immediate\u00ac ly that they had overreached themselves, and modified the conditions; Motilal was now required not to engage in any political activity in Nabha and to leave immediately after the conclusion of the trial. This was still much to demand, but so intense was Motilal\u2019s anxiety, especially as he had heard of the unhealthy conditions in Nabhajail, that he agreed to abide by these restrictions and return ed to Nabha.\nOnthe th Motilal saw his son in jail. The interview, lasting over two hours, was not a success. The officials at Nabha flattered themselves that both father and son looked dejected because Motilal had concluded that Jawaharlal\u2019s action had put him legally in the wrong and there was little hope of his escaping convic\u00ac tion. In fact, the reasons for the unsatisfactory nature of the interview were\n> Administrator Nabhastateto Agent, Governor-General Punjab,  September .

Jawaharlal had shown his irritation at his father\u2019s intervention, and this had deeply upset Motilal. So Motilal left Nabha.\nI was pained to tind that instead of affording you any relief my visit of yesterday only had the effect of disturbing the even tenor of your happy jail life. After much anxious thinking I have come to the conclusion that I can do no good either to you or to myself by repeating my visits. I can stand with a clear conscience before God and man for what I have done so far after your arrest but as you think differently it is no use trying to make opposites meet.. . please do not bother about me at all. I am as happy outside the jail as you are in it... I do not wish you to have the impression that you have.offended me in the least. I believe honestly that the position has been forced upon us both by circumstances over which neither has any control.\nJawaharlal was now deeply sorry. * confess that the idea of causing you any pain is most distressful to me and I am haunted by the thought. It is a dearly cherished desire of mine to serve you and to lighten if possible the heavy bur* den you carry.\u2019 But he was quite reconciled to a term in Nabha jail. \u2018It will be a new experience and in this blase' world, it is something to have a new experience.\u2019 However, Motilal sent his son, through his secretary, a drasti\u00ac cally altered statement to be read by him in court. Jawaharlal had written an emotionally worded text, criticizing the Nabha administration and eulogizing the Akali movement. \"\nI rejoice that I am being tried for a cause which the Sikhs have made their own. I was in jail when the Guru-Ka-Bagh struggle was gallantly fought and won by the Sikhs. I marvelled at the courage and sacrifice of the Akalis and wished that I could be given an opportunity of showing my deep admiration of them by some form of service. That opportunity has now been given to me and I earnestly hope that I shall prove worthy of their high tradition and fair courage. Sat Sri Aka/.\nMotilal replaced these paragraphs with a closely argued statement written with the cold pen of a lawyer, and it was this which Jawaharlal read.\nMeantime, the case dragged on. The Government of India directed that sentence should be passed on Jawaharlal but it should be announced at the same time that the Nabha Government had suspended its execution without\n Motilal to Jawaharlal,  September .\nJawaharlal to Motilal from Nabha jail,  September .\nJawaharlal to Kapil Deva Malaviya and Mahadeva Desai, undated but clearly written from Nabha jail.\n Draft statement,  September .

This would meet the probable contingency of the convicted persons declining to accept any conditions; but if they returned to the state the suspension would be cancelled. This did not please Wilson Johnston, who wished Jawaharlal to serve his sentence, and argued that mere expulsion would severely shake the con\u00ac fidence of loyalists by establishing that there was one law for Akalis and another for Congressmen. But the Government of India believed that such discrimination would in itself be of advantage in that it would loosen the alliance between the Akalis and the Congress. So Jawaharlal and his two com\u00ac panions were each sentenced to  months\u2019 rigorous imprisonment; but these sentences were suspended and they were ordered to leave the state and not to return. They all left Nabha the same night.\nIt was not, however, disclosed that the sentences would be operative if they returned to Nabha; and Jawaharlal had no reason to believe that the suspen\u00ac sion was conditional. So he later challenged the statement of the Adminis\u00ac trator that if they had refused to leave they .would have had to undergo the sentence, and he added the hope that if it.was necessary in the interests of their cause to return to Nabha, he and his\u2019companions would do so. In fact, the next year, when Gidwani returned to Nabha he was thrown into prison, and Jawaharlal challenged the Administrator to let him have a copy of the suspen\u00ac sion order and to inform him as to whether he too would be arrested if he returned to Nabha. The Administrator replied that the sentence had only been suspended and not remitted, to which Jawaharlal retorted that the suspension had been unconditional.\nAs Jawaharlal recognized years later in his Autobiography, probably the bold step to have taken, especially as Gidwani had been imprisoned again, would have been for him to return to Nabha. 'As often with us all, discretion was preferred to valour.\u2019 On his return to Allahabad, where he received a hero\u2019s welcome, he had developed typhoid with high fever and confessed that he had not felt quite so feeble physically for a long time. Gandhi dissuaded him from returning to Nabha, and his father too made sure that he did not involve himself in Nabha affairs again. He would not even permit Jawaharlal to meet the Maharaja of Nabha. \u2019Having once burnt your fingers over Nabha\n\u2018Home Dept, to Administrator Nabha,  September ; Administrator Nabha to Agent to Gov.-Gen.,  September ; Home Dept, to Administrator Nabha,  September .

So the Government of India, who had encouraged the Administrator of Nabha to act arbitrarily, were not embar\u00ac rassed by any further challenge. Both the Secretary of State and Lord Curzon, who was by no means dominated by a commitment to the rule of law and spoke for the opposition in the House of Lords, felt that the situation had not been handled quite so well as it possibly might have been. But the Government were enabled to congratulate themselves on an easy if undeserved victory. \u2018There is no doubt that Nehru and his son were substantially defeated over the Nabha affair and they know this full well.'\n Motilal to Jawaharlal,  August . .

Escape into Administration\nFree again after a fortnight in jail, but now a sick man, Jawaharlal could do little more for a while than write speeches. In his presidential address to the U.P. provincial conference in October, which was read in his absence, he deplored the loss of the faith and confidence which had inspired the Congress in  and . \u2018We did not sit down to debate and argue, we knew we were right and we marched on from victory to victory. We felt the truth in us and every fibre of our being thrilled at the idea of our fighting for the right, and fighting in a manner unique and glorious.\u2019 But now pro-changer and no\u00ac changer \u2018went for each other, and the average no-changer was not behind the pro-changer in forgetting the basic lesson of non-violence and charity and in imputing the basest of motives to persons of a different way of thinking.\u2019 These two viewpoints being fundamentally different, there could be no real or stable compromise between them; and the result was that a noble movement had been converted into two caucuses, concerned only with securing support against each other.\nThe Congress session at Delhi, said Jawaharlal, had marked a retreat from direct action. But non-violent non-co-operation could not die, and it was the duty of those like him to fight on while the main army rested or was engaged in peaceful pursuits. Till the time came for launching another mighty cam\u00ac paign of civil disobedience, they should keep the practice and ideal of direct action and peaceful revolution before the people. He was still very much a Gandhian.\nI believe that the salvation of India, and indeed of the rest of the world, will come through non-violent non-cooperation. Violence has had a long enough career in the world, it has been weighed repeatedly and found wanting. The present condition of Europe is eloquent testimony of the inefficacy of violence to settle anything. I believe that violence in Europe will go from excess to excess arid will perish in the flames it has itself kindled and be reduced to ashes.\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nBolshevism and Fascism were the ways of the West; they were really alike and represented different phases of insensate violence and intolerance. 'The choice for us is between Lenin and Mussolini on the one side and Gandhi on the other. Can there be any doubt as to who represents the soul of India today?\u2019 Non-violence was not weakness but required courage; better theJhonest man of evil and violence than the non-violent coward. However, no circumstance could justify terrorism or secret violence, the dagger of the. assassin or the stab in the dark.\nBesides extolling non-violence Jawaharlal expounded in Gandhian terms the merits of non-co-operation.\nEvil flourishes only because we tolerate it and assist in it. The most des\u00ac potic and tyrannical government can only carry on because the people it misgoverns themselves submit to it. England holds India in bondage because Indians co-operate with Englishmen and thereby strengthen British rule. Withdraw that co-operation and the fabric of foreign rule collapses.\nPolitical freedom was bound to come before long, if not entirely through their strength then through the weakness of Europe and England. Europe was in the melting pot, and England, with all her seeming might, could not but be affected by the collapse of the continent. But by then, feared Jawaharlal, once again reflecting an unqualifiedly Gandhian viewpoint, India, instead of being a shining example to the rest of the world, might have become but a cheap and inefficient replica of the countries of the West. \u2018Let us take the longer view from now and try to avoid this, and build up a great and strong India worthy of the great leader whom God has blessed us with.\nTwo months later, at the Kakinada session of the Congress, he again emphasized, in Gandhian terms, that there was not really much in common between Indian volunteers and any Western counterparts, and an Indian volunteer organization must have non-violence as its basic principle. What India needed was non-violent, disciplined soldiers. \u2018We meet as soldiers of freedom and must be men of action rather than of words.\u2019 They should have little to do with the wordy warfare that was going on and devote themselves to training as many as possible for effective action; for without such training strength would be wasted and courage bear little fruit. But much as Jawaharlal desired action, he never doubted that such action should be controlled and encompassed by the Gandhian doctrine. Indeed, there was frequently a clear suggestion in his speeches that the sterile debate in the Congress had only been made possible by the absence of Gandhi in jail. To Jawaharlal non-violent non-co-operation was a positive programme, and its exponent above all a man of action.\nESCAPE INTO ADMINISTRATION \nJawaharlal himself, however, could at this stage engage in no thrilling action and had to consume his energies in a variety of administrative duties. * am developing into a kind of Pooh-Bah.\u2019 He was already president of the Allahabad town Congress committee and heavily involved in provincial Con\u00ac gress work, and at Kakinada the President. Maulana Mohamed Ali, insisted on Jawaharlal becoming one of the general secretaries of the Congress. This added considerably to Jawaharlal\u2019s work, he being the most active of'the three secretaries. He tried to introduce method and procedure into Congress admi\u00ac nistration, which had till then been rather ad hoc and haphazard. This meant that he had to give considerable attention to matters of detail. He also checked the office accounts carefully, demanded that everyone, from the President downwards, should submit detailed accounts, and issued regular statements on Congress finances. He kept in touch with committees abroad \u2014 in Britain, Japan and the United States - that sought affiliation to the Congress. He toured the province widely on a fund-collecting mission for the U.P. Congress which, in January , had only twenty rupees in the bank.\nBecause of the direct interest which Jawaharlal had shown in the Akali campaign and his excursion to Nabha, the Congress had appointed him one of the liaison officers to keep in touch with, the defiant Sikhs; and as general secretary it wgs his responsibility to implement the Congress resolution to render all possible assistance, including the dispatch of men and money. An Akali Sahayak (assistance) Bureau was set up at Amritsar, and though Jawaharlal was in no position to act on Rajagopalachari\u2019s suggestion that he should take charge of this office, he kept in close touch with Gidwani, who was appointed to this post, and, after Gidwani\u2019s arrest, with his successor, K.M. Panikkar. The Congress had little money to provide, and Jawaharlal thought that the best assistance it could render was to perfect its own organiza\u00ac tion and throw in its whole weight at the moment of crisis, and till then to give full publicity to Akali activities, keeping the political side of it and the side affecting other communities well in the forefront. Jawaharlal felt that the Congress could also help in rallying Hindus and Muslims behind the cam\u00ac paign, which should be regarded as part of the general movement for freedom. Shaukat Ali, for example, had pledged the full support of the Muslims. \u2018To the Akalis I will declare that the warfare they have engaged in is like the Khilafat question taken up by the Muslims and the Swaraj problem by the Hindus ...

Clearly their hope now was to secure concessions from the Government, as in fact they did in . Nor were Jawaharlal\u2019s efforts to improve relations between the Hindus and the Sikhs acceptable even to the Hindus of Amritsar because on his visit to that place he had stayed in a hotel where the cooks were Muslims.\nAll these activities kept Jawaharlal busy, and enabled him to ignore the malaise afflicting Congress. He had even hoped to return to jail, even though on a false issue, for at one time it seemed probable that the Government would arrest him for defying, along with Pandit Malaviya, the injunction against bathing in the Sangam at Allahabad during the Kumbh Mela festival in January. That year the Ganga had somewhat changed its course, and the current was so strong near the Sangam that bathing without proper precau\u00ac tions became dangerous. So, with financial assistance from Government, volunteers prepared a suitable bathing place, but the district authorities refused all access to the Sangam. \u2018The question of danger receded into the background and the whole issue became one of prestige. Danger can be dis\u00ac cussed and overcome, prestige cannot.' So Malaviya, Jawaharlal and a few others courted imprisonment by jumping over the barrier and bathing in the Sangam. But the Government refrained from action. \u2018There appears to be little chance of my arrest for the Kumbh Mela affray. Worse luck!-'\nHowever, he was soon glad to be unconfined, for on  February  Gandhi was released on grounds of health. After seeing Gandhi at Poona, Jawaharlal spent a few weeks at Juhu, where Gandhi was having talks with the Swarajist leaders Motilal and Das. In the elections in November  they had achieved a considerable triumph, and they now sought Gandhi\u2019s approval of their policy. This they could not secure, and it looked as if the Congress would break under the strain. Everything, wrote Gandhi to Jawaharlal, was in the melting pot- including himself; and Jawaharlal felt it might become necessary for him to resign the secretaryship. \u2018Surely you can imagine a situation when it may be impossible for me as well as others to con\u00ac tinue in office. When everything is in the melting pot, as you put it, why should I be impervious to heat or refuse to melt?\u2019\nAt the meeting of the AICC in Ahmadabad in June , Gandhi moved a resolution requiring all Congressmen to spin. This was challenged by Motilal and Das, and the resolution was finally carried with the omission of the clause depriving of Congress offices those failing to spin sufficient yarn.

In fact, it waa Gandhi\nwho had said it. **\nESCAPE INTO ADMINISTRATION \nregarded himself as defeated and humbled, and, recognizing the support which the Swarajists enjoyed in the party and the country, decided to leave the field to them. The British Government, however, spurned their offers of co\u00ac operation. Motilal had expected that the first Labour Government would invite him and Das to London, and Das, it is said, made a generous donation to Labour Party funds. Motilal s hopes were disappointed; but then Das ex\u00ac pected much from Birkenhead. This too fizzled out. The policy, wrote Birken\u00ac head confidentially to Reading, that he would recommend to the Cabinet over the next four years would be politically one of negation. So the Swaraj party lost all purpose and could achieve little. Deprived in June  of the leadership of Das, they were further weakened by the hankering for office shown by an increasing number of their members.\nMeantime, the growing tension between Hindus and Muslims seized Gandhi's attention. The Muslims, who, according to the  census, formed nearly a quarter of India\u2019s population had, before the advent of the British, lived in social harmony with the other communities. This is not surprising, for most Muslims in India were converts from Hinduism and had much in common with their Hindu neighbours. Under the East India Company, how\u00ac ever, regional imbalance in economic and social development led to the classes who gained most from British rule being predominantly Hindu; and by the time the interior areas of India caught up with westernization, national con\u00ac sciousness, particularly in Bombay but also in Bengal, increasingly spoke in a Hindu idiom. The British were not slow to take political advantage of this. Gandhi, in his search for mass support, also expressed himself in Hindu terms and, rather than strengthen the national identity, drew up a programme which took for granted the divergence between the two communities but was accept\u00ac able to both. So the official policy symbolized by separate electorates, or con\u00ac stituencies where the essential qualification for candidates and voters was a particular religion, and the response of the Congress with such activities as the Khilafat campaign combined with the lag in development between the two communities, the decline of the Muslim upper class and the failure to offset this (as in the caseof the Hindus) by the rise of new classes, to strengthen the religious element in Indian politics. This was reflected in communal rioting. During the years  to  there were sixteen such riots; for the three years from  to  the number was seventy-two.\nIn September , to check the growing communal rancour, Gandhi began a fast for twenty-one days. He termed it both a penance and a prayer; but its objectiveon this occasion was to blackmail the conscience of his country\u00ac men. When Jawaharlal, who had been visiting the riot-stricken area of Sambhal, received \u2018the shattering news whose consequences are terrible to contemplate', hecalleduponeach townand village in the United Provinces to hold immediately\n\u2018Motilal to Das,  July , Motilal Nehru papers.\n January , Reading papers, vol. .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nits conference of leaders of all communities and parties to find means of unity. \u2018Leaders of all communities are meeting at Delhi on the rd and, God willing, will find a way out of the impasse. But time passes and daily the danger increases.\u2019\nA day after commencing the fast, Gandhi had written to Jawaharlal:\nMy dear Jawarlal [sic\\ You must not be stunned. Rather rejoice that God gives strength and direction to do my duty. I could not do otherwise.\nAs the author of non-co-operation, a heavy responsibility lies on my shoulders. Do give me in writing your impressions of Lucknow and Cawnpore. Let me drink the cup to the full. I am quite at peace with myself.\nJawaharlal, on his return from the Unity Conference which had passed a series of platitudinous resolutions but could not persuade Gandhi to terminate his fast earlier than scheduled, himself went down with fever; but he sent Gandhi long reports on the disturbances in Allahabad itself. Speaking with this first-hand knowledge of communal animosity, he told the U.P. Political Conference that whatever pride he had had in the national strength and awakening had been shattered, and he was now not only humiliated but ashamed. They themselves had done more harm to their countiy than any foreigner. An All-Parties Conference, meeting in January , proved a failure, and Jawaharlal found its discussions painful to listen to. All that there was to do, therefore, seemed to be the preaching of unity and of non\u00ac violence, spinning and the wearing of khaddar. When a young man came to him in search of national work, the only possible activity Jawaharlal could think of was khaddar work.\nIt is surprising that Jawaharlal did not think of utilizing the services of such young men for promoting communal harmony. Gandhi had suggested the formation of a flying column of Hindu and Muslim workers who would at a moment\u2019s notice be ready to go to riot areas for investigation and relief. But Jawaharlal seems to have been too dispirited to act on this suggestion. This communal problem was such a wasteful diversion from the main cam\u00ac paign against the British, and it revolved round what seemed to him such unreal issues that he could not bring himself to take energetic measures to deal,with it. In his own city of Allahabad, there was a revival of-aggressiveness of Hindu communalists, inspired, according to the local magistrate, largely\n Letter to the Editor, The Leader,  September .\n September .

In November  his wife lost a child after premature birth and soon after began to show signs of tuberculosis. Then, in March , he himself had to undergo a minor operation, performed by Dr Ansari at Delhi. The deep commitment to Gandhi and known dislike of Swarajist policy had caused friction in his relations with his father, and Gandhi had sought to intervene.\nThis letter like the former is meant to be a plea for Jawaharlal. He is one of the loneliest young men of my acquaintance in India. The idea of your mental desertion of him jhurts me. Physical desertion I hold to be impossible. Needless to say Manzar Ali and I often talked of the Nehrus whilst we were together at Yeravda. He said once that if there was one thing for which you lived more than any other, it was for Jawahar. His remark seemed to be so true. I don\u2019t want to be the cause direct or indirect of the slightest breach in that wonderful affection.\nThese differences with Motilal made Jawaharlal acutely conscious of his dependence on his father for money.'Gandhi had offered to arrange for some re\u00ac munerative work, either as a press correspondent or as a college professor, * but nothing had come of this. Gandhi later suggested that Jawaharlal be paid as general secretary by the Gongress or that personal friends be permitted to find funds for retaining his services. \u2018I will not mind even if you decided to do some business. I want your mental peace. I know that you will serve the country even as manager of a business.\u2019 The Bombay firm of Tata\u2019s offered to employ him, and Motilal strongly recommended to his son that he proceed to Bombay and call on Tata. But this again did not materialize, probably because Jawaharlal showed no keenness to serve in a commercial firm. Finally, to earn the money required to pay for the trip to Europe which he and Kamala were planning, he had to return to the distasteful practice erf law; and for preparing a brief Motilal secured for him the large fee of Rs , \u2014 an amount which the client doubtless paid to ensure that Motilal would handle the case.\nHowever, there was one sphere of activity which in these years provided\ni Report on the political situation in the U.P. for the first half of September .

Motilal to Jawaharlal,  November .\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nJawaharla with some satisfaction. For two years, from April  to April , he was chairman of the Allahabad Municipal Board; and this phase in his life is of interest as marking'his first experience of official administration. It is also of some significance, because many of the traits which marked his prime ministership can be discerned here in embryo \u2014 his domination of his colleagues, his desire for efficiency, his loyalty to his competent subordinates, his efforts topush forward in all directions with new ideas. Even officials had to recognize that he had brought a fresh impetus to municipal administration and that his management of Allahabad affairs was marked by both constructiveness and competence.\nIn  the United Provinces Congress committee decided to contest the municipal elections on the Congress and Khilafat programme, and to enter these local bodies not to obstruct but to direct their affairs honestly and efficiently. Jawaharlal was, much against his will, persuaded to stand as one of the Congress candidates from Allahabad, and as the Congress had a majo\u00ac rity, soon found himself elected chairman for three years. It had earlier been thought that Purushottam Das Tandon would be chairman, but he decided to stand down in favour of a Muslim Congressman, as some loyalist Muslims had objected to a Hindu chairman. However, when it became clear that the loyalist Muslims wished to have not so much a Muslim as a loyalist, and as the Muslim Congressman was unwell, Jawaharlal\u2019s name was suddenly put forward and he was elected by  votes as against  secured by the candidate sponsored by the officials.\nJawaharlal was a most unwilling chairman. To him the primary task was the fight for swaraj, and he decided to continue as secretary of the provincial Congress committee, a post which he regarded as more important than the chairmanship of the municipal board and which, he declared, he was prouder to hold.\nThe day I am satisfied that the municipal chairmanship is injuring my Congress work that day I shall submit my resignation of the chairmanship.\nFor the chairmanship is to me only the means for serving the nation for hastening swaraj. The best method is to go straight ahead on the lines chalked out by our leaders and not to wander in the shady alleys and lanes of constitutional activity. My mentality is revolutionary. I believe in revolution and in direct action and in battle. I know that many times weshall have to advance and engage the enemy and offer the inevita\u00ac ble price of freedom before we finally carry the citadel ... I do not forget the history and agony of Indiaduring the last few years and I am not going to spend most of my time in any office while my beloved leader lies in jail. I shall give battle whenever I can. I shall fight and hit hard whenever\n See account in The Leader,  April , and Jawaharlal's letter in the same issue.\nESCAPE INTO ADMINISTRATION\nImay. That is my main function till swaraj is attained. All else is training\nand preparation.\nInvited by the Collector of Allahabad to come and discuss the possibility of keeping general politics outside the municipal sphere, he replied that he would try to carry out the policies of the Congress, and would resign if he disagreed with the Board on any matter of principle or if the Congress com\u00ac mittee so desired it. \u2018I regret that I cannot split myself up into various com\u00ac partments \u2014 one for \u201cgeneral politics\u201d, another for \u201cmunicipal affairs\u201d, and so on.\u2019 Repeatedly during the next two years, till his resignation was finally accepted by the Government, Jawaharlal offered to relinquish office, and he never allowed it to hamper his activities in the wider world and even courted arrest as at Nabha.\nHowever, though JawaharM\u2019s priorities never wavered, his distaste for municipal affairs gradually weakened, and he found himself enjoying the work. \u2018What I feared and disliked I have begun to like, and municipal work has begun to have some fascination for me. I feel that it is in the power of our board to make life a little more bearable, a little less painful to the inhabitants of Allahabad.' And he always retained this interest in his home town, con\u00ac tinued to keep an eye on its development and, even when engrossed in later years in national work, could find time to protest against vulgar posters or noisy brass bands.\nOnce he had assumed this responsibility of the chairmanship, Jawaharlal worked hard. Himself regular in attendance, whenever he was in Allahabad, at meetings which were held at least twice a week, he deplored the tendency of the members to look to their own convenience and urged them to sacrifice their own professional work, if need be, for the sake of the municipality. Indeed, he almost coerced his colleagues to work as hard as he did, and rather than adjourn meetings for lack of a quorum, he directed members to wait so that they were driven to send for their truant colleagues. Soon after taking over as Chairman, he issued a public statement rebuking some members for idleness; this had its effect, so that later he could agree to refrain from such public criticism. Chairmen and members of standing committees were told that, in addition to their routine work, they should inspect their departments periodically and introduce efficiency. Public grievances should be removed and,\n\u2018Circular letter of Jawaharlal as secretary, prov. cong. committee to all district, town and ttbsil Congress committees and members of prov.

It will perhaps be better for any member who finds it difficult to give enough time to his committee work to resign and make room for another who can give the necessary time.\u2019 He also forbade member* to exercise patronage in appointments or to secure municipal contracts or any other favours from the Board. But he soon won the confidence of all groups on the Board and was able to direct the proceedings on the lines he desired. It was the nominated Anglo-Indian member who, but two months after voting against Jawaharlal, sought an assurance from him that there was no truth in the rumour of his resignation; and in  the Board unanimously re\u00ac quested the Government not to accept Jawaharlal\u2019s resignation and, if this were not feasible, to permit the Board to re-elect him.\nThe secret of JawaharlaTs influence was his manifest integrity. On one occasion, one of the vice-chairmen, Zahur Ahmed, offered his resignation orally but retracted it after its acceptance by Jawaharlal. Realizing that he had erred in acting on an oral resignation, Jawaharlal requested the Board to censure him. \u2018I think that the Board would be justified in expressing its dis\u00ac pleasure of this action and I can assure the Board that I will appreciate this. I believe in discipline and no one should be above it. The Board declined and stood by Jawaharlal\u2019s action, but was persuaded by him to cancel its vote of confidence and permit Zahur Ahmed to continue in office. While he did not conceal his views on major issues, he never permitted the Congress majority to push matters to extremes, and in minor matters he voted, as was expected from a chairman, against any change. He turned down the request of the municipal employees that they be allowed to suspend work on Jallian- wala Bagh day, for he knew that they were only interested in a holiday. He secured the rejection of the proposal of a member belonging to the Congress party that the Board dispense with chairs and conduct proceedings while sitting on the floor, by pointing out that this had nothing to do with swadeshi. He encouraged the wearing of khaddar by municipality employees and the use of Hindi or Urdu in official transactions but rejected suggestions that these be made obligatory. He supported the passing of a resolution deploring the treatment of Indians in the United States and the British colonies, but rejected as impractical suggestions for retaliation such as doubling municipal taxes on Englishmen and Americans or debarring them from buying land.\n'Chairman's circular,  April , Allahabad Municipality File .

He had no illusions about dvil servants. \u2018Permanent officials who are not under popular control, as we know to our cost, are a danger against which we must guard. They are too wooden, and utterly out of touch with the people, and have no sense of propor\u00ac tion or vision. They always tend to make a close corporation of themselves, indulge in mutual praise and are wholly intolerant of people Who differ from them.\u2019 But he was willing, in the conduct of municipal affairs, to co-operate with Government servants so long as the public interests and the principles of the Congress were not jeopardized. As he told the Collector, he and his fellow Congressmen had not sought election purely for discovering oppor\u00ac tunities of friction, with the Government. \u2018Mr. Knox and I agreed that it was hardly possible for us to convince each other of the correctness of the other\u2019s viewpoint on wider issues. That difference must be faced, but in the routine work of the Board this will hardly trouble anyone.\u2019 He instructed the heads of departments to get rid of incompetent subordinates with all speed and without mercy. Within a week of taking charge of his office, he suspended a dispatcher and a messenger for delay in delivering a letter. 'I shall be obliged if you will make it clear to every member of the staff that if there is one thing which will not be tolerated it is incompetence and slackness and any instance of this will be severely dealt with ... no kind of effective work is possible unless our office is run on business lines.\u2019 Informed that the engineering staff was efficient in its work but slack in sending reports, he recorded, \u2018I am afraid the staff will have to get over this aversion to pen and paper. Any slack\u00ac ness of this kind is most objectionable and is own brother to incompetence. It is impossible for a person who is slack to be efficient and I desire no slack ness in the municipal employ.\u2019 Delay, he informed the Board, might be excused but it was seldom justifiable; and he expected prompt resuite. \u2018Success and failure will be the teste applied. In case of the latter excuses will not find favour with the board, and immediate and drastic action will be taken. Only such officers will be-employed who are prepared for this responsibility.\u2019\u2019 But those officials who worked well received the chairman\u2019s full support even in face of public criticism and satyagrabtr, and no bureaucrat could have\n\u2018Note of  July , Allahabad Municipality File .\nJSpeech at Ballia,  April, reported in Tbs Lsadsr,  April .\n Note on interview with Collector,  April , Allahabad Municipality File .\n Jawaharlal\u2019s note on municipal work, April-May , dated  June .

What does it think will be the effect of the Committee siding with some employees of the Board as against a high officer ... It is difficult for officers to carry on their work properly if they are censured and condemned in this manner for trivial details.\u2019 \u2022\nMost important of all, Jawaharlal was clearly above sectarian prejudices. His guidance enabled the Board unanimously to reject the suggestion to prohibit the slaughter of cattle; and the next week he reminded the members that while Christian missionaries had originally certainly come to India to convert Indians, at the same time their object was also to benefit India as far as possible.\nSuch moderation and impartiality gave Jawaharlal a commanding influence. He first turned his attention to formulating a scheme for widening the muni\u00ac cipal franchise and ensuring fair elections. He desired the abolition of plural constituencies and the replacement of communal by proportional representa\u00ac tion. He also suggested, to avoid impersonation, smaller constituencies and personal registration of voters. But electoral reform was beyond the purview of the Municipal Board. Jawaharlal had to content himself with introducing, whenever possible, the spirit of nationalism in municipal .administration and implementing the constructive, nation-building programme of the Congress. The singing of Iqbal\u2019s Hindustan Honiara (Our Hindustan) was made a part of the school curriculum. Tilak Day ( August), the anniversary of the death of Tilak, and Gandhi Day ( March), the anniversary of the day when Gandhi was sentenced to jail, were added to the list of public holidays, while Empire Day was omitted. The release of Gandhi in February  was celebrated by the illumination of municipal buildings. Civic addresses were presented to the Congress leaders Das, Ajmal Khan and Shaukat Ali. The United Provinces Government sought to prevent such defiance by directing that civic addresses should be presented only to the Viceroy and the Governor of the province, but Jawaharlal secured the unanimous rejection by the Board of this directive, which he termed \u2018an insult and impertinence\u2019. In other words, even the nomi\u00ac nated and non-Congress members supported his assertion of the Board's inde\u00ac pendence on such matters? Jawaharlal made it clear to his colleagues that they should be prepared for the consequences of their disobedience; but in fact it was the Provincial Government which had to withdraw from their position.\nThis was soon followed by the Board\u2019s decision to ignore a viceregal visit to Allahabad. Jawaharlal was ill at the time of Reading\u2019s arrival, but he cir\u00ac culated a note to the members of the Board emphatically objecting to the\n\u2018Note,  April , Allahabad Municipality File .\nProceedings,  June , reported in The Leader,  July -\n\u2019Proceedings,  July , reported in The Leader,  July .\nNote, .

I wish no personal discourtesy to Lord Readipg. But we are human beings with eyes to see and, sometimes, to weep and ears to hear and hearts to feel \u2014 and feel the more because our arms are weak and there is no strength in us to stand upright and protect our own . . . Lord Reading, secure in his strength and proud of his might, has flung this challenge to the Sikhs and the Indian people and he would have us applaud him for it and thus complete our degradation. I am weak and powerless but I too have a little pride \u2014 the pride of the weak, perhaps,, it may be, but I would sooner be trampled by Lord Reading\u2019s soldiery than bow down to welcome a person who was responsible for so much sorrow to my country and countrymen.\nJawaharlal also secured the introduction of spinning and weaving in schools, and rejected the objection of the Commissioner of Allahabad Division to what seemed to the latter to be a Congress measure.\nWe have laid great stress on spinning in our schools because we believe in its economic value. I have little doubt that if you considered the ques\u00ac tion on its merits and without the prejudices born of political opinions you will appreciate the attempts to revive spinning and put it on a firm basis. If you will take the trouble to learn spinning yourself you will after a few days feel its charm and delight in the music of the wheel. Spinning is not a party matter confined to a particular group. * *\nMost of the teachers and the boys and girls dressed in khaddar.\nJawaharlal was eager to improve the quality of instruction imparted in the municipal schools, to raise the salaries of teachers, to make education compul\u00ac sory and to train children to be good citizens who neither cringed nor boasted.\n\u2018I have felt that the physical and mental development of the young should be the special care of the state and the municipality and in this respect we might well take a leaf out of the book of Soviet Russia.\u2019 Scouting was introduced for boys and a day\u2019s outing was arranged every month for all children for nature study. But as Government declined to give further grants for education which was directed to encouraging the \u2019new spirit\u2019, it could only be given low priority by the Board, after the maintenance of the basic municipal services \u2014 sanitation, water supply and the upkeep of roads. The staff of sanitary inspectors was in-\nTbe Bombay Chronicle,  October . . Tbe Tribune,  August . *A note on municipal work during December  and January and February ,' Allahabad Municipal Gazette,  April .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\ncreased, and better arrangements made for the disposal of refuse. As the water\u00ac works plant was worn out, there could be no marked improvement in water supply; but even so, many new water connections were provided. As for roads, Jawaharlal observed that although more was being spent on roads than ever before, many roads in the city had so deteriorated that soon it would be impos\u00ac sible for vehicles to use them. \u2018In some places it is difficult to get any medical advice as no vehicle can safely go there and doctors refuse to walk the distance especially when this will involve wallowing in the mud.' Jawaharlal thought the reason for thiswas that a great part of the municipal funds allotted for roads was being utilized to improve and beautify the Civil Station where Europeans and the richer dass of Indians lived. This led him to suggest a tax on large com\u00ac pounds, which were to be found mostly in the Civil Station, for he thought that this area should be more built up and the compounds become smaller and better looked after. The income of the Board would also be raised and the general appearanceof Allahabad would improve. He also wished to tax open sites whose owners, interested in land speculation, had failed to build on. There should be a tax both on land value and on improvements and houses, but in such a way that the latter were encouraged. But nothing came of these suggestions. Nor, because of the recalcitrant attitude of the Allahabad Town Improvement Trust, dominated by civil servants and loyalists, was he able to implement any of his ideas on town planning.\nHowever, Jawaharlal could show more substantial results in the matter of improvement of municipal finances. He was convinced that the rates would have to be increased, but in such a way as to limit the increase\u2019s incidence to the rich. Unwilling to raise money at the expense of the poorer classes, he rejected the suggestion of an octroi duty on cycles and exempted houses with a low rental value from payment of water rates. He also terminated the practice whereby octroi was levied on foreign goods at the \u2018invoice* rate, while Indian goods were charged at the market rate which often was higher, with the suit that Indian goods paid more. It was laid down that the market rate should be the wholesale and not the retail rate, although this meant a loss in income. Jawaharlal urged that a heavier rate be charged on foreign goods so as to en\u00ac courage Indian manufacturers, but the Board resolved on a complete boycott of British goods unless they were not manufactured elsewhere in the world or were not available in India.\n'Proceedings of Board meeting,  May , The Leader,  June .\nJawaharlal's note on municipal work, June-August, , AllahabadMunicipal Gazette Extra\u00ac ordinary, $ September .\n Note on municipal work, December -February , Allahabad Municipal Gazette,\nI April ; Jawaharlal's note on taxation,  August , The Leader,  September .\n* The Leader,  July .\n\u2019Annual Administration Report of the Allahabad Municipaf Board,  May . \u2022Jawaharlal\u2019s notes on municipal work, June-August  and September-November , Allahabad Municipal Gazettes Extraordinary,  September  and  December , respectively.\n\u2019Proceedings of the meeting,  October , reported in The Loader,  October .\nESCAPE INTO ADMINISTRATION\n\nYet, despite these decisions, the Municipal Board under Jawaharlal\u2019s guild ance, by more efficient collection of taxes, increased levy on railways passing through the city, and the imposition of a new cax on passengers, improved its financial position, paid back, for the first time foryears, a part of the loan receiv\u00ac ed from the Government, and set self-sufficiency as its objective.\nJawaharlal\u2019s work attracted wide public attention because, apart from his general standing, he issued a fortnightly municipal gazette reporting the pro\u00ac ceedings of the Board and its committees and, in addition to the annual report, gave a detailed account of municipal activities once every three months. There were also Hindi and Urdu editions of the gazette. For the first time, too, the average citizen of Allahabad felt that he had a municipal chairman who was accessible and concerned with his welfare. The ekkawalas (drivers of horse carriages), for example, approached him with their grievances and on investi\u00ac gation Jawaharlal was astounded to find that in three months about , pro\u00ac secutions had been initiated against them by the police. This was not the direct concern of the Municipal Board, but it convinced Jawaharlal that something was very wrong somewhere, and he induced the Board to do what it could to make the life of the ekkawalas more tolerable.\nJawaharlal had also, from the start, kept in close touch and exchanged ideas with the ten other Congress chairmen of municipal boards in the United Pro\u00ac vinces, and he was elected Chairman of the United Provinces Municipal Con\u00ac ference that met at Aligarh in December . 'his provincial conference accepted Jawaharlal\u2019s proposals that training as scouts should be made part of physical education in schools, adult franchise introduced for municipal elec\u00ac tions and the autonomy of municipal boards protected. These recommenda\u00ac tions were in line with his view that municipalities could become minor arenas for national education and for constructive national and political work. He also, however, knew that the real arena for national advance lay elsewhere. In Feb\u00ac ruary  he was dissuaded by Gandhi from resigning the chairmanship; but at the Congress session in December presided over by Gandhi he opposed a resolution advocating the capture by Congressmen, whenever possible, of local boards and municipalities. His own experience, he said, had convinced him that Congressmen in these boards were so restricted that the effort was futile; andon his return from the Belgaum Congress he resigned both his chair\u00ac manship and membership of the Board, ostensibly on the ground that he had little time to devote to municipal work. Three years later, in , he allowed himself to be dragged again into municipal politics and even, despite Gandhi\u2019s advice, permitted his name to be put forward for the chairmanship; but on this occasion he was, surprisingly, defeated by one vote by the loyalist candidate.\n\u2019Jawaharlal's note on municipal work, June-August , op. cit.\nSee Allahabad Municipality File .\n*Mahadeva Desai, Day to Day with Gandhi (Banaras, ), vol. , p. . \u2022\n\u2018My conviction is that you cannot combine all India work with solid municipal work.'

For a man who believed that a municipality should not confine itself to such matters as housing and sanitation but should regard social welfare in its widest sense as its primary concern, the disappointment could not be glossed over. But it was astonishing how much he had succeeded in achiev\u00ac ing, despite the inherent limitations of the post and the demands of his wider interests. Even the Commissioner was compelled to record reluctantly his impression that \u2018the improvement in the administration was largely due to the chairman, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and a few public spirited members of the Board.\u2019 The comment of the U.P. Government at the time of Jawaharlal\u2019s relinquishment of the chairmanship is also worth mention. \u2018Pandit Kapildeo Malaviya\u2019, they wrote in April , \u2018was elected chairman of the Allahabad Municipal Board by (a majority of) two votes, in succession to Jawaharlal Nehru, who strove to show that a swarajist could be an administrator and a gentleman, and the Commissioner thinks that the newcomer\u2019s position will be very difficult.\u2019\n The Tribune,  August .

    "1927-1931": " Europe -\nOn  March  Jawaharlal sailed with his wife and child for Europe, The trip was undertaken primarily in the causeof his wife\u2019s health. It was hoped that a long stay in Switzerland would help her to shake off the tuberculosis that was still in an incipient stage, while her husband would spend his time in study and travel. But these two years, while they did Kamala little good, were to have a profound effect on Jawaharlal\u2019s mental development. Till now he had been one of the ordinary run of conforming nationalists, an unquestioning follower of the Mahatma. The Government of the United Provinces, reporting their deci\u00ac sion to give him a passport, summed up his position: \u2018He is a devoted follower of Gandhi, is much respected and carries great influence with his party.\u2019 An over-enthusiastic district magistrate had suggested to Jawaharlal that he should facilitate the issue of a passport by giving an assurance that he was not visiting Europe for political purposes; but neither at Lucknow nor at Simla did Jawahar- lal\u2019s refusal to give any such assurance cause any hesitation in permitting him to leave. He was not regarded as particularly dangerous, and it seemed worth while to keep his father in good humour. But it was this spell in Europe, and not the earlier years at Harrow and Cambridge, that was to provide Jawaharlal with his real political education; and here again it was Gandhi who was the most perceptive. \u2018I expect', he wrote to Motilal on the eve of the family\u2019s depar\u00ac ture, \u2018great results from this trip, not only for Kamla [sic] but also for Jawaharlal.\u2019\nIn leaving India, Jawaharlal felt somewhat of a deserter.\nI amcertainly looking forward to the visit to Europe but I am full of appre\u00ac hension. It is quite likely that when I get there I shall be looking backward to India! It is good to have a change and a holiday but this should rest on the solid foundation of something accomplished.

Indiaissolikeawoman \u2014 sheattractsandrepels.\nItwas the sense of relief, however, which grew as the months passed. Indian politics at this time were in a low and grim condition. The Congress was riven with dissension, and even within the Swaraj Party Motilal was fighting a losing battle against opportunism. Communal tension was rising, and many old Con\u00ac gressmen were reacting to events more as Hindus and Muslims than as natio\u00ac nalists. Gandhi had not lost heart, but even he was reconciled to the situation getting much worse before it began to improve. \u2018I must confess\u2019, wrote Jawahar- lal to his father later in the year, \u2018to a feeling of satisfaction at not being in India just at present.-Indeed the whole future outlook is so gloomy that, from the political viewpoint, a return to India is far from agreeable.\u2019 Settled in Geneva in cheap lodgings, his principal occupations now, besides nursing his wife and escorting his daughter to school and back, were learning French, reading widely and attending various courses and lectures.\nThe older I grow the more I feel that there is so much to be learnt and studied and so little time to do it in. Most of us after a very perfunctory education imagine that we have learnt as much as is necessary and do not even attempt to increase our knowledge. This is sad for progress can only come with knowledge and the few years that we spend at school and college teach us precious little.\nt\nBertrand Russell\u2019s books, particularly On Education and What  Believe, made a deep impact.\nI think what is required in India most is a course of study of Bertrand Russell\u2019s books, or at any rate some of them. No country or people who are slaves to dogma and the dogmatic mentality can progress, and un\u00ac happily our country and people have become extraordinarily dogmatic and little-minded. Generosity of heart is a good thing but what is wanted is not an emotional outburst of generosity but coldly reasoned tolerance.\nLike Gandhi he was a long-term, far-seeing optimist about India: 'The outlook in India is dark enough but somehow I do not feel as pessimistic as the news would warrant.

This was, of course, too easy and hopeful a solu\u00ac tion, based on asomewhat simplistic understanding of European developments. But Jawaharlal was still* optimist enough to believe that religious differences in India would be automatically dissolved by economic advance, and therefore gave no serious thought to it.\nBy the end of the year it was dear that Kamala had benefited little from the treatment of Spahlinger\u2019s vaccine injections; so Jawaharlal dedded to shift her from Geneva to Dr Stephani\u2019s dinic in the more bracing climate of Montana (Valais). The move to the mountains enabled Jawaharlal to take lessons in ski\u00ac ing and ice-skating; but he was beginning to feel restive, for the wider world and for India. Hecould not as yet return to India; his wife was still far from wdl and Motilal was planning a trip to the West. So the family started their wander\u00ac ings round Europe. There were visits to the museums of London, Paris, Berlin and Heiddberg, tours of factories and interviews with Indian exiles and revolu\u00ac tionaries. Jawaharlal was at Paris airport, with his daughter perched on his shoulder, waiting for Lindbergh to complete his lone journey across the Atlantic \u2014 an achievement which greatly impressed him for its human daring and resolution. Always keen on flying* and having himself done two short hops at this time from Londbn, once to Paris and once to Ostend, Jawaharlal urged his countrymen to become more air-minded.\nHowever, the real significance of these travels was that Jawaharlal now came into contact with European political workers and movements, and these gave a new depth to his thinking and activities. The discursive reading under\u00ac taken in Switzerland had ploughed up his mind; it was ready for new seeds but had not yet received them. A letter published in the Journal de Geneve was staunchly nationalist in tone and expounded the standard arguments about the traditional unity of India and the impoverishments and divisions brought about by British rule; but there was no glimmer of any fresh effort at inter-, pretation. In an article published in India, he advocated complete independence\n> Idem,  August , S.W\u201e vol. , p. .\naMem,  May, IS July and  August  and  July , S.W., vol. , pp. *,* and -.\n\u2019Mrs Gandhi\u2019s broadcast reported in the Hindustan Timas,  July .\nLetter to his father,  November , and *Victory over the Air', article in Aaf,  September , S.W., vol. , pp. - and -, respectively. #\n* August , S.W., vol. , pp. -.\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nin the sense of full freedom in both external and internal affairs and favoured the formation of an extremist pressure-group within the Congress to counter the activities of those who tried to hold the organization back. This received wide publicity and, as Motilal complained, was generally interpreted as a criti\u00ac cism of the Swaraj Party and of its leadership: \u2018it is the most famous document in India at the present moment and is being used for a variety of purposes not even dreamt of by you.\u2019 Jawaharlal was irritated equally by the Liberals, the Swarajists, and the no-changers, all of whom seemed to have more or less the same moderate mentality.\nThe mention of Independence frightens them and every effort is made to dissociate oneself from the idea or from its implications. The Indian States and foreign policy are taboo and not to be discussed; the army and problems of defence are beyond us, and so we spend all our energy in protesting, with varying degrees of emphasis, against internments and imprisonments and regulations etc. I am afraid this very tame and consti\u00ac tutional and legal and proper and reasonable activity raises no enthusiasm in me.\nBut while there was commitment and impatience, there was no fresh line of analysis.\nThe turning-point in Jawaharlal\u2019s mental development was the invitation to help in organizing \u2014 and to participate as the representative of the Indian National Congress in \u2014 the International Congress against Colonial Oppres\u00ac sion and Imperialism to be held at Brussels in February . The chief organizer of the conference was Willi Muenzenberg, who \u2018really invented the fellow-traveller\u2019. The Soviet Union kept severely aloof and no one from that country attended the conference, though, as Jawaharlal realized even at the time, the objectives of the conference were wholly in accordance with Soviet foreign policy and were intended to bring together the forces of anti\u00ac colonialism and organized labour as against imperialism, especially British imperialism. This did not frighten Jawaharlal and he suggested that a large delegation, including an economist and an expert on military matters, be sent from India by the Congress, but in fact he was the only delegate.\nClearly, at such a conference where the prime target was British imperia\u00ac lism, the official representative of the Indian Congress would be an important\n'Article in Pratap, December .\n  January .\n\u2019To A.

He arrived at Brussels on  February, took part in all the informal meetings, presided overoneof the formal sessions and played a leading role in the drafting of many of the resolutions. \u2018I am dead tired\u2019, he wrote from Brussels on the th, \u2018after  or  days of the Congress here. I have not had a good night\u2019s sleep and hardly a decent meal since I came here.\u2019 It was a strange medley of delegates \u2014 European Communists, trade unionists and pacifists, nationalists from Asia, Africa and Latin America, and secret service agents \u2014 with many delegates doubling the roles. However, Jawaharlal could not but be influenced by some of the men and women he met here \u2014 Henri Barbusse, George Lans- bury, Ellen Wilkinson, Fenner Brockway, Harry Pollitt, Reginald Bridgman, Edo Fimmen, Willi Muenzenburg, Ernst Toller, Mohammed Hatta and Roger Baldwin, apart from a large number of delegates from China, Africa, Mexico andLatin America \u2014 and his fallow mind was receptive to Marxist and radical ideas.\nIn his first statement to the press, Jawaharlal merely emphasized the common element in the struggles against imperialism in various parts of the world; the fabric of imperialism looked imposing and appeared to hold to\u00ac gether, but any rent in it would automatically lead to its total destruction. Indian nationalism was based on the most intense internationalism, just as the problem of Indian freedom was a world problem; as in the past, so in the future, other countries and peoples would be vitally affected by the condition of India. But his speech at the inaugural session of the conference was at a deeper level. Jawaharlal pointed out that India was the prime example of imperialism. She had been continuously exploited and terrorized by the British, and her workers and peasants had been systematically crushed. \u2018It does not require statistics, facts or figures to convince you that India in the course of the last few genera\u00ac tions had terribly deteriorated, and is in such a bad way that if something dras\u00ac tic is not done to stop this process India may even cease to exist as a nation.\u2019 It was the policy of the British to create differences among Indians or, where they already existed, to increase them, to maintain the feudal princes in power, to support the rich landowners and to promote an unholy alliance of British and Indian capitalists. \u2018Naturally, therefore,\u2019 concluded Jawaharlal, introducing into his articulated thought a consciousness of the interlinking of economics and politics, \u2018from their capitalist and imperialist point of view they wanted to do everything in their power to hold on to India.\u2019 For the first time, instead of merely condemning British imperialism, Jawaharlal had tried to understand the motives, manner and methods of its functioning. His mind had taken a big step forward.\nThe resolution on India, drafted by Jawaharlal, accorded the warm support of the conference to the liberation of India from foreign domination and all\n To, A. Rangaswamy Iyengar,  February , S.W., vol. , p. . *\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nkinds of exploitation as an essential step in the full emancipation of the peoples of the world. The peoples and workers of other countries should fully co\u00ac operate in this task and in particular take effective steps to prevent the dispatch of foreign troops to India and the retention of an army of occupation in India. This was really meant by Jawaharlal for his audience in India, to weaken \u2018the extraordinary mentality which clings on to the British connection in spite of everything\u2019 and took the presence of British troops for granted. Similarly, to goad the Indian National Congress into looking beyond political freedom, Jawaharlal, in the last paragraph of the resolution, expressed the hope of the conference that the Indian national movement would base its programme on the full emancipation of the peasants and workers of India, \u2018without which there can be no real freedom\u2019, and would co-operate with the movements for emancipation in other parts of the world.\nApart from India, the chief planks of the conference were China and Mexico. At this time in China the Kuomintang, in short-lived alliance with the Communists, was riding on a wave of nationalism and seeking to unite the country; and the Chinese delegation to the Brussels conference, to a large extent official, was hoping to enlist the sympathy, if not support, of public opinion and labour organizations in other countries. A joint declaration of the Indian and Chinese delegations, clearly drafted by Jawaharlal, bears the marks of an outlook which was to remain unchanged for over thirty years. Friendship with China was the core of his pan-Asian feeling. The declaration, in line with the prevalent attitude of cultural nationalism in India and its stress on the ancient civilizations of the East, recalled the close cultural ties between the peoples of India and China for over three thousand years and blamed the British for fostering ill-will against India in China by utilizing Indian merce- napy troops \u2018in support of British capitalist brigandage\u2019. It was therefore urgent and essential that the Indian people should be educated regarding China, and British imperialism should be simultaneously engaged on two of its most vital fronts. \u2018We must now resume the ancient personal, cultural and political rela\u00ac tions between the two peoples. British imperialism which in the past has kept us apart and done us so much injury, is now the very force that is uniting us in a common endeavour to overthrow it.\u2019 The Indian and Chinese delegations thereafter persuaded the British delegation, representative of the British Com\u00ac munist Party, the Independent Labour Party and certain sections of the Labour Party, to commit themselves to support the oppressed countries in their fight for \u2018full independence\u2019 (a phrase preferred by the British to \u2018severance of the British connexion\u2019), to oppose all forms of coercion against colonial peoples,\n. to vote against all credits for the maintenance of armed forces to be used against oppressed nations and to cany on propaganda among British troops. In parti- cular, the British delegation promised to advocate direct action, including strikes and embargoes, to prevent the movement of munitions and troops to China, and demanded unconditional recognition of the nationalist Govern-\nEUIOPE - \nment, abolition of unequal treaties and of extraterritorial rights and surrender of foreign concessions.\nThe Chinese delegation was keen on promoting contacts between the Kuomintang and the Indian Congress and on educating Indian opinion on the Chinese question. Jawaharlal realized that the British Government could prevent exchange of visits at any level, but he felt that the effort should be made. \u2018It is up to us in India to do something practical for China. Vague resolu\u00ac tions of sympathy do not carry one far.\u2019 What he had in mind was the dispatch of an ambulance unit of twenty to twenty-five volunteers. This was intended not only to encourage cordial relations between India and China; Jawaharlal was also anxious to widen the vision of Indian nationalism. He saw too the importance to the world of the future of China, especially as at this time the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party were acting in alliance. What was happening in China, therefore, was not merely an assault on foreign im\u00ac perialism but a direct attack on the capitalist system.\nA victory for the Chinese means the creation of a great Soviet republic in the East closely allied with Russia and together with it gradually domi\u00ac nating the whole of Asia and Europe. This does not mean that the Chinese Republic will be fashioned- wholly on the lines laid down by Marx. Even Soviet Russia, owing to the pressure of the peasantry, has had to give up part of its communism, and in China where the small peasant is the deciding factor, the departure from pure communism will be all the greater.\nThis prescience, the realization that if the alliance of Chinese parties held it would be the Communists and not the much larger Kuomintang who would determine the lines of the future, and the recognition that there would be a large indigenous element in Chinese communism, can only be regarded as astounding \u2014 especially as at this time Stalin\u2019s agents were dominating the Chinese Communist Party. But this was not all. Jawaharlal proceeded to point out that Britain, even with the aid of other European countries, would be un\u00ac able to do much injury to the great continental bloc of Russia and China. \u2018What is more likely is that England in order to save herself from extinction will be\u00ac come a satellite of the United States and incite the imperialism and capitalism of America to fight by her side.\u2019 It was at Brussels that Jawaharlal for the first time, perhaps because of his meeting with the delegates from Mexico and other countries of America, discerned that Britain was fast losing its leader\u00ac ship to the United States.\nMost of us, specially from Asia, were wholly ignorant of the problems of South America, and ofhow the rising imperialism of the United States,\nLettertoN.S.Hardikar,  March , S.W., vol. , p. .'See also his article in Tf>e Volunteer, April , on The Situation in China and India's Duty\u2019, ibid., pp. -.\n^Confidential report to die Working Committee,  February , S.W., vol. , p. .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nwith its tremendous resources and its immunity from outside attack, is gradually taking a stranglehold of central and south America. But we are not at liberty to remain ignorant much longer, for the great problem of the near future will be American imperialism, even more thaif British imperialism. Or it may be, and all indications point to it, that the two will join together to create a powerful Anglo-Saxon bloc to dominate the world.\nJawaharlal expected, in face of the Chinese threat to imperialism, a world war in five years if not earlier. In any such war the North-West Frontier area of India would naturally be a principal battleground, and it was thought that the British were planning with this in view. Again, under the guise of en\u00ac couraging Indian industries, the British were seeking to make India a self- sufficient country in munitions and other sinews of war. Jawaharlal wished the Indian Congress to take cognizance of these developments and formulate its own policy and programme on that basis. There should be a strong agitation against British intervention in China and the utilization of Indian troops for this purpose.\nJawaharlal s forecasts did not come immediately true, if only because the Kuomintang fell out with its Communist partner. But more than twenty years after this report was written, with the triumph of the Communists in China, the conclusion of a Sino-Soviet alliance, the formulation of a Chinese pattern of Communism and the evolution of Britain\u2019s \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the United States, Jawaharlal was to be proved one of the most far-seeing prophets in world affairs in our age.\nThe Brussels conference concluded with the issue of a manifesto based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of imperialism. It was asserted that European capitalism had battened on the exploitation of countries in Asia, Africa and America. In its latest phase of finance capitalism a few countries, and in them a few individuals, controlled the world. But the world war and its consequences had dearly shown that imperialist capitalism was its own grave-digger. A huge wave of the movement for national emandpation was passing over the world, and had received a mighty push forward from the Russian revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union. But the imperialists would not easily give up their booty, as was proved by the activities of \u2018the worst adventurer of our time\u2019, Winston Churchill. So the Brussels Conference dedded to found the League against Imperialism and for National Independence, to organize co-operation between nationalist movements in the colonial countries and labour and anti\u00ac imperialist movements in the exploiting countries.\nJawaharlal does not seem to have taken an active part in drafting this mani\u00ac festo, originally written in French, and resented the way in which it was rushed through the conference. But by this time he had no verygreat objection to its sentiments. He had come round to the Marxist viewpoint in its broad essen-\n.EUROPE -.\n\ntials. He agreed that imperialism and capitalism went hand in hand and neither would disappear until both were put down. As against this, the forces opposing imperialism and capitalism should be co-ordinated so as to strengthen each other. In colonial countries, nationalism automatically and rightly took pre\u00ac cedence over all other ideologies, but such nationalism should have a broad basis, derive its strength from the masses and work specially for them.\nJawaharlal was appointed an honorary president of the League as well as a member of the Executive Committee, though he declined appointment as one of the secretaries on the grounds that he would be away in India. But during his stay in Europe for the rest of the year he attended regularly the meetings of the Executive Committee. Though the Communists were only a minority in this body, they sought to dominate it, and Jawaharlal was one of the leaders of an effective resistance. Often irritated, but never angry, he made it clear that while he accepted in its fundamentals the socialist theory of the state, he had \u2018the strongest objection to being led by the nose by the Russians or by anybody else\u2019. But he did not think there was much danger of this, and, so long as the Soviet Union tried to utilize the League on unobjectionable lines, he saw no harm in co-operating with her against British imperialism. So he recommended to the Working Committee that the Congress might become an associate memb\u00ac erof the League. It was possible that the League might develop, in contrast to the ineffective Leagufe of Nations, into a powerful League of Peoples; but this was not the reason why Jawaharlal advocated association of the Congress. He was enough of a realist not to place faith in such fantasies. Nor did he trust much to the support of British and other foreign working-class movements; 'almost every Englishman, however advanced he may be politically, is a bit of an im\u00ac perialist in matters relating to India.\u2019 He would have agreed broadly with Gandhi that India had little to expect from such bodies as this League, because most of the European states were partners in the exploitation of India, and their sympathy could not be expected in the final heat of the struggle. He wrote to Gandhi:\nI do not expect much from it and indeed I am quite sure that none of the members of the so-called imperialist or oppressing nations will help us in the least whenever their interests conflict with ours. I have no illu\u00ac sions about their altruism. But I welcome all legitimate methods of getting into touch with other countries and peoples so that we may be able to understand their viewpoint and world politics generally.

It is solely with a view to self-education and self-improvement that I desire external contacts. I am afraid we are terribly narrow in our outlook and the sooner we get out of this narrow\u00ac ness the better. Our salvation can of course come only from the internal strength that we may evolve but one of the methods of evolving such strength should be study of other people and their ideas.\nAssociation would also enable the Congress to utilize the League as its vehicle for propaganda abroad without committing it to the adoption of a socialist programme or limiting its freedom of action in India or elsewhere. Moreover, the League could be used by the Asian members to keep in close touch. At Brussels many delegates from Asia, despite discouragement from the organizers, had met informally and talked in terms of forming an \u2018Asiatic federation.\u2019 But this was thought to be premature and it was decided, for the time being, to concentrate efforts on strengthening the League and promoting bilateral relations.\nHowever, it was the Soviet Union that now dominated Jawaharlal\u2019s mind, just as it had, an unseen presence, dominated the Brussels conference. He read all that he could lay hands on, books both by partisans and by critics, about developments and conditions in that country, and found much to admire. He believed that whatever the tradition of hostility between Britain and Russia, to a free India she would be no threat; and even if India were wholly opposed to Communism she could have friendly relations with Russia. Jawaharlal, far-seeing as ever, recognized that as she grew in power Soviet Russia might develop a new type of imperialism; but he thought there was little chance of this for a long time to come, and for the moment, for reasons of self-interest, Russia was befriending all oppressed nationalities. It seemed logical, there\u00ac fore, that he should visit the Soviet Union before returning to India; and the opportunity came, after Motilal\u2019s arrival in Europe in the autumn, when father and son were invited to the decennial celebrations of the  revolution. When they were at Berlin the Soviet ambassador conveyed the invitation to them; and though this was short notice they decided, after some hesitation, to accept it.\nThe invitation came in the last phase of the Soviet policy of support for national liberation movements in Asia, regardless of their ideology. This was a heritage from Lenin, who had believed that colonial countries like India should have their bourgeois, democratic revolution before they could think of proletarian rule, and that therefore it was the duty of Communists to work at this stage in co-operation with the leadership of the bourgeoisie. So to Lenin Gandhi was a revolutionary, and he rejected the argument of M.N. Roy that\n*A Note on Foreign Policy for India,  September , S.W., vol. , pp. -.\n*Nehru to Amal Home,  October , Nehru paper*.\nEUROPE -\n\nthe Indian bourgeoisie was no different from the traditional feudal classes. ThethesisofLenin became the official policy of the Soviet Union and the Com\u00ac intern, and although by the end of  there were the beginnings of Com\u00ac munist party organization in India, the general plan was for the Communists to infiltrate the Congress rather than promote a revolutionary mass party of their own. It was true that in May  Stalin had accepted the position of Roy and advocated the formation of a revolutionary bloc in India led by the proletariat in general and the Communists in particular, and including the revolutionary section of the bourgeoisie. But the other line of working with bourgeois leadership still held the field till the end of . The Brussels Congress testified to the importance the Soviet Union still attached to bour\u00ac geois nationalist movements; and the severance of diplomatic relations by Britain in  followed by strong rumours of British preparations for military invasion, with Peshawar as a base, led to a war scare in the Soviet Union. Now more than ever it seemed invaluable to have the sympathy, if not the active support, of the Congress Party.\nAchange in Soviet attitude came towards the end of . The setbacks in China and the failure of the efforts to reach a rapprochement with the Western Powers unnerved the makers of Soviet and Comintenf policy; and Stalin, who was now finally emerging as the victor in his rivalry with Trotsky, viewed the colonial question only against the background of European events and had a more limited idea of the security of the Soviet Union. At the Fifteenth Party Congress, Bukharin made it clear that the bourgeoisie in India could no longer be supported. The Sixth Congress of the Third International formally aban\u00ac doned in  the policy of a united front against imperialism and directed the Indian Communist Party to act in isolation and work for an armed insurrec\u00ac tion, for the bourgeois nationalist parties had become supporters of imperialism and, having assumed \u2018a reformist and class-collaborationist character\u2019, could not be expected to lead the revolution.\nSo November  was the last occasion, for many years at any rate, when the Nehrus could expect an official invitation to Moscow. They were in Russia for only a few days, but the articles which Jawaharial wrote for The Hindu covering this visit ami which were later published as a book, show the deep impression made on him by 'this strange Eurasian country of the hammer and sickle, where workers and peasants sit on the thrones of the mighty and upset the best-laid schemes of mice and men\u2019. They were, he wrote to his sister from Moscow, 'in topsy turvy land. All one\u2019s old values get upset and life wears a strange aspect here.' He knew that they were on a conducted tour, seeing only what they were allowed to see; he knew too that conditions in the\n D.N.

Yet he was convinced that the Soviet Union had made rapid progress in agriculture, prison reform, the eradication of illiteracy, the treat\u00ac ment of women, the handling of the problem of minorities and the removal of the sharp contrasts between luxury and poverty and of the hierarchy of class. He was sure too that the Soviet Union had much to teach India, which also was a large agricultural country with a poor and illiterate population. His mood was defined by the lines which he put on the title-page of his book:\n\u2018Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,\nBut to be young was very heaven.\u2019\nStarry-eyed? Perhaps; but it is well to remember that the Russia which Jawaharlal visited was still very much the Russia of Lenin, even though Lenin had been dead for over three years. Stalin had not yet become the undisputed dictator, and there was a considerable amount of mass support for the Soviet regime. The New Economic Policy was still in effect. \u2018Get rich\u2019, Bukharin had advised the peasants in ; and the peasants still dominated the country- ide and brought about a strong recovery in food production. This was to them the \u2018golden era of Soviet rule\u2019. The number of family holdings rose to  millions in , and comprised - per cent of the sown area. Stalin, like Lenin, was still speaking in terms of voluntary collectivization of agricul\u00ac ture. It was only after  that it was felt that \u2018Bolshevism in alliance with the peasants\u2019, apart from being ideologically untenable, was also impracticable. The food shortages in large cities in the summer of , despite a good harvest, showed that, without mass production of consumer goods, the pea\u00ac sants could not be induced to sell their grain. The percentage of the crops being sent to the urban markets was even less than that in the years before the war. On the other hand, industrial production, which till  had shown a rapid rise because of the reactivation of productive capacity of the years before , now began to slacken. If industrialization \u2014 and specially,heavy indus\u00ac trialisation, thought to be so necessary with the imminent prospect of war -*\u25a0 were to be maintained, itwas necessary to insiston the peasants disgorging their supplies; and this meant rapid and enforced collectivizatiop. In December , therefore \u2014 a month after the visit of the Nehrus \u2014 the P:.rty Congress de\u00ac cided on an offensive against thekulak, opening a new chapter in Soviet history.\nSo Jawaharlal saw the Soviet Union in the last days of its first, halcyon period. If his reaction was idealistic, it was partly because there was still some idealism in the air. The grounding in Marxism, which he had received at the Brussels conference and after, was followed by a near-conversion to commun\u00ac ism by practical testimony. Jawaharlal had been particularly impressed by Lenin\u2019s leadership, by his realism and resilience, and above all by his insistence\n.A. Nove, An Economic History of the U.S.S.R. (London, ), p.l.\nEUROPE - \non professional, full-time revolutionaries. The need for such workers in India was obviously even greater, and it was as one such that Jawaharlal now doubt\u00ac less saw himself. He who had sailed from India as a dedicated disciple of Gandhi returned a self-conscious revolutionary radical. Although always to be deeply influenced by Gandhi, he was never again to be wholly a prisoner in the Gandhian mould. But it is significant that the change was wrought not by the revolutionary situation in India but by what he saw and heard and read in Europe. Jawaharlal was always a radical in the European tradition, seeking to apply and adapt its doctrine to his own country. This could be both a strength and a weakness. The Campaign for Independence\nONE\nIt was in this mood, not as before of novelettish romanticism but of thoughtful commitment to revolutionary change, that Jawaharlal returned to India. The British Government, too, had noticed this change of outlook, and, as Jawahar\u00ac lal knew, shadowed his activities in Europe during , while at Simla the Home Member had warned his father that \u2018Jawahar was sailing too near the wind\u2019. In fact, it was aft<\"r this friendly caution that Motilal decided to sail for Europe to keep an eye on his son and escort him safely home.\nHowever, Jawaharlal, his wife and daughter came back ahead and reached Madras in time for the Congress session in December . He was itching for action. For this, the first step seemed to him to be the acceptance of full indepen\u00ac dence as the objective. Jawaharlal had been thinking about this for a long time and had now finally come round to the view that the Congress should commit it\u00ac self firmly to the goal of independence. He could not accept the usual argument that there was no real difference between Dominion Status and independence because the former carried with it the right to secede. Theoretically this was so, but in fact Dominion Status implied the maintenance of a connection with Britain and allowing her dominance in every major field. This might be suited to countries like Australia and Canada, but was meaningless for India. Either India left the empire or she stayed as a dependent, under whatever guise, within it; there was no third alternative. Co-operation between the lamb and the lion always resulted in the lamb being inside the lion. But this need not mean enmity with Britain. Though there could be no friendship within the empire, once India was out of the imperial stranglehold, she could co-operate with Britain as an equal.\nEven more important to Jawaharlal than the political and economic im\u00ac plications of independence were the psychological consequences of a com\u00ac mitment to such an uncompromising policy. The assent to Dominion Status\n\u00ab\nIMotilal to Gandhi,  May ..Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya, vol. $, no. .\nt in\nTHE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 'll \nas the objective was in itself an indication of India's mental degradation, for behind it lay an unquestioning acceptance of the inevitability of a British presence in India. That the Congress should adhere to it revealed a craven fear of being declared an unlawful assembly if it claimed anything more, and the preponderance within it of elements which on the whole profited by the British connection. The spider\u2019s web of imperialism had obviously caught even Con\u00ac gressmen. But once the Congress made independence its goal, it wopld shake off the defeatism and weariness that had followed the non-cooperation move\u00ac ment, sweep away Swarajist temporizings, gain a new strength and again pull in the masses. Jawaharlal\u2019s stay in Europe had confirmed him in the resolve that India should look for no favours from Britain. Relatively and potentially Indian nationalism was not weak, while England was daily losing ground despite her apparent strength. It made no difference which party was in office. His first-hand contacts with British Labour leaders had filled him with particular contempt for these 'sanctimonious and canting humbugs\u2019.\nJawaharlal, therefore, was eager for wholehearted combat, with no quarter sought or given. His new radical ideas affirmed rather than diverted his en\u00ac thusiasm for political action. Even the arrest of capitalist exploitation and a lightening of India's poverty required the termination of imperialist rule. But the mirage of Dominion Status weakened\u2018resistance in India to the British and generally strengthened reformist as against revolutionary forces. The real strength of the British in India lay in the submissive attitude of Indians to the statusquo \u2014 to the raj, to established ideas, to old customs and traditions. So, as he complained to Gandhi, 'it passes my comprehension how a national organization can have as its ideal and goal dominion status. The very idea suffocates and strangles me.\u2019\nIt was Gandhi, of course, who was the main hurdle. He was not present at the sessions of the Madras Congress when Jawaharlal secured the passage of a resolution committing the Congress to independence. But the followers of Gandhi had been there in sufficient numbers to secure the removal of the parts of the resolution which clarified independence to mean full control of defence, finance and economic and foreign policy and demanded that this be implemented immediately, in particular by the complete withdrawal ofthe British army of occupation. So all that the party accepted was a general ad\u00ac herence to die goal of complete national independence; and even this was not incorporated into the constitution of the Congress. That still proclaimed the objective to be swaraj, and thus enabled those who did not believe in indepen\u00ac dence and a total severance from Britain, and had no wish to see the British army withdraw at once, continue to be members of the party.\nSo Jawaharlal's resolution, as he himself recognized, was not really taken\n Speechat the All-Parties Conference,  August , S.W., vol.  (Delhi, ), p. .\n* January . \u2022\n*Autobiography, p. .\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nseriously and was meant primarily to humour him. But Gandhi did not conceal his disdain for what seemed to him mock heroics. He described the resolution in Young India as \u2018hastily conceived\u2019 and 'thoughtlessly passed\u2019, and the Con\u00ac gress as a whole as having descended to the level of a schoolboy debating society. He also warned Jawaharlal privately that he was proceeding too fast. When Jawaharlal replied stiffly that he had a large measure of support, that Gandhi\u2019s leadership was now hesitant and ineffective, and that their ideals were very different, Gandhi offered to publish the correspondence. In other words, he was prepared for an open break. The relationship had not yet developed to the extent that to the olderman it was in any way indispensable. But Jawaharlal drew back. The firmness of his views was not to him incom\u00ac patible with emotional dependence, and he was eager to remain, in Gandhi\u2019s phrase, \u2018under stupefaction\u2019. He recoiled from further publicity being given to their differences which, he assured Gandhi, were only on a few points and need not spread to the many other issues on which they agreed. His regard and affection for Gandhi were personal, but they were also something more; \u2018even in the wider sphere am I not your child in politics, though perhaps a truant and errant child?\u2019\nSo, without breaking away completely from Gandhi and the old leadership, Jawaharlal campaigned for independence as the ultimate objective. It was a circumscribed revolt. The issue came up again at the All-Parties Conference and at the proceedings of the committee set up by it, with Motilal Nehru as the chairman, to draw up a constitution for India as an answer to the challenge of the Secretary of State, Lord Birkenhead, that Indian politicians were capable of no constructive suggestions. Though Jawaharlal was not a member of this com-? mittee, he took an active part in its meetings and helped his father with the sec\u00ac retarial work. But he was thoroughly ill at ease in an atmosphere of haggling and compromise. \u2018The fault must be mine but anyway it results in my feeling always that I do not fit in with anything. I am always the square peg and the holes are all round. I feel very lonely.\u2019 His suggestions that the constitution should establish a democratic socialist republic and a beginning be made in elections by economic units were not given even a moment\u2019s consideration. To secure the broadest level of agreement in a body many of whose members were not Congressmen, Motilal favoured Dominion Status and gave his atten\u00ac tion mostly to finding a possible solution of the communal problem. In this he was successful, and the Nehru Report recommended, as concessions to the\n* January .\n* January . A Bunch of Old Letters, pp. -.\n* January .\n January , Collected Works, vol.  (New Delhi. ), pp. -.\n* January .\n*To Gandhi,  June .\nNote,  March , Report of the Committee to the All-Parties Conference.\n*HE CAMPAIGN for independence \nMuslims, not separate electorates but reservations of seats, the constitution of Sind as a separate province and the introduction of the reforms of  in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan.* The hope of Jawa- harlal and many others that reservation of seats should be terminated after ten years or earlier with the consent of the parties concerned could not be incor\u00ac porated into the report. But even this measure of consensus was a notable achievement and Jawaharlal was not alone in expecting that the report might provide the finishing kick to communalism. But the acceptance of Dominion Status went against the grain. He spoke repeatedly against it and often had to engage in public debate with his father. He knew, however, that he had no chance of getting the decision reversed, and fell back on keeping alive the com\u00ac mitment of the Congress to independence. The fact that it was a party to the Nehru Report need not mean that it had abandoned its own preference.\nIt was for this purpose that he organized the Independence for India League as, in the first instance, a pressure group within the Congress. Knowing that Gandhi and other leading Congressmen disapproved of independence and all that it implied, Jawaharlal resigned the general secretaryship; but the Working Committee declined to accept it. Ostensibly this was because the resolution of the Madras Congress gave legitimacy to propaganda for independence; but in fact it was because the general run of Congressmen attached little importance to Jawaharlal\u2019s efforts. To them the only value which the demand for indepen\u00ac dence now had was that it enabled them to bargain for Dominion Status. Had there been any danger of the Independence for India League altering the general direction of the Congress, it would doubtless have been hastily stifled. For the League was intended to keep alive not only the objective of political indepen\u00ac dence but also the concomitant ideals of republicanism and socialism. To Jawaharlal independence was not a purely political issue. Severance of the British connection implied also an attack on the vested interests supported by the British in India; indeed, the basis of the struggle was economic. The future republican government of India would be based not on the exploitation of the masses but on social equality. The object of the Independence for India League was therefore both to achieve independence and to reconstruct Indian society by changing its capitalist and feudal basis. 'It means that the League aims at the socialist democratic State in which every person has the fullest opportunities of development and the State control of the means of production and distribu\u00ac tion;\u2019. Instead of a few individuals amassing huge fortunes by the exploitation\nm\niNote,  July .\nIntfrview to the press,  September.

TheLeague should beboth an active element within the parent party and a general catalyst in the nation. The Con\u00ac gress might head the political campaign and take the lead in drafting constitu\u00ac tions, but economic and social changes could be effected only by the sanction provided by the exploited classes. For this a revolutionary atmosphere would have to becreated in thecountry and the people organized on a large scale. But this required an economic programme. Gandhi had drawn the masses into the political struggle in a way in which no one else could have done, and this to Jawaharlal made his leadership indispensable. But they could only be kept in this struggle by providing an economic content to swaraj \u2014 something which Gandhi had never done. Gandhi claimed not to object to this on principle, but thought the effort was premature.  am quite of your opinion that some day we shall have to start an intensive movement without the ricKpeople and without the vocal educated class. But that time is not yet.\u2019 However, Jawaharlal went ahead and formulated a precise programme. Though he hada grand design of socialism, he wanted a very modest beginning. In the U.P. in particular there seemed to be no alternative to the abolition of landlordism, but this should be done with the payment of partial compensation and replaced by smallholdings owned by individual peasant proprietors with no right of alienation. There would be not nationalization but socialization of laid, and the most that the Statewouldmanagewould be model farms. Agricultural debts should bewritten off but after part payment. The State should gradually acquire key industries, ensure a minimum living wage and impose sharply graduated direct taxes an inheritance tax and a tax on agricultural income.\nJawaharlal was aware thAsuch a programme would inevitably, at some stage or other, raise issues of the dass struggle and bring about dashes of in\u00ac terests between labour and capitalists and between landlords and tenants; but these could not be shirked. It was no wisdom to refuse to recognize or face conflict where it existed. Such conflicts would have to be fought and Overcome. Pushed to it, Jawaharlal was willing to concede both that violence was not objectionable in itself and that the final goal, thfe resolution of the struggle, might well be communism. If India were convinced that she could become free throughviolence, shewould undoubtedly have the right to indulge in it as other countries had done. He stood for intensive non-violent non-co-operation, only\n^rcularletter toCongressmen,  April , S.W., vol. , p. .\n\u2019See speech at Banins,  January, Tbs BombayCbnmicls,  January .\n\u2019To Jawaharlal,  April , CoUtcUd Works, vol. , p. .\nPresidential address to the U.

Violence was contrary to the logic of politics and not of ethics; and terrorism was a tactic of defeat. As for the ultimate objective, addressing a students\u2019 conference in Calcutta, he publicly accepted that though he personally did not agree with manyof the methodsof theCommunists andwasbynomeans sure to what extent Communism would suit conditions in India, yet he did believe in Communism as an ideal of society. For essentially it was socialism, and to him socialism was the only way if the world was to escape disaster.\nFor the work of organization Jawaharlal looked to the young men and women of India. Impressed by what he had seen in the Soviet Union and read about the achievements of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, Jawaharlal was thinking in terms of youth cadres in India. He did not fancy Communist workers, if only because there appeared to him to be no trained Marxists in India, and he certainly did not consider himself as one. Moreover, the strongest appeal in India inevitably came from nationalism, and any programme for economic and social reforms would have to be linked to that. So, while he continued to promote the work of the Hindustani Seva Dal, he also looked further afield. Within a few months of his return, he wrote to jthe press calling on those who were for independence, detested the growing influence of religion in politics and desired the removal of inequalities of class and caste and wealth to get in touch with each other and with him. But revolutionary battalions do not spring into existence on the merewriting of letters to the editor, and Jawaharlal\u2019s appeal was significant only as indicative of his own aspirations. Throughout the year he gave the greatest importance to youth leagues and conferences, and was prepared to sacrifice all other work to the organization of youth. But an all-India corps dedicated to \u2018full- blooded socialism' and carrying the fight to various parts of the country never came into being.\nNor did the Independence for India League, as Jawaharlal sadly recognized soon enough, fulfil the hopes of its creator. It consisted of a few politicians who either were disgruntled with Gandhi and Motilal or hoped to draw on the grow\u00ac ing popularity of Jawaharlal for their own advantage. Indeed, often people joined the League with the intention of smothering it. Jawaharlal was too honest himself to realize in time the machinations of others; and it has been suggested that he was by now increasingly the victim of flattery.

But the result was that the Independence for India League never became the spearhead of revolu\u00ac tion, well-knit in its organization and dear-cut in its ideology. Rather, for a year it struggled on in a state of suspended animation till it ceased to have a raison d\u2019itre in the beginning of . with the Congress as a whole committed, in certain circumstances, to the goal of independence. Its significance in history is its testimony to the unalloyed idealism of Jawaharlal. But his enthusiasm for action in a noble cause was not matched by a capacity for organization.\nTWO\nHowever, if at this time Jawaharlal failed to create an instrument to mobilize the country for a long-term revolution, he was more successful in helping to plan demonstrations all over the country as a reply to the insult proffered to it by the announcement in  of a Commission consisting solely of British members of Parliament to consider whether India was ready for a further instalment of constitutional reforms. The mistake was primarily that of the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, and his officials. They soon realized that they had blun\u00ac dered, but convinced themselves that a boycott of the Commission was not a serious threat. It was thought that the Congress was weak and divided, and dominated by the Swarajists who were moving more and more towards con\u00ac stitutional opposition; and with the Congress lukewarm in its boycott of the Commission, other parties need not be expected to be rigid in their hostility. So things might right themselves in the course of a few months, especially if some small sops could be found. Various concessions were suggested by the Governmentof India and by Sir John Simon, the chairman of the Commission, to make it easier for the Indian political parties to abandon the boycott and co\u00ac operate with the Commission. Gandhi thought this might well happen; and Motilal, who shared this fear, was, by the summer, planning to visit Canada rather than waste his time in India.\nHowever, the boycott held. Liberals like Sapru, who relied heavily on British goodwill, resented the jilting so deeply that for once they refused to behave like moderates. Jinnah also could not be won over by the Government, with the result that the Muslim leaders who were willing to collaborate could not claim to represent all Muslims.

Freedom was India\u2019s fundamental right, and as all commissions sent out from England denied that right they could receive no quarter in India. \u2018Our aim is a completely free India and we have nothing to discuss except on this basis.\u2019 But at least the affront of the Simon Commission could be used as an occasion for united action, to bring together members of various parties in a common cause. The boycott might not lead India far on the path of independence, but it would certainly help to create a healthyatmosphere in which work of national organization could be expedited.* The chance of hitting back had almost a therapeutic effect on Jawaharlal, and he set about, as general secretary of the Congress, organizing the boycott on a countrywide scale. February rd, the day the Commission was to land in India, was to be treated as a day not of mourning but of rejoicing, for on that day would commence afresh the war for independence.\nThe national hartal was a greater success than Jawaharlal had anticipated, and thereafter, throughout the year, wherever the Commission went, demon- strations ending in police charges and firing took place. At Lahore the leading Congressman of the Punjab, Lajpat Rai, was severely beaten. Jawaharlal and his colleagues now awaited the arrival of the Commission in the United Prov\u00ac inces. The Provincial Government at first decided to adopt an accommodating attitude and to allow processions, provided the organizers asked for permission and agreed to follow the route laid down by the police. This moderation was believed to have been based on the assumption that the demonstrations would not amount to much, as the Muslims would not participate in it. The local organizers of the boycott also decided to abide by these conditions, as they had no desire to have a conflict with the police; and processions were taken out with permission on  and  November. Jawaharlal arrived in Lucknow on the th and the tempo immediately rose. He had little enthusiasm for law- abiding processions. \u2018I shall only stay on till the th if there is much doing. Otherwise I do not propose to waste good time in waving a little flag.\u2019 News of the death of Lajpat Rai on  November had already inflamed tempers throughout India, and Jawaharlal called on the youth of Lucknow to answer this challenge.

The organizers of the procession replied that it was too late to alter the route, and when the procession started to move it was lathi-chargeA by mounted police. Jawaharlal had by this time, probably expecting no major confrontation, left Lucknow; but on hearing of the lathi charge he returned to the cityon the th. Thepolice, whobelieved that the defiance of the boycott committee on the th had been on Jawaharlal\u2019s orders, refused to permit any more processions. They stopped a small group of twelve led by Jawaharlal and Govind Ballabh Pant, which was on its way to a public Sheeting, and asked them if they had secured a licence for a procession. Jawaharlal replied that in view of the behaviour of the police the previous day he was not prepared to have any further dealings with them, and the police thereupon broke up the group with lathis. Jawaharlal himself received two blows. Despite this, the group refused to disperse. Meantime a large crowd had gathered, and the officials were compelled to permit Jawaharlal and his companions to proceed along their chosen route to the meeting with, in fact, the police riding in front as a vanguard.\nThe next morning the Commission arrived in Lucknow. The Congress, which had sought permission to hold a blade flag demonstration, was allotted a site nearly  yards from the station, so that Simon and his colleagues would hardly notice it. Alarge procession, led by Jawaharlal \u2014 Modlal,whohadcome from Allahabad, was prevented by his son from joining them \u2014 reached the station, and sought to take up a position nearer to the route of the Commission than theoneallotted to them. Thiswasnear anopen space, and thepolice carried out a cavalry charge, using both lathis and spears, on a crowd of over thirty thousand for two or three furlongs. Though hundreds were beaten and many trampled down, the large crowd generally stood its ground, neither retreating nor retaliating, till the police, once the Commission had passed, fell back. Jawaharlal, after receiving half a dozen lathi Mows on his back, shoulders and legs, was surrounded by students who shielded him from further attack. Just then ayoung man, ostensibly a student but later discovered to be a police agent, offered to provide Jawaharlal with two revolvers. The offer was politely\nReport of Deputy Commr Lucknow,  December . Home Dept. Pol. Pile  of .\n\u2019Ibid.\n\u2019Report in Tb* Tribun*,  December ; pees* statements of Jawaharlal,  and  December .

It strengthens Jawaharlal\u2019s accusation that the police, angry at their loss of prestige on the two previous days, were out on this occasion for vengeance, and primarily ^gainst Jawaharlal.\nThe news of the latbi charges on the th and th and of the injuries in\u00ac flicted on Jawaharlal roused widespread anger in India. The deputy commis\u00ac sionerof Lucknow sought to play it down. Of the dash on the th he reported that if Pant and Jawaharlal were beaten it was very slightly indeed; and as for the confrontation the next day at the station he remarked that the \u2018actual occurrence was rather like the dealing of a football ground in England when the crowd havebroken loose. There have been gross exaggerations in the press, and Jawaharlal\u2019s report is so ludicrous and overstated as to carry its own refuta\u00ac tion.\u2019 In fact, it was Jawaharlal\u2019? statements, fortified by other eye-witness accounts in the press, that were bdieved. The raj was thought to have bared its teeth, and its actions, bom of bloodlust and cracking of nerve, evoked memories of Amritsar in . Jawaharlal wa$ not slow to draw the paralld.\nThe events of Lucknow make it dear that the authorities in the United Provinces at least are modelling themselves on the old Punjab model and Haileyism is coming to mean much the same thing as ODwyerism. O\u2019Dwyerism was followed by non-co-operation and the greatest national awakening of modem times in India. That awakening shook the fabric of British rule. India is different today from what it was nine years ago and Haileyism is likely to lead to an even greater national response which may carry us to our goal.\nTHREE\nApart from the impact on the devdopment of the national resistance to British rule, the police actions at Lucknow confirmed Jawaharlal\u2019s national standing. He was no longer merdy a politician of the United Provinces; throughout India his popularity leapt, and he was firmly established as one of the front\u00ac runners of his generation. Gandhi realized and wdcomed this. \u2018My love to you. It was all done bravdy. You have braver things to do. May God spare you for many along year to come and make you his chosen instrument for freeing India from [the] yoke.\u2019\nThe Government\u2019s reaction to the growing popularity of Jawaharlal was to consider his arrest. As early as September, when Jawaharlal founded the Independence for India League, there was a rumour that he was soon to be\n\u2022Home Dept. Pol.

In fact, the speech was in Jawaharlal\u2019s usual vein, a castigation of British imperialism as an aspect of the world phenomenon of capitalism, a vivid description of India\u2019s low condition and a call to revolt against evil and the establishment of a co\u00ac operative socialist commonwealth in a world federation of socialist states. As suited an address to students, it was more academic than his other speeches of the time. Yet the jittery Government of India asked the Bombay Government to consider prosecution, and were brought back tp reality only by that Govern\u00ac ment\u2019s comment that everyone must agree with much of what Jawaharlal had said, and it would be difficult to prove that communism and revolution, and not merely socialism, were being advocated.\nThe Government acquired another opportunity to proceed against Jawahar\u00ac lal at Jharia, where the annual session of the All-India Trade Union Congress was being held. The League against Imperialism had deputed W.J. Johnston as a fraternal delegate, and the police walked into the meeting to arrest him. Jawaharlal had the police turned out, made a fiery speech and led the infuriated delegates in affiliating the Trade Union Congress to the League. When, the next day, Johnston was arrested outside the conference pandal, Jawaharlal delivered yet another vehement denunciation of imperialism and called for united action against the British. But, rather than arrest Jawaharlal, the Government preferred to await the decisions of the National Congress which was to meet in its annual session in a few days at Calcutta.\nThe hope of Motilal at Calcutta was to secure the adoption by the Congress of the Nehru Report and the acceptance of Dominion Status without prejudice to the ultimate goal of complete independence. In this way he expected to hold the line, and to retain moderate support without losing that of his son and the othermembers of the Independence for India League. Gandhi came to Calcutta\nStatement of MauUna Zafar AU, Tba Tribun*,  September .\n*To Syed Mahmud,  September .\n\u2019Note ofHome Secretary,  October . Home Dept.

The psychology behind the Nehru Report was alien to him. \u2018It is obvious that the Congress contains at least two if not more groups which have nothing in common be\u00ac tween them and the sooner they break apart the better.\u2019 But if such a break occurred, Gandhi and his father would be on the other side; and, as so often in his public life, affection prevailed over logic. He opposed Dominion Status in the severest terms. To accept it, as Gandhi suggested, was to declare that the Congress was prepared to allow India to be exploited by British imperial\u00ac ism. All energy oozed out of him at the very thought of Dominion Status. But he toned down independence to mean severance of all connection not with the British but only with British imperialism; and he commended the Nehru Report without prejudice to the independence resolution of the Madras Congress. This suggested both a desire to find common ground and a willing\u00ac ness to face both ways.\nGandhi was as anxious to avoid a break. He, of course, preferred Dominion Status to independence, but he was not enamoured of the Nehru Report. 'The way to constitutional swaraj may lie through Lucknow; the way to organic swaraj, which is synonymous with Ramarajya, lies through Bardoli.\u2019* If he supported the Report it was primarily out of loyalty to Motilal. But in the effort to hold the party together, he was not prepared to discard all consistency. The final sentence in Jawaharlal\u2019s speech probably gave him the clue: \u2018Pre\u00ac pared as this House should be for any compromise on any lines, it should not be prepared to give up its definite real goal of independence for any length of time.' This hinted that Jawaharlal was willing to shelve temporarily the de\u00ac mand for independence. So Gandhi recommended that if the Government did not accept and act upon the Nehru Report within two years, the Congress should revert to full independence. Such flexibility of approach involved no long-term compromise on ideals and, especially as no one seriously expected the Government to accept the Nehru Report, made a concession only to the ear. As a further step to placate Jawaharlal, the time-limit was reduced in discussions to one year. So Jawaharlal and his friends could accept the re\u00ac solution; but to mark his disapproval of even the paper concession, Jawaharlal stayed away from the final session when the resolution was passed. Gandhi explained his absence.\nHe thinks this resolution itself falls far short of what he wants but, a\nhigh-souled man as he is, he does not want to create unnecessary bitter\u00ac ness ... how can he help feeling disatisfied? He would not be Jawaharlal\nif he did not strike out for himself an absolutely unique and original\nTo Aosari, ) September .\n\u2019Speech  December . S.W., vol. , pp. -.\n*ToB.G.

His own country and his duty to his own country he considers and nothing else.\nFOUR\nSo the Congress gave its support to the Nehru Report and the demand fir Dominion Status for one year, after which it would again resort to non-co- operation as the means for securing independence. As there was obviously no chance of the Government responding to this resolution in any satisfactory way,  was dearly to be a year of preparation. It was in that spirit that Jawaharlal carried out his duties as general secretary of the Congress, and he was encouraged in this by Gandhi. \u2018I wish that Jawahar could travel through\u00ac out all the provinces and see that the Congress organizations become living bodies.\u2019 He asked Jawaharlal to reorganize the provincial Congress commit\u00ac tees, compel obedience to instructions from the Working Committee and direct them to implement fully the constructive programme.  Jawaharlal had also been directed by the AICC to prepare, with Subhas Bose, a scheme to train volunteers to work in the villages and among the dty labourers. So Jawaharlal set out to revitalize the Congress and run it on proper lines.\nIt seems to be the general opinion that everything connected with the Congress can be done in an unbusinesslike way. Certainly no business could have survived the want of method which the poor Congress has had toput up with. My own personal bent is all for method and thorough\u00ac ness. The less I see of these in Congress offices the more I get put out.\nHe himself was short of money, but spent as much as he could out of his own pocket on Congress work. He secured authorization from the Working Com\u00ac mittee to inspect, personally or by representatives chosen by him, the offices of the provincial committees and to make recommendation for their improved working. He also arranged for auditors to visit these offices and 'examine the accounts. Almost all the provincial headquarters were inspected and sugges\u00ac tions made for their improvement, and their finances were put in order.\nJawaharlal also, while m sought to avoid public speaking as far as possible and was not greatly excited by the constructive programme of spinning and boycott, gave considerable attention to the Congress volunteer corps, the Hindustani Seva Dal, youth leagues and student organizations. What m wanted was dedicated young men and women who would organize the pea\u00ac sants and workers and create a mass consciousness in preparation for the\n*  December , CoUoctod Works, vol. , pp. -.\nGandhi g>Motilal,  February , CoUoctod Works, vol. , p. .\n*  January and  February , Ibid., pp.  and -. *\n\u00abTo Lala Shankarlai,  May .\n See Sri Prakasa's article in R.

The main question before the people was that of bread, and when the driving forces of hunger led the poor into the struggle for freedom, then swaraj wold be attained. He planned an Indian National Service, at both all-India and provincial levels, and collected funds for building up a cadre of whole-time workers in the United Provinces. He also sought to reacti\u00ac vate the Independence for India League and provide it with an economic and social programme, even though the League had never shown much sign of life and, by the end of the year, there would be no need for a separate pressure group to champion the cause of independence as the whole Congress would be committed to it.\nThese activities of Jawaharlal alarmed the Government. They regarded the Calcutta resolution, passed primarily to accommodate Jawaharlal and those of his way of thinking, as a clear triumph for extremism. As the ulti\u00ac matum presented to the British Government was not expected to be complied with, the resolution was a definite declaration that civil disobedience would be started a year later. \u2018If the experience of the Calcutta Congress is any guide, the decision of future policy appears to be almost entirely with the younger men notably Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Babu Subhas Chandra Bose, and on their intentions and activities future developments may be expected largely to depend.\u2019 The Government attached greater significance at this time to these efforts of Jawaharlal and-his colleagues to rouse the masses and particu\u00ac larly, as they thought, the peasants and the students, to destroy the raj, than to the Communist programme to stir up a movement, chiefly among industrial labour, to attack the economic organization of society and aimed directly against employers and only indirectly against imperialism. The Government recognized that the two movements had points of contact and in some respects were closely linked. There is a tendency for the political and the Communist revolutionaries to join hands, and Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru, an extreme nationalist who is at the same time genuinely attracted by some of the Com\u00ac munist doctrines, stands about at the meeting point.\u2019 But the tacticians of the Home Department felt that it would be advantageous from their point of view to stress the differences between the Communists and the nationalists.\nCommunism contains grave dangers for the very classes who support the extreme nationalist movement, and our aim should be to do nothing which will produce an artificial union between the two movementswhich, if left to themselves, may tend to diverge. This suggests the conclusion that we should be very cautious in taking action against Communism .which may rouse for the Communists any general sympathy among the nationalists or provide the nationalists with what they are searching\n'Speeches-at Delhi,  February, and at Lahore,  February , S.W., vol. , (Delhi, ), PP. -. *\n\u2019Home Secretary to all Local Govts.,  February , Home Dept.

But rather than try and uproot Communism by attacking Com\u00ac munist organizations throughout India and seeking special powers for this purpose, the Government preferred to arrest the leading Communists in various parts of India and to prosecute them for conspiracy to overthrow British rule. It was hoped to secure a judicial pronouncement which would enable the Government to deal with the further spread of Communism and to prevent the movement recovering from the blow which it had been dealt by the arrest of its leaders; and there might also be the political advantage of convincing the general public that Communism was not the kind of move\u00ac ment that should receive the sympathy of nationalists. Meantime, no action was contemplated against the latter.\nThe trial of the Communist leaders was staged at Meerut, chosen as the venue in order to avoid a jury, who might jeopardize the chance of a conviction. The Congress, though on principle it did not believe in defence in British courts, promptly formed a defence committee, of which Jawaharlal was a member; and this committee engaged lawyers to appear for the defence. For the first time, and as a very special case, the Congress sanctioned Rs , for the defence, while Jawaharlal sought financial and other assistance from abroad. Indeed for months there was a widespread belief among the public, shared by both Motilal and Jawaharlal, that Jawaharlal himself would soon be arrested. In the long indictment of Communist activities made by the prosecution, the League against Imperialism was specially mentioned as one of the organizations inspired by the Communists; Jawaharlal\u2019s correspondence with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and others in Europe was regularly inter\u00ac cepted; and the Intelligence Bureau and the Home Department attached great importance to a faked letter from M. N. Roy, in which Jawaharlal was described as the \u2018liaison agent between Moscow and India\u2019. But after a careful examination of, his dossier, the prosecution concluded that there was insuf\u00ac ficient evidence against him. A number of letters received by Jawaharlal from abroad were* cited by the procecution, but they could find no letters written by him; and though his book on Soviet Russia was placed before the\n Note of H.G.

Mitter, junior prosecution counsel in the Meerut case, in Tba Sunday Standard,  December .\nTHE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE\nm\ncourt, it was realized that a charge based on that alone could hardly stand. The magistrate trying the case served notice on Jawaharlal to produce all the letters received by him from certain persons abroad. Jawahaiial's first reaction, approved by Gandhi, was to refuse, on the principle that the prosecution should not be helped in any way. Howeyer, on second thoughts which were dearly encouraged by his father, he replied that he had thrown away or destroyed those letters which he had received in his personal capacity; his correspondence as general secretary of the Congress was to be found in the official files, but these he could disdose only with the permission of the Congress. Motilal was concerned that a further order would follow which would result in a search of the Congress offices and the court securing the papers it wanted, and the locking up ofJawaharlal for six months. To my mind Jawahar will only himself ridiculous by both helping the govt to the fullest extent he can and going to jail for it.* But, in the event, Jawaharlal was only asked to certify that he had no personal correspondence in his possession. Jawaharlal did so, and |p avoid his being dted as a witness by the prosecution, Motilal advised the lawyers for the defence not to object to secondary evidence of those letters being produced. Later, when the prosecution wished to call Jawaharlal as* a court witness, the magistrate agreed that Jawaharlal seemed to be the re- presentative in India of the League against Imperialism, and his evidence would probably be illuminating; but calling him would not be worth while as it would mean unreasonable delay, and he was anxious that the arguments should begin. So Jawaharlal did not appear in the case, either as witness or as accused.\nThe lade of direct evidence and the desire to isolate the Communists from the general nationalist movement and not Motilal\u2019s alleged influence with the authorities, though m was doubtless greatly relieved, would seem to be the real reasons for the Government's obvious reluctance to drag Jawaharlal into the net. Gandhi, perceptive as usual, saw this from the start. \u2018It is quite like Jawahar\u2019, he wrote to the worried father, \u2018that he should give up smoking, a fine preparation to face Hailey. I do not know that Hailey will lay his hands upon Jawahar quite so easily as you think.* Though attracted by the ideology ofCommunism, Jawaharlal was not involved in the activities of the Communist Party. Not, as was dear from the names of quite a few who had been arrested, that the Government had any qualms about involving the innocent. As Jawaharlal is reported to have remarked on his first visit to Meerut jail, \u2018How little do these accused persons know about the Communist International.\nI know a lot more than they.\u2019 But the Government could secure little direct evidence implicating him, while the Communists themselves felt little accord\n'Motilal to Gandhi,  September , Motilal Nehru papers.\n\u2019Motilal to K.C.

The Communist assess\u00ac ment of Jawaharla! at this time was not left in doubt. A writer in the Comin\u00ac tern journal condemned the Independence for India League as superficial intelligentsia organization which in parts had already fascist tendencies\u2019 and described Jawaharlal as a person \u2018who promises all the blessings of socialism without a revolutionary struggle\u2019. Jawaharlal, wrote a British Communist, had\nformed an Independence of India League: and at the same time he is president of the Socialist League of Youth. The Independence of India League is a complete sham. The Socialist League of Youth is a more complete sham; it puts forward most wonderful slogans for Communism and the Dictatorshipof the Proletariat and takes no steps to achieve them. They are merely a means for getting support from the proletariat and for stemming the tide of the onward movement... It is dear that the British Government knows the difference between young Nehru and the Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 party, and that the latter cannot look over the hedge, where Jawahar Lai Nehru can steal a horse.\nFIVE\nIt was in this context that Jawaharlal found himself pitchforked by Gandhi and his father into the presidency of the Congress. Motilal had for long wanted his son to secure this high honour, and had discussed it with Gandhi even two years earlier. In  Gandhi had not been enthusiastic and, after consulting Jawaharlal who was then in Europe, had decided in favour of Ansari, in the hope that the latter would improve rdations between Hindus and Muslims.\n\u2022\nThings, as they are shaping in the Congress, confirm the opinion that it is not yet time for Jawaharlal to shoulder the burden. He is mo high-souled to stand the anarchy and hooliganism that seem to be grow\u00ac ing in the Congress, and it would be cruel to expect him to evolve order all of a sudden out of chaos. I am confident, however, that the anarchy will spend itself before long and the hooligans will themselves want a disciplinarian. Jawaharlal will come in then.\nThe next year Motilal renewed his suggestion and Gandhi was agreeable, but on this occasion theleaders of the Congress in Bengal, where the session was to\n* Muzaffar Ahmed to P.C.

Though the reasonsgiven were local, the real objection, as Jawaharlal saw it, was not youth or jealousy but fear of his radical ideas. In , ten Congress committees voted for Gandhi, five for Vallabhbhai Patel and only three for Jawaharlal. The general feeling was that he was still unseasoned for the presidency. Jawaharlal himself was unwilling.\nMy own personal inclination always is not to be shackled down to any office. I prefer to be free and to have the time to act according to my own indinations... I represent nobody but myself. I have not the politician\u2019s flair for forming groups and parties. My one attempt in this direction \u2014 theformationoftheIndependencefor IndiaLeaguelastyear \u2014 wasa hope\u00ac less failure so far as I was concerned ...

Thiskind of negative backing is hardlygood enough...\nIf I have the misfortune to be president you will see that the very people who put me there, or many of them, will be prepared to cast me to the wolves.\nBut Gandhi wrung consent out of him and then announced that the crown should be worn by Jawaharlal. Older men had had their innings, and it was but right that the young should be led into battle by one of themsdves. Gandhi added, with a candour that was not flattering to his victim, that his relations with the younger man were such that the latter\u2019s being in the chair was as good as Ik himself being in it. Again Jawaharlal begged Gandhi not to press his name,J while Motilal, much as he desired his son\u2019s election, pointed out to Gandhi that forcing Jawaharlal on the country against its will was unfair to both Jawaharlal and the country. * But Gandhi had made up his mind, and on  September  the AICC reluctantly elected Jawaharlal to preside over the next session at Lahore in December.\nSo circumstances, and Gandhi\u2019s will, were too strong for Jawaharlal. \u2018I have been quite dear in my own mind that my election as President would reduce my effectiveness in many directions. But fate has willed it otherwise and I fed in spite of my sdentific spirit and outlook that after all we are to some extentplaythings of fate.\u2019From the viewpoint of the older leaders, there was a great advantage in having in the chair the malleable founder of the inde\u00ac pendence movement; his opinions underwrote the genuineness of their inten*\n*To Syed Mahmud,  June .\n* See AICC File G  for -.\nUiMhitU to Gandhi.

On the other hand, Jawaharlal\u2019s colleagues in the League against Imperialism expected that he would use his position to split the Congress and carry the country with a fully revolutionary programme, i Only Jawaharlal knew his predicament, that he would be torn between his loyalty to Gandhi and the Congress organization on the one side, and his ideological leanings on the other. As he wrote to an old friend, \u2018I am afraid I shall have my work cut out for me to avoid losing all mycheerfulness and light-heartedness.\u2019\nThe testing-time was not long in coming. Jawaharlal was getting ready for civil disobedience. \u2018Already the blood tingles in the veins and the call to the field of action becomes louder and louder.\u2019 But the lines of battle were suddenly blurredbythe Viceroy\u2019s statement, on his return from Britain at the endofOcto\u00ac ber, that the British Government would meet representatives of British India and the Indian States for securing the greatest possible measure of agreement for the final proposals to be submitted to Parliament and that the natural issue of India\u2019s constitutional progress was the attainment of Dominion Status. This in itself meant nothing, but Gandhi was convinced of Lord Irwin\u2019s sincerity and associated the Congress with the Liberals and others in what he regarded as a reciprocation of this sincerity. The Delhi manifestooffered co-operation to the British provided the Government adopted a policyofgeneral conciliation, politi\u00ac calprisoners weregranted ageneral amnesty, progressive political organizations were adequately represented at the conference with the Congress being given predominance, and it was understood that the conference was not for discussing when Dominion Status was to be established but to frame a scheme of a Domi\u00ac nion constitution suitable for India\u2019s needs.\nDespite these provisos, however, the manifesto marked a retreat by the Con\u00ac gress. Far from preparing for a struggle for independence, or even from insisting on a full acceptance of the Nehru Report, it was, under Gandhi\u2019s guidance, thinking in terms of negotiations with the British Government without the latter making any precise commitments beforehand. Jawaharlal fought hard, if he could not secure rejection of the Viceroy\u2019s proposals, at least to stiffen the terms offered by the Congress: but he failed, and then, to the surprise of his friends, signed the manifesto. Subhas Bose,who had refused to sign, saw in this the triumph of Gandhi\u2019s personality over Jawaharlal\u2019s principles. \u2019Jawaharlal has nowgiven up Independence at the instanceof the Mahatma.\u2019 In fact, Jawa\u00ac harlal had not changed his views but was persuaded to sign by appeals to his sense of discipline.

And yet I suppose there can be too much of dis\u00ac cipline. Something seems to have snapped inside me evening before last and I am unable to piece it together.' * \nHowever, Gandhi, Motilal, Ansari and others persuaded Jawaharlal to hold his hand, mainly on the ground that he could rely on the British not to accept the four provisos stipulated by the Congress;  and on  November the Work\u00ac ing Committee, while confirming the Delhi manifesto, revised Gandhi\u2019s draft resolution to say, obviously to placate Jawaharlal, that it should be clearly understood that this confirmation would only hold till the next session of the Congress. Jawaharlal was greatly relieved. 'It is clear enough that there is not an outside chance of the British Government acceding to the four conditions laid down, so that even moderate Congressmen will have no alternative left except to stick to independence.\u2019 By giving some rope to those who favoured a compromise, the ground for the coming struggle'Was being better prepared. The Government, even if they could not accept the Nehru Report, could still perhaps have retained Gandhi's co-operation by somegesture such as the release of prisoners; for to Gandhi, as Hailey observed, Dominion Status was not a constitutional objective but a frame of mind, \u2018a general kind of political kiss- in-the ring\u2019. But imagination was not among the virtues of Irwin\u2019s Government, and by the middleof December Gandhi was thinking in terms of befog in prison by January. When he and Motilal met the Viceroy along with Sapru, Jinnah and Vithalbhai Patel on  December, the break was dear. Gandhi announced that unless the establishment of Dominion Status could be presumed as an immediate result of the conference he could not attend; not Parliament but India ought to frame India\u2019s future. He added that he doubted the sincerity of British purpose broadly, though he recognized that of individuals; and the Viceroy replied that there was obviously no common ground.

He had had his way by yielding in the first instance. The hope of the officials that the Viceroy\u2019s statement might split the Congress had been defeated. But though Jawaharlal^ nationalist followers in India now had no grievance, he had still to contend with his radical friends abroad. Convinced by the frequent references to the League against Im\u00ac perialism in the Central Assembly during the debates ori\u2019fhe Public Safety Bill and by the proceedings at Meerut that the Government was making a dead set against the League, Jawaharlal took much trouble during the summer of  to prove to the public that the League was not a Communist organization, even though many Communists belonged to it, but rather an association to establish contacts between all movements throughout the world which supported the struggle against imperialism. If a broader and more international vision was gradually animating the Congress, this was the direct consequence of its asso\u00ac ciationwiththeLeague. Communists were undoubtedly the strongest opponents of imperialism and as such their co-operation was welcome to all nationalists. They need not be treated as untouchables. Co-operation with them \u2014 as with imperialist powers other than the British like the United States \u2014 was possible when interests coincided, though this co-operation should be on one\u2019s own terms. But Jawaharlal was certain that in no sense did Communists dominate the League. Nor was the Congress, which was merely associated with the League, bound by every resolution orprogramme of that organization.\nThis confidence of Jawaharlal was shaken by the end of the year when he heard that the Communists had taken over the central apparatus of the League and muzzled non-Communists like James Maxton. Clearly he himself would have ik> place in the League, and the organization as he had conceived it, the grand all-party alliance between the forces of national freedom and social equal\u00ac ity, had collapsed. So it caused him no great concern that those now in charge of the League disapproved of his acceptance of the Delhi manifesto.\nIt is a fundamental political error to think that unity in the Congress is more important than the vital interests of the masses. After having risen to be the undoubted leader of the youth of the country and to enjoy even the confidence of the working masses, you seem in a moment of inexpli\u00ac cable weakness and mental confusion to have left your followers in the lurch.\nPossibly Jawaharlal was rationalizing his weakness and proneness to what Subhas Bose termed 'sentimental politics\u2019 into a claim to superior tactics and\n See, for example.

Chattopadhyaya to Jawaharlal,  December .\nTHE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE\n\ntopermitting events so to develop as to stress the unavoidainiityofa dash with the Government; but in doing so he was certainly not distressed by the rebukes of the Communists. Rather, he would seem to have been reinforced in his con\u00ac viction that the political struggle for freedom demanded the first priority, and that in this,the leadership of Gandhi was the most powerful individual factor. Future success seemed to him to lie in acceptance of this ipther than in co\u00ac operation with the Communists. And his first ill-fated experiment of working with the Communists suggested to him that equal co-operation with them was not to be too easily taken for granted.\nSo the decks were dear, and Jawaharlal was free to act as he chose, neither held back by his moderate colleagues nor pushed off course by his erstwhile friends of theleft. In the lastweek of November, before his gamble had paid off, he presided at Nagpur over the annual session of the All-India Trade Union Congress. Elected the previous year in his absence, Jawaharlal had agreed to serve because, although he had no experience of trade unionism, he realized the importanceof awakening industrial labour to the national cause. But during his year in office fie could hardly devote himsdf to this effort in education. While the Government, by their legislation and summary arrests and trials, mounted a massive attack against the whole labour movement, the latter was riven by sharp differences between the Communists and the rest; and Jawaharlal had to toil hard \u2014 aftd, as it proved, in vain \u2014 merely to hold the movement to\u00ac gether. The moderates in the Trade Union Congress, led by the general secre\u00ac tary, N. M. Joshi, were anxious to isolate labour from political currents in India and abroad and to improve working conditions in industry by co-operating with' the Government. Jawaharlal, of course, reacted instinctively against this, and in consequence was regarded as acting in accord with the Communists. Jawa\u00ac harlal feared that a split was inevitable, but sought not to precipitate it. How\u00ac ever, the advent to office of the British Labour Party in the summer of  strengthened the moderate trade unionists in their eagerness to co-operate, and increased the differences within the movement. Jawaharlal was requested by the radicals to accept the presidentcy of the largest railway trade union, that of the Great Indian Peninsular in Bombay, which was dominated by the Com\u00ac munists, and although he already had as much work as he could manage he was willing to consider acceptance if it would help in securing a compromise. The fact that the Communists were criticizing Jawaharlal as one of the \u2018dangerous enemies of labour\u2019might have been expected to make his name acceptable to conservative trade unionists; but in fact the suggestion fell through.\nThe criticism itself was obviously unjustified. Jawaharlal was primarily involved in politics, and his basic loyalty was to the Congress; and that was, of\n\u2018jawaharlal to C.B. John.  July .

But in problems concerning theworkers, therewas nodoubt as to where his sympathies lay; and in the strug\u00ac gle for trade union leadership, he threw his weight against the moderates. To the chagrin ofthese men,whowished to co-operate with the RoyalCommission on Labour appointed by the Government, Jawaharlal publicly called for a boycott.! There was such acrimony that Jawaharlal thought of resigning the presidency, but decided that, with the year drawing to its dose, it was not worth while.\nItwas in this atmosphere of dissension, with both sides so suspidous of each other that they sparred fiercdy even on such trivial issues as the dates of meet\u00ac ings, that the Trade Union Congress met for its annual session. Jawaharlal\u2019s addresswas wholly acceptable to neither faction, but true to himself. He placed the responsibility for the miserable condition of the Indian workeron the system which was the natural outcome of capitalism and imperialism, and called on labour to join the national movement in its fight against imperialism even while it sought to recruit nationalists in its own struggle against capitalism. The real problem was the conquest ofpower, theoverthrow of both the fordgn ruler and the exploiting employer, and the goal was a socialist order of sodety in which the interests of the workers were supreme and the sources ofwealth were owned by the community and not by individuals.\nAll this was most pleasing to the Communists in his audience, but then Jawaharlal condudedwiththesuggestion that the Trade Union Congress should affiliate itself to neither the Second nor the Third International. The Second International was disliked by Jawaharlal because it was mainly preoccupied with the fight not against capitalism but against Communism; but the Third Inter\u00ac national had for Jawaharlal its own drawbacks. Personally he was a staunch admirerof thegeneral trend of policy in the Soviet Union; that country, despite all its heavy blunders and many sins, still held out, more than any other country, the bright promise of a better day to the world at large and to the worker espedally.\nWith all my sympathy for the Communist view point, however, I must confess that I do not appredate many of their methods. The history of the past few years in China and elsewhere has shown that these methods have failed and often brought reaction in their train. To affiliate with the Third International must mean an adoption of their methods in their entirety. I do not think this is desirable for us.\nThese sentences the moderates applauded. But if they saw in this rejection oftheleadershipofMoscow an indication that thepresident would support them in the wrangles of detail, they were soon disillusioned. Indeed, his only positive\n* Statement,  September , S.W., vol. . pp. -. * '\nTo Bakhale,  September , AICC File  oI .\nTHE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE\n\nact shifted the bias of the whole session. For by his pasting vote Jawaharlal re\u00ac cognized the Gimi Kamgar (Red Flag) Union of the textile workers in Bomba/ as having a membership of,, thusgiving it and the G.I.P. Railway Union, both controlled by the Communists, a majority, under the constitution of the Trade Union Congress, in the open sessions. Otherwise, he sat silent at the meetings of the Executive Committee while resolutions were passed rejecting the Nehru Report, condemning the Delhi manifesto, favouring independence as against Dominion Status, demanding the establishment of a workers' repub\u00ac lic and calling for affiliation with the League against Imperialism. The fact that he and the Congress were still committed to negotiations for Dominion Status does not seem to have bothered him, while his inner hesitations about the League found no expression. It was not so much that Jawaharlal saw his role as president to be akin to that of a figurehead as that, whatever his public posture, he privately approved of most of these decisions. He also made no strong effort tQ prevent the* secession of the moderates and the formation of a separate All- India Trade Union Federation.\nIf at Nagpur Jawaharlal had to connive at the rejection of policies to which he was still officially committed, at Lahore at the end of the year he was utterly unshackled. Riding, with his sense of theatre, on a white charger in the Con\u00ac gress procession, he fitted to perfection, as Gandhi had prophesied, the role of the young Galahad of revolt. The Congress was by now committed to indepen\u00ac dence and to dvil disobedience. The Viceroy, it is said, had at one stage considered banning the session, but finally decided not to interfere. Such action, even if ostensibly in the interestsof maintaining law and order in the city, would have been foolhardy. There was, as an impartial eye-witness noted, no spirit of animosity to the British but a love of India, confidence in their leaders \u2018and a new spirit of sacrifice dominant in their thought even to the point of suffering and loss'. The same conclusion was reached by an English observer who was normally an ardent Imperialist: \u2018The present movement is a deep all-India affair. It's no use pretending that it is the concern of the Indian \u201cIntelligentsia\u201d ,.. Time and education can only intensify the feeling of thinking Indians for India: and the love for the idea ofIndia is one of the finest, and also one of the most incalculable forces in the country.\u2019 Jawaharlal's speech was attuned to this atmosphereofdefiance and rebellion. He had begun to draft his presidential address about the tenth of December, but even then he could write with the full knowledge that the talks with the Viceroy had no prospect of success^\nJawaharlal put the Indian problem in its international context.

It appeared to be a dissolving period of history, when the world was in labour, and outof her travail wouldgive birth to a new order. In this Asia and even India would play a determining part, for the brief day of European domination was already approaching its end and the future lay with America and Asia. But if India had a message to give to the world, she had also much to learn and receive from other peoples.\nThen, reverting to India, Jawaharlal pointed out that though her social struc\u00ac ture had proved to be wonderfully stable, it had failed in one vital particular: it had found no solution for the problem of equality and in fact had deliberately based itselfon inequality. But a solution based on thegenius of the Indian people and on India\u2019s thought and culture had to be found if the political and social structure was to have any stability and the discords between the various com\u00ac munities were to disappear. And this led Jawaharlal to plead for the faith and generosity which would remove fear and suspicion between the communities.\n... by right of birth I shall venture to submit to the leaders of the Hindus that it should be their privilege to take the leadin generosity. \u2019 That was not only good morals but often good politics and sound expediency. The time was coming soon when such labels as Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs would have little meaning* and when struggles would be on an economic basis. Till then it mattered little what mutual arrangementsweremade, provided only that barriers in the wayoffuture progress were not built up.\nThe British army of occupation, Jawaharlal went on, held India in its iron grip, and thewhipof the master was ever ready to comedownon the best of them who raised their heads. The answer to the Calcutta resolution had been clear and definite. Only by the greatest stretch of imaginatidh could the Viceroy\u2019s statement be interpreted as a possible response, but he and others like him had signed the Delhi manifesto because even an outside chance of honourable peace had to be taken before launching on a national struggle. But now they had but one goal \u2014 independence, complete freedom from British domination, which alone could lead to world co-operation and an international community of equals. The British Empirewas certainly not such agroup; it could not be a true commonwealth so long as imperialism was its basis and the exploitation of other races its chief means of sustenance. In'any such group, India\u2019s position was bound to be oneof subservience. Out of imperialism and capitalism peace could never come, and because the British Empire Stood for these and based itself on the exploitation of the masses Indiacould find nowilling place in it. Many of the problems India had to face were the problems of vested interests, mostly created or encouraged by the British Government; and so long as the British Empire continued, in whatever shape, in India it would strengthenthese vested interests and create more.\nThe controversy about the relative merits of independence and Dominion Status was to Jawaharlal really a question about the conquest of power, and he did not think that any form of Dominion Status applicable to India would trans\u00ac fer real power. A test of this power would be the entire withdrawal of the alien army of occupation and of its economic control. India demanded the fullest\nTHE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE \nfreedom. They were very conscious of their weakness, but let no one underrate the strength of their resolve. There would be no turning back. Agreat nation could not be thwarted for long when once its mind was made up.\n\u2018I must frankly confess\u2019, Jawaharlal continued, 'that I am a Socialist and a republican, and am no believer in kings and princes, or in the order which pro* duces the modern kings of industry, who have greater power over the lives and fortunes ofmen than even the kings of old, and whose methods are as predatory as those of the old feudal aristocracy.\u2019 He acknowledged that the Congress, as it *was then constituted, might not be able to adopt a full socialistic programme, but the philosophy of socialism had gradually permeated the entire structure of society the world over, and almost the only points in dispute were the pace and the methods of advance. India too would have to go that way if she wished to end poverty and inequality, though she might evolve her own methods and adapt the ideal to her own genius.\nOn the two particular problems of India, the minorities and the states, Jawaharlal had little that was startlingly new to say. He wanted the minorities to begiven the fullest assurances that their culture and traditions would be safe. The princes were the products of a vicious system which would ultimately have to go. Only the people of the states could determine the future of those areas, and while the Congress was perfectly willing to confer with such rulers as were prepared to do so and to devise means for smoothing the transition, in no event could thepeopleof thestates be ignored. But, as regards the problem of peasantry and labour, Jawaharlal asked the Congress to commit itself to ending the domination of any one class over another, and to draw up a programme of such changes as could be immediately put into operation. Paternalism and trustee\u00ac ship were both equally barren theories. The least that every worker in field or factory was entitled to was a minimum wage and humane hours of labour; and in the long.term the Congress should strive for workers\u2019 control of industry on a co-operative basis and for a system of peasant proprietorship.\nThe immediate problem, however, was the conquest of power, and the forg\u00ac ing of sanctions to enforce the national will. The Congress had not the material or the training for organized violence, and individual and sporadic violence was a confession of despair.\nThe great majority of us, I take it, judge the issue not on moral but on practical grounds, and if we reject the way of violence it is because it pro\u00ac mises no substantial results. But if this Congress or the nation at any future time comes to the conclusion that methods of violence will rid us of slavery then I have no doubt that it will adopt them. Violence is bad, but slavery is far worse.\nGandhi himself had said that it was better to fight than to refuse to fight out of cowardice. But except in times of organized revolt, all mass movements must necessarily be peaceful. The basic idea of non-co-operation must remain, but\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nJawaharlaJ did not think it wise to declare a boycott of schools and law courts at the very start. Theprogramme should be one of political and economic boy\u00ac cott, the reduction of all points of contact with the British Government. This would release energy and direct attention to the real struggle, whichshould take the shape of non-payment of taxes and, where possible, general strikes. It was now an Open Conspiracy, which everyone should join, to free the country from foreign rule.\nThe presidential address shows both the strength and the weakness of Jawaharlal at this stage. His impatient and full-blooded eagerness for freedom was manifest. He had no use for political compromise. He wished to eject the British from India and thereafter cut his country off from the British Empire. In the campaign of civil disobedience which was to begin he accepted.the leader\u00ac ship of Gandhi, but made it clear that he accepted non-violence as a technique rather than as a moral end in itself, and did not rule out the adoption of violent methods at any future time. There was still very much of the romantic in Jawaharlal; he was still, beneath the added maturity and sophistication, the emotional nationalist of the early twenties. The impact of ideology to which he had been exposed during his stay in Europe in  and  could be dearly seen, but it was not deep absorption. With courage he announced that he was a socialist and a republican, but it was courage tinged with apology. The social- ism which he envisaged was clearly of a mild and timid variety, and he spoke of India evolving her own methods and adjusting it to her traditions. There was little here of forthright Marxism or of the scientific socialism of which he had heard so much in Europe. He was groping more in the direction of Utopian, Gandhian socialism,.though he went on to criticize the concepts of trusteeship. Similarly, while he realized that the basic problem in India was an economic one and communal troubles were artificial, he spoke of finding an interim solu\u00ac tion which would be typically Indian. The confusion of thought was probably the result of a dislike of precise choice, an instinctive rductance to abandon Indian ways even while his mind turned away from them, and the feeling of a lack of immediacy about these matters. They all had to give way to the conquest of power, and for this the Congress was the obvious instrument. He added almost in the same breath as his assertion of his personal credo that he did not expect the Congress, with its predominantly middle-class composition, to agree with him or to adopt a revolutionary programme. His loyalty to the Congress being unreserved, this could only mean that, while he would not abandon his principles, he would be willing to keep them in abeyance. His extremism in objectives did not carry with it an intensity of purpose and method. So, while the leader-writers of the British and the Indian press threw up their hands in horror at this enthronement by the sedate Congress of a seeming revolutionary, for Gandhi therewas no dismay. Hedid not forget that the author of this radical address rfas also a signatory of the Delhi manifesto and tl&t to Jawaharlal\nTHE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE \ndiscipline was more important than revolution and political freedom took priority over economic and social change. There was little to fear from a man whom Gandhi described as a confirmed socialist who wanted for his country only what it could manage, a practical statesman who tempered his ideals to suit his surroundings. On the other hand, it was worth having in the chair a figure of glamour and integrity who would keep captive within the Congress his wide following among the students and the intelligentsia. During the next ten years, no single individual did more to build in the Congress an awareness of economic issues; but Jawaharlal was also the best shield of the Congress against left-wing groups and organizations.\ni Young Action \u2014 and Anti-Climax\nAfter the Lahore Congress, however, Jawaharlal* could push aside these nagging problems of the gap between thought and practice and devote himself happily to action. He had, at a moving ceremony on the banks of the Ravi, unfurled the flag of independence; and on New Year\u2019s Eve he danced round the flagpole. The Congress now urged its members to work exclusively towards the attainment of independence. It also authorized the AICC, when\u00ac ever it deemed fit, to start a programme of civil disobedience, including the non-payment of taxes, in selected areas or all over the country and under whatever safeguards it considered necessary; but in fact this meant that full direction in the tactics of struggle was left to Gandhi.\nWhile Gandhi brooded over the best means of initiating the battle, Jawahar\u00ac lal, as president, was engrossed in mobilizing the forces, though he expected to be arrested at any moment. In fact, the Punjab Government had suggested prosecuting Jawaharlal for his Lahore address, but the Government of India preferred to wait and watch developments, leaving the initiative to the Congress. * So Jawaharlal was free to organize the celebration throughout India of  January as Independence Day, when everyone was called upon to take the independence pledge drafted by Gandhi and Jawaharlal. The latter had directed that this should be done in the morning, at the time of the unfurling of the national flag, with a procession and a public meeting later in the day; but Gandhi vetoed processions and speeches. He was anxious not to precipitate a crisis till he was ready to commence civil disobedience. The Government, on their part, as anxious to avoid a clinch, did not prohibit the meetings. On the actual day, the response seemed to the Congress spectacular, while the Government preferred to believe that outside the\n To A. C. Bombwal.  June , Nehru papers.

The inriA>n\u00bb at Bombay on the th, when some mill-workers sought to displace the natinnal tricolour with the red flag, coming in the wake of continuous efforts by the League against Imperialism to ridicule the Congress and its leadership, dearly infuriated Jawaharlal. \u2018It seems to be a ddiberate policy of Gommunists to be offensive. As a matter of fact there are very few real Gommunists in India. Many people who pose as such are British agents.* He informed the League and its supporters in India in no uncertain terms that the Congress would not allow its ranks to be weakened by the Communists. While the Congress was willing to co-operate with Communists or to be assodated with any anti\u00ac imperialist organization, in no event would it take orders from the League or be associated with it if that were going t function as a purely Communist organization. Never had the Congress been,more advanced in its views, both political and social, and to attack its leaders without the least knowledge of conditions in India at a moment when they had begun a great revolutionary struggle was in effect to hdp the British Government. Jawaharlal also re\u00ac quested the League to accept his resignation from its Executive Council if the position of non-Cocnmunists in the League were not clarified.\nHaving done what he could to answer the Communist critics, Jawaharlal sought to ensure the support of the minorities, and especially the Muslims, for the Congress cause. Leading Muslim Congressmen, including Ansari, Tassaduq Sherwani and Khaliquzzaman (but with the honourable exception of Azad), disliked the non-co-operation campaign,* and gave priority to the building of communal harmony. In the Working Committee, which met on  February, Syed Mahmud asserted that the Muslims as a whole were indif\u00ac ferent to the struggle and he feared that civil disobedience would rapidly, with official encouragement, degenerate into Hindu-Muslim riots. Gandhi was re\u00ac ported to have replied that he realized this danger but it could not be helped. They had to march ahead, as there was no other alternative. Till now they had failed in achieving Hindu-Muslim unity because they had been working on\nStatement of Jawaharlal,  January, Tb\u00a7 Tribune,  January ; Home Department's telegram to Secretary of State,  February , cited in S.

This would also sterilize the third party, the British. But Jawaharlal was more sensitive than Gandhi or his father to the fears of the minorities and recommended assurances that under no circumstaQces would any coercion or repression of these communities be tolerated and, in fact, favoured treatment in economic matters would be guaranteed. Political repre\u00ac sentation should also be on economic lines, as this would fit in far more with modern conditions and do away automatically with communal electorates. The Nehru Report had lapsed, but its non-controversial parts were still binding on the Gongress; and Jawaharlal hoped that its role in the fight for freedom would convince all of its bonafides.\nMeanwhile, the Working Committee authorized Gandhi to start civil dis\u00ac obedience as and when he desired, and advocated, once the mass movement had started, a boycott of law courts and schools. By now Gandhi had at last seen his way ahead, and decided to march to the sea and violate the salt laws. Jawaharlal had not been enamoured of the eleven points earlier put forward by Gandhi. Prohibition, reduction of land revenue, military expenditure and high salaries, abolition of the salt tax, lowering of the exchange ratio of the rupee, licences for firearms, tariffs on foreign textiles, reservation of coastal shipping, a political amnesty and abolition of the secret police had seemed to him to comprise a tame definition of independence. He himself had been thinking in terms of public ownership of the principal industries, peasant proprietorship, annulment of agricultural indebtedness, a minimum wage, a steeply graduated income tax, high death duties, and no indirect taxation. But law-breaking was invigorating in itself, and his support for Gandhi now was without any mental reservation. \u2018How I wish I could join your gallant band or at least could see it start off bravely on the morning of the th.\u2019 Gandhi\u2019s march to the sea at Dandi, with a small group of tough and disciplined men and women, has a high place, as fact and as legend, in the history of the Indian freedom movement and, indeed, of freedom in the world. The challenge gripped the imagination in India and beyond, and the refusal of Irwin\u2019s Government to arrest Gandhi in the belief that the march would evoke no response showed how little they were aware of the true situation. Thousands lined the route, large meetings were held at every halting-place, and many village and district officials resigned, while the rest of India was enthralled by every detail of Gandhi\u2019s progress. Jawaharlal with a few friends went down to Gujarat and marched with Gandhi for one stage, and the impression left on him was profound and permanent. Over twenty years later he wrote;\n Gandhi to Ansari,  February, and Motilal to Ansari,  February , Ansari papers.\n The Problem of Minorities',  March , reprinted in Young India,  May .\n)Resolution at meeting of U P.

Jawaharlal appealed especially to the young to be ready to jump into the fray, and persuaded the Congress committee in his own province to look ahead and organize wherever possible a campaign for non-payment of land revenue or rent. Hetoured intensively in the villages and was filled with confi\u00ac dence by the spirit among the peasants.\nThere is no doubt that India is awake and astir and we are going to give a good fight to the British Government.

He himself took charge of the campaign in Allahabad district.*As there was no possibility here of manufacturing salt, technical breaches were organized for inviting arrest. On the th he sold packets of contraband salt in the city*and the next day he and his wife led a large proces&on and collected salt from a special kind of earth brought in for the purpose.

More worrying to the Government was his activity in the Rae Bareli district and the formation of associations among the tenants for non-payment of rent. On the th, while on his way to Raipur to attend a local Congress conference, Jawaharlal was arrested at Cheoki, a few miles outside Allahabad, tried in Naini jail and sentenced to six months\u2019 simple imprisonment for assisting in the manufacture of salt on  April.\nGreat Day!' Jawaharlal wrote in his pocket diary the day the prison gates shut on him. He was placed in solitary confinement in a barrack reserved for dangerous prisoners and surrounded by a circular wall nearly fifteen feet high. To Jawaharlal this gave a greater sense of captivity than any rectangular en\u00ac closure; for, apart from creating a feeling of being closed in, it cut off a good bit of the sky in the day and the stars at night \u2014 the sight of which was one of Jawaharlal\u2019s chief pleasures in prison. \u2018What a terrible waste of brick and mortar,\u2019 he wrote in his diary, \u2018just to deprive people of their liberty! A very decent, large-sized house could be built out of the materials of my particular wall only.\u2019\nJawaharlal had been placed in the \u2018A\u2019 class, which meant that once a fortnight he could have one interview, write one letter and receive one. As a special concession, he was allowed to sleep outside his cell, but his bed was chained to the wall to prevent it beinj^used for scaling the wall. He could also receive two weeklies, one in English and the other in Hindi, but no daily newspapers. A fellow-prisoner was deputed to cook for him, and he was in addition permitted to receive food and fruit from home. He was also allotted some servants to work the punkha fan. But Jawaharlal chafed at these privileges, especially as news reached him that others in prison for salt satyagraha were being treated harshly. So he dispensed with the punkha boys, and wrote to the jail superintendent, much against his father\u2019s wishes, that he did not desire any special treatment. Told in reply that it was always open to him not to utilize these privileges, he returned some sweets sent from home and asked that no more fruit be sent.\nEven the weekly budget of news that trickles through the massive walls and iron gates of Naini prison, by means of the Hindi Bharat, is enough to give some idea of happenings outside. Frequent firings, assaults, martial law, flogging of boys, imprisonment of women and so on and so forth denote a state of affairs that is very far from normal, and in this siate it is difficult for me to accept with pleasure dainty articles of food. The very sight of these dainties has the reverse of an agreeable effect on me. If Naini prison prevents me from doing something when barbarities are\nbailey to Hirtzel,  May , Hailey papers, vol. .\nEntry # April . *\n* May .\nACTION\u2014AND ANTI CLIMAX\n\nbeing committed all over the country, at least I cannot hold high festival here.\nHe decided to have two light, simple meals and no more, and as a result often went hungry.\nWorse than the hunger, however, was the boredom. Life in prison was about as uneventful as that of the average turnip.\nThe object of jail appears to be first to remove such traces of huma\u00ac nity as a man might possess, and then to subdue even the animal element in him so that ultimately he might become the perfect vegetable! Soil- bound, cut off from the world and its activity, nothing to look forward to, blind obedience the only \u2018virtue\u2019 that is instilled, and spirit con\u00ac sidered the great sin \u2014 is it any wonder that the prisoner approximates to the plant?\nTo evade this ennui, Jawaharlal organized his life to a rigorous schedule. Up with the dawn, after a run of about a mile beside the main prison wall and a brisk walk for the same distance, Jawaharlal spent the remainder of the day mostly in spinning, weaving and reading. Since at first he was not allowed a charka, Jawaharlal, keen on some form of manual labour, took up newar weavk ing and continued it even later. But as a disciplined Congressman his main interest was in hand-spinning.\nJawaharlal was allowed only six books at a time, and there was some uncertainty as to whether this included reference works and dictionaries and whether a multi-volume work counted as one book or more. So Jawaharlal had to give up the idea of continuing his letters to Indira, tracing the history of man. In , when she was in Mussoorie and he was wandering in the plains, he had written to her giving in brief outline the origins of the earth, the beginnings of life and human prehistory. He had got as far as the forma\u00ac tion of classes, the development of organized religion and the coming of the Aryans, when he had been forced by the stress ofpublic affairs to discontinue. Now, in prison, though time was not lacking, he needed more books and probably even missed the inspiration: my mind was too full of the making of history, as it was being made from day to day in India, for me to think of the dead past.\u2019 But he read much and made copious notes; and the books he read disclose the spreading range of his interests.

It was broken from the start by the presence of numerous convict warders and orderlies, ostensibly intended to attend on him but also used to keep a watch on him, and not allowed to mix with other prisoners lest they carry messages. But in fact a large number of other warders and servants also came daily for darshan and to discuss swaraj. Convicts smuggled in flowers, and his punkha coolie, who was not a convict, brought him a few little mangoes almost daily. \u2019They are not up to much,\u2019 wrote Jawaharlal, much moved, \u2018but the gift is worthy of the Gods. The man is very poor.\u2019 Officials of the jail and the town also called on him frequently. A month after his arrest, another Congressman arrested for civil disobedience was placed in the same barrack. But it was the arrival of Motilal Nehru and Syed Mahmud on  June that disrupted the placid routine of Jawaharlal\u2019s life. Looking after his father became now his main preoccupation, till both father and son were soon drawn, even from within jail, into political negotiations.\nJawaharlal, despite the taboo on discussion of politics at interviews and the denial of newspapers, had been kept fairly well and quickly informed of events outside by the warders and later arrivals in prison. \u2018Peshawar occurrences' runs the entry in the pocket diary for  April, revealing that the solitary prisoner had heard and been thrilled by the knowledge that the Government had virtually lost control of that city. What particularly delighted Jawaharlal was the fact that the inhabitants of the N.W.F.P. were predominantly Muslim, and by their revolt had belied the foreboding that the Muslims would keep aloof from the movement. The news of the spread and intensification of civil dis\u00ac obediencewasindeed so exciting that Jawaharlal fretted inhis idleness and could not sleep. On  May he heard that Gandhi had been arrested in far-off Bombay a few hours earlier, and was well pleased. 'Ca marche bien. It is full-blooded war to the bitter end. Good.\u2019 Nothing, he thought, would be more unfortunate than any premature compromise.\nThis attitude ensured from the start that the effort of the professional media\u00ac tors, Sapru and Jayakar, to negotiate a settlement between the Government and the Congress was bound to fail. Jawaharlal held all Liberals in contempt and minced no words in his diary:\n'Speech to the Foreign Press Association, New Delhi,  March .\nDiar$ entry  May . *\n'Diary entry,  May .\n May .\nACTION\u2014AND ANTI-CLIMAX\n\nSome of the moderates are waking up, but some behave like old women \u2014 weeping and howling and feeling terribly oppressed about everything! TheLeader is evidently among the weeping widows. If they have not got gumptionenough to do anything why do they not shut up? It is enough to sicken one to hear them sing the praises of Irwin and Benn and co! It is difficult to imagine agreater dope at the political game than the moderate in India. Nothing could condemn British rule in India more than the amazing product of it!\nSo he was taken aback when some slack statements to a British journalist by Gandhi and Motilal were picked up by the two leading Liberals as a basis for a settlement atatimewhenbothcivil disobedienceand the Government's attempts to crush it were in full fury. Armed with some general platitudes from the Viceroy, they saw Gandhi in Yeravda jail and found him in what they felt to be a co-operative mood. In fact, however, while Gandhi sounded accommodating on the constitutional issue, he had clearly not given his whole mind to it and insisted that Jawaharlal's should be the final voice So the peacemakers pro\u00ac ceeded to Naini prison to interview the Nehrus.\nLot of time was wasted in listening to what Irwin said and Jinnah did and Fazl-i Husain intrigued. Nothing important or hopeful. Bapu\u2019s note disappointing although it is dear that even that will not be acceptable to the Viceroy. We have not suggested anything. Have said that without full consultation with colleagues, especially Gandhiji, we cannot make any suggestion. Wehave not committed ourselves in any way although we have hinted at a stiff attitude. I have been worried however for last two or three days. I wish wehaddefinitely stopped all talk of 'peace'. It is harmful and diverts attention. There is no peace anywhere in sight.\nHowever, theimpressionoftheover-optimistic negotiatorswasverydifferent. Sapru reported to the Viceroy.'\nMuch to our agreeable surprise we found Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in quite a reasonable frame of mind yesterday. Both he and his father gave us a very patient and courteous hearing. On the constitutional issue however we did not find our task with them so easy as we had found with Mr. Gandhi, whereas*on the question of salt and the  points of Mr. Gandhi on which he had laid so much stress at' Poona we did not find them in complete agreement with Mr. Gandhi.\n Gandhi to Motilal,  July , Tba Bombay Cbronicla,  September .\nGandhi was addressed as 'Bapu' or 'father' by Jawaharlal and many others.\n Diary entry,  August .

Though Jawaharlal had not been very keen, Motilal had said that they had no objection, and a special train sped them across the country to see Gandhi. Meanwhile, Jayakar, who had taken the letter to Gandhi and seen him alone, was confident that Gandhi was anxious for a settlement.\nBut the talks of Gandhi and the Nehrus with Sapru and Jayakar came to nothing. The Congress stated its terms precisely and stiffly to be a complete national government with the right of secession and reference of all British claims to an independent tribunal. These terms would obviously not be accept\u00ac able to the Government; and though the indefatigable Sapru and Jayakar continued their \u2018silly peace negotiations\u2019 and shuttled between Simla, Naini and Poona, no one shared their illusory hopes of a compromise. What, indeed, struck the Secretary of State was \u2018Gandhi's deference to Jawaharlal and Jawa- harlal\u2019s pride in what had been achieved as well as his declaration of belief in non-violence. It was the apparent pride which depressed me, because it did not show the spirit of a beaten man.'\nA few days later, Motilal was released on grounds of ill-health, and Jawaharlal\u2019s own term of six months was drawing to a dose. But the U.P. Government had no intention of leaving him at large for long. Nor did Jawaharlal expect it. Released on  October, he promptly resumed the Con\u00ac gress presidency, thereby, as the organization had been outlawed; rendering himself liable to artest, and he then directed all the provincial committees to launch a fresh offensive. The manufacture of salt and the boycott of British goods, especially cloth, which formed the backbone of the movement, should be vigorously sustained, and in addition efforts should be made to initiate no-tax campaigns as in Gujarat.\n. It is clear that India, big as it is, is not big enough to contain both the Indian people and the British Government. Oneof the two has to go and there can be little doubt as to which this is going to be... we are in deadly earnest, we have burnt our boats, we have taken the great resolve and there is no going back for us. \u2022 July .\n*Sapru to Jayakar,  August , Sapru papers J .\nJayakar to Sapru,  August , Sapru papers J .\n\"Hailey to General Shea,  August , Hailey papers, vol. .\nWedgwood Benn to Irwin,  September , Halifax papers, vol. .\n Hailey, Governor, to Crerar, Home Member,  October , Home Dept.

Though, on the face of it, this involved all sections of society, landowners, tenants and professional classes, in the political struggle against the Government, basically it was a call to the peasant tillers not to pay rent to the landlords; and its explosive nature lay in its rousing class conflict and spreading it to the countryside. The next day he was arrested, tried for sedition and incitement to manufacture of salt and non-payment of taxes, and sentenced to two years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment plus five months in default of fines. He had been out of prison for less than ten days.\nDenied the artistry of action, Jawaharlal reverted to the regular tenor of Naini life. A pain in the shoulder prevented him from much spinning and newar weaving. But the insatiable reading was taken up again. He re-read Radhakrishnan\u2019s Hindu View of Life, and made notes from, among others, Trotsky, Shaw, Maeterlinck, Kropotkin and Keyserling. He also recommenced his letters to his daughter, basing himself on his memory and his notebooks, for by now it was clear that ahead lay many years in prison \u2014 indeed he would only be able to write in prison \u2014 and if he hoped for the help of reference books he would never write at all. But his sense of wonder had led him to amass a great deal of odd information. Over these letters Jawaharlal took much trouble, collecting his thoughts on paper and then organizing them lucidly to suit a girl of thirteen. The handling of the language was easy, but his style had not quite settled down and occasionally there was a trace of affectation. The letters dealt with the histoty of man. Like Raleigh and Condorcet, Jawaharlal wrote a history of the world while sitting in prison. Each letter was devoted to one theme or development; and the whole, starting with Mohenjo-Daro and ancient Greece and ending with the writer\u2019s own times, was spread over nearly three years. The letters showed, when published as Glimpses of World History, a unity of outlook and a command of fact which would have done credit to any pro\u00ac fessional writer; and that they were written with no research assistance of any kind and as an escape from the monotony of jail made the work an astonishing achievement.\nThe newsof the celebration of his forty-first birthday all over the country on Novemberthrilledhim.\u2018JawaharDay! Arrests \u2014convictions\u2014 lathicharges all over the country!' About twenty million people had participated in  cities and villages (including Colombo); the police had opened fire in one place and carried out lathi charges in  others; one person was killed, about , were wounded and , were arrested. Sothe morale of the movement\n'Speech at Lucknow,  October , The Tribune,  October .\n*See letter to Dhan Gopal Mukherji,  October . *\nJDiary entry,  November .\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nwas obviously still high, and Jawaharlal gave some thought to its future. A revolutionary dynamic, even in politics, could only be maintained by the goal of an economic revolution and by the rousing of a mass revolt.\n*\nUltimately, that is theonly thing that will tell. In spite of the great success of our movement we have not yet come within reasonable distance of moving the masses in a revolutionary sense. There is sympathy but no more. Gradually, if we do not look out, even this sympathy will get less and less.\nFrom this point of view, a no-tax campaign was vital and some attention should be given to defining its objective. The battle-cry of an economic programme was a far more powerful one for the peasant than that of political swaraj alone, and the object of a no-tax movement should be economic advance and not the release of a few leaders. Even the idea of a Constituent Assembly to settle the political future of India, which struck Jawaharlal at this time, could not be expected to rouse the kisans. In May  the national body, following in the steps of the U.P. Congress, had accepted that the poverty and misery of the Indian people was due not only to foreign exploitation but also to the economic structure of society which required \u2018revolutionary changes\u2019. Thanks to Jawa harlal the Congress was acquiring, if not a socialist viewpoint, at least an economic dimension. But no thought had been given to these \u2018revolutionary changes'. The Congress, in the middle of a war, could not be expected to draw up a definite economic and agrarian programme, but it should at least formulate some tentative ideas. Jawaharlal thought of some, 'not', as he said, \u2018from a purely socialistic standpoint, but from a Congress viewpoint with some lean\u00ac ings towards socialism\u2019. Big zamindaris should be acquired by the State, with compensation to all except those who had sided with the British and against the national movement, and replaced by peasant proprietorship and large state farms, where major experiments could be tried by the cultivators to whom they would be jointly leased. There should be also an inheritance tax and a land tax which would be at a flat rate of  per cent of the agricultural income above a certain minimum and up to a certain limit, and beyond that graduated like the income tax. Tenants should have rights of occupancy, purchase, transfer, improvement and inheritance, and a ceiling should be placed on rent. The time might not be ripe for a radical agrarian programme for the whole of India, and leading Congressmen would not agree to it; but the U.P. could take the lead. While there was no point in needlessly irritating the zamindars and the capital\u00ac ists and adding to one\u2019s enemies in the middle of a great fight, where a choice had to be made between two positions the Congress should without fear back the masses \u2014 the kisans, the landless people and the petty zamindars \u2014 for they weje the vital groups. The Congress was wise in abiding precipitation\n*Notes probably written in October-November .\nACTION-AND ANTI-CLIMAX\n\nof the dass conflict, but it should always be remembered that such a conflict was there and could not be wholly ignored. The ultimate ideal should be dear* cut in their minds; it need not be advertised but it need not be kept secret either.\nThese ideas, very similar to the U.P. manifesto of , were, as Jawaharlal was well aware, by no means revolutionary; but even their attainment was poised in his eyes on the continuance of a revolutionary struggle, and to that extent he was racing far ahead of reality. Even from within prison he and his companions sought to resist, and for the first time Jawaharlal contravened the jail rules byorganizing a three-day fast in protest against the flogging of political prisoners and their harsh treatment in other jails. He was vasdy delighted, too, by the news of his wife\u2019s arrest on New Year\u2019s Day and by her message on that occasion: \u2018 am happy beyond measure and proud to follow in the footsteps of my husband. I hope the people will keep the flag flying.\u2019 But generally, as Jawaharlal was compelled angrily to recognize, spirits were flagging and there was a mood for compromise.\nUnhappily the hartal age inaugurated by the Mahatma and the Con\u00ac gress has had some evil effects. It has resulted in continuous hartals in the heads and brains of some people. The upper storey has been locked up and the key is missing. It is a sad and deplorable result, but I suppose we must all bear up with this additional affliction.\nIt was in this context of fatigue that the British Government sent out seductive messages suggesting a settlement. The first session of the Round Table Conference had made dear that it was futile to discuss Indian problems with anyone except the Congress: \u2018no Indian delegation\u2019, wrote the corres\u00ac pondent in India of The Times, \u2018without a three-quarter line composed of Gandhi on one wing, the two Nehrus in the centre, and Malaviya or Patel on the other, can possibly be looked on as representative.\u2019The Viceroy also came round to the recognition that logically there were only two alternatives: to govern without consent or to make terms with Gandhi. The concept of the knock-out blow being futile, there had to be some settlement. On  January  theViceroy, in the new, Christian style of imperialism, appealed to Gandhi for co-operation on a basis of mutual trust; and two days later the Prime Mini\u00ac ster, Ramsay MacDonald, offered provincial autonomy, responsibility of the central executive to a federal legislature with some safeguards for minorities during a period of transition, and reforms in the existing constitution pending final decisionon permanentchanges. The thought that these siren voices might strike a 'response in the Congress drove Jawaharlal almost frantic. All such statements, he pleaded with his father, even if they offered full independence,\n*To hit father,  December .\nJLetter to his editor,  September , The History of the Times, -, (ft. ii (New York, ). p. .\nIrwin to Wedgwood Bean,  September and  November , Halifax papers, vol. .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nshould be ignored and the fight carried on; but, in fact, MacDonald\u2019s state\u00ac ment amounted to nothing. \u2018The British Government are past masters in the art of political chicanery and fraud, and we are babes at their game.\u2019 In even dreaming of a compromise the Working Committee would be*playing with fire \u2014 fire which might consume the country at no distant date \u2014 and lower\u00ac ing the morale of the people. \u2018Some people may be tired. There are also some people who have got the iron into their souls and who will go through hell if necessary before giving in to an ignoble compromise.\u2019 The Government should be made to realize that the fight would go on not for months but for years if necessary and the Congress would not give in except on its own terms. \u2018The day we convince the enemy that we are immovable like the Himalayas and as difficult to crush, that nothing in the world can make us bend \u2014 that weshall put up with all that they may inflict on us \u2014 that day the enemy will crumple up.\u2019 The larger world-situation also demanded that Britain make peace with India.\nMotilal, however, was dying, and could give no guidance to the Working Committee, whose members had now been released. Gandhi was unwilling to reject the Government\u2019s overtures out of hand both because he sensed a kindred spirit in the Viceroy, and because he believed that the war-weariness was more widespread than Jawaharlal was willing to recognize. The latter was prepared to overcome the staleness in the towns by stirring up the rural areas, but this did not appeal to Gandhi. Out of time, therefore, with the mood of his leader, and deeply stricken by his father\u2019s death on  February, Jawaharlal made no decisive contribution to the discussions. Trained to conceal his emotions, he continued to attend all the meetings of the Working Committee. But the undemonstrativeness could not hide the depth of his grief. Jawaharlal\u2019s personalitywas still incomplete and lacking in an assured centre. He was a man in the process of becoming, and therefore greatly dependent on his strong family background and on the support of a powerful father. His mother had no influence over him. The differing attitudes of father and son on many poli\u00ac tical issues, the gradual shift of Motilal to a viewpoint closer to Jawaharlal\u2019s and the many legends woven round his ambitious and spoiling love for his son, cannot detract from the fact that his was the weightier influence. For long after Motilal\u2019s death, Jawaharlal felt the lack of his sheltering wisdom, and doubtless this deprivation did muchto reinforce his dependence on Gandhi.\nJust at this moment, however, Gandhi\u2019s ways were wholly alien to him. The negotiations with the Viceroy, carried out by Gandhi on his own, and the settlement which resulted, seemed to Jawaharlal a total and unwarranted surrender. He still had not understood that Gandhi was no different from the Moderates in his basic strategy of negotiating with the British for concessions;\nhe only sought to build up greater mass pressures in his favour.* \u2018All these \u2022 *\n\u2018Two undated letters to his father, clearly written in January .\n*For an analysis of this, see Bipan Chandra, \u2018Elements of Continuity and Change in Early Nationalist Activity*, paper read at the Indian History Congress, December .\nACTION-AND ANTI-CLIMAX\n\nforms of action', in Fanon\u2019s words, 'serve at one and the same time to bring pressure to bear on the forces of colonialism, and to allow the people to work off their energy.\u2019 Assuming that the Congress was committed to the position Gandhi and the others had taken up at Yeravda the year before, and expect\u00ac ing, till almost the very end, the talks to break down, the actual terms came to Jawaharial as a severe jolt. Gandhi had agreed to discontinue civil disobedience in return for a partial amnesty limited to those not charged with violence, and permission to picket peacefully and to manufacture salf under certain con\u00ac ditions; and he committed Congress to take part in the Round Table Con\u00ac ference to consider a scheme of federation and responsibility with safe\u00ac guards 'in the interests of India* for such matters as defence, external affairs, the position of minorities, financial credit and the discharge of obligations. This was a far cry from the demand for independence and the right to secede, and even from the position taken up by the Congress in the talks with Sapru and Jayakar in the summer of . Nor had Gandhi stood firm on the demands for a general amnesty, an inquiry, into police excesses, which to Jawaharial was preliminary to any participation in the Round Table Con\u00ac ference, the return of all immovable property which had been attached, and the unlimited right to collect salt.\nThousands ofpoor people are pledged to eatonly tax-free salt or salt manu\u00ac factured by themselves. Hundreds have during the past eight months bled for vindicating the right. The leaders are involved in the pledge taken by thepeople. Humiliation ofthepeopleand theirleaders and invita\u00ac tion to break their pledge is hardly the way to approach peace.\nIt appeared to most members of the Working Committee, and above all to Jawaharial, that Gandhi had been outwitted and, in return for some empty phrases which recognized the indispensability of Congress in any Indian settlement, had yielded on every crucial issue and ignored the long-term objectives. But Gandhi threatened to retire if his settlement were repudiated and demanded personal loyalty even if not approval. Jawaharial was in tears and moreaware than ever that the loss of his father was more than a personal one. Never had Motilal\u2019s clear-sightedness and ruthlessness in negotiation been more needed. \u2018Always\u2019, he recorded in jail a year later, \u2018when thinking of the truce people start guessing what might have happened if father had been there and there appears to be a general consensus that events would have taken a very different turn. Foolishly I said so in Delhi a few hours after the truce.

It has frequently been suggested that Gandhi secured this by agreeing, in turn,\u2018to a resolution, drafted by Jawaharlal and revised by him, committing the organization to provide in any future constitution for not only the basic civil liberties, adult suffrage and free primary education, but also \u2018real economic freedom\u2019. But the argument that in return for hisacceptanceofthe political compromise Jawaharlal was given a recognition of socialist objectives is defeated by the list of fundamen\u00ac tal rights incorporated in the resolution. In industry, economic freedom meant only a living wage and proper conditions of work, liberation from serfdom or conditions bordering on serfdom, decent treatment of women workers, pro\u00ac hibition against the employment of school-going children, the right to form trade unions and the establishment of machinery for settling disputes by arbitration. The state should control mineral resources and the key industries. These could not constitute part of the \u2018revolutionary changes' which the Cong\u00ac ress had accepted in  as being necessary. But in agriculture the position was even worse. The.Karachi resolution stipulated no more than a substantial reduction of land revenue and rent with total exemption only for necessary periods in the case of uneconomic holdings, a progressive tax on agricultural income above a certain level and a graduated inheritance tax. There was no reference to the abolition of landlordism or the socialization of land or even the annulment of at least a portion of the rural debt. On the other hand, much ofGandhi\u2019seleven pointsof was included \u2014 reduction of civil and military expenditure, exclusion of foreign cloth and yam, prohibition, abolition of the salt tax and lowering of the exchange ratio of the rupee.\nObviously, therefore, this resolution was no sugar on the political pill. There was nothing socialistic about it. Only the secret police could have believed that M. N. Roy, who was present at Karachi, had helped in drafting this resolution, which he later denounced as confused, compromising with foreign imperialism and native feudalism and \u2018an instrument of deception\u2019. Jawaharlal too was aware that this resolution did not go even as far as his earlier efforts, from  onwards, at drafting an economic programme which would have some meaning for the peasants and workers of India. But he sponsored it as it formed at least one more step taken by the Gongress, however haltingly, not on the road to socialism but towards the recognition of the need for an economic policy. It indicated \u2018that our national movement is gradually turning towards the left.\nI think this is a desirable development and that this in itself will help the fuller development of an advanced ideology in groups. It will provide the background out of which that ideology can develop.\u2019\nSo the resolution on fundamental rights in itsdf did not compensate for the loss of ground suffered because of the political settlement; and if Jawaharlal\n\u00bb *\n J.P. Haitbcox, Communism and Nationalism in India (Princeton, ), pp. -.\nTo Onkar Nath Verma,  December .\nACTION-AND ANTICLIMAX\n\npublicly supported the latter, it was because such conduct was in consonance with both his policy and his character. Once the settlement had been reached, Jawaharlal, \u2018lonely and almost uninterested\u2019 as Gandhi described him, in\u00ac formed his colleagues that he was unable to accept or reconcile himself to the references to safeguards and reservations. But he added: \u2018I do not desire, how\u00ac ever, that any impediment should be placed in the way of those who interpret the words differently from me and who propose to extract independence out of them. Truce having been proclaimed by the Working Committee, I trust all of us will honour it and carry out the directions of the W.C. in regard to it.\u2019 In other words, Jawaharlal resented the conclusion of this agreement but was not going even to offer to resign, as he had done in , and intended to abide by the settlement. But the contradiction between his mental attitude and his decision to conform was not complete. It was not the case of a middle-aged fledgling who believed in extremism and acted in moderation. As Jawaharlal saw it, the settlement was undoubtedly a self-inflicted defeat. But he would not have agreed with Irwin\u2019s claim, at a private meeting of the Conservative Party after his return to London, that he had built a breakwater against the great agrarianforceswhichwerebeingharnessed by Jawaharlal by ensuring the loyalty of the older politicians who were on the side of \u2018conservatism\u2019. No permanent damage had been done to Indian nationalism. Gandhi had not broken, but only ignored, the logic of the struggle for freedom; that struggle, in fact, could only end with the attainment of independence. So this was no peace but only a truce. The temporary phase was bound to pass sooner rather than later, and the fight recommence; and then once again the nation would require the leadership of the man who had called a depressed people to life and action. Till then, in the period of neither peace nor war, it was Jawaharlal\u2019s duty to keep the spirit of battle alive, to respect the cohesion of the party and to abide by the leadership of Gandhi. The fears of the Brftish Government that he might split with Gandhi and cariy on civil disobedience on his own showed how little they knew him. As he advised a young Congressman:\n\u2022\nWecannot afford to get excited in politics. We must preserve our balance and not rush into any action without proper consideration. Such action as we take should not be individual as far as possible. If we do so we lose the benefit of collective action and of an organization.\n\u2018See Gandhi\u2019s handwritten note to Jawaharlal, AICC File G (KWXi) .

Hecalled on Congress\u00ac men to retain the war mentality, for the time wa'fc sure to come when they would have to fight again; meanwhile, they should abide by the agreement which their leader had reached, and exploit it fully in such matters as picketing of liquor shops, manufacture of salt, boycott of foreign cloth and preaching of swadeshi. There was also scope for more important activity in the sensitive areas of Gujarat and the United Provinces, where the movement of  had developed into rural no-rent campaigns. That in Gujarat had been the more successful, but it was also the more easily called off, for it had been primarily a political effort in a small area no larger than half a district in the U.P., with relatively well-to-do cultivators responding to the call of Gandhi and Vallabh- bhai Patel to pay nothing until the Government cancelled a summary enhance ment of the revenue. The authorities were forced to acknowledge that the assessment had been carelessly arrived at, and, after the settlement, the chief issues were the restoration of lands which had been confiscated and the re\u00ac instatement of officials who had been dismissed. But the situation was very different in the United Provinces. Here, between the Government and the cultivators, therewas an intermediate class of about , landlords, but the fragmentation of land was such that the vast majority of these landholders paid less than Rs  a year in land revenue. But if the landlords were for the most part impoverished, the condition of the tenants was relatively much worse. Pressure on land was continuously increasing, and rents paid by the tenants were enhanced far more rapidly than the revenue payable by the landowners to\n See the Viceroy\u2019s record of interview with Gandhi,  March , Collected Works, vol.

Between  and  rents had increased by Rs  lakhs while land revenue had increased by only Rs  lakhs. Agricultural prices, already low by January , fell by December by about  per cent and were lower than at any time since ; and the yieldwas not sufficient even to cover the rising costsofproduction, let alone to enable payment of rent. Added to this was a series of bad harvests since . Nearly  per cent of the peasants and the poorer zamindars were sunk in debt. Two years after the agrarian riots of , life tenure wasgiven statutory recognition in Avadh (Oudh), and a simi\u00ac lar statute was passed in  in Agra. But this acceptance of tenancy right had its darker side, in that rents were stabilized at a time when they were high. But there were no occupancy rights in Avadh; conditions were slightly better in the Agra districts, but evictions were widespread throughout the province, the landlords being eager to evict occupancy tenants.\nThe agrarian question, therefore, in the United Provinces was much more an economic than a political one; and even after the truce of March  there were many instances of landlords and the police acting together in evicting and harassing tenants in order to extract rents. Some villages were even reported to have been deserted by the inhabitant* out of fear. Jawaharlal was under the impression that while Gandhi had assured Irwin that even if he did not attend the Round Table Conference he would not resume civil disobedience so long as the Conference was sitting, he had made it clear that this assurance did not apply to any local economic struggle that might be forced upon the Congress. There is nothing to this effect In the official record but it is confirmed by implication; and it was explicitly stated in Gandhi\u2019s later correspondence, in August, with the Government. So in March , as the slump in prices con\u00ac tinued and even the rabi (spring! crop was a failure, the whole scope of the movement in the United Provinces was changed, as Gandhi described it, from one for non-payment of rent to one purely for seeking economic relief. Tenants were advised to pay what was possible, which in general appeared to be  per cent by occupancy tenants and  per cent by statutory tenants, provided the landlords gave receipts for the full amount. The Congress organizations in the tebsils acted as qgents of the peasants in negotiations with the landlords, and Jawaharlal met some senior officialsofthe U.P. Govern\u00ac ment, while the provincial Congress committee opened an office at Lucknow to deal with the Government and deputed Govind Ballabh Pant to be in charge.\nThe Government, however, though they recognized the economic distress andrealized that therewasnothingobjectionable in the attitudeofthe Congress, feared that its mediation would strengthen its hold in the rural areas and refused\n\u2018Jawaharlal to Jagdiah Praaad, ChiefSecretary UP.,  March cod to Maharai Singh, Commis\u00ac sioner, Allahabad division,  April .Home Dept.

It seemed to them more than a matter of prestige.\nJawaharlal and his school have of course a great influence locally, and there is no doubt that they have for a long time been bitten with the idea of making a kind of Soviet organization of peasant workers, which will first of all abolish the landlord and then possibly Sovietize Government. Theprocedurenowadopted is well chosen and difficult to meet. Congress announces that it is really a peasant trades union and cannot desert the tenant in his hour of stress. It no longer pursues the no-rent campaign as a political measure, but it demands the right to judge as between landlord and tenant and to decide what rent the latter can pay. The landlords are thoroughly unhappy, and we ourselves find it difficult to meet the new position without recourse to ordinances, which might break up the Delhi settlement.\nKnowing Gandhi\u2019s keen desire to make the settlement a success, they sought to drive a wedge between him and Jawaharlal. In this they were not wholly un\u00ac successful. Emerson reported that Gandhi fully accepted the position that it was wrong to refer to the settlement as a truce* to talk about a future war, to refer to Government as an enemy and to exploit the settlement as a victory for Congress. \u2018Hewas very loyal to Pandit Jawaharlal, but, Igathered, did not regard it as altogether improbable that he would take his own line sooner or later.\u2019 Gandhi, in fact, was frightened by the officials with the bogy of a class war being let loose by Jawaharlal. He liked the idea of Congress tebsil committees acting on behalf of the tenants, but disapproved of advice to withhold payment of rent even in part, the appointment of Congress tehsildars and attacks by tenants on zamindars. He even, to the Government\u2019s delight, practically withdrew the claim of the Congress to be an intermediary between the Govern\u00ac ment and the people.\nJawaharlal\u2019s health at this time being on the verge of collapse, he had to take a holiday, and while he was in Sri Lanka and southern India, Gandhi was in chargeofthe U.P. problem. This appeared to be the chance for the Government to press home their advantage, and to get Gandhi to throw in his weight against his \u2018wild men'.

Remissions of revenue of about Rs  lakhswen announced, with parallel reductions of rent for the rabi harvest of about Rs  lakhs. But, though in remitting revenue the Govern\u00ac ment went back to the level of , rents were taken back only to the level of -, and the remission amounted to only about two annas in the rupee. If rents also had been pushed back to , the talukdars% the traditional allies of the Government, would have lost heavily and the Government were not willing tocontemplate this. This was hardly adequate remission even for current rents \u2014 nothing was said about arrears or the kbarif (autumn) harvest \u2014 and many district officers and most of the zamindars pointed this out. Landlords were practically unable to collect any rent at all in Barabanki, Rae Bareli and parts of Lucknow and Pratabgarh districts; and the situation was not much better in parts of Agra, Meerut and Allahabad districts. But the U.P. Govern\u00ac ment were prepared at this stage to do no more. On the other hand, the Divi\u00ac sional Commissioners were ordered to provide police assistance to landlords in carrying out the ordinary processes of eviction and distraint. This seemed theonlywayof smashing the almost total hold which the Congress had acquired in some districts, and of retaining the loyalty of the talukdars. And the pretence of conciliation, however minimal, seemed a sufficient backdrop for talks with Gandhi.\nThe Home Secretary, Emerson, met Gandhi at Simla in the middle of May. Gandhi was not prepared to accept that the Congress had no right to intervene at all in the relations between the* Government and the tax-payer; even if it was not a recognized intermediary, it had a role to play as the poor man\u2019s friend in advising him on rent matters. But he roundly condemned pressure being brought on landlords, direct appeals not to pay, the proposal of a general  per cent reduction of rent and any refusal to pay less than what was within the individual\u2019s capacity. Hewas then invited to meet Hailey at Naini Tal to discuss details, andthe spectre was presented to him of tenants refusing to pay any rent and resorting to violence if pressed by landlords. When he suggested an inquiry into the exact pitch of rents so as to ascertain if payment was practical, Hailey replied that this would involve such a delay in collections that Government could not agree. The Governor was mo shrewd to press Gandhi to any precise commitment, but that Gandhi had been sufficiently won over was shown by the manifesto he issued immediately after the interview. Ignoring the resolution of the U.P. Political Conferencepassed a few weeks earlier that the rents should on no account exceed those prevailing at a time when agricultural prices were\ntH\u00abiky toCrerar, S May . Home Dept. Pol.

Pol. /XI cl .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nwhat they were at this time, Gandhi called upon the tenants to pay all the rent they could as early as possible, and in no case less than  annas in the rupee in the case of statutory and non-occupancy tenants and  annas in the case of occupancy tenants \u2014 more than what the U.P. Congress had recommended. He added that the tenants should certainly not listen to advice to pay no rent at all or resort to violence.\nFortified by Gandhi\u2019s half-hearted support of the kisans, the Government now forced the pace and, without openly denouncing the settlement, set about breaking up the alliance of the U.P. Congress and the tenantry as well as the Congress organization in the countryside. If the Congress built up an influence in the rural areas such as they already had in the towns, in any future campaign of civil disobedience they would have the whole population behind them; and serious as Bardoli had been, it would appear insignificant compared to any no-rent campaign which might develop, encompassing the whole of the United Provinces. Administration would practicallycome to an end, it would be impos\u00ac sible to maintain law and order or even a semblance ofgovernment, and right in the heartof India  million people would be entirely out of hand. That was why it seemed important to Hailey and other perceptive officials not only to destroy the potential of the Congress in the countryside but to ride Gandhi off the United Provinces. This was doubtless one major reason why the Government were anxious that Gandhi should have no opportunity for reconsidering his position and should be encouraged to attend the Round Table Conference in London.\nIt is, I think, the mercy of Heaven that they have concentrated on a tehsil in Bombay when they might have been playing havoc with six or seven million tenants in the United Provinces. I do not mean that all of them are thoroughly discontented, but there is quite enough rack-renting and bullying by landlords in some of the districts to make a very fine field for agitation. Jawahar Lai and his friends have done and are doing their best, butof course they lack the halo which surrounds the unprepossessing poll of the Mahatma. \nSo when Jawaharlal came back to the U.P. in the middle of June, he found the situation and atmosphere much worse than in March. The talukdars were terrorizing the peasants with the help of the police, Congress volunteers were being beaten up in many places, and even activity such as peaceful picketing, permitted by the settlement, was in places banned by overenthusiastic district authorities. Jawaharlal had no intention of submitting meekly to this, despite letters from Gandhi, seen in the mail by the authorities, deploring the element\n  Mct . *\n> Hailey to Haig,  October , Hailey papers, vol. .\n* and  June .\nAGRARIAN CRISIS IN THE UNITED PROVINCES\n\nof violence in the Congress ranks and urging him not to break any law himself but to seek an interview with the Governor or with Emerson. \u2018On your side\u2019, Gandhi wrote to a U.P. Congressman, \u2018it is all well, so long as you hold the kisans in check. But Jawaharlal\u2019s presence must now ease the situation. He has no difficulty in dealing with the kisans and restraining them.\u2019 As much in reply to Gandhi as to the Government, Jawaharlal said that the Government were breaking the truce and using the zamindars to crush the kisans, and the Con\u00ac gress would have to take drastic action in reply. Talukdars who preferred to bask in official sunshine rather than to be on friendly terms with their tenants had no place in India, and those who were guilty of oppression would have to answer for it before the nation.\nJawaharlal was too loyal to Gandhi to accept, even to himself, that his leader was weakening their case, and he dutifully sought an interview with Hailey, which, however, was not granted. But he took the view that what Gandhi had asked the tenants to pay was not the minimum but the maximum and this need not be paid if it entailed debt and sale of cattle and ploughs, or if the kisans were ill-treated. The U.P. Congress set up commissions of inquiry to visit the districts and ascertain details of official and zamindari repression. For their part, the U.P. Government claimed that they were prepared to grant no further remissions and were even willing to consider the arrest and prosecution of Jawaharlal for his support of the tenants or even for organization, of peaceful picketing in Allahabad. It is difficult to believe that Hailey, who was perhaps the shrewdestof hisgeneration ofcivil servants in India, was serious about this, and it was probably intended to keep the' Government of India, of which in Willingdon\u2019s time he had no high opinion, from making any concession on the U.P. to Gandhi. For such a stupid step as the arrest of Jawaharlal would clearly have served to push Gandhi too far. However keen he might have been, as the authorities at Simla thought, to maintain the settlement and proceed to London hecould hardly have done so with one of his chief lieutenants in prison; and anopen warwith the Congress at this stagecould hardly havebeen of advan\u00ac tage to the Government. But fortunately, from their viewpoint, Jawaharlal left the U.P. to attend a meeting of the Working Committee and then accompanied Gandhi to Simla. There Gandhi suggested to the Viceroy and his officials that the district authorities should fix the amount of revenue and rent to be collected after consultation with Congress workers, but if this were not acceptable to the Government, at leastadetailed inquiry to enable temporary adjustments should be ordered. The Government of India were williug to consider this, but it was veotedbytheU.P. Government Jawaharlal also,onthisoccasion, met anumber\n*ToMohanlal Sauna,  June , Colltct\u00a7d\"Works, vol.

He made no secret of the fact that landlords had no place in his scheme of things, but he intended to buy them out rather than confiscate their estates, and even this only when the Congress party came constitutionally into power, and not as the result of a peasants\u2019 revolt. In the U.P., he said, the Congress was acting merely as the organization of the kisans and advising them on what rents they should pay or none at all. Indeed, according to Emerson himself, it was he who took the offen\u00ac sive in these discussions and Jawaharlal whowas moderate. Emerson contended that the Government would never have concluded the settlement if they had had any idea of the agrarian programme which the Congress would undertake in the U.P. and, when asked by Jawaharlal what the Congress should do if the kisans came to them with their grievances, replied naively that the Congress should refuse to intervene. Pressed by Jawaharlal as to what he would say if a peasant who had been evicted wished to till hisjand rather than leave it fallow, Emerson seems to have replied that he would sdhply refuse to answer him. Obviously this was not going to convince Jawaharlal or deflect him from his line of action, but it was dear that he was no hot-headed revolutionary.\nHe was not prepared to admit that Congress activities had generally been objectionable, but was less uncompromising in this matter than Mr. Gandhi... The Pandit seemed to me to appredate more dearly than Mr. Gandhi the complexity of the problem, and while of course he was naturally anxious to get from the local Government some concession in regard to existing collections, he probably realised that this was imprac ticable. Hewas moreconcerned with a permanent solution or, at any rate, alleviation. \nIn a sense, of course, these conversations were unreal, because both Jawahar\u00ac lal and Emerson were perceptive enough to see that, whatever the short-term bargains and haggles, there could be no final settlement between an imperialist Government and a Congress committed to independence. As Emerson recog\u00ac nized, even ifGandhigave a hint to Jawaharlal to slow down Congress activities in the U.P. and even if Jawaharlal wished to do so, drcumstances would\n\u2018To Hailey,  July , Hailey papers, vol. .

On return to Lucknow Jawaharlal met the Chief Secretary and urged that as the season for collection of rents was over and tenants had already paid  to  annas or more in the rupee, further collec\u00ac tions should be suspended and coercive processes stopped. This would immedi\u00ac ately relieve the tension and produce the proper atmosphere for an inquiry into future adjustments. But the Government, on the plea that rents had earlier been deliberately withheld, insisted that the process of collection should continue longer than in normal years. So evictions continued, and attempts were made to secure new tenants for these holdings. Congressmen in particular were penalized for taking an interest in these matters, and such tenants as declared themselves against the Congress were given special remissions.\nJawaharlal, supported by Tassaduq Sherwani, himself a zamindar and president of the U.P. Congress committee, and Pandit Malaviya, by no stretch of the imagination a radical, reported all this to Gandhi, who sought clarifica* tion from Hailey and received a soft but evasive answer. Gandhi made no speci\u00ac ficdemands, Hailey was only too anxious to keep the U.P. in the background of controversy, and the Working Committee was not keen to have a breakdown of the settlement and the cancellation of Gandhi\u2019s journey to London on such an explosive, dass-ridden issue. It was Bardoli and coercive processes there which the Committee put in the forefront, and Jawaharlal did not embarrass it by making the U.P. crisis a test case. Asked by Gandhi for a definite answer as to whether he should dedine to attend the Conference because of the U.P., Jawaharlal and his colleagues from the province replied that although there were sufficient instances in the U.P. of a breach of the truce, they would tty to see that conditions improved and they did not want the U.P. to stand in the way of Gandhi going to London; For Jawaharlal realized that though he himself favoured the abolition oflandlordism, his colleagues in theWorking Committee (not exduding Gandhi) were unwilling to recognize, whatever their theoretical commitments in earlier resolutions, even the possibility of marked sodal and economic change. The crisis in the U.P. was real enough, and conservatives like Sherwani and Malaviya could not shut their eyes to it; but the Congress leaders from other parts of India had no wish to take up a problem which might open the door to unpredictable forces, and preferred to confront the Govern\u00ac menton the saferground of Gujarat. On this, however, a last-minute agreement was reached, and Gandhi sailed for England, leaving Jawaharlal to deal with the U.P.\nIndeed, even before Gandhi\u2019s departure, Jawaharlal appears to have decided that on the U.P. problem his guidance was unsafe.

Gandhi, when consulted, advised that Pant should agree, but his advice was ignored and Pant declined to serve till he had received the approval of the U.P. Congress committee. Clearly Jawaharlalk normal and ostentatious loyalty to his leader did not now exclude an occasional exercise of quiet defiance. The official committee recommended a complicated system of reduction of rents on the basis of the fall in prices, but never more than  per cent and never below the average rentals for -. They would also not be reduced if their rise could beshown to be the result of causes other than the rise in prices, such as irrigation or the use of improved seeds. The Government accepted this recommendation, which would result in a reduction of Rs . crores^outof a total cash rental of Rs  crores. But the actual implementation of this cumbrous scheme depended on a host of minor revenue officials, sus\u00ac ceptible to local pressures and the influence of zamindars. Evictions, issue of processes and arrests of Congressmen continued as before, though \u2018more quietly and without fuss\u2019. There were about , evictions in Allahabad district alone, while in Muttra district over , processes were issued in August. There were more ejectments, sales of property and cases and convictions of ejected tenants for trespass in the ten months from October  to July  than in the twelve months of the previous revenue years - and -. Officials both at Simla and at Naini Tal counselled Jawaharlal to be patient and give them time to reinstate the tenants, but in fact there was never any intention of doing so. The argument that there should be no evictions for non\u00ac payment of rent was regarded by the U.P. Government as untenable and tanta\u00ac mount to granting proprietary rights to the tenants. They were prepared, on the other hand, for any organization by Jawaharlal of defensive direct action \u2014 that is, civil disobedience \u2014 in the last resort, a course which the Congress had madeknown to the Government that it kept open to itself. So, although at this time the Central Government adopted a posture of friendliness and seemed to wish to strengthen the efforts of the Congress to maintain the settlement, \nthe U.P. Government did not even pretend to do so.

But nothing happened, and meantime the general attitude of the Government of India also stiffened. There were shooting outrages at Hijli detention camp in Bengal, the salt concession in the whole area covered by the Salt Range in Shah- pur district in the Punjab was withdrawn, and Congressmen were arrested in large numbers in that province. In the U.P. itself, evictions and harassments continued, and men and women were beaten up for the recovery of such petty arrears as two or five rupees. Yet, under Jawaharlal\u2019s guidance, the U.P. Congress committee did not consider the request of the Rae Bareli district committee for permission to start civil disobedience, but instead called on all its branches to refrain from any such action for the time being. The committee appointed by the U.P. Congress to inquire into the agrarian situation, which also reported at this time, publicly denied that the Congress was opposed to the zamindars or wished to countenance a class war. Jawaharlal had no wish to embarrass Gandhi in London or his colleagues in the Working Committee; nor was the organization on a war footing.\nTouring the district, Jawaharlal found the conditions varied, depending on the particular attitudes of the local officials. He was more interested in ascer\u00ac taining the facts than in exploiting them. Even the U.P. Government conceded that his speeches were less open to objection than usual*. But, on the whole, the situation was grim. The kisans, losing all hope of redress from the Govern\u00ac ment or the Congress, were desperately raising money to avoid eviction and the loss of their crops. They sold their cattle, dumped their grain on the markets thus further reducing its price, and borrowed from moneylenders and paid not only the current rent in full but often some arrears and heavy costs. Thosewho had been evicted paid very muchmore to recover their land than if they had paid the full rent without any remission at the start, and in the process they lost their occupancy rights and became life tenants. Moreover, these direct transactions were regarded by the authorities as mutual arrangements between the landlords and the tenants which dispensed with the need for remissions. To deter Jawaharlal from visiting villages in Gonda district, where there were serious allegations of harassment, ditches were dug across the road; and in Bahraich district, to prevent attendance at Jawaharlal\u2019s meetings, the kisans were directed to stay in their villages on the particular dates to receive their remis\u00ac sion slips. In many districts the peasants were informed that these remissions\n* Patel to Emerson,  September , Home Dept. Pol. File / of .\nJawaharlal to V.N.

It was only when rent had been fully paid, moreover, that any objec\u00ac tions of the tenant regarding the rent would be considered. But it was obvious that money once paid would never be returned, and dearly the purpose was to terrorize the peasant into paying all he could. In Allahabad district, the popula\u00ac tion had increased over the years, while the cultivated area had dedined, so that the pressure on holdings, already uneconomic, was acute. The kharifcrop was also wdl bdow average because of untimdy rains. But heedless of these con\u00ac siderations, as well as of the public opinion to which the district was exposed, the Collector, R.F. Mudie, granted remissions for  of only Rs . lakhs, out of a total cash rental of Rs  lakhs for both the kharif and rabi crops, as against Rs  lakhs in  for the rabi crop only, on the ground that there were a large number of occupancy tenants whose rents had not been raised in recentyears. TheCollectoralsocontended that therentaldemand in - had been the same as in , the base year selected by the U.P. Government, and on this wrong premiss, assumed without checking or publishing the figures, further reduced the remissions. So the remissions were only  per cent or  annas  pies in the rupee, although the prices of cereals had fallen by  per cent, and grain formerly worth a rupee was now worth only seven annas.\nJawaharlal was at last forced to contemplate a no-rent campaign. \u2018Thus the outlook for the tenant\u2019, he wrote to the Chief Secretary, \u2018is about as black as it could wdl be and there seems no way out. If the Government policy is enforced he is doomed to even greater suffering than he has passed through. We have been anxiously considering this and the Allahabad District Congress Gommittee have felt that they can be no parties to this continuous oppression of the kisan leading to his economic death.\u2019 So it might become necessary to advise the tenantry to withhold payment of rent till a satisfactory solution was found. Though they did not wish to take any decision, involving such far-reaching consequences, without the fullest consultation, there seemed no other way. But they were convening a representative kisan conference to consider this question, and also communicating with the provincial and the All-India Congress.\nI regretgready that such a step should be contemplated by them, specially at a time when Gandhiji is attending the Round Table Conference. But the question of payment or non-payment is an urgent issue and cannot await the deliberations of the Round Table Conference or the return of Gandhiji. We have tried to avoid raising any issue which might lead to\niThough for  the U.P.

But the fates seem to be against\nthis.\nJawaharlal also brought the crisis to the notice of the Viceroy and of Gandhi. The Government of India merely referred his letter to the U.P. Government, whileGandhi authorized Jawaharlal to do as he thought fit. Both the Allahabad district committee and the kisan conference recommended the cessation of pay\u00ac ment of rents, \u2018It is war,\u2019 Jawaharlal was reported as having said, \u2018war now and ever till the end ofour lives. \u2019 What exasperated him as much as tenancy wrong in the U.P. was the shabby treatment to which Gandhi was being exposed in London.\nBy now the Government of India were ptepared for a fight. \u2018Jawarlalal [sic] seems to be on the warpath again and Gandhi\u2019s last speech when he evidently lost his temper and let himself go makes one feel one will be busy again ere long\u2019. But at this stage it was the U.P. Government that hung back. Hailey felt that Jawaharlal was bluffing, and that the telegraphic correspondence with Gandhi was as much meant for the official censor as for themselves. Yet the Governor was not willing to call the bluff. Mudie was transferred from Allaha\u00ac bad, an error in his calculation of the remissions was acknowledged and a further one lakh was sanctioned, and the Congress leaders were invited to a discussion with the officials concerned. This enabled the Working Committee to postpone a firm decision and refer the recommendation of the district committee to the U.P. committee, with the final approval or veto of a no-rent campaign vesting in the president, Patel.\nThe talks, however, came to nothing, the official side refusing to discuss the proposals of the Congress for further rental reductions, cancellation of arrears, revocation of ejectments and lowering of interest on money owed to money\u00ac lenders. Any modifications of the decisions already announced were regarded as impracticable, and nothing more than further information about present policy wasoffered. The U.P. Congress committee, still reluctant to have a con\u00ac frontation in which the tenants would obviously suffer most, offered to renew negotiations. But there was not even a remote chance of these succeeding, for the authorities were determined to yield no ground; the only question for them\nJawaharlal to Jagdish Prasad,  October , AICC File , Part /.\n Jawaharlal to E.

File / of .\nAGRARIAN CRISIS IN THE UNITED PROVINCES\n\nwas whether the charade of discussion should be gone through. The Central and Local Governments believed that this would have the advantageofstrength\u00ac ening the forces within the Congress against Jawaharlal.\nAs you say in your letter, Jawaharlal himself is probably in favour of an immediate declaration of Civil Disobedience if he can get sufficient sup\u00ac port from other Congress leaders. He has always objected to the Delhi pact; he is clearly disgusted that Congress ever consented .to appear at the Round Table Conference; and he is of course inordinately vain and desirous of attracting to himself the limelight which has hitherto shone on Gandhi and to a certain extent on Patel.\nIn fact, this assessment was inaccurate as well as prejudiced. Jawaharlal was as disinclined as any other Congress leader to start a no-rent movement, primarily because of the absence of Gandhi. He now, unlike in , understood the basic nature of the peasant problem; he knew that it was a part of the class war; but he preferred to project it as an aspect of the struggle against the British, and even in this he sought to avoid battle. But the option was being gradually re moved. The Government expressed their willingness to parley, but made it clear that there would be no reconsideration of principles. Meantime, collec\u00ac tions for the current season were due to commence on  November, and the U.P. Congress committee, with the authorization of Patel, directed the kisans of Allahabad district to withhold payment of rent and revenue while negotia\u00ac tions were pending.\nThere was logic in this, for it was pointless to pay rent and revenue while the whole question of the quantum was under discussion. But the Government utilized this resolution to call off the discussions. Indeed, the Government of India, in Hailey\u2019s words, \u2018took fire\u2019 and wanted him to move against the Congress with all his forces and without dday. The Congress and its affiliated bodies should be outlawed, the Instigation Ordinance re-promulgated and the leaders arrested. With the Conservatives back in power in Britain and the second Round Table Conference a failure, the Government of India had dearly dedded to turn their backs on Irwin\u2019s settlement; and the harsh Bengal Ordi\u00ac nance and the drastic policy favoured in the U.P. were both parts of a general return to a policy of repression. Willingdon and Emerson went to Lucknow to speed up matters, but Hailey refused to be hustled. The Round Table Confer\u00ac ence had still a fortnight to run, the payment of rents had been ddayed by late rains and would not starton any large scale until  December, and the Congress had served no clear-cut challenge. So, in the U.P. at any rate, there continued\n\u2018Hailey to Crerar,  November , ibid.\n**Ae Ltadtr,  November .\n\u2022To de Montmorency,  December , Hailey paper*, vol. .\nCrerar to Hailey,  November , Home Dept. PoL File / of .\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nwhatJawaharlal described as an impossible situation. \u2018Peace we can understand and war we are not unused to, but this hybrid state we cannot understand.  The Congress had received private information from Delhi that the Government of India were spoiling for a fight, but yet there was no action in*the U.P.\nQearly, however, this was only a temporary lull. The days of the truce were obviously numbered, and Jawaharlal and his colleagues braced themselves for the struggle which they had sought so hard to postpone. \u2018If we are to die, we shall die after a fight. I do not want a'half-way settlement or a half-way fight.\u2019 Heexpected to be arrested within a few days, and had no hope of seeing Gandhi on his return. Indeed, the Pioneer, which had access to official sources, referred to the possibility of deportations, and Willingdon would certainly have done this if he could. 'One thing I do regret very much in all this business and that is we have no power of deportation out of India. It would be an enor\u00ac mous advantage if we can take hold of  or  of these leaders, send them right away to the West Indies or somewhere instead of having to keep them under surveillance in some Province or other.\u2019\nOn  December the district Congress committees in Rae Bareli, Btawah, Kanpur and Unao, in addition to Allahabad, were authorized to commence their no-rent campaigns. Payment of rent in these districts came to an almost complete standstill, other districts were also lining up, and it was clear that once the movement started it would spread throughout the province. The U.P. Government secured the permission of the Government of India to arrest Jawaharlal if he toured any of these districts. However, though Jawaharlal did visit some of these districts, nothing was done. Hailey knew that his case was weak and, despite the impatience of the authorities at Simla, remained \u2018cold-footed\u2019. Unlike in the previous year, this no-rent campaign had no obvious political overtones and was motivated, and justified, by economic causes. In many European countries there would have been hesitation in pena\u00ac lizing such agitation, and repressive action would alienate moderate opinion in India and abroad. Nor, unlike the Government of India, did he now believe that the Congress under Jawaharlal was determined to force the issue in Gandhi's absence. \u2018It is not unlikely that the Congress really desire to wait till\n\u2018Speech at Calcutta,  November, The Tribunt,  November .\n Autobiography, p. .\n Speech at the kisan conference at Allahabad,  November, The Leader,  November .\n\u00ab ToPatel,  November , AICC FileG  of ; to Syed Mahmud,  November .\n  November .\n Willingdon to Sir Samuel Hoare, Secretary of State,  December , Templewood papers,, I.O.L.

P. Government lowered the water rates, introduced a bill to secure tenants from eviction if they paid two-thirds of the arrears due for the pre\u00ac vious fouryears, and offered to consider immediate measures to protect tenants against debts which had become overdue owing to the fall in prices.\nThen, at last, Hailey decided to strike. What ultimately determined his action was not so much the spurring from Simla as the fear that the situation might slip out of control and if Gandhi, on his return, decided to support the agitation, norentor revenue at all could be collected. Even then, he toned down the Ordinance drafted by the Government of India and issued it together with what was really a long apologia. It was contended that the Congress had utilized the economic crisis to increase its following among the kisans, that the spirit of the truce had never been respected and that Jawaharlal had preached class warfare. Under the Ordinance which, even as modified, was drastic enough, action was now taken against Congressmen. Notices were served on Jawaharlal and other leaders prohibiting them from speaking or writing in support of the campaign; and Anand Bhawan, along with many Congress offices, was searched. Jawaharlal\u2019s own arrest was delayed because he was away on tour in Bombay and the Karnatak.\nEven at this stage, the Congress was in no mood for a general campaign of civil disobedience. The Secretary of State, Sir Samuel Hoare, found Gandhi in London as well disposed as could be expected. He contemplated no imme\u00ac diate general renewal of civil disobedience, and promised before taking any such step to communicate with Hoare and Willingdon \u2014 'the satisfactoiy part about the interview was the genuine friendliness of the old man.\u2019 In Bombay, Patel, the Congress president, publicly offered to let any impartial judge, or even Irwin, decide as to which party had broken the settlement, and Jawaharlal suggested an inquiry by any Indian or European judge appointed by the Govern\u00ac ment. On his return to Allahabad Jawaharlal was served with a notice not to leave the city without official permission and the U. P. Provincial Conference, scheduled to be held on  December, was banned. Still the Congress struggled to avoid battle, and postponed the conference. But Jawaharlal himself was arrested on  December for violating the order restricting him to Allahabad. The local magistrate had thought that this restriction had merely been to\nfortnightly report of U.P. Government for the second half of November , Home Dept. Pol.

Though Jawaharlal gave no formal notice of this, it was known that he was leaving Allahabad in order to welcome Gandhi on his return from London and not to promote the no-rent campaign; but the U.P. Government ordered his arrest. He was arrested and taken off the train at Iradatnagar station, and sentenced a week later to two years\u2019 imprisonment. He was also fined Rs , and for realizing this amount a car registered in the name of his daughter was attached.\nThe arrest of Jawaharlal soon appeared as not just a provincial matter but partofageneral offensive against the Congress. Willingdon and his Government believed that Irwin had made an error in negotiating with the Congress and signing a truce, and they had no intention of repeating it. The Viceroy was \u2018perfectly clear as I have always been that Gandhi is a sort of Jekyll and Hyde, and while he may possibly have his saint-like side, on the other he is the most Machiavellian bargaining little political humbug I have ever come across.\u2019 When Gandhi sought an interview with the Viceroy, he was asked first to repudiate his colleagues and to agree not to discuss Bengal, the U. P. and the North-West Frontier, where also a number of stern ordinances had been imposed and Abdul Gaffar Khan arrested. These were terms which Gandhi obviously could not, and was not expected to, accept; and when the Working Committee decided on a resumption of civil disobedience, Gandhi, Patel and other leading Congressmen were arrested. The \u2018shock tactics\u2019 of the Govern\u00ac ment of India surprised almost everybody. The Secretary of State was dot too happy but supported the man on the spot, who, on his own admission, was \u2018becoming a sort of Mussolini in India\u2019. This time, however long it might take, the back of the Congress was to be broken. \u2018We can, in my opinion,\u2019 wrote the Home Member after twelve months of repression,\u2019 do without the goodwill of Congress, and in fact I do not believe for a moment that we shall ever have it, but we cannot afford to do without the confidence of those who have supported us during the long struggle against the Congress.\u2019 So the policy of seeking to destroy the nationalist movement was to be continued, and Jawaharlal would obviously remain one of its prime targets.

    "1932-1936": " In and Out of Prison\nClearly, therefore, this was going to be a long spell in jail for Jawaharlal and now, for the first time, prison life began to tell on him. He had trouble with his teeth, and his general condition was poor. He began to run a temperature in the evenings, but for months the jail superintendent would neither try to diagnose the cause nor permit examination by other doctors. Ultimately, after Jawaharlal\u2019s transfer to another jail, Dr Bidhan Roy and Dr Ansari were permitted to see him and it was found to be a recurrence of pleurisy on the right side. Gradually Jawaharlal shook it off, but meanwhile had to forgo his running and exercises and even walks, and content himself with sunbaths.\nHis living conditions too were, at the start, such as made for relative dis\u00ac comfort. He was first placed in Naini jail, and then, after a few weeks, trans\u00ac ferred to Bareilly where both environment and men were vile. His barracks were at least six feet below ground level, which meant that the surrounding walls were over twenty-four feet. \u2018The wall which faces me\u2019, he wrote to his daughter, \u2018must bear some relation, in height at least, to the Great Wall of China!\u2019 Further, for the first time since Nabha, not only the ward but the bar\u00ac racks also were locked at night. The fortnightly interview with his family was spoilt by the close supervision of not only the jailor, but of a policeman who took notes. His companions also, with the exception of Govind Vallabh Pant, irritated him. So generally Jawaharlal fretted. \u2018On the whole I have not been able to settle down this time as I have done in the past. Perhaps a slight touch of ill-health \u2014 perhaps my transfer \u2014 perhaps my missing my old compan\u00ac ions \u2014 perhaps a certain want of satisfaction with things, and happenings in general \u2014 perhaps so many other things!\u2019\nThis malaise was worsened by other events. In April his mother was beaten in a lathi charge and badly injured. The old lady was full of courage and spirit. \u2018I am proud to have been beaten with sticks for the cause of my mother\u00ac land . . . While being beaten I thought of you and your father and did not utter\n Letter,  March , Glimpses of World History (Bombay, ), p. .\n Diary Aitry,  March .\n\nIN AND OUT OF PRISON\n\na sigh... The mother of a brave son is also somewhat like him. It was only a lathi \u2014 had it been a gun I would have bared my chest.\u2019 But it added to the intense despair of Jawaharlal. Then, because, at an interview in jail with Ranjit Pandit, Indira had shown him a school report of his children, the jailor insulted Jawaharlal\u2019s mother and wife who were also present, and the Government ordered that they could not interview Jawaharlal for a month. This roused Jawaharlal to bitter anger, and he declined to have any interviews even after the month was over; for on no account, as he put it, was he prepared to take the slightest risk of further insult to his mother and wife. It was not till early in , after a break of eight months, that he began, on Gandhi\u2019s persuasion, to see visitors again.\nThe self-denial of interviews, whi>h formed the sole relief in the boredom of prison, robbed life of the excitement of anticipation.\nThedays and the weeks and the months pass by one after the other, merg\u00ac ing into each other, and there is little to distinguish one from the other. And the past looks like a blurred picture with nothing standing out. Yesterday takes one back to the day of one\u2019s arrest, for in between is a blank with little to impress the mind. It is the life of a vegetable rooted to one place, growing there without comment or argument, silent, motion\u00ac less. And sometimes the activities of the outside world appear strange and a little bewildering to one in prison; they seem distant and unreal \u2014 a phantom show. Sowedevelop two natures, the active and the passive, two ways of living, two personalities, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\nIn June  Jawaharlal was transferred to Dehra Dunjail. Here the climate was pleasant and the jail buildings not severe. The superintendent, an Irishman whose name deserves to be remembered, Captain Falvey, had been a pupil of de Valera, and he did what he could to alleviate conditions. Jawaharlal was even permitted to take his walks outside theprison gates. But all this could not dimin\u00ac ish the inner turmoil. Indeed, on hearing of the savage treatment df political prisoners in other jails in the United Provinces, Jawaharlal felt ashamed of the better conditions of his own prison life, and he invited the Government to give him the same treatment as the others.\nJawaharlalwasconcerned, too, about hiswife and mother roughing it out on their own and his two sisters languishing in jail; but it was the thought of his growing daughter that frequently came strongly to him and filled his mind. It wasbecause letters toher brought her image close tohim that he continued writ\u00ac ing his neat little essays, taking herstage by stage through the human past, even thoughtheycouldnot be sent to her and had to bekept aside for a later date.\n Letter (in Hindi) to Jawaharlal,  April . \u2022\n* To the Superintendent, District Jail, Dehra Dun,  July .\n\u2019Letter to Indira, New Year's Day , GUmptss, p. .\n Letter to the Superintendent, District Jail, Dehra Dun,  November ,\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nJawaharlal was no professional scholar writing within a clearly defined and balanced framework. Taking, as he described it, centuries at a stride and seeing continents at a glance, he rushed past what he found dull and lingered at points wherehis interest was aroused. Hewas, for instance, fascinated by the greatmen of history \u2014 and not necessarily the men of virtue and idealism. Genghis Khan and Napoleon take up as much space as Asoka, Leonardo or Lenin, Strength, even in cruelty, commanded his attention. This was to be expected of someone who was never happier than when under the influence of stronger characters. But it was also the product of a temporary sense of loss. Jawaharlal himself throve on action, and, forced in jail to .action, he glamorized the vigorous performances of others whatever their results.\nIn the preface written on  January , he commented that \u2018even as I was writing theletters myoutlook on life changed gradually. Today if I had to rewrite them, I would write differently or with a different emphasis. \u2019 He would probably have qualified the ultimate belief that history tells of growth and progress and of the possibility of an infinite advance for man.\nHistory is not pleasant. Man, in spite of his great and vaunted progress, is still a very unpleasant and selfish animal. And yet perhaps it is possible to see the silver lining of progress right through the long and dismal record of selfishness and quarrelsomeness and inhumanity of man.\nHe might have toned down too his glorification of certain individuals. But otherwise he retained all his life the half-liberal, half-Marxist view of history which holds the book together. The story of man was one connected whole, and the only history that could be properly written was the history of the world. It was the product not of individuals or national peculiarities but of world forces, and developments in different countries told basically the same tale. Even the \u2018superficial sketches\u2019 which he had \u2018joined together by a thin thread\u2019 and which dealt mostly with Europe and Asia were intended to establish that history was notwhat was achieved by leadersorgovernments but what happened to peoples, and this was the result of the interplay of ideas, economic interests and social relations. Though he made no deep analysis, he broadly believed that the class which controlled the means of production was the class that ruled, and that the history of man was the history of class conflicts and social struggles. To grasp this was to secure the ability both to understand the past and to face the future with confidence and to be prepared for effective action.\nThe intellectual acceptance of history as the result of impersonal world forces for which no individual could be blamed or applauded, led Jawaharlal to criticize the imperialist system rather than the British and to strive to consider even issues pertaining to India impartially as a scientist examining facts. Jawa\u00ac harlal codld not jump out of his skin. He was a sensitive Asian nationalist, and\n Letter,  January , Glimpses, p. . a Lettey  August , Glimpses, p. .\nIN AND OUT OF PRISON\n\nhard as he tried to be fair to the British, a certain impression of \u2018nagging* crept in, especially when he was dealing with matters that had nothing to do with India. But he was wary of nationalism as \u2018an unreliable friend and an nnsafp historian\u2019, and dwelt on the shortcomings of his own people as much as those of their rulers. He had, since his return from Europe in , shown an acute distaste for institutional worship. Hecontinued to admire thegreat Hindu scrip\u00ac tures. The Bbagavad Gita was \u2018that jewel of a poem\u2019; and as for the Ramayana and the Mababbarata \u2014 \u2018Who but the greatest of men could have written them?\u2019 But they impressed him more as literature and historical testimony than as revelation. Hedisliked temple-going, was scornful of ritual and regarded prayers as morbid. But, writing in the early \u2019thirties when the memory of the Kanpur riots in which his friend Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi had lost his life was still fresh, he was particularly concerned with the savagery committed in the name of religion. It was important to release India from the chains of the com\u00ac plex ideology ofcustom, convention and superstition. He was at pains to tell his fellow-countrymen that Islam did not believe in religious persecution and a man like Mahmud of Ghazni, whom most Indians regarded as an arch-iconoclast, was in fact no more than a successful soldier. He had come to India to conquer and loot, and would have done so whatever religion he had belonged to. The best of Indian culture was a synthesis; this had badly frayed and should be rebuilt on the securer foundations offreedom and social equality and in consonance with a better world order.\nWhenJawaharlal was too tired to write, there were always books. Fortunately there was no restriction this time on the number he could read and keep, and hewas also allowed newspapers and journals without restriction. So apart from The Statesman and the Pioneer, he read the Living Age, the Manchester Guar\u00ac dian Weekly, theNewLeader, theNew Republic, theModem Review, theNew Statesman, theNation and the Spectator; and his reading lists show that he was as well read and up-to-date as any leisurely person of cultivated tastes in London orNew York. For the authors include Toynbee, Maurice Dobb, Leonard Woolf, Tawney, Laski, Louis Fischer, Julian Huxley and H. G. Wells as well as Sven Hedin, Tagore, CharlesMorgan, Maurois, Lowes Dickinson and L.A.G. Strong. They not only, as Jawaharlal said, saved him from tedium and depression; they also kept him intellectually sensitive and vigorous.\nSo Jawaharlal settled down to jail routine and was irritated by talk of the release of all political prisoners. He even turned roundly on a fellow-prisoner who talked ofparole for medical treatment. \u2018I have almost brought myself to the frame of mind when a ten year sentence of imprisonment will make little dif\u00ac ference!

Gandhi\u2019s fast in  in protest against the Communal Award treating the Scheduled Castes as a separate community for purposes of elections was a sharp shock. The thought that Gandhi might die, and for such a minor reason, and that the onlyremaining protective forcein his life might be removed, knocked Jawaharlal for a time off balance. \u2018My little world in which he has occupied such a big place, shakes and totters, and there seems to be darkness and emptiness everywhere ... Shall I not see him again? And whom shall I go to when I am in doubt and require wise counsel, or am afflicted and in sorrow and need loving comfort?\u2019 He wept, with mixed anguish of anger and love for a man who could precipitate such a crisis so wantonly, and with bitterness towards a people who could let their heroes risk death in such a way. Gandhi, amid his own travail, sensed this reaction and sent Jawaharlal a reassuring telegram which helped, along with the news of the fast having been broken, to restore Jawaharlal\u2019s stability. How\u00ac ever, the whole episode drove him further on his inner resources. His existence was based wholly on mind, emotion and memory. Sitting alone for hours that seemed unimaginably long, he was frequently immersed in nostalgia. His father he missed deeply and, as his mind went back to him again and again, he felt shelterless.\nIf father had been alive! How my mind wanders unconsciously and dwells onhimandhowempty I feel at the thought that he is not there. For months and years we lived far from each other \u2014 when I was in Europe \u2014 but it did not matter so much. Always one had the feeling that he was there and one could always go to him for help and counsel. Now there is an emptiness...\nAnd in another moving and candid entry he reveals how close to the surface was this ache for his father:\nI was reading the newspaper \u2014 There was an account of a ceremony of unveiling a bust or statue of father\u2019s at the Hindu Boarding House in Allahabad. Hirday Nath Kunzru did the unveiling. I glanced casually at what he said, but I did not see anything. To my surprise, and quite un\u00ac awares, my eyes were full of tears.  Letter.  September , Glimpsts, pp. *.  Diery entry,  March . * Diary entry,  August .\nIN AND OUT OF PRISON\n\nThe next year, Gandhi undertook a purificatory fast and again plunged Jawa* harlal, along with millions of his countrymen, into an emotional crisis. Gandhi realized this from afar, and wrote a chatty letter which was meant to soothe. The two telegrams Jawaharlal sent in reply indicate his bewilderment and dread of personal loss. \u2018What\u2019, wired Jawaharlal in his first mood of petulance, \u2018can I say about matters I do not understand. I feel lost in strange country where you are only familiar landmark and I try to grope my way in dark but  stumble. What\u00ac ever happens my love and thoughts will be with you.' But as the hours passed, he felt that he owed Gandhi a morecheerful message, and that evening he wired again: \u2018Now that you are launched onyour great enterprise may I send you again love and greetings and assure you that I feel more clearly now that whatever happens it is well and whatever happens you win.\u2019\nAt the commencement of the fast the Government released Gandhi, who suspended civil disobedience for six weeks. This was a shock to Jawaharlal, but his mind, still numbed by the fearof Gandhi\u2019s death, accepted it. However, once the ordeal was over, Jawaharlal was able to see Gandhi with a much clearer vision than at any time before or since. For a short while the blinkers fell. He realized that Gandhi\u2019s attitudewas sheer revivalism against which cool thinking had no chance. Gandhi's political actions were often guided by an unerring in\u00ac stinct, and, fortified by this, he did not encourage others to think. He himself, as he frequently asserted with pride, was satisfied with the next step and had given no precise thought to the long-term objective. The emphasis on God and faith, the acceptance of the existing social order, the stress on compromise, the reliance on lieutenants who were proclaimed reactionaries \u2014 all these jarred on Jawaharlal, and his love for Gandhi could not conceal from him that he was drifting further and further away from his leader. \u2018I am getting more and more certain that there can be no further political co-operation between Bapu and me. At least not of the kind that has existed. We had better go our different ways. My way will keep me in jail. That is dull work and depressing, but perhaps it is as well.\u2019 Obviously a stiff battle between rival loyalties awaited him outside, and, not relishing this prospect, he did not look forward to his release. But coincidentally, just as he had finished the last of his letters to his daughter, he was transferred to Naini jail and, aweek later, on  August, twelve days before hewas due to beoutofprison, he was released. His mother was seriously ill, the province wasquiet, the Congress, with Gandhi\u2019s assistance, had seemed to have succeeded in tying itself into knots, and Jawaharlal himself was (erroneously) believed bytheGovernment to be in favour ofgiving upcivil disobedience. From his letters, read by the censors, it was gathered that he had no dear plan as to what he intended to do, and the world history he was writing was expected to keep him busy for some time. So, all points considered, the U.P. Government\n\u2018Telegrams,  May .\n*Diary entry,  July .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\n(in Hailey\u2019s absence, since he was in London) felt it could take the risk of releas\u00ac ing him; and the Government of India approved.\nJawaharlal\u2019s comment, on emerging from jail, that he attached little impor\u00ac tance to theswadeshi and Harijan movements, the reports of his talks with his colleagues in the U.P. and his statements to the press that India*S primary prob\u00ac lem was economic and a new structure of society was inevitable raised expecta\u00ac tions that he would formally break away from Gandhi and the old Congress and form a new party with independence as its goal. There was certainly little in common between the public attitudes of Jawaharlal and of Gandhi. The younger man, while in jail, had made a wide study of international affairs, and saw India as a part of the pattern of world forces \u2014 the failure of capitalism, the rise of Nazism, the growth of dictatorial tendencies even in England  and the United States, and the shaping struggle between fascism and communism. There was, as Jawaharlal saw it, an inevitable, universal swing, not necessarily to the Soviet model but towards the general lines of the Soviet conception. Fundamentally the choice before the world was between some form of communism and some form of fascism, and he was all for the former. There was no middle road; one had to choose between the two, and Jawaharlal unhesitatingly chose the com\u00ac munist ideal. From this time dates the intense dislike of fascism, which was never to leave him, and the conviction that, while communism would have to adapt itself to changing conditions and different countries, its basic ideology, general oudook and scientific interpretation of history were sound. The affinity to the left, born of the visit to Europe in the \u2019twenties and nourished by reading, wasconfirmed by the rival philosophies that had spawned in Italy and Germany.\nIn India, the effort of the British to protect not merely their own vested in\u00ac terestsbutalso thoseoftheir allies, thezamindars, the princes and the capitalists, had not to Jawaharlal a chance of success because it went against the broad eco\u00ac nomic forces determining the future of the world. But nationalists, on their part, could not possibly hope to confine themselves to a replacement of foreign by home interests and seek to avoid the disturbance of class divisions and the social status quo. A socialist state was a concomitant of independence, and if an Indian Government took the place of the British and kept all the vested interests intact, this would not even be the shadow of freedom. The Gongress, as the spearhead of the Indian nationalist movement, needed anew ideology which was\n Mieville, P. S.

This was an urgent task, for the impoverished peasants, whose drill-sergeant was hunger, were being driven to seek immediate relief.\nRoast lamb and mint sauce may be a tasty dish for those who eat it, but the poor lamb is not likely to appreciate the force of the best of arguments which point out the beauty of sacrifice for the good of the elect and the joys of close communion, even though dead, with mint sauce.\nThere had to be a fundamental change of regime, politically, economically and socially, and the three were inextricably linked. British imperial rule had to be destroyed, the autocracy of the Indian states had to be ended, the whole land system had to be changed, industry brought under public control and all wealth shared. Each was a part of a total problem.\nThese ideas were all far removed from the outlook of Gandhi, who was seek\u00ac ing to renew peace negotiations with the British and to convert his countrymen, through fasts, to better social behaviour. His were the politics of intuition, requiring no argument or logic; Jawaharlal followed the path of reason, applying the laws of history and change. The break seemed inevitable, and as Jawaharlal went to Poona to confront his leader, also just released from prison, even he probably prepared himself for it. But he could not forget that, intermeshed as was the crisis, the most important front was the political one; and till the British had been expelled there could be little advance towards socialism. To combat economic wretchedness with the State power obstructing them was a hopeless waste of energy. But in this political struggle, Gandhi\u2019s leadership, however wayward, still seemed indispensable; and Congress was still the most militant organization in India. He himself was the quintessential upper-class figure, and even his radicalism, modelled on European example, seemed at times to him no more than a product of his deep-seated class sense, a de haul en bas posture. So both leader and party were necessary to him, and it was not just the springs of personal loyalty and affection which proved once again too deep to permit release. Jawaharlal. face to face with Gandhi after two years, publicly affirmed his continuing acceptance of Gandhi\u2019s leadership, and letters were exchanged in which Jawaharlal stated his position in terms which were easy for Gandhi to approve. The objective of independence included full control of the army and of foreign relations as well as financial and economic control, vested interests had to be \u2018devested\u2019 as gently and as rapidly as possible, the Round Table Con\u00ac ference was a futile effort, and the problem of Indian freedom could not be separated from vital international issues. Indeed, the clash of viewpoint was reduced almost to the ridiculous by Jawaharlal laying emphasis on his divergence from Gandhi on such paltry issues as to whether individual civil disobedience\n'Whither India? These three articles, written in October , provide the clearest exposition of Jawaharlal's views at this time.\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nwas different in kind from mass civil disobedience, and secrecy in action was never desirable; and Gandhi closed the discussion by declaring that the differ\u00ac ences were only temperamental and confusion had been created by Jawaharlal's tendency to be repetitive. A few months later, Gandhi confidently gave Jawaharlal \u2018power of attorney\u2019 to state the policy of the Congress and was frank in his justification.\n do not think that Jawaharlal's own views are yet sufficiently crystallized to make any fundamental departure from Congress policy likely. He is a firm believer in socialism, but his ideas on how best the socialist principles can be applied to Indian conditions are still in the melting pot. His com\u00ac munist views need not, therefore, frighten anyone.\nThis failure to break with Gandhi was, of course, a disappointment to Jawa- harlal's radical supporters, and when he followed up his correspondence with Gandhi by stating that hewas perfectly happy with theway in which the struggle was being conducted and saw no need tosummon a meeting of the AICC, even his friends were driven to protest. For all his rhetoric he had no new policy and, seemingly, no use for democracy either, for he refused to consult othef Congressmen.\nThe fact is that Pandit Jawaharlal and his friends are themselves com\u00ac pletely out of touch with the realities of the situation. Alternatively, we should have to suppose that they are purposely deluding themselves into the belief that the present policy has succeeded, which, of course, is un\u00ac thinkable ... No useful purpose is served by putting before Indians a radical economic policy, without telling them how to implement it.. .\nIf Pandit Jawaharlal, in the face of the present appalling situation, has nothing better to offer us but the repetition of old shibboleths and the as\u00ac sertion that he, and he alone, is in touch with Congressmen and the masses it is dear that the reins of leadership, however regretfully, will have to be taken up by others, who will restore the Congress to its pristine power as the premier political influence in the country.\nWhatJawaharlal\u2019s critics had failed to understandwas that once he had dedd- ed not to break with Gandhi and the Congress, it was out of character for him to lead a rebellion from within. However sharp his expression of disagreement in private conversation, to the outside world he was determined to accept Con-\n Jawaharlal'sstatement tothe press,  September, Tba Laadtr, September ; Jawaharlal's letter,  September and Gandhi\u2019s reply,  September .\n Interview in the Madras Mail,  December .\n* Interview in Tba Bomba,y CbronicU,  September .\n* Editorial, \u2018Save, the Congress\u2019, in Tba Bombay Cbronieta,  September .\nIN ANb OUT OF PRISON\n\ngress policy and decisions and interpret them in as favourable a manner as pos\u00ac sible.  His loyalty might at some time snap; but while it lasted it was firm. Ups and downs were inevitable in a broad national movement and the lull to which he was now committed could best be used in hard thinking about methods and objectives. It was idle to expect the Congress as constituted to become a full- fledged socialist organization, but there was every hope of its becoming more and more socialistic. \u2018I do not see why I should walk out of the Congress leaving the field clear to the social reactionaries. Therefore, I think it is up to us to re\u00ac main there and try to force the pace, thereby either converting others or making them depart.\u2019A time might come, sooner rather than later, when the new ideas might cause a split in the Congress; but till then advantage should be taken of the national movement and it should be pushed as far as it could go. The Con\u00ac gress should be led out of the backwaters of pure politics by socialist elements who, rather than forming independent and sterile study centres, could exploit the Congress programme of mass action. For although ideologically backward, the Congress was still the most advanced revolutionary organization in the country and what was required was to give it a new orientation rather than to abandon it. Separate organizations for promoting the interests of workers or peasants were desirable, but not political organizations counter or parallel to the Congress. \u2018There is a great talk of the socialist party or the like but I am convinced that much of this talk is merely meant to cover ineffective action and also as a means of self-aggrandisement.\u2019 \nThe plan to give Congressmen courses of instruction in ideology assumed that he would remain out of jail, and about this Jawaharlal was rightly not opti\u00ac mistic. Within a week of his release he was expecting to return. Prison was a part of the day\u2019s work, and he would clearly be back soon \u2018to muse on the earthly paradise and the various bars, of iron and of the spirit, which prevent us from reaching it\u2019. In fact, as time passed, he longed for prison. Life outside, in an atmosphere of repression, was suffocating. Conditions, in some places like Bengal, were more humiliating than elsewhere, but in fact all Indians were caught and being crushed in the mill. Indeed, suggested Jawaharlal, it would be simpler, instead of a variety ofordinances and orders and rules, to have a com\u00ac prehensive enactment abolishing all schools and colleges and suppressing all newspapers and books, and layingdown that every Indian must consider himself in prison (\u2018C Class), salute the Union Jack every morning and sing the British national anthem at divine service twice a day; \u2018and the afternoons might be profitably devoted to listening to an inspiring address on the virtues of British rule\u2019.\niSee, for example, letter to Kapil Dave Maiaviya,  September .\n*To Abdur Rahim,  October and C.

Now, Iam not only prepared but Iam eager to do so. My instinct tells me that I must take a step forward and instinct in this matter is a safe guide for me.' The seizure of his shares worth about Rs , by the Government rid him of what he regarded as a liability and he followed it up by selling the family jewellery at a nominal price. Jawaharlal, unlike Gandhi, was encumbered by complex thought, but in the matter of worldly goods he was becoming as much of a political ascetic.\nBut while he was out, he sought to keep up the struggle, even if at a lower pitch, for the only alternative was a compromise wkh imperialism, and this was unacceptable not only to him personally but manifestly to the Indian people. Travelling round the country, Jawaharlal was convinced that never, at any rate since , had there been such extraordinary bitterness against the Govern\u00ac ment and such a passionate desire tc be rid of it. So he concentrated on the sustenance of the struggle, and declined to be distracted by such side shows as village uplift and the Harijan movement. \u2018This kind of safe and pious activity can well be left to old ladies.\u2019 It was a question not merely of time and energy butof creating a psychological atmosphere. The national fight had to continue, and it would be strengthened by making it a social and economic fight for the masses and purging it of Hindu and Muslim communalism.\nJawaharlal had till now deliberately ignored thegrowth of the communal evil in Indian politics in the hope that public attention could be diverted from it by emphasis on the positive aspects of the national struggle. Hunger, poverty and exploitation had nothing to do with religion. But the time now appeared to have come for a frontal attack on communalism as a cover for political reaction. In language which even Gandhi regarded as too fierce, he condemned the Hindu Mahasabha for its reactionary and anti-national policy of co-operation with the Governmentand supportof vested interests. The Hindu communalists wanted no basic change of the political and economic structure, and sought official favours to augment theirownposition. This criticism applied equally, of course, to Muslim communal organizations, and Jawaharlal recognized that they were as anti-national and reactionary in every sense of the word. But he rebuked them in milderterms. Fearwas justified, or at least understandable, in a minority community which was economically and educationally backward; and commu\u00ac nalism bomof fear had to be exorcized and not just brushed aside. \u2018Honest com-\n To Sri Prakass,  January , Sri Prakasa papers.

November, The Tribune,  November .\n Interview in the Pioneer,  November .\nIN AND OUT OF PRISON \nmunalism is fear; false communalism is political reaction.\u2019 In Jawaharlal\u2019s understanding, there were shades of both in Muslim communalism. Moreover, while the Congress had drawn into its ranks most of the vital elements of Hindu society, the communalists were the dominant and politically clamorous group among the Muslims. No other organization had so far arisen which could suc\u00ac cessfully challenge their claim to speak for the Muslims, and their aggressively communal character gave them an advantage over the large number of nation\u00ac alist Muslims in the Congress.\nObviously Jawaharlal had no illusions about organizations which worked under theleadership of so feudal and reactionary a figure as the Aga Khan. Their activities at the Round Table Conference, where they stymied all efforts by Gandhi to confront the British Government with an agreed solution on the com\u00ac munal problem, were but the latest testimony to their narrow upper-class base and commitment to subordinate collaboration with the Imperial power. The only way to ascertain the wishes of the Muslims was to ask them to elect re\u00ac presentatives to a Constituent Assembly on the widest possible franchise but, if necessary, on the basis of separate electorates. Then economic demands would undoubtedly get their rightful priority and the communal problem would be found to be an insubstantial ghost. But, in the meantime, in what could be interpreted as an apologia for Muslim communalism, he came close to recogniz\u00ac ing the hold of communal parties on the Muslim community and justifying their attitudes. He always, like Gandhi, took the line that it was for the Hindus, as the majority community, to make concessions while the communal problem lasted. This in itself, despite the call to magnanimity, assumes a communal approach, however subconscious. The argument is based on the belief that the majority community is a privileged one, and the minority community has reason to be communal. It was true that Jawaharlal had not carefully probed this issue, and was irritated by the Mahasabha\u2019s criticisms of Gandhi and the Congress and its open wooing of the Government. But even so, the implication that there was something to choose between Hindu and Muslim communalism was dangerous in its possibilities.\nHowever, all these public activities were not to be for long. The Government were as anxious as Jawaharlal to get him back in prison as soon as possible. They saw in the conversations with Gandhi not the dialogue between master and disciple, which it Was, but a Machiavellian attempt to organize forces to greater effect against the British. Gandhi, it was believed, would tour the country, ostensibly to promote his Harijan schemes but really to sow the seed of further activities in regard to civil disobedience, while Jawaharlal, whose socialism had become \u2018redder\u2019, would seek to strengthen peasant support, particularly in the United Provinces, with a programme of expropriation of the landlords. \u2018The one real danger that we have at the present moment in regard to our political future\u2019, reported the Viceroy, \u2018is the fear lest Jawaharlal Nehru should start a\n Interview,  November, The Bombay Chronicle,  December .\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nsecretivepropaganda in the villageson purely socialistic and communistic lines, for this might be a very troublesome thing to deal with. \u2019 The U.P. Government had little doubt that Jawaharlal\u2019s main object was to organize the masses and \u2018inoculate them with the virus of Communism*. The result would be^ according to the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, that for the next civil disobedience campaign Gandhi would have raised a huge Harijan army and Jawaharlal a host of stalwart agriculturists. The Bengal Government went further, and publicly stated that Jawaharlal was carrying on his revolutionary agitation under the guise of anti-untouchability activities and with the money collected for Harijan work.\nAll this was beside the mark, for Gandhi made it clear that only those Con\u00ac gressmen whoweretoo weak to court arrest or had lost faith in civil disobedience should join the Harijan movement, and forbade its use to strengthen the poli\u00ac tical activities of the Congress or its hold on the people. As for Gandhi and Jawaharlal acting in concert, Andrews called on the Home Member and assured him that Gandhi was not in sympathy with Jawaharlal\u2019s views. Regarding the allegation aboutJawaharlal\u2019s duplicity, he, a year later, while in England, sharply protested,and the Bengal Government were forced, with \u2018an ignominious crawl\u2019, to withdraw it. \u2018British officialdom in India\u2019, commented the Manches\u00ac ter Guardian, \u2018seems to be suffering from a bad attack of stupidity . . . The charge to anyone who knew anything of Nehru was ridiculous; one might as easily imagine Savonarola robbing a till.\u2019 But talk about a two-pronged offen\u00ac sive by the Congress was wishful, for it justified the attitude of unqualified hostility to the party which the Government had adopted since  and had no desire to change.\nJawaharlal\u2019s activities in particular were made to sound dangerous enough to require his speedy return to prison. All Local Governments were authorized to arrest him if opportunity arose not on some minor issue but on a serious charge which would involve a substantial sentence. \u2018My one hope is that Jawaharlal is such a temperamental person that he may go off the deep end before long and we shall be able to get him back into jail, which is really the safest place for a person with his political views.\u2019 What worried the Govern-\n\u2018Willingdon to Hoare, ,  and  September , Templewood papers, vol. ; Hailey to Chhatari,  September and to Clay,  September , Hailey papers, vol. ; notes of Home Department in Home Dept.

These were in grave economic distress and might well respond to his call for a new revolutionary ideology. \u2018You can never tell how far an emotional people will be captured by programmes of this nature; your own De Valera seems to me a man some\u00ac what like J. L. N. I certainly see no other leader at the moment who is likely to have an equal following, for the rest of India will never follow a Bengali.\u2019 If he broke the Congress and led a movement of his own it would be serious enough; but even more menacing was the possibility that, as Gandhi had hinted, he might cease to stress his leanings towards communism and merely call upon the Congress to give attention to economic problems. His open renunciation of the no-rent campaign suggested that this was likely; and this spurred the Government to action. 'Honestly, I think he is much better put out of the way, and I only hope that the Courts will convict him and give him a satisfactory sentence.\u2019 In December the Chief Commissioner of Delhi was asked to consider if Jawaharlal could be arrested for a speech denouncing British exploitation and the feudal autocracy of the Princes. But, while the Delhi authorities agreed that the speech was most objectionable, they had no great hopes of a successful prosecution. All Local Governments were then ordered once again to examine Jawaharlal\u2019s speeches carefully with a view to prosecution on some serious charge involving a substantial sentence of imprisonment.  The speech to the Trade Union Congress at Kanpur in December calling for the overthrow of British imperialism seemed to the Home and Law Members to be as strong a case as they were ever likely to get, and the U.P. Government were pressed to prosecute. \u2018The Government of India regard him as by far the most dangerous element at large in India, and their view is that the time has come, in accordance with their general policy of taking steps at an early stage to prevent attempts to work up mass agitation, to take action against him.\u2019 Hailey, however, though he was keenly aware of Jawaharlal\u2019s growing influence, was hesitant to act, and ultimately it was the Bengal Government which agreed to bell the cat. On his visit to Calcutta in January, Jawaharlal had in forthright terms condemned the vulgarity of imperialism and stressed that there was no half-way house between nationalism and imperialism. He had also sharply rebuked the terrorists for adopting a futile and out-of-date policy. But the Government had no use for such an ally against terrorism.

Crowds and mobs of people also lose control of themselves sometimes and misbehave. That is regrettable. But it is a terrible thing when an organized Government begins to behave like an excited mob; when brutal and vengeful and uncivilized behaviour becomes the normal temper of a Government.\u2019 Undoubtedly the Government of India at this time, believing that it had the Congress by the throat, was out for a kill. Repression and savagery were un\u00ac abashed and believed to be successful. As the one man among the leaders who was neither cowed nor shaken in nerve was jawaharlal, the authorities stalked him till they once more had him behind bars. Back for a Test cure\u2019 in his \u2018other home\u2019, this time the central jail at Alipore in Calcutta, he reverted to the routine of prison life and adjusted himself to living in a small cell and bare barrack yard, with a clerk sentenced for embezzlement as his only com\u00ac panion. The days pass, and so do the nights, and so we carry on. How soon one gets used to a particular mode of life!\u2019 The Bengal authorities did not encourage reading and writing, and for some time, after he had exhausted the novels in the prison library, the only book Jawaharlal had was a German grammar. This was later set right. But he never settled down in Alipore and was relieved when, early in May, he was transferred to the familiar barrack in Dehra Dun jail.\nThroughout these months, the news from outside was depressing. The ill-health of his mother and wife was a constant source of worry; and political news was no more cheerful. Gandhi's statement in April withdrawing civil disobedience was a heavy blow. \u2018It marks an epoch not only in our freedom struggle but in my personal life. After  years I go my way, perhaps a solitary way leading not far. But meanwhile there is prison and its lonely existence.\u2019 An undated, incomplete note obviously written at this time indicates that Jawaharlal was being driven once more to the recognition that he had come to a parting of the ways. There was hardly any common ground between him\u00ac self and Gandhi, and he had been wrong in subordinating their differences in a larger loyalty to the cause of national freedom. \u2018Our objectives are different, our ideals are different, our spiritual outlook is different and our methods are likely to be different.\u2019 The Congress was now aggressively anti-socialist and, in its acceptance of constitutionalism, politically more backward than it had been even in the heyday of the Swarajist party. Gandhi\u2019s statement withdrawing civil disobedience, the reasons given and the general outlook displayed \u2018seemed to me to be an insult to the nation, to the Congress and\nto any person with a grain of intelligence. I felt with a stab of pain that the !\u2022\n See telegrams toGandhi and to hi* daughter,  February . %\n*To Vijayalakshmi Pandit,  March .\n Diarf entry,  April .\nIN AND OUT OF PRISON\n\ncords of allegiance that had bound me to him for many years had snapped.' The concentration on non-political issues and the personal and self-created entanglements which led Gandhi to desert his comrades in the mMdle of the struggle were amazingly casual and likely to be fatal to the movement.\nIn August, when Kamala\u2019s condition took a turn for the worse, the U. P. Government let Jawaharlal out of prison, and he took this opportunity, in what even Willingdon, who had seen a copy made by the police, described as \u2018this very humandocument', to pour out his heart to Gandhi. The abandon\u00ac ment of civil disobedience had been bad enough, but the reasons given by Gandhi and his suggestions for future work had astonished him.\nI Had a sudden and intense feeling that something broke inside me, a bond that I had valued very greatly had snapped. I felt terribly lonely in this wide world. I have always felt a little lonely almost from childhood up. But a few bonds strengthened me, a few strong supports held me up. That loneliness never went, but it was lessened. But now I felt absolutely alone, left high and dryon a desert island.\nThe decisions that followed the termination of civil disobedience, such as the approval of the formation of a parliamentary oarty and the contesting of elections, had been shock after shock, allowing his mind and feelings no peace or rest and making prison life a greater ordeal for his nerves than at any time before. What was happening was not a setback, common enough in all great struggles, but a spiritual defeat and surrender of ideals. The Congress had become a caucus where opportunism flourished and the Working Committee's resolution condemning socialism showed such astounding ignorance of even the elements of the subject that it was painful to read it and realize that it might be read outside India. \u2018It seemed that the overmastering desire of the Committee was somehow to assure various vested interests even at the risk of talking nonsense.\nApart from this private letter, which Gandhi did not take seriously, Jawa\u00ac harlal responded to the Government\u2019s gesture and took care to keep away from political activity. However much he might have sympathized in private with the criticism nude by his follower, Rah Ahmad Kidwai, of the Congress leadership, he publicly dissociated himself from it. The proclaimed socialists in the Congress, who in May, as a counter-blast to the milk-and-water pro\u00ac grammes of the parent body, had formed the Congress Socialist Party, had not concealed that they sought and drew inspiration from him. They believed that they were echoing his ideas in hailing the Congress as potentially the\n ToHowe,  September , Templewood papers, vol. .\nTo Gandhi,  August .

The decision to keep the Socialist Party within the Congress was also modelled on Jawaharlal\u2019s precedent of the Independence for India League. Yet Jawaharlal refused, while out of prison, tcf give them any encouragement. He shared the socialist outlook; but there was no truth in the claim that he was fully in agreement with the decision to form the party. He considered the step premature and likely to divert attention from the immediate issue of political independence. The socialists had no support among the people, and it was more important to push the Congress as a whole, however slowly, towards acceptance of economic objectives than to nurture the doctrinaire views of a handful of individuals. Jawaharlal had a radical rather than an ideological mind. The precedent of the Independence for India League was not a happy one. It can be argued that Jawaharlal was giving up too easily, that while he had a socialist vision derived from Europe he lacked the stamina to formulate specific programmes suited to India and promote the strenuous work of forming cadres and establishing an organization \u2014 in other words, that he lacked a 'revolutionary perspective\u2019. Such criticism is balanced by the fact that, however disappointed with Gandhi and the Con\u00ac gress, Jawaharlal was still certain of their indispensability in the struggle to expel the British; nor could he regard the motley crowd of Marxists, Fabians, Gandhians and orthodox Hindus who led the Congress Socialist Party with anything but \u2018amused contempt\u2019.\nThe U.P. authorities, however, feared that the Socialist Party, which was the \u2019greatest menace to peace in the rural areas\u2019, had about fifteen centres in the province, very few of which were really active; but they would all receive a tre\u00ac mendous fillip when Jawaharlal came out of jail. The Government of India feared the release, especiallyon the eveof the elections to the Central Assembly, of the one person they had cause to worry about and of whom they had made a bogy man \u2014 \u2018the high priestof Communism\u2019. So it was made clear that no re\u00ac mission of his sentence could be considered, and after eleven days, when his wife\u2019s health slightly improved, he was taken back to prison. But this time he\nAcharya Narendra Deva\u2019i presidential address at the first session of The Socialist Party Con\u00ac ference, reprinted in Socialism and the NotionalRevolution (Bombay, ), pp. -.\nTo Sampurnanand,  August , Sampurnanand papers, National Archives of India.\n\u00bb Jsyaprakash Narayan to Rajendra Prasad,  July ,#U.P.

Then, in October, when she was moved to a sanatorium at Bhowali, Jawaharlal was transferred to the nearby jail at Almora.\nTheillnessof his wife pushed all else to the background. Over the years their relationship had matured from indifference to a deep attachment. Often in jail his mind wandered to her, and he sat waiting for her letters and looking forward to her interviews. \u2018Felt greatly cheered\u2019, runs a characteristic diary entry, \u2018at seeing her. I am much too fond of her!' Now, with her at death\u2019s door, he be\u00ac came a bundle of nerves, and more to take his mind off the crisis than anything else, he set to work feverishly drafting the work which was to be his greatest literary achievement. He began in June  the writing of his life story and finished it on  February . So a massive manuscript of  pages was dashed off in less than nine months. First called In and Out of Prison, it was later published with the bare title, An Autobiography.\nTagore, Andrews, Sapru and a host of lesser men, as well as the nationalist press as a whole, and Attlee, Lansbury and other leaders of the Labour Party in Britain, none of whom had any sympathy with Jawaharlal\u2019s political views, pleaded for magnanimity and a full release. But to set him free in India seemed to the Government of Indiaout of the question, for they saw no reason to believe that Jawaharlal would \u2018behave well\u2019, that is, refrain from political activity. Jawa\u00ac harlal himself was too proud a man and too committed a nationalist to ask for special favours. Even when let out of prison in August, he had declined to give any undertaking to the Government.  Now, while thanking the U.P. Govern\u00ac ment for the various courtesies being shown to him, he asked for no more.\nQuite frankly I fed that the U.P. Government has gone very much out of its way to meet an individual case and I am somewhat embarrassed by this special consideration. It would be wrong and absurd to expect the Government to vary State policy because of individual cases. Personal reasons cannot and should not interfere with principles and larger issues.\nI have myself endeavoured to act in that way, and if I may say so without impropriety, I thoroughly appreciate that Government cannot do so. \nWhen an advocate of Allahabad petitioned the High Court for his rdease and followed it up with a memorial to (he Government, Jawaharlal promptly repu\u00ac diated this unauthorized intervention in his personal affairs.

For the first time, Jawaharlal had to worry about money. He had an annual income, derived from book royalties and such shares as were still left to him, of about nine thousand rupees, and with this he had to run a large establishment at Anand Bhawan, pay heavy medical bills and arrange for the passages by sea and the stay in Europe. It was probably at this time that a member of the Birla family, the wealthy financiers, hearing of his difficulties, offered to pay him a fairly substantial monthly allowance, such as they provided to many leading Congressmen; but Jawaharlal expressed his surprise at the suggestion and sharply declined the offer. He mustered such savings as he had and made the arrangements, and Kamala sailed, with Indira and a doctor in at\u00ac tendance, in May. The Government of India were unwilling to remit Jawa\u00ac harlal\u2019s sentence on condition that he left India with his wife for Switzerland, for that in itself would encourage the socialist wing in the Congress and dispirit officials and loyalists. The hope was that, with the official retirement of Gandhi from the Congress in September, the party would become moderate and constitutional under the leadership of Patel and Rajagopalachari. For this the socialists would have to be kept under, and nothing would facilitate this more than the retention of Jawaharlal in prison.\nIn a way, this was not unacceptable. Kamala was anxious to brave the jour\u00ac ney, not only for a change of climate and in hopes of a cure, but because dose proximity to Jawaharlal was at this time jarring on the nerves of both. Mutual dependence caused its own frictions. In , while on a visit to Jawaharlal in Dehra Dun jail, Kamala had called on a Bengali lady sanyasinL They had not\n See note on income and expenditure, May .\n* Letter to U. N.

She later visited this lady several times and her influence grew. Jawaharlal pretended not to mind, but such a development was alien to his own nature; and he also resented the intrusion of another.\nWhat a child K is! That irritates me often enough and yet I think that is partly her charm. How my moods change when I think of her. How much she means to me and yet how little she fits in or tries to tit in with my ideas. That is really the irritating part, that she does not try, and so she drifts apart.\nWith Kamala and his daughter in Europe, Jawaharlal felt lonelier than ever in jail. He had now no major writing task to divert his mind, and though he set himself to writing articles in English and Hindi and reading a large variety of books, these could not subdue his emotional tension. He became a prey to nightmares and tears and, what was so rare with him, began to lose his very interest in life. All these years, his dedication to India\u2019s freedom had kept him going even when his personal affairs had been a shambles. As he had once told a senior British official in the halcyon 'twenties, his only ambition had been to be buried in the foundations of free India. But now he despaired even of that. The Congress had become a cautious, almost loyalist body, more frightened of communism and a class struggle than inimical to the British; Subhas Bose, in exile abroad, fancied himself as a future fascist dictator, and Gandhi gave all his attention to such problems as the relative merits of cows milk and buffalo s milk. \u2018Even Bapu) wrote Jawaharlal perceptively in his diary, \u2018he is either a non-co-operator or a full-blooded co-operator. The fire or a sofa \u2014 though a sofa is hardly the correct place for him. He can think only in extremes \u2014 either extreme eroticism or asceticism. Was it not Aldous Huxley who said that the ascetic was the counterpart of Eton Juan?\u2019 . Nor did the masses of India, indulg\u00ac ing in wild communal rioting, seem to deserve better. \u2018What a disgusting, sav\u00ac age people we are. Politics, progress, socialism, communism, science \u2014 where are they before this black religious savagery?\u2019 There were very few oases of intellect and character in the arid waste of Indian humanity, and doubts arose in his mind as to whether anything could be done with this material. To crown it all, the news from Europe of Kamala was depressing. She had stood well a complicatedoperation in Berlin for the removal of lung adhesions but, far from\n* Draft Second Volume of Autobiography (hereafter DSVA) written in Dehra Dun jail .

He asked for clarifications, and was told that his movements would be unrestricted in India till his departure as well as in Europe, but if he returned before his sentence expired in February  he would be imprisoned again. He was also requested not to make any political speeches before departure. On these terms, which did not infringe his honour, Jawaharlal left Almora for Allahabad and took the first available flight to Europe.\nKamala was in a clinic in Badenweiler in the Black Forest in Germany, and Jawaharlal found her condition changed very much for the worse. However, he still thought there was an even chance of a slow recovery. Keeping away from the Nazis and only asserting his viewpoint by patronizing Jewish shops, Jawaharlal spent his time nursing his wife, correcting the proofs of the Autobiographyand meeting the odd visitor \u2014 Andrews, Subhas Bose, Raja Rao. But the long hours in hospital were oppressive, and as he observed long after, \u2018I found that life affecting me powerfully, as it was.affecting much more the patients themselves. Since then I have never advised anyone to stay too long in a clinic.' Kamala too, in addition to the physical ravages of her illness, was giving way to the psychological strain. She was anxious to get back to Switzer* land and Jawaharlal therefore moved her early in  to a clinic in Lausanne. \u2018There is no immediate crisis\u2019, he reported in January, \u2018but there is a kind of continuing semi-crisis and certain complications appear to have set in due largely to extreme weakness.

But there was really no hope, and at  a.m. on  February she died.\nKamala\u2019s short life \u2014 she was not thirty-seven when she died \u2014 was over\u00ac cast with acute pain and suffering. Born in a social milieu much humbler than that of the Nehrus, she was faced from the start with the resistance of some of her husband's family, who treated her as an intruder from the otitside world into their exclusive relations with Jawaharlal. Smart, snobbish and insensitive, they led her to feel that she did not belong, made Jawaharlal a poor wife \u2014 andwasplain anddowdyinto thebargain. Fine-grained and high-spirited, Kamala was continually humiliated in her deepest feminine instincts, and con\u00ac sequently developed a growing sense of futility.\nNor, in these early years of tension and repression, were Kamala\u2019s relations with Jawaharlal cloudless. Theirs was not love in spring. He did not suspect her distress and fear of inadequacy, and after . was so engrossed in public affairs that the result was emotional reluctance. It is curious how little she figures in his jail diaries of the 'twenties. Different in temperament and up\u00ac bringing, deliberate adjustment was required from both sides and a special effort from Kamala to raise her personality to his level, if their marriage was to succeed. But from the start she was dogged with sickness. Their daughter, Indira, was born in November ; but thereafter her health slowly slid down\u00ac hill. Tuberculosis was first diagnosed in  and, despite varied treatment and a long stay in Europe, took firm root. In  a son was born prematurely and after two days; and three years later she suffered a miscarriage.\n\" \u2018Added to this were the strains of national politics, with the family often scat\u00ac tered, Jawaharlal for long stretches in prison and the house frequently searched and property attached. It was no wonder that not only did her health sharply deteriorate, from about , but she became increasingly neurotic.\nYet, despite all these stresses and disadvantages, Kamala s life was, in its own way, one of happiness and achievement. Never a simpering consort, she slowlyroseabove her surroundings and grew in mindand character till she could derive joy and companionship from her married life. The moody self-pity and death-wish, induced by being bedridden for months at a time, were shaken off. Illness was no longer stagnation but an impetus to energy. That she had not received a regular education was a handicap she felt sorely. 'Today in this world only the educated are honoured. People do not want to talk to those who are uneducated; indeed dose relatives and even husbands do not wish to talk to them. Undersuch conditions the lives of the girls become unbearable; and then will it be a life or a curse?\u2019 This disadvantage too she surmounted in her own life;buttheeducMtonofwon^il becameto her a part of the struggle for freedom.\n The facts aboutKamels Nehru\u2019s health arederived front Jawaharlal\u2019s note on the subject written for the doctors .in May .\n ToSyed Mahmud froth Geneva,  November , original in Utdu.\nDEATH OF KAMALA NEHRU\n\n\u2018Daily I grow more determined that on my return, taking your wife along with me, I shall urge Indian women to have faith in God and fight for their own freedom \u2014 and educate their daughters so that they may not be in trouble like us and may be able to win independence for their country and end Hindu* Muslim conflict.\u2019\nIt was more than mere faith in God and works of charity in the Ramakrishna Mission and similar institutions which gave her strength and scope for service. She was formally enrolled into the Mission as a lay follower,but did not adopt the life of a recluse. Social action of a more exciting kind called her, and she trained herself not only to endure the separations from Jawaharlal but to parti\u00ac cipate in the struggle. Though ill, her courage never failed. Oik of Jawaharlal\u2019s keenest experiences ofsatisfaction was when she was arrested in  and went to jail with a statement which was an unconscious blend of self-confidence and commitment to him. Even during her last months, the impression she left on Palme Dutt was of a woman of strength and perception: \u2018a wonderful person\u2019, with enormous directness, clarity of political vision and burning desire to serve \u2014 and with such influence over her husband that Palme Dutt was con\u00ac vinced that\u2018with her death some of his backbone went out of him.\u2019\nGradually, as time passed, their relationship had matured. His early lack of serious interest was replaced first by a light-hearted, protective loyalty and then by acommitment which was stronger than passion and warmer than considera\u00ac tion. In Sri Lanka in  they had discovered each other again, and realized that their marriage had neither broken nor tarnished. Stricken by his past neglect, he allowed Kamala to move slowly from the fringes towards the centre of his life, till, by the end, as even the unimaginative police department recog\u00ac nized, he was a\u2018devoted husband\u2019. Many women, drawn by his charm or driven by snobbery, made claims on him and, especially after Kamala\u2019s death, sought to thrust themselves into his life; and he did not always firmly resist their gross ardours. Yet, despite occasional dalliances, Kamala was the only woman who ever meant anything to him; and he kept her image unsullied. \u2018Kamala five years\u2019 runs the single-line entry in his pocket diary on  February . He kept in his bedroom or his jail cell, along with her photograph, a small portion of her ashes, and requested that they be mingled with hisown after his death. As far as he was concerned, the wound of her death never healed; but, of course, the wounds which do not heal are usually those which have remorse festering in them.\nSo, over the years, Kamala had evolved anequal human relationship with her husband. Writing two years after her death, Jawaharlal acknowledged that she,\n'To Syed Mahmud from Brighton, June , original in Urdu.\nP.

If a successful struggle foe self-aware nessand self-emancipation is the true testofgreatness, thenKamala ranks among the greatest of the Nehrus.\nMessages of condolence swamped him, from the Secretary of State and the Viceroy as well as from humble Congress workers add friends in various parts of the world. \u2018How shall I console you\u2019, wired Gandhi, \u2018all our hearts with you. Godgiveyoupeace love Bapu\u2019. Another message is also worthy of remembrance. \u2018You will not\u2019, wrote Naomi Mitchison, \u2018have made the mistake of importing human qualities like justice and mercy into the universe: one has to go to deeper principles less easy to understand.\u2019 These were no routine messages, for to Jawaharlal the loss was severe. The child-wife he had married on his father\u2019s directive had become in twenty years a brave and true comrade whose death left him lonely and desolate.\nThe publication of Jawaharlal\u2019s Autobiography in the spring of , only a few weeks after the death of Kamala, gave the world an inkling of his nature and enabled it to share his sorrow. All the reviews in Britain, including those in Conservative journals, immediately recognized the book\u2019s importance and quality. It was not surprising that friends like Ellen Wilkinson, Edward Thomp\u00ac sonand H. N. Brailsford hailed it as a basic utteranceofoneof the few great men of the time; but even those whodisapproved of Jawaharlal\u2019s politics commended it. The life, the man, the witness, all seem to have imposed a paralysing humility on the critics. Any understanding, wrote The Economist, of the last fifteen years in Indiawas incomplete without reading it; Sir StanleyJleed thought it an exceptional book; \u2018a book to read\u2019, said The Timesp \u2018however much one may disagree with the outlook of the author.\u2019 It was an essential document of the period, a key to the ideas and politics of a whole new world. Here was a man who spoke and thought in the language of modernity and reason, whom, unlike Gandhi, the West could understand, a man like\u2018themselves who happened to find himself on the other side. His individual vision was of general interest and universal value. In this, the first important first-hand account of the modern phase of Asian nationalism, Jawaharlal showed that in India it was a civilized, responsible movement that owed as much to the principles of European revolu\u00ac tion and the liberalism and nonconformity of Britain as to the Indian context.\n'Note for John Gunther,  March .\nOn this point she was clear-sighted even about Gandhi: \u2018there is no one else like Gandhi in the world, but as regards women\u2019s rights he is nobetter than other men.\u2019 Letter to Jawaharlal (in Hindi),\n October .\nSee his statement to the press,  March ; The Discovery ofIndia (Calcutta, ), p. . U July .\n*The Spectator,  May .\n\u2018 April .\nDeathof kamaia nehru\n*\nSo the Autobiography, despite being a long and serious book, became a best\u00ac seller and within weeks ran into many editions \u2014 though unfortunately lor Jawaharlal his publisher. The Bodley Head, soon after went into liquidation.\nThe book was characteristic of Jawaharlal. It was honest and introspective. Standing almost outside himself he commented frankly on the society and age in which he lived, on the people he had known and on his own mental develop\u00ac ment. The book is not awooden narrative ofevents; nor is it, like Gandhi's auto\u00ac biography, a part of confessional literature. Jawaharlal was too undemonstra\u00ac tive, too repelled by any trace of exhibitionism* to interest the world primarily in himself. Indeed theAutobiography is inone sense a tourdoforce in that, after over  dose-knit pages, his privacy remains unbroken. It is a reverie on the context into which he had been thrown, and of his reactions to it. If a portrait ofa personality, wistful, complex and ofindrawn tension, caught in its own inte\u00ac grity, is gradually built up, it is almost as a by-product. But what Jawaharlal did set out to tell was of the Indian condition and of British rule, which hurt both his feelings and his intelligence by forcing the large majority of his countrymen to live in sordid and brutal drcumstances. The reader found himsdf in the pre\u00ac sence of great moral and historical issues as seen through the eyes of a refined and humane man.\nWhat further helped to gain a wide audience for the Autobiography was its prose style. It was a dear, fluent bode, \u2018an excellent substitute for a novel\u2019, written withterse, nervous elegance and control ofphrase and with a wideknow\u00ac ledgeofEnglish writing, old and new. It showed amindof intdlectual and moral quality, freeofdicheemotions, butattractivelyreplete with half-tones, subtleties and diffidences. In later years, Jawaharlal often spoke of the Autobiography as having \u2018dated\u2019. It has, of course, \u2018dated\u2019 in the sense that it deals with a period that is deed. But the book has not lost its freshness as a piece of craftsmanship and as the expression of a sensitive human being.\nMoreover, Jawaharlal wrote with detachment. There was sdf-scrutiny and self-criticism but no self-pity. The hardships he had opted for were taken for granted. Theattemptwas not at self-justification but at justification to himsdf. Estranged from hisownpeople by being soaked in the exploiter\u2019s culture, he was a mixed-up being, yearning for roots and struggling toworkout his own destiny. Tortured by doubt, impressivein his indecision, agonizingover all rides of every question,alwaysasking towhatend was the long, wearying struggle, heprovided a picture of warm am] vulnerable humanity.. Jawaharlal made no daim to be exceptional; rather, he was a natural disciple with a taste for heroes. He dupg to thosewhowould determine his intdlectual uncertainties.

The bond of mutual confidence between him and Gandhi was also seen as an iron corset, supporting but confining. He confessed to his repeated display of weakness at critical moments, to his frequent surrender of judgment to personal loyalties, to his dedication to purpose and principle rather than to doctrine and definition. *\nJawaharlal was not strong in analytic thought and the book provides no pro\u00ac found ideas or philosophy. Such ideas as he had were intellectual impulses rather than logical constructions. Even his Marxism was vague and confused, for his ideology was to a large extent based more on sympathy thanon conviction. But heborewitness toapassionate commitment to nationalism, though in nonarrow sense, to an awareness of world forces, and to a total personal integrity. Bom to wealth and an easy life, he had been forced by the situation into the world outside.

Fastidious and lonely by instinct, he had taken to politics and become indifferent to all else because he cared about the human scene and was disturbed by the ugliness and stupidityof the world. Thedeep personal affections he could give he had almost stifled. His sense of the essential pushed private life to the background, and led to a conscious withholding of emotion. Out of the pages of the Autobiography rises, almost, it would seem, against Jawaharlal\u2019s will, the story of the slow development of what was by the end a happy marriage; and its tragic close was revealed in the six brief words of the dedication, \u2018To Kamala, who is no more*.\nThe whole book was written in jail at a time when writing was at once a dis\u00ac cipline, an indulgence and a solace. But there is no bitterness against the British. The book was not abrasive; it had no rant or claptrap. Jawaharlal's quarrel was not with the foreign ruler but with systems \u2014 with imperialism, with capital\u00ac ism, with the social evils of religion. Such bitterness and contemptuous wit as hedoesdisclose he reserves for some of his fellow-Indians. The Liberals who, as he thought, concealed behind platitudes and compromises a low-minded oppor\u00ac tunism, came in for sharp derision. Gandhi, who read the book in manuscript, suggested that these portions be revised; but Jawaharlal left them as they were. TheLiberate were naturally resentful, it is an insufferable book\u2019, wrote Jayakar to Sapru, \u2018full of self-laudation .. . There is nothing in that book which is illuminating or exalting ... the vapourings of a half-baked politician.\u2019 Right- wing Congressmen, whose thinking and attitudes were alien to him, Jawaharlal had tended to ignore. There is no mention, for example, throughout the book, of Rajagopalachari. Their reactionwassummed upin the review by K.MMunshi, who described Jawaharlal as being scarcely in tune with the \u2018soul of India\u2019 (whatever that mightbe) and criticized him for having time and again destroyed the possibility of immediate gains by insisting on independence and socialism.\n\u2018MaMtevaDeui to Jawaharlal,  December .\n* May . Sapru papers.\nDEATH OF KAMALA NEHRU \nBut most Indian readers, drawn from the middle classes, were able to identify themselves with Jawaharlal in his expression of the hopes and obstacles of a whole generation.\nAfter his wife\u2019s death, Jawaharlal returned to India, resisting, on the way, the blandishments of Mussolini who sent a personal message of sympathy and sought to inveigle Jawaharlal into an interview while in transit at Rome airport. \u2019It was a most embarrassing and ticklish affair but I survived it with a display of extreme tact and firmness.\u2019 He brought back Kamala\u2019s ashes and immersed all \u2014butthefew he retained \u2014 atthe Sangam in Allahabad. \u2018Despite his courage, Pandit Jawaharlal was visibly moved as he immersed the ashes in the waters of the two mighty rivers.\u2019\nJawaharlal sought to smother the inner emptiness in work. Many years later he wrote to a friend who had suffered a like bereavement, \u2018those who have had similar experiences, and I am one of them, can understand to some extent the sorrow that comes to one. The only way to deal with it, so I found, is to apply oneself with greater earnestness to the causes for which one has stood.\u2019 But the emotional strain was never far below the surface. Leading the Party\nDuring Jawaharlal\u2019s absence in Europe he had been elected president of the Congress for . The decision was, as usual, primarily that of Gandhi. The main issue before the Congress was whether they should contest the e^ctions and accept office in the provinces under the new Government of India Act. Jawaharlal\u2019s views on the subject were well known. He regarded the Act as deliberately designed to strengthen all the vested and reactionary elements in India, and acceptance of office under this Act would be a retrogade step which might well lead to the disintegration of the Congress and obstruction of a civil disobedience campaign at any early date. Gandhi too seems to have been of this view, despite the persuasion ofJRajagopalachari and Ansari, and therefore was keenthatJawaharlal should once again accept the responsibility, even if it meant that many senior leaders would feel unable to follow his leadership. \u2018Your presidency is the lightest thing that could have happened for the country.\u2019 TheWorking Committee accepted Gandhi\u2019s suggestion as theonlywayof avoid\u00ac ing bitter controversy. The new constitution of the Congress would enable Jawaharlal to pick his own committee, and even those who could not support him agreed to stand by and give his policies a fair and unobstructed trial.\nIn Europe, Jawaharlal\u2019s hostility to the Act and his radical tendencies had been strengthened. He paid short visits to England in November  and January , when temporary improvements in Kamala\u2019s condition permitted him to leave her bedside. He had not wanted to do Sb, for his mind rebelled against social relations with those responsible for the nightmare years of oppres\u00ac sion in India. But Gandhi encouraged him to go.\nUnlike in Paris, where he happily discussed Hinduism with Malraux and conditions in Russia with Gide, in London he could not avoid politics. He de\u00ac clined to meet any member of the British Government and took no initiative in\n'Gandhi to Jawaharlal.

Evenso, hisfewdaysinLondon were crowded with talks with politicians of every variety. What impressed Jawaharlal was the personal friendliness as well as the general boredom over the Indian question. The presence of a representative from Scotland Yard by his side from the moment he landed at Dover constantly reminded Jawaharlal, even ifhewereinclined toforget, that hewas in a sense a ticket-of-leaveman with partof a sentence still hanging over him. But the British publicgave him awarm welcome.Therewasgeneral andgreat appreciationofhimas a man. The reporter for The Tribune was lyrical.\nWhen the man stepped out of the train there was almost a hush. I saw a beautifully featured pale face, cast in a classic mould; certainly one of the most dignified and truly aristocratic faces I have ever seen. I heard a soft and mellow voice. I felt, as everybody who has ever met him must feel, that Jawaharlal is a Presence and in an immeasurable degree much more than a politician.\nThe modesty of Jawaharlal, his lack of bitterness and his commitment to ideals, the sadness of mien born of imminent sorrow and past suffering, the difficulty he- experienced in even articulating his speeches after nearly four years in jail, the dazzlement by the light after long darkness, madea deep impact. \u2018Few in the House of Commonsseemed to care\u2019, wrote Hannen Swaffer in John Bull, \u2018butwhenyou went there the other day, oneof the world\u2019s bravest spirits \u2014 one embodied in your slight retiring frame \u2014 was within the walls of the Palace ofWestminster . . . Although you were heard by only a few people in England, you left behind you a great inspiration. If all the reformers in this country were as calmly valiant as you, a new hope would dawn in the minds of oppressed millions.\u2019 But Jawaharlal knew that smiles, good humour and personal approval did not carry far. Even the members of the Labour Party, by and large, with all their theoretical dislike of imperialism, moved in its orbit and felt powerless to step out of it. It did not therefore seem possible to avoid conflict with the British, and all one could hope for was a little more civility in ordinary life and less brutality in battle. So he was more at ease talking to intellectuals and literary figures than to politicians. The discerning account of Jawaharlal in London, provided by Leonard Woolf, makes this dear.\nI liked Nehru very much as a man; he was an intellectual of the intel\u00ac lectuals, on the surface gentle and sad. He had great charm and, though  Even to this, however, there were exceptions. A. G. Fraser, principal of the Achimota College in what was then the Gold Coast, invited Jawaharlal to dinner at his dob. The secretary of the club objected to Jawaharlal appearing in the public dining room. Fraser resigned from the dub and arranged thedinner in a privateroom in a hotel. See Jawaharlal\u2019s note to Secretary-Generfl, Ministry of External Affairs,  May , Nehru papers.  November . Noteon a visit to England,  February .\n\nJAWAHARLAt NEHRU\nthere was a congenital aloofness about him, I had no difficulty in talking to him. It was a rather strange and inconclusive conversation. I had thought and still think that he had intended to discuss politics and, in particular, Imperial politics from the Labour'angle with me. And in a vague way we did talk politics, the problems of India and Ctylon; but it was pretty vague and somehow or other we slipped into talking about life and books rather than the fall of empire or empires . . .*\nThe most lasting impression on Jawaharlal was made not by any Englishman but by Krishna Menon, whom he then met for the first time. 'He is very able and energetic and is highly thought of in intellectual, journalistic and left wing labour circles. He has the virtues and failings of the intellectual.\u2019\nHowever, it so happened that at Lausanne Jawaharlal met by chance Ben Bradley, who was also a patient at the dime, and Palme Dutt who had come to see Bradley. Palme Dutt and Jawaharlal spent three days together, and the British Communist found the \u2018Professor\u2019, as Jawaharlal was known in Comin\u00ac tern circles, very receptive. He agreed that the Congress was, on the whole, moving towards the right, but was himself willing to work in dose collabora\u00ac tion with the communists. He was not well read in Marxism but was persuaded of its validity and emotionally indined toward it. He also had a deep admiration for the achievements of the Soviet Union. Russia was the land of the future. \u2018With all its defects and mistakes and ruthlessness, it is taking visible, vital shape there, stumbling occasionally but ever marching forward.\u2019 He hoped that some variation of the political and economic systems prevalent in Russia would extend to India, but hewas not prepared to have this by coercive methods. \u2018I do not want India to be drilled and forced into a certain position, because the costs of such drilling are too great; it is not worth while; it is not desirable from manypoints of view. \u2019 Gvil liberties were to Jawaharlal of absolute value, and the communists had to reckon with this. Jawaharlal was not a MarxistJn the normal senseofthe word. He accepted the Marxist interpretation of history and its vision of a classless society, but he certainly did not believe in revolu\u00ac tionary dictatorship. Conditioned under Gandhi, he hated violence even if he did not in theory reject it, and stood for democratic and peaceful though not for constitutional means. But with these reservations, Jawaharlal, according to Palme Dutt, promised that he would, as president of the Congress, do all he could to promote the Communist Party in India, and he even gave a series of specific undertakings as to what he would try to do.\nDownhillAU tba Way (London, ), pp. -.\nJToRajendra Prasad, November , HomeDept.

In  Jawaharlal, \u2018a candidate well placed for becoming the Indian Kerensky\u2019, had been expelled from the League against Imperialism. \u2018Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019, ran the resolution, \u2018has become traitor to the cause of the emancipa\u00ac tion of the people of India from the British imperialist yoke; it [the League] stigmatises his desertion to the camp of counter-revolution before the broad masses of India and expels him from its ranks,\u2019 In subsequent years, as part of the policy of refusing to work with bourgeois nationalist parties, the com\u00ac munists had condemned him vehemently for his \u2018left reformism\u2019 and as one of \u2018the most dangerous enemies in the struggle for independence\u2019. Bradley himself had criticized Jawaharlal for trying to stem the rising peasant movement with vague talk of socialism and communism. But by the summer of  there had been a shift in Soviet and international communist policy. The call was now for popular fronts. In India, said Dimitrov, speaking at the seventh congress of the Third International, the communists had to support, extend and parti\u00ac cipate in all anti-imperialist mass activities, not excluding those under national reformist leadership. The interview given by Jawaharlal over two years before, declaring that the choicelay between communism and fascism and he preferred the former, was now reported with approval.\nThe details of what the communists hoped for from Jawaharlal in India can be discerned in an article by Palme Dutt and Bradley. It was conceded that the Congress was the principal mass organization of diverse elements seeking national liberation in India: but it was not yet the united front of the Indian people. To achieve this, its constitution, programme and leadership would all have to be revised and strengthened. Workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 unions and other such organizations should be brought into the joint struggle either in a united front or by collective affiliation to the Congress. The constitution of the Con\u00ac gressshould beamended to permit such collective affiliation at the local, district, provincial and national levels, and joint bodies should be set up immediately. There should also be provision for greater initiative of the rank and file within the Congress in place of the hierarchical structure dominated by the Working Committee. Centralized direction was of course vital in a struggle; but it ought to be based not on personal dictatorship but on democratic centralism. The dogma of non-violence was a weakness which should be omitted from the Con\u00ac gress creed; but while a sharp ideological struggle should be conducted on this question, it was not so important that it should be allowed to split the national front. The elections should be fought jointly by the front in such a way as to provide sufficient representation for the left-wing elements and to enable the demands of the masses to be clearly expressed. The chief demand, the positive\n* Saperov in the Bolsbtvik in , quoted in Druhe, op. cit., p. .\n*The Background in India', LabourMonthly, March .\n IntemationalPress Correspondence,  January .\nPalme Dutt andBradley, TheAnti-Imperialist People\u2019s Front in India\u2019, LabourMoMbly, March .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nslogan of the front, would be for a Constituent Assembly freely elected by uni versal suffrage.\nIt is dear that this artide was written after the talks with Jawaharlal at Lausanne, and stated what Palme Dutt and Bradley bdieved to have been ac\u00ac cepted byJawaharlal as the common programme for which he would strive. He wasforajoint front against imperialism; indeed, he regarded the Congress under Gandhi as already in essence such a front which only required to be widened. He also continued to favour a Constituent Assembly; and the communists, reversing their earlier condemnation of this idea, now accepted this. But he was not ready to abandon Gandhi\u2019s leadership or the method of non-violence. Quite apart from its ethical aspect, non-violence had helped to preserve India from civil conflict and to tone down indigenousopposition to the national movement. The concession in the article of Dutt and Bradley that, though non-violence was outmoded, its rejection was not a fundamental issue, was obviously made with Jawaharlal\u2019s attitude inmind. AsforGandhi, as Palme Dutt reports it, Jawahar\u00ac lal had confessed that he felt in his nature an aristocrat; he was sorry for the Indian people, it moved his heart to see them turn to him for guidance, but he lacked the common touch and could not get as close to them as Gandhi did, though even Gandhi was not of the masses. This, according to Jawaharlal, was the source of his tremendous deference to Gandhi; and his audience doubtless recognized that, by its very nature, it could not be set aside for intellectual reasons. There is corroborative evidence of this overwhelmingly emotional mood of Jawaharlal at this time. He condemned imperialism for its horrors, its indecency and vulgarity as much as for its exploitation, and appreciated Gandhi above all for the psychological transformation he had wrought in the Indian people. In an article written at about this time in answer to Indian left-wing criticism of Gandhi, Jawaharlal contended that Gandhi had played a revolu\u00ac tionary role in India because he had reached the heart of the masses while groups with a more advanced ideology had functioned largely in the air.\nNow the Congress awaited Jawaharlal\u2019s guidance. Till his return to India, no major decisions had been taken, and the party, as Gandhi described it, was 'literally tacking\u2019. It was for Jawaharlal to end this policy of \u2018non-action and non-thought\u2019. Meeting Gandhi and senior Congressmen before the session at Lucknow, Jawaharlal found considerable support for office acceptance; and he was isolated in the Working Committee. But embarrassment to him was avoided by shelving any firm decision on an issue which would only arise after\n> Noteon a Constituent Assembly for India,  February .\n See Adhikari's thesis February , Impncor, vol. , no. ,  July .\n* Interview with the author,  November .\n* Seehis letters to Lord Lothian,  December and  January .\n*Mahatma Gandhi,  January .\n\u2022To Jawaharlal,  September . ,\nTTo Rajeulra Prasad,  November , Home Dept.

Meantime, reflecting Jawaharlal\u2019s new ideas derived in Europe, the Working Committee agreed that it was desirable to develop closer associa\u00ac tion between the masses and the Congress organization so that they might take their full share in the shaping of Congress policy. It was also decided that the Congress constitution should be revised to make it a joint front of all anti- imperialist elements and enable closer co-operation with organizations of pea\u00ac sants and others.  These resolutions, along with that opposing India\u2019s participa\u00ac tion in any imperialist war,jvere drafted by Jawaharlal and, as he wrote later, increased his confidence in himself. There was nothing very new in substance, but they hinted a new orientation, and generally a more emphatic and radical tone was adopted.  They also delighted the socialists; and the fact that Jawaharlal, though he abstained from formally joining the Congress Socialist Party, was \u2018now a socialist in the full sense of the term,\u2019 gave the socialists great hopes of increasing their influence in the Congress. Jawaharlal might think that they themselves had not adequate support among the masses to talfp over the Congress organization, but he would certainly not allow the Congress to become a mere parliamentary body. The Congress was \u2018in a rut due to idiotic ideas of certain people\u2019, and it should be given a new direction by socialist permeation.\nHowever, it soon became clear that the socialists had overestimated both Jawaharlal\u2019s influence as president and his commitment to them. There was not the faintest suspicion of socialism in any of the resolutions. Despite Jawaharlal\u2019s open opposition the Subjects Committee approved of the Working Committee\u2019s resolution discarding proportional representation in elections to Congress offices, thus eliminating any chances the socialists might have; and this was only set right by the full session of the Congress. He spoke in favour of non-acceptance of office, for the revolutionary as against the reformist mentality, but would not support the socialist amendments committing the Congress to this position because of his desire to prevent a split. Jawaharlal clutched at the avoidance of a decision in his own mind and in the party. He believed that, while making hisown position dear, he should not push the issue to breaking-point. He had been long away, cither in prison or abroad; the hunger for office had grown among his colleagues and could not be just wished off the scene; and Gandhi, though out of tune with this mood, was unwilling to battle with it. Jawaharlal could, in the future, use the office of president to\n Resolutions to be placed before the Lucknow Congress, The Bombay Chronicle,  March and  April . *DSVA,pp. -. * Message to the AlMndia Socialist Conference at Meerut, The Bombay Chronicle,  January .

To seek satisfaction merely in brave ideas was the way of facile intellectual opportunism. The true socialist was no armchair politician but a man of action, utilizing his philosophy and scientific outlook for achievement. The immediate task was the elections, anti this could be used to widen the base of the national movement and develop mass contacts. Indeed, the only thing to be said in favour of the  Act was that it created a wider electorate. To divide the Congress at this stage on a remote issue and weaken its prospects at the polls seemed foolish tactics. Jawaharlal did not face up to the fact that electoral success and the opportunity of forming ministries would in themselves further weaken the position of those in the party of his way of thinking. It would have been far easier to secure a commit\u00ac ment to non-acceptance when the lure of office was not immediate. Postpone\u00ac ment, by the very nature of the situation, transferred the advantage to the other side.\nIn his presidential address Jawaharlal, as was now to be expected of him, analysed the world situation and India\u2019s place in it. Two vast groups faced each other; decaying capitalism, imperialist and fascist, on the one hand and the progressive forces, socialist and nationalist. On the other. British im\u00ac perialism in India also, though still powerful, was showing signs of decay and, in its desire to hold on, was developing an increasingly fascist mentality. The growing intensity of repression required no elaboration, but worthy of special mention was the tremendous deprivation of civil liberties. All this only steeled Jawaharlal to a greater resolve to end this infamy and to have nothing to do with those willing to compromise with such a rule. But in the national movement itself there was a spirit of disunion, a malaise, a stress on petty, internal conflicts. Middle-class leadership was inevitable, but it easily tired if it did not draw strength and inspiration from the masses. The Congress should be not only for the masses but of the masses; only then would it really be for the masses\nSo Jawaharlal argued for the forming of new links which would permit the growthof mass consciousness within the Congress, and the revision of the party constitution for this purpose. The real problem was to join together all the anti\u00ac imperialist forces in the country, to forge a broad front comprising the mass elements as well as the great majority of the middle classes. The primary com\u00ac mittees should be made living organizations, as in the account of Soviet Russia given by the Webbs, and organizations of producers such as trade unions and peasant associations should be affiliated to the Congress or brought into full co-operationwithit. TheCongresscould have a corporate as well as an individual membership. There was no near prospect of direct action or civil disobedience, and theelectionscouldbeusedtocarry the message of the Congress to thepeople. The removal ofsocial and economic burdens and the convening ofa Constituent Assembly to frame a constitution formed the minimum programme, and these\nLEADING THE PARTY\n\ncould not come through the Government of India Act or the legislatures con\u00ac stituted under it. To accept office under the Act which they had rejected was to stand self-condemned, to slide back to static futility and revive the old sterile creed of reformism. National honour and self-respect could not accept this position, for it would inevitably mean co-operation in some measure with the repressive apparatus of imperialism and partnership in the exploitation of the Indian people. The price of office acceptance was surrender. It would be a descent into a pit from which the Congress would find it difficult to come out. The sole purpose of entering the provincial assemblies should be to create deadlocks so as to kill the proposals for federation and make the working of the Act impossible.\nThe address had been written on  March, when Jawaharlal had not known for certain the strength of feeling in the party in favour of office acceptance. That he should have stuck to the written text even after he had virtually been voted down showed courage; but it also made dear how wide a gulf stretched between the president and his followers. The speech, as a whole, mirrored the contradictions in Jawaharlal\u2019s outlook and the weaknesses of his political posi\u00ac tion. He affirmed his Marxist approach, his recognition of the Indian problem as a part of the world problem of capitalist imperialism. The laws of historical development had to be grasped to realize the organic connection of events and changes. \u201cLet us try to develop the historic sense so that we can view current events in proper perspective and understand their real significance.\u2019 The only key to the solution of the world\u2019s problems, and of India\u2019s problems, lay in socialism, \u2019and when I use this word I do so not in a vague humanitarian way but in the scientific, economic sense.\u2019 But immediatdy, in the very next sentence, he moved away from the precise Marxist attitude. \u2019Socialism is, however, some\u00ac thing even more than an economic doctrine; it is a philosophy of life and as such also it appeals to me.\u2019It was not merely the ending of poverty, of vested interests and private property, but a change in instincts and habits and desires, a new civilization such as was being fashioned in Soviet Russia. But it was not just a communist utopia, modelled on the Russian example and to be achieved by any means. The socialist approach in India would have to be adapted to the Indian conditions and speak in the language of the country. Socialism was to Jawaharlal more a tendency than a definable body of doctrine. He was always critical of the Indian communists for their imprisonment within the walls of dogma and for their rigid adherence to the Soviet example. \u2019For you,\u2019 he frequently told them, \u2018history begins with .\u2019 There was much that had happened in the Soviet Union which pained Jawaharlal greatly and he avoided the word com\u00ac munism because in the general understanding it signified Soviet Russia. He was a libertarian Marxist, whose idea of socialism encompassed at every stage a large and irreducible measure of civil liberty. A belief in democracy was the coreoi his socialist attitude. He rejected any mechanical view of human nature andlooked forward to a socialist societywhich, byremovingeconomic and social\nJAWAHARLAL NfiHRU\n#\ninhibitions and obstacles, would provide greater scope for individuality. It was this understanding of socialism which underlay his presidential address; and immediately after the Congress session he established an Indian Civil Liberties Union on non-party lines, with members of all shades of political opinion and even from outside politics. What was happening in many parts of India was beyond the limits of \u2018common decency\u2019 and it was the duty of every public- spirited citizen to protest. For when civil liberties were suppressed a nation lost all vitality and became impotent for anything substantial.\nThedetailsof his programme for action were also not framed wholly to please the socialists, let alone the Marxists and communists. He made it clear that he would not, as president, seek to impose socialism on the Congress, even though it \u2018is a vital creed which I hold with all my head and heart\u2019. He would like the Congress to become a socialist organization but he accepted that the majority in the party were not prepared to go that far; and he would not force the issue on what was basically a nationalist organization and thereby create difficulties in the struggle for independence. Socialism was to him a personal matter; he thereforesawnorolefor himself in the Congress Socialist Party; and as president of the Congress Party he would, without compromising his beliefs, function as a political leader, leading the niajority the way it wanted to go. He cast himself in the mould of Blanqui: \u2018I am their leader, therefore I must follow them.\u2019 And, above all, he had no intention, as he had made clear in Europe to Bradley and Palme Dutt, of moving away from Gandhi; and the address ended with the customary paean to him.\nIt is true that Jawaharlal advocated the two chief proposals now being com\u00ac mended by the communists \u2014 the formation of a joint anti-imperialist front, and the affiliation to the Congress of trade and peasant unions. This gave the Communist Party much satisfaction. \u2018In his presidential address Nehru\u2019s anti\u00ac imperialist voice stammered on some vital points yet it was full-throated on several others, it was a clearer anti-imperialist call than had ever been made from the Congress chair.\u2019 But even here the implementation wasto be very different from what the communists expected. Jawaharlal\u2019s idea of a joint front was not solely an allianceofthe Congress with political organizations ideologically to the left of it. He was thinking as much of the Congress drawing to its side groups which were more conservatively inclined, as at the time of the boycott of the Simon Commission in , and spokeof it as seeking to become 'an All-Parties Conference in permanent session\u2019.* He was willing to co-operate with anybody, irrespective of ideology, whowas opposed to imperialism; and within a few days of the Lucknow session he beganr negotiations with Pandit Malaviya, whose\n\u2018Speech at Allahabad,  May, TheBombay Chronicle, May and talk in Bombay, The Bombay Chronicla,  May .\nStatement of the Politbureau of die Central Committee of the Communist Party of India,  July b\n*Speedj it Bombay, TbsBombay Chronicle, May .\nLEADING THE PARTY \noutlook in politics was frankly communal, for an electoral alliance with his Nationalist Party. Jawaharlal\u2019s general indifference to communal issues and his belief that they would be submerged once the emphasis was shifted to economic matters affecting the common people enabled him to ignore the communal tinge in organizations which were otherwise opposed to the British and were prepared to join him in the campaign for civil liberties. As for the affiliation of peasant and worker associations, this was watered down by the Working Committee to the constitution of a small committee to consider the promotion of closer contacts between the Congress and the masses; and this in turn became the need to grant greater responsibilities to the primary com\u00ac mittees of the Congress so as to make them living bodies.\nSo left-wing forces had cause to be disappointed with the Lucknow Congress. Jawaharlal\u2019s speech was heart-warming, and his personal standing in the party and the country was second only to that of Gandhi. But he had not even sought to assert thestrengthof his position. He had, at the end of the session, considered resignation and informed the delegates that having sat on a high pedestal for three days he was nowgoing back to oblivion. But he later decided not to precip- >r:atc matters. So it was the \u2018old guard\u2019 which had been successful. It had been, as Satyamurti, the Congressman from Madras, gloated, the triumph of Gandhism over socialism. G. D. Birla crowed:\nMahatmaji kept his promise and without his uttering a word, he saw that no new commitments were made. Jawaharlalji\u2019s speech in a way was thrown into the waste paper basket because all the resolutions that were passed were against the spirit of his speech ... He could have caused a split by resigning but he did not... Jawaharlalji seems to be like a typical English,democrat who takes defeat in a sporting spirit. He seems to be out for giving expression to his ideology, but he realises that action is impos\u00ac sible and so does not press for it.\nAs Gandhi himself observed in a letter which was seen by Jawaharlal, their ways were different and Gandhi accepted hardly any of Jawaharlal\u2019s methods. He would strain every nerve to avoid a class war; so perhaps would Jawaharlal but he did not think it possible to avoid it. \u2018But though Ik is extreme in his presentation of his methods, he is sober in action ... Whatever he does, he will do it nobly. Though the gulf between us as to the outlook upon life has undoubtedlywidened,wehavenever been so near each other in hearts as perhaps we are today.\u2019\n Letter to M. M.

Even they owed their appointment not to Jawaharlal but to Gandhi,who thought these socialists would be useful in weakening the support which the terrorists commanded among the younger generation; and these three were selected on the ground that they were socially acceptable.* Jawaharlal thought it vulgar and inappro\u00ac priate to thrust his views, however deeply held, on a party in which he and his followers were in a minority, and created for himself what was in many ways the role of an ineffective president. Rafi Ahmad Kidwai, devoted to Jawaharlal and sharing hisviewsbutnota member of the Socialist Party, was expected to replace Acharya Kripalani of the right wing as general secretary; he was not even included in the Committee. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, the only member of the old Working Committee who had on occasions joined Jawaharlal in opposing office acceptance, was now dropped. Nor, surprisingly, was any woman included. The three socialist members realized that they would have little influence in the Committee, but agreed to serve out of personal loyalty to Jawaharlal.\nPowerful as the presidential address was as an attack on imperialism, the Government felt that they would be unable to sustain a prosecution on it. In the months that followed, while Jawaharlal toured the country addressing scores of meetings and \u2018simultaneously carrying on war at various fronts\u2019, the authorities, regarding him as \u2018a potential danger of the first magnitude\u2019, followed him round with their notebooks seeking carefully but in vain for any statement that would justify his arrest and ensure a long sentence. Instead, they had to console themselves with the thought that his preaching of socialism was weakening the Congress and this would be reflected in the elections.  \u2018Indeedweshould keep him in cotton wool and pamper him, for he is unwittingly smashing the Congress organization fiom the inside.\u2019 This hope was again to be belied. But the Government were right to the extent that his speeches frightened jnany in the Congress and outside. He started what was virtually a country-wide election campaign in Bombay with a bang. The Congress was contesting the elections and entering the assemblies in order to combat the Act and render it unworkable. As to how this should be done, there was as yet no agreement; but he himself was convinced that acceptance of office would weaken their movement. The first and immediate issue was political, the\nAuthor's interview with Achyut Patwardhan,  April .\nSee statement of the executivecommittee of theCongress SocialistParty,  April, The Bombay Chronicla,  April .\n\u2019To Ellen Wilkinson,  June .\nHomeSecretary to all Local Govts..

He believed that socialism was inevitable for the solution of India's prime problem of poverty and degradation but he had no wish to force the issue. If he talked about it now, it was solely to educate the people so that they would be in a better position to decidewhen the issue came up. Socialism \u2014 and here Jawa- harlal\u2019sdivergence from the communists was dear \u2014 could not be imposed on India. Violence was abominable to him and he hoped that socialism would be attained with the support of the vast majority and the least harm to anyone. Compensation should be paid, though not in full, at least partially, to propertied and vested interests. However, there might be upheavals if resistance to eco\u00ac nomic progress developed, and he doubted if the rich in India were wise enough to avoid this.\nSuch unhesitant exposition of his intellectual and emotional commitment to the socialist ideal naturally roused resentment. Bombay was the heart of \u2018big business\u2019 and there were reactive tremors to \u2018the storm of communism\u2019 that was passing over the city. Twenty-one leading businessmen issued a manifesto condemning Jawaharlal\u2019s \u2018destructive and subversive programme\u2019 which, ac\u00ac cording to them, would create disorders and impede the achievement of self- government. Jawaharlal\u2019s reply was vigorous.\nI have hardly mentioned socialism except incidentally, but I have laid stress on the amazing poverty of our people, the vast unemployment of our peasants and workers and middle class, on the progressive deteriora\u00ac tion of all classes except the handful at the top. That has been my sin in the eyes of that handful. But that is the only future that comes before my eyes when I think of India. I cannot rid myself of it, try as I may. It is not a pleasant picture. I do not like it, and as I see it, sometimes my blood freezeswithin me and sometimes it boils with indignation that such things should be.\nHe accused Indian capitalists of creating Indian fascism, which was the ally of British imperialism. Their attack on his socialist views was merely a facade for attacking the Congress and the national movement. As the Congress be\u00ac came increasingly a lower-middle-class and mass organization, the upper strata of Indian society were drawing closer to the foreign rulers. As the struggle for freedom grew more intense, one was either for or against; there was no room for third parties or a middle course. Indian capitalists had supported the Govern\u00ac ment in seeking to repress civil disobedience and break the boycott. They had defended the ordinances, they had reached agreements with foreign textile interests and they had sent their representatives to those sessions of the Round\n\u25a0 \u2018Speeches end statements at Bombay, The Bombay Chronicle,  and \u2018a Mmv <HA SirCowasji Jehangir in The BombayChronicle,  May .\n* Manifesto of the ', The Tribune,  May .\n\u00ab Reply to Critics!, The Tribune,  June .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nTable Conference which had been shunned by the Congress. For them to speak nowof their share in the national movement and of his weakening it was there\u00ac fore an impertinence.\nThe more intelligent among the businessmen realized that to promote a public debate with Jawaharlal was to invite humiliation. \u2018You have rendered no service to your caste men. It is curious how we businessmen are so short\u00ac sighted . . . It looks very crude for a man with property to say that he is opposed to expropriation in the wider interest of the country.\u2019 It would be obviously far more effective to strengthen the opposition to Jawaharlal within the Con\u00ac gress. Jawaharlal had been unfair to the Indian capitalist class in castigating them as allies of the British imperialists. Though heavily dependent on them, the Indian capitalists had not been their junior partners. They had, on the other hand, supported the non revolutionary, right-wing elements in the anti\u00ac imperialist camp;  and they now looked to these men to deal with Jawaharlal. They left it to Vallabhbhai Patel and others to remind the president of the party that he represented a very small section of minority opinion and had no mandate to make such a severe onslaught on the ideological hegemony of propertied interests. Patel, Rajendra Prasad and Rajagopalachari objected as strongly to Jawaharlal\u2019s speeches in Bombay as any of the capitalists, and appealed to the grand master Gandhi, who called on Jawaharlal for an explanation. They could not openly object to his crusade for socialism, but they criticized his under\u00ac rating of khaddar and his suggestion that the responsibility for not including women in the Working Committee was not his. Jawaharlal replied that, though technically he was responsible for the decision, the Committee as it took shape was not of his making; and Gandhi retorted that he was not satisfied with the answer. Yet, on the main issue, Jawaharlal was unrepentant; and he toured the Punjab making the same points with equal vehemence. The political battle for independence was the first priority, but after freedom was won, socialism was bound to come. \u2018The whole economic structure will crash and there will be upheavals which no human power can avert, the capitalist system will go and along with it the British Empire, this is how I visualise the happenings of the next ten years.\u2019\nThe public response was enthusiastic. \u2018I am being attacked and criticized\u2019, wrote Jawaharlal to Krishna Menon, \u2018by a variety of people, Big Business, Lib\u00ac erals, Responsivists, someCongressmen and of courseour beloved Government.\n Speechesand interviews, The Bombay Chronicle, ,, and  May .\n*G.

It is a tiring business to carry onwarsonnumerousfrontsandtherearefew to help. But Icarryon. The process is not without its exhilaration.' But at Wardha, when the Working Committee metin the firstweek of July, Jawaharlal was plainly rebuked by Gandhi and the others. Rajendra Prasad, on behalf of the right wing, wrote to Jawaharlal criticizing him severely and the latter offered to resign and submit the dispute to the AICC for discussion. Today there is no loyalty of the spirit which binds ourgroup together. It is a mechanical group and on either side there is a sense of suppression and that, as every student of psychology knows, results in all manner of undesirable complexes, both individual and social.\u2019 But Gandhi pulled him up for arrogance, intolerance and lack of a sense of humour. 'You are in office by their unanimous choice but you are not in power yet. To put you in office was an attempt to find you in power quicker than you would otherwise have been.\u2019 Jawaharlal should therefore cease wrangling and the 'tragi-comedy\u2019 hewas playing and not destroy himself by moving openly into opposition.\nJawaharlal meekly submitted and publicly acknowledged his responsibility for the exclusion of women from the Committee. Objection having also been taken to his appointment of young socialists in the AICC office, his enthusiasm for building up the central office was checked. His speeches also were thereafter all in a lower key, and lacked, as Jayakar gleefully reported to Sapru, 'the trium\u00ac phant freshness* of his earlier performances. He now gave greater emphasis tothepartwhichthe Congresshadplayed in involving thepeasants in the national movement, and made claims for the party and its leader which he himself could not have seriously believed. The Congress was not, olcourse, socialistic, but it no longer ignored economic issues; and whenever a conflict of interests emerged it was always willing to sacrifice the interests which clashed with those of the masses. The socialist outlook, which the Congress had been stress\u00ac ing since Gandhi took it over, helped in the political struggle by clearing the issues and strengthening the role of the masses. These bore reserves of power and a deep unrest, a hunger that gnawed and required satisfaction; and it was because the Congress promised to provide the satisfaction that the people came in their thousands to hear its leaders. No socialist imagined that socialism could have any place in India before political freedom had been established. Indeed, no longer stressing the inevitability of socialism, Jawaharlal accepted that after independence socialism could come only if India were ripe for it and the great majority of people desired it. Those who believed in socialism could not assume an attitude, of superior knowledge and make of themselves a sect apart. Their correct understanding of history and of social change was not\n Jawaharlal to Gandhi,  July ; Gandhi to Jawaharlal,  July,  July and  July .  Tb\u00bb Bombay Cbronicl*,  July .   July , Sapru papers.\n JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nenough; they had to justify themselves in other ways and seek to win over to theirwayof thinking others in the Congress and the country at large.\nIfJawaharlalgavewayto the pressure of the right wing, it could not have been for the personal reasons which Gandhi elaborated. By now Jawaharlal was as indispensable to the Congress as the party was to him. He commanded, even before his election tours gave him a wide popular appeal, the support of large sections of radical youth who, but for him, would have left the Congress for left- wing parties. Even the Congress Socialist Party might have broken away from the parent body. Throughout India there were men and women who, along with nationalist feeling, had developed a conscience on economic matters, who saw in Jawaharlal the spokesman of their viewpoint, and who, because of him, followed the lead of the Congress even if they did not belong to it. He was, too, the only Indian politician who had an international audience, and it was he who secured for the party recognition on the world stage. Had Jawaharlal, therefore, insisted in the summer of  on resigning the presidency, it is difficult to believe that Gandhi and his followers would have been short\u00ac sighted enough to let him do so. But it was not just that it did not lie in Jawaharlal\u2019s nature to precipitate such a conflict and to safeguard his political chastity at the price of weakening the nationalist organization. The psycholo\u00ac gical hankering to follow Gandhi and the ingrained loyalty to the party were only part of the explanation. Jawaharlal knew that there was no working-class leader\u00ac ship or even an alternative elite leadership available; and so long as this was the case, it would be disastrous to weaken the Congress. And, as ever, his col leagues took advantage of this.\nMeantime, as the mimic war of the elections drew nearer, Jawaharlal gave it increasing attention. The election manifesto of the Congress, largely drafted by him, rejected the Act of  and the Communal Award that went with it. The only purpose of sending Congressmen to the legislatures was to seek to end the Act; but how thiswas to be done, and whether office should be accepted or not, would be considered after the elections. The economic programme of the Congressremained in essence the resolution on fundamental rights passed at Karachi: land reforms, reduction of rent and revenue and an equitable adjust\u00ac ment of the burden on agricultural land, and reasonable standards of living and of working conditions for industrial labour. Jawaharlal excluded any reflec\u00ac tion in the manifesto of socialist doctrine. His weakness he justified to himself by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the rapid drive to a world war which made it all the more necessary to see the Indian problem in perspective as part of the world struggle and concentrate on the fight against imperialism. Before criticizing him, it should be remembered that the socialist members of the Working Committee also raised no objection to the manifesto and did not seek to include in it such objectives as the abolition of landlordism or the\n Article! on \u2018Congress and Socialism', The Bombay Chronicle, and  July ; statement on the Punja| peasantry,  August, The Tribune,  August .\n See AICC FileG  of .\nLEADING THE PARTY\n\nnationalization of key industries. On the other hand, Narendra Deva was delighted with the manifesto, which had been revised overnight by Jawaharlal as desired by Narendra Deva himself, and he commended it to the AICC as a revolutionary and not a reformist document.\nJawaharlal\u2019s right-wing colleagues were naturally elated. \u2018I was charmed\u2019, wrote Rajagopalachari to Gandhi, who had not been present at the Working Gommittee session which ratified this document, \u2018with the manner in which Jawaharlalji got through the Working Gommittee. All the business was done exceedingly well and everyone was pleased.' Vallabhbhai Patel was equally satisfied.\nWe have been getting on beautifully this time. The smooth and harmo\u00ac nious working reminds me most forcibly of the Working Gommittee meetings before . It has been more like a gathering of family mem\u00ac bers than a formal committee meeting. We have just finished and within half an hour the AIGG will meet. The manifesto was prepared and passed almost unanimously all co-operating with the utmost confidence and trust. I cannot speak too highly of Jawaharlal. He has done wonderful work, and has been burning the candle at both ends. We found not the slightest difficulty in co-operating with him and adjusting ourselves to his viewson certain points. I have an impression that he is also satisfied.\n%\nWhether, as claimed, Jawaharlal was equally satisfied is doubtful. But he made no publicgrievance of the clipping of his wings. If he realized that, though he was president, he was being steadily forced to continue the retreat which had begun at Lucknow, he did not disclose it even to his closest friends and threw all his energies into the winning of the elections. This was the first of his national campaigns, covering the Indian village network by train, plane, car, bicycle, cart and steamer, on horse, dephant and camel, and on foot. Once he even ran for half a mile to reach a meeting-place, the crowd following him. On another occasion the audience was so packed that he had to walk on their shoulders, and later fdt ashamed for having done so with his shoes on. But such actions had little effect on his popularity. His frequent losses of temper were short-lived and patently without malice. There was a degree of sponta\u00ac neity and aggressive vitality in his behaviour which, combined with his \u2018actor\u2019s presence', endeared him to the people.\n\u2018See his article, 'Favouriteof Fortune', in Nehru Abbinandan Grantb, pp. -.\n*Tbe Tribune,  August .\nJLetters toGandhicommunicated toJawaharlal by Mahadeva Desai,  August , AICC File G () of .\n The Bombay Chronicle, January .\n* Lai Bahadur Shastri\u2019s article in Zakaria,AStudy ofNehru, pp. -.\nFrancis Watson provides an eye-witness account of %uch an occasion at the Congress session in . \u2018As though toensurethat Ishould not overlook the item, my neighbour in one cithe prelimi\u00ac nary sessions, some three or four rows from the front, heckled the platform in a yescendo of\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nDay after day the programme began at dawn and went on till late at night, and on one occasion without a break for twenty-four hours. He drew strength from the bain de multitude, made himself receptive to the impressions and thoughts roused by the thousands he met as well as by the diverse contexts in India, and yet snatched the odd hour to read Huxley\u2019s Eyeless in Gaza and live for a while another life. \u2019It is an exhausting business and yet I find a strange relief in it from the politics of committees and individuals. I seem to feel a little nearer to reality and I suppose the enthusiasm and the crowds cheer me up.\u2019 His speeches were impersonal, with little reference to individual candidates. He talked about the common problems of the Indian people \u2014 poverty, debt, foreign rule \u2014 made them think of India as a whole, explained the party manifesto, and promised nothing except unceasing struggle till freedom was won. He spoke in simple terms but treated his audience as mature. Many of them were little interested in & this, and came merely to see for themselves the god-like figure of whom they had heard so much. Gandhi was one of them, but Jawaharlal was the glamorous prince. Yet in the eyes of a few there was a responsivegleam. ABritish official, reporting to his superiors, has given a vivid description of Jawaharlal on these tours.\nIn spite of his unattractive Congress dress and cap the Pandit looked a thoroughgentleman and an impressive figure. He is about the only good- looking Indian as I have seen in a Congress cap and appears sturdy and vigorous. He used no notes whilst he was talking and did not wear spectacles. He has agood deep voice and rams home his arguments merely by working his right forearm. He does not \u2019intone\u2019 like so many Indian public speakers, but at the same time addresses his audience in rather a scolding manner. He certainly does not go out of his way to flatter them.\nIt is easy for a European to follow his Hindustani, partly because he uses simple words and phrases, and partly because he talks it with what I can only describe as an English accent .. The Pandit is by far the most attractive public speakerwhom I have heard in India, and there is no doubt that his manliness, frankness and reputation for sacrifice attracts a large public.\nIt was obviously senseless to make a change in the Congress presidency\nPanditji-baiting questions until Panditji, projecting himself from the dais like a rocket and landing more or less in mylap, shrivelled the offender with his wrath, demanded his pass, tore it up and in seconds cast the whole meeting into uproar. When  crawled out under a collapsed corner of the canvas, the Congress volunteers in their blue shorts v'ere still trying to tranquillize the shouting tangle of patriots. It was somehours later that  had a chanceof talking to Nehru alone and enquired the cause of the disturbance.

He reiterated in his address what were by now familiar views \u2014 that the primary issue was political freedom, that socialism helped to analyse the situation and provided the only future solution to economic problems, and that the Indian.struggle was but part of a titanic conflict which gripped the world. He felt the latter even more strongly than before, for the civil war in Spain which had broken out since the Congress last met, was to Jawaharlal, as to so many intellectuals in the West, a matter of personal involvement. But on the, other hand, deep in the throes of election\u00ac eering, he tended to give less urgency to socialism. It was world peace and free democracy in India which were now the prime objectives. But his colleagues in the Congress had little time for these visions. They were concerned solely with the polls and what would follow. Jawaharlal repeated that the Congress was contesting the elections in order to rally the masses and not in search of con\u00ac stitutionalism or a barren reformism; to him the cornerstone of Congress policy was still the demand for a Constituent Assembly. The Act had to be wrecked so that they could write on a clean slate, but this could be done not so much by action within the assemblies as by mass struggle.\nThe long tirade against office acceptance, however, was not taken seriously by the audience. Jawaharlal was a useful standard-bearer, whose energy, eloqu\u00ac ence and popularity were assets in winning votes. These the Congress party- managers exploited, without paying much heed to his ideas, which could be defeated after the polling was over. The token protest of a hartal on  April, when the new Act would come into force, had little meaning. More signi\u00ac ficant was the decision to summon a convention of all Congressmen who had been elected. Jawaharlal might regard it as a preparation for a Constituent Assembly, while the Viceroy was convinced that the object was to improve Congress discipline as a prelude to refusal of office and preparation for civil disobedience. Both were credulous. Though called ostensibly to consider how to refuse to work the Act, any such convention of legislators could be expected todisplay an eagerness for office; and to summon such a meeting was to promote a decision to that effect. Indeed, the magnitude of the triumph of the Congress at the polls, a victory for which no single individual had been more responsible than Jawaharlal, strengthened the forces against him. The Congress had con\u00ac tested , of the , seats and won . It had a clear majority in  of the  provinces and was the largest single party in three others.\nJawaharlal believed that there had been a change in Congress thinking since the Lucknow session.

How they think, how they act, what moves them, what does not affect them. It is easy enough to take up a theoretically correct attitude which has little effect on anybody. We have to do something much more important and difficult, and that is to move large numbers of people, to make them act, and to do all this without breaking up the Congress. I must say that the results of the last six months have been quite extraordinary.\u2019 But to his chagrin, immediately after the declaration of the resuhs many Congressmen thought and spoke in terms of ministries. The ostensible objective of contesting the elections, wrecking the Act, was hardly remembered, lost in arguments about the spoils of office. Such behaviour seemed to him not merely an abdication of purpose but so foolish and lacking in self-respect and political sense that he took hold of the debate in the U.P. and forced through a resolution in the provincial Congress committee against acceptance of office. Then, moving to Delhi for the crucial meetings of the Working Committee and the convention of legislators, he asserted that what the electors had said was in effect, \u2018To hell with this Con\u00ac stitution.\u2019 In the presidential speech for the convention, drafted and made public well in advance, he argued that the electors had given notice to British imperialism to quit, and the Act should therefore \u2018go, lock, stock and barrel, and leave the field dear for our Constituent Assembly\u2019. Till such an Assembly met there could be nothing but conflict and struggle, and the narrow issue of office acceptance hardly arose. To co-operate was to submit to imperialist dictation and to share the odium of exploitation.\nGandhi\u2019sown inclination was to support Jawaharlal, but he responded to the overwhelmingmoodof the party. The Working Committee described the results of the elections as a condemnation and rejection of the Act, impressed on all Congressmen that the fundamental policy of the party was to combat and seek to end the Act, and then, without a trace of logic or embarrassment, authorized acceptance of office if the leaders of the party in the assemblies were satisfied that while the ministries acted within the constitution the Governors would not interfere. M. N. Roy was at this time Jawaharlal\u2019s neighbour in Delhi, and his record of Jawaharlal\u2019s reaction has the ring of truth.\nOn the third day, late in the afternoon, he walked in and threw himself on the bed, a broken man, nearly on the point of ciying. \u2018I must resign\u2019 he said. I enquired, \u2018Why?

While he had not changed his views he would, \u2019like a humble soldier\u2019, loyally abide by theresolution which had been adopted. The time might comewhen he would wish to resign, for no man could lead an army who did not know theway; but that timewas not yet, and till then the Congress should 'hold together, push together, fight together and win together\u2019. It was theoretically feasible to accept office not in order to cooperate but to work for revolutionary charge. However, Jawaharlal still thought it possible that the assurances sought from the Governors would not be given, and, therefore, Congress ministries might not be formed. At first, this was the case. The Governors ignored the Congress majorities and called on men defeated in the elections to take office. Jawaharlal denounced this as the culmination of the growth of the fascist spirit in the British Government in India, and the Viceroy seriously considered his arrest. Jawaharlal could see no room for compromise and was confident that even the moderate elements in the Congress would be forced to recognize that the conflict inherent in the Act had taken immediate shape. But the Congress resolution had left the initiative for securing assurances to the leaders of the provincial parties; and Rajagopalachari, the leader of the Congress party in Madras, exploited the opportunity. A self-proclaimed political ascetic who, in the \u2019twenties, had led the opposition to Das, Motilal Nehru and the Swarajists, Rajagopalachari had now quiedy put himself in line for the Chief Ministership in Madras and wasdetermined to take office. Enjoying Gandhi\u2019s confidence and ignoring Jawaharlal, who was first put out of action by a mild attack of typhoid and was then away in Burma and Malaya, Rajagopalachari negotiated with Lord Erskine, the Governor of Madras. While he had commended office acceptance to the convention of legislators as a means of wrecking the Act, he assured Erskine that \u2018therewas a real chance toget rid of the Civil Disobedience mental\u00ac ity for good, and that it would be a thousand pities if the chance was missed\u2019. In London, Halifax in the Cabinet was in favour of some gesture which would helpRajrgopalachari andothersofhiswayof thinking; but Zetland and Linlith\u00ac gow saw no need for it.

However, alarmed by Jawaharlal\u2019s repeated assertions, both abroad and on his return to India, that the funda\u00ac mental struggle between nationalism and imperialism could not be submerged and an Act which protected imperial and other vested interests and petrified the miseryof millions would have to go, they kept ready an ordinance in the improb\u00ac able circumstance of the Congress breaking off negotiations and starting civil disobedience. But, in fact, they had assessed their counterplayers correctly. The Working Committee, overruling Jawaharlal, decided that even though no assurances had been given the Congress should accept office. The majority were so anxious for a quick decision that they were unwilling even to refer the matter to the AICC. As Jawaharlal ruefully commented, the question was being con\u00ac sidered the wrong way; not what are the reasons for accepting office, but office must be taken and therefore reasons have to be found for it. But in sight of the prize, Rajagopalachari and the right wing were not to be diverted by such arguments. Afew days later, Congress ministries were formed in six provinces.\nZetland to Linlithgow,  July V, Zetland papers, vol. . *\nProceedingsofthe Working Committee,  toJuly , AICC File  of .",

Just as the King can do no wrong, the Working Committee also can do no wrong.\u2019 Acceptance of office, he announced, seem\u00ac ingly more to convince himself than others, did not mean acceptance of the slave constitution, but was primarily a means to fight the imposition of federa\u00ac tion. If they remembered this, the risk of getting involved in petty, reformist activitieswould be lessened. So, to be loyal to the spirit underlying the decision, Congressmen should not lose their sense of perspective and should carry on their work outside the legislatures with even greater energy. But such loyalty could not conceal that in his heart Jawaharlal hated it all. The Congress had moved away from almost everything that it had stood for in his eyes, and had become a responsivist, constitutional organization, avid for the minor loaves and fishes of office. So Jawaharlal virtually went into retreat. Though still the president of the party, hedid not serveon the parliamentary board which sought to guide and co-ordinate the working of the ministries. He took no serious interest in the composition of the Governments, noteven that in his home state, the United Provinces. It is necessary to state this, because years later the charge was made by Maulana Azad that the leaders of the Muslim League in the U.P. had agreed toco-operate with the Congress in return for twoseats in the Cabinet, but Jawaharlal had whittled down the number to one and thereby destroyed the agreement reached by Azad. \u2018Jawaharlal\u2019s action gave the Muslim League in the U.P. anew leaseoflife. All students of Indian politics know that it was from the U.P. that the League was reorganized. Mr Jinnah took full advantage of the situation and snuted an offensive which ultimately led to Pakistan.\u2019\nSuch severe criticism from so authoritative a quarter cannot lightly be set aside. Even if Jawaharlal had been responsible for the decision to exclude the representatives of the League in , it is obviously too superficial to trace\n Message to the Associated Press, Tba Bombay Cbroniclt/  July .\n The Decision to Accept Office',  and  July  Eigbtaan Months in India, pp. *.\n* Mauvna Azad, India Wins Freedom (Calcutta,  edition), pp. -.\n\n\nOUT OF TUNE WITH THE CONGRESS\ni\nthe growing influence of Muslim oommunalism to one such single event. But did Jawaharlal in fact decide in this manner? Azad\u2019s memoirs, prepared under his instructions by Humayun Kabir, were published in January  after his death. The manuscript was shown to Jawaharlal, who asked Kabir not to make any changes. Healso referred to the criticism at a press conference but in very general terms, merely remarking that Azad had thought too much sometimes in individual terms and not in termsofthe historical forces at work. His loyalty to the memory of an old colleague was too strong to permit him to rebut the charge in detail. The result has been the entrenchment of a myth, and its frequent repetition even in scholarly accounts of this period.\nHowever, the facts are very different. When Jinnah took up again in  the leadership of the Muslim League, he was still a nationalist who had no wish to support, or rely on, foreign rule. Indeed his aloofness, brittle ability and anti\u00ac imperial attitude made him as disliked by the British as any Congressman. \u2018Of all the Indians I have met\u2019, Hoare wrote to Willingdon, \u2018I think I have dis\u00ac liked Jinnah the most. Throughout the Round Table discussions he invariably behaved like a snake, and no one seemed to trust him. I greatly hope that he is not getting a following among the Muslims.\u2019 But Jinnah had no use for mass politics. His idea was to revert to the pre-Gandhian period and to form once more an alliance of elite politicians acting together to wrest concessions from the British. He had been the chief architect of the Lucknow Pact of  be\u00ac tween the Congress and the League, and his hope now was for another similar understanding. He therefore secured the election as president of the League not of a loyalist contender but of Sir Wazir Hasan, a retired judge of Lucknow whose family had close links with the Congress leadership in the U.P. The election manifesto of the League drafted by Jinnah was very similar to that of the Congress, and in the Leagueparliamentary board there were representatives of Muslim organizations, such as the Jamiat-ul-Ulema, which supported the Congress. In all his speeches in  Jinnah stressed his nationalism and com\u00ac mitment to freedom; and in August he and Jawaharlal spoke from the same platform at the All-India Students Conference in an atmosphere of personal cordiality.\nYet Jinnah\u2019s tactics had never a chanceof success.

I\n JAWAHARLAl NEHRU\nparties with political objectives and that they could form an equal partnership, was long dead. Certainly the Congress, which had mobilized the masses in a series of campaigns and established itself as a broad nationalist front, could not now be expected to agree that it was primarily a Hindu organization and would notseek toenlist the Muslimand other religious minorities in India. ToJawahar- lal in particular, critical of vested interests and emphasizing the basic problems of poverty and hunger from which the vast majority of the Indian people, what\u00ac ever their religion, suffered, the religious Elitism of Jinnah appeared medieval and obscurantist. Throughout the early months of  he and Jinnah attacked each other in the press. When Jawaharlal stated that there were only two forces which mattered in India, British imperialism and nationalism represented by the Congress, Jinnah replied that there was a third party, the Muslims. Jawahar\u00ac lal brushed this aside as communalism raised to the \u00abth power. Muslims could not be regarded as \u2018a nation apart*; and the Muslim League represented a small group functioning in the higher regions of the upper middle classes and having no contacts with the Muslim masses and few even with the Muslim lower middle dass. The controversy soon descended to verbal slanging. Jinnah spoke of the Peter Pan who refused to grow up, \u2018the busybody President\u2019 who seemed \u2018to carry the responsibility of the whole world on his shoulders and must poke his nose in everything except his own business\u2019. On his part, Jawaharlal de\u00ac clared that there were Muslims in the Congress \u2018who could provide inspiration to a thousand Jinnahs\u2019. He had no use for secret pacts with anybody, much less with Jinnah. It is at this time that Jinnah seems to have developed a particular allergy to Jawaharlal, his exuberance and his socialist ideas. He even appealed over Jawaharlal\u2019s head to Gandhi for an understanding on Hindu-Muslim relations, but was firmly rebuffed. \nThe election results had their own lessons for both Jawaharlal and Jinnah. While the Congress had done spectacularly well in the general constituencies, in the seats reserved for Muslims it had put up only  candidates and won in . In eight provinces it had not put up candidates for these special seats at all, and most of its victories in such constituencies were in the NWFP, where AbdulGaffarKhan hadgiven theCongress adecisive hold.Ontheotherhand, the Muslim League had not contested all these  seats, and had won only  of them. It could not gain a majority even in the Muslim-majority provinces of the Punjab and Bengal. In the former, it was the Unionist Party, dominated by landlords, which won a majority, while in Bengal the single largest parties were the Congress and the peasants\u2019 party led by Fazlul Haq. To Jawaharlal this suggested that the Congress had not done enough work among the Muslims, and that in the new\u2018mass contact\u2019programme a special effort should be made to reach theMuslims. Therewas a widespread anti-imperialist spirit in the country\n The Bombay Chronicle,  January and  July . * Ibid..  February . * Ibid.// February .

The party had therefore erred in not setting up more Muslim candidates. Theyounger genera\u00ac tion of Muslims and the Muslim peasants and workers were getting out of the rut of communalism and thinking along economic lines, and the Congress should set about organizing this latent support. \u2018The Congress is supreme to\u00ac day so far as the masses and the lower middle classes are concerned. Even the Muslim masses look up to it for relief. It has hardly ever been in such a strong position.\u2019 The elections had gone some way to lay the ghost of communalism, and the Congress should follow this up by working among the Muslim intelli\u00ac gentsiaand masses and rid India of communalism in every shape and form. Each provincial Congress committee should set up a special committee to increase contacts with Muslims and enrol more Muslim members. The central office of the Congress would also set up a separate department for this purpose. Notices should be issued in Urdu as well as in other local languages and wide circulation should be given to a new Congress journal being published in that language. .Gandhi disapproved of this \u2018mass contact\u2019 programme and preferred to proceed cautiously through constructive work among the Muslim masses by both Hindu andMuslim workers, but the Working Committee preferred Jawaharlal\u2019s scheme. For it recognized that the Gandhian constructive programme no longer evoked enthusiasm, ami Muslims had absolutely no trust in Gandhi and con\u00ac sidered him their enemy.\nJinnah\u2019s diagnosis was very similar, but the lesson he drew was the opposite. The Muslim League had made a mistake in not organizing itself better for the elections and contesting all the seats reserved for the Muslim electorate. The Congress was becoming increasingly a mass party and striking out in new direc\u00ac tions. Were its approaches to the Muslim masses to prove effective, Jinnah and the League would be left high and dry. So, if the Congress were to take him seriously, it would be necessary to strengthen thecommunal feelings among the Muslims. The only possible answer to the Congress \u2018mass contact\u2019 programme was to make the Muslims submerge their economic interests in religious zeal. Then the Congress would be forced to deal with the League. The hold of Islam on the Muslim masses should be strengthened to provide the sanction for the demand of the Muslim upper and middle classes for jobs and security.\nIt is against this general background that developments in the U.P. fall into place. In the elections, the chief opponent of the Congress was not the Muslim League but the National Agriculturist Party, an organization of landlords pro\u00ac moted by the Government to challenge the influence which the Congress had gained over the tenants. The British attached greater importance to this party\n Jawaharlal to Stafford Cripps,  February .\n* Circulars to provincial Congress committeer  March and  July .\n* Proceedings of the Working Committee, April , ACC File  of .\n\u00abP.D.

So the Congress and the League reached an informal, unspoken understanding in this province and avoided a conflict as much as possible. The question of Hindu-Muslim relations and ofthe recog\u00ac nition ofMuslims as a separate third party, raised by Jinnah on an all-India level, did not apply in the U.P. Here the ipain issue was authority, landlordism and reaction on the one hand and tenant right on the other. In this contest, the Congress and the League made a joint effort to defeat the Government and their puppets. The parliamentary board of the League in the U.P. was an odd assort\u00ac ment of reactionaries, leaders of the Jamiat who supported the Congress, ex- Congressmen with personal affiliations to the Nehru family like Chaudhuri Khaliquzzaman, and many with no fixed attachments. The most energetic campaigner for the League was a leader of tht Jamiat, Maulana Husain Ahmad, who was very close to the Congress. Some candidates of the League would probably have stood as Congressmen if requested, and during his election tours Jawaharlal supported the League candidates if they were not obvious reaction\u00ac aries and the Congress was not contesting the seats.\nAfter the elections, the various elements in the parliamentary board of the League fell out. When in March the Congress refused to take office and a loyalist \u2018interim\u2019 ministry was set up by the Government, Khaliquzzaman was asked to join it but refused. However, another member of the League joined, and, though he was expelled from the board, some other members, including Maulana Husain Ahmad, resigned. At this stage Govind Ballabh Pant and Mohanlal Saxena, leading members of the U.P. Congress, not expecting their own party to take office in the near future, approached Khaliquzzaman to reinforce his decision not to join the \u2018interim\u2019 government and pressed him to return to the Congress. It is possible, though they did not admit this, that they went even further and offered to form a pact with the League. The atmosphere then, born of a collective triumph over the Government and the latter\u2019s efforts to thwart the decision of the elections, was conducive to this. Jawaharlal got wind of these overtures and warned Pant against any such agreement. 'I am personally convinced that any kind of pact or coalition between us and the Muslim League will be highly injurious. It will mean many other things also which are equally undesirable.\u2019 It is worth adding that Azad, who was staying with Jawaharlal at this time, wasequally opposed to any such pact.\nFaced with this reprimand, the U.P.

In a vacancy which arose in a Muslim constituency which had been held by the League, the board of that party in the U.P., despite Jinnah\u2019s announcement that it should be retained by the League and. warning the Con\u00ac gress not to claim it, decided to leave it to a leading Congressman, Rafi Ahmad Kidwai. Jinnah himself, however, was in favour of a coalition with the Con\u00ac gress, or, as he termed it, \u2018a united front\u2019. Now that the Congress was willing to accept office if it were satisfied on certain points, there seemed to him to be no substantial difference between the two parties. He was right to the extent that the Congress no longer even claimed to be a revolutionary organization and there was no difference on that score between it and the League. But the main hitch still remained, that any coalition with the League implied the Congress accepting a Hindu orientation and renouncing the right to speak for all Indians. For fear that Khaliquzzaman might go further than a coalition and agree to merge the League in the Congress, Jinnah came to Lucknow and authorized the continuance of negotiations on the basis of the maintenance of separate identities. But this the Congress was not prepared to grant. When, towards the end of June, it became clear that the Congress would take office, Khaliquz\u00ac zaman and Nawab Ismail Khan again suggested a coalition. Khaliquzzaman seems to have gone even further and informed Azad that the League would accept any terms provided he and Ismail Khan were included in the Ministry. Jawaharlal was not enthusiastic, for a Congress ministry should undertake land reforms and he did not wish this to be precluded by any agreement with the League, which was influenced by zamindari interests. But Azad was attracted by the possibility of the League ceasing in the U.P. to exist as a separate group. He was in charge of the negotiations, being authorized by the Working Com\u00ac mittee to deal both with Congress affairs in the U.P. and Bihar and with Muslim representation in all the provincial ministries. He consulted Jawaharlal, Pant, Kripalani and Narendra Deva and it was decided to offer ministerships to Khaliquzzaman and Nawab Ismail Khan in return for acceptance of the Con\u00ac gress programme and the winding up of the Muslim League group and the U.P. parliamentary board. All Muslim League legislators should become full members of the Congress party and abide by its discipline; no Muslim League candidates should be set up in by-elections, and they should resign their offices or vacate their seats whenever the Congress decided to do so.\nThese were stringent conditions which, if accepted, would have seriously\n The Bombay Chronicle,  March .\n Z.

In Khaliquzzaman's account of his meeting with Azad, he states that discussion centred only on two points: whether the League would resign office along with the Congress if at any time the Congress resigned (to which he agreed), and whether he would agree to another Muslim in place of Nawab Ismail Khan (which he refused) Pathway to Pakistan, p. .\n Jawaharlal to Rajendra Prasad,  July ; Khaliquzzaman, op. eit., p. .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nweakened the Muslim League in the U.P., although Khaliquzzaman and others were not asked to sever all connection with the parent Muslim League or speci\u00ac fically to take the Congress pledge. Khaliquzzaman agi'eed to all conditions except two: the winding up of the parliamentary board and tfle injunction against contesting by-elections. He himself was willing to accept even these but was not authorized to do so. However, he added, this might happen in any case. In fact, so eager was he to reach an agreement and take office that he offered to call a special meeting of the executive committee of the U.P. Muslim League to consider the question of by-elections. He also suggested that members of the League be given freedom of vote on communal matters. But Azad and Jawahar- lal insisted on full acceptance of the original conditions, and the negotiations brokedown. Neither at the time, noreven later during his life did Azad voice any regrets, either to Jawaharlal or in public.\nThis account makes dear that while Jawaharlal was never happy about these opportunist, unprincipled bargainings with the League which had now, in the U.P., become a narrow upper-class organization, he had allowed Azad, Pant and Rafi Kidwai to do what they thought best. Certainly the discussions had not brokendown on the question ofone or two representatives of the League in the ministry, nor had Jawaharlal decided unilaterally that it should be one and not two. Whether, if the negotiations had succeeded, the country and the Congress would have benefited in the long run is debatable. Any agreement would in effect have accepted that politics were a matter of alliances between upper-class groups, betrayed all Muslims who thought in non-communal terms and abandoned the economic programme on which Jawaharlal had been laying so much stress. No such agreement could have endured, for the League had no long-term economic or social objectives. The only incentive where its leaders were concerned was the hope of office, and once this was\u00bbfulfilled the cracks were bound to widen. Indeed, the negotiations were throughout hollow and unreal, for alongside the parleys of Azad and Khaliquzzaman a by-election was being fought in a Muslim constituency where the new strategy of Jinnah was finding full play. Both the Congress and the League set up candidates, convert\u00ac ing it into a test election. Jawaharlal himself spent two full days in the consti\u00ac tuency, speaking as usual of economic and national interests, while the League raised the cry of \u2018Islam in danger\u2019. Jinnah issued an appeal in the name of Allah and the Koran, and Maulana Shaukat Ali spoke of civil war and called on the voters \u2019to crush the swollen head of Jawaharlal\u2019.

This, along with the bigotry that had been aroused, ensured the defeat of the Congress candidate. It was the beginning of a new phase of Indian politics, in which communal rancour was to spread and embitter all relations. F(?r the first time in his career, Jawaharlal was the object of a hostile demonstration. On his way to a meeting in the constituency, his car was pelted with stones. In these circumstances, little importance can be attached to the talks with Khaliquzzaman, and no weighty consequences followed their failure.\nA few months after the formation of the first Congress ministries, the party also took office in Assam and the North-West Frontier, and all these ministries functioned for over two years. The eight ministries had to their credit consider\u00ac able achievements. Conciliation machinery was established in labour disputes, though in Bombay the effect was nullified by banning strikes and obstructing the growth of a genuine labour movement by the encouragement of unions promoted by employers and of occupational unions. In a few districts prohibi\u00ac tion was introduced, there was some improvement in the condition of Harijans, mass literacy campaigns were promoted, and steps were taken to spread primary education. The sight of men and women in khadi exercising authority also served to lift the morale not just of the party but of ordinary people. This was a particularly exhilarating experience in the North-West Frontier, home of the conservative Pathan, with its large Muslim majority, and which the British had for so long sought to seal off. But, on the whole, the record of the Congress ministries was, as Jawaharlal realized soon enough, static if not counter\u00ac revolutionary. The worst cases were Bombay and Madras. There was no question now of taking office to combat the new Act; the ministers worked in close co-operation with the Governors, and in carrying out minor reforms forgot the major issues. Soon after they took office, Jawaharlal, as Congress president, directed them to release all political prisoners. Govind BaUabh Pant\u2019s first act on taking charge in the U.P. was to sit down at his office table to write the order for their discharge. But K.M. Munshi, the Home Minister of Bombay, \u2018if anything more royalist than the king,\u2019 ignored this directive. Keen to detain communist and left-wing leaders, he asked a surprised Viceroy toputthe C.I.D. of Bengal in touch with hisown C.I.D. todeal with communists in and around Bombay.

The reliance which B.G. 'Kher, the Chief Minister, and Munshi placed on the Viceroy and fhe Governor, and the full reports they provided to the British of discussions and differences within the Congress, encouraged Linlithgow to promote the resti\u00ac veness of the Bombay ministry against central control. \u2018My advice to you, for what it is worth,\u2019 he wrote to Lord Brabourne, the Governor, \u2018would be, here as elsewhere, to play for time and to miss no chance of impressing Kher and his colleagues with a sense of their own importance and of the necessity for standing on their own feet. This sort of pressure from the Centre cannot last for ever.\u2019 But Kher and Munshi were basically weak men who, however much they might ignore Jawaharlal, did not dare to defy Patel, who was responsible in the Working Committee for Bombay.

The result was \u2018a negation and a reversal of fundamental Congress principles and policy\u2019. * Rajagopalachari ordered the police to shadow Congressmen, arrested Congress socialists, con\u00ac tinued the ban on the Independence pledge and demanded security from a socialist journal.

Asked at a press conference about a proposed Coronation durbar, Jawaharlal replied that if the Government wished to avoid a clash between the Congress ministers and the Governors, the best way they could do it was to keep the King in England. A few weeks later, Rajagopalachari assured the British that there would be no Congress boycott of a durbar or disturbance of any kind. The conduct of Rajagopalachari, in short, was the epitome of all that Jawaharlal had feared would be the result of office accept\u00ac ance. \u2018In fact,\u2019 summed up Erskine, a diehard Tory himself, \u2018he is even too much of a Tory for me, for though I may want to go back twenty years, he wishes to go back two thousand and to run India as it was run in the time of King Asoka.\u2019\nJawaharlal\u2019s general attitude, to the great disappointment of the left wing, was to stand up loyally for the ministries in public and protect them from petty and petulant criticism; *we cannot agitate against ourselves.\u2019 But though he tried consistently to develop an atmosphere of friendliness towards the min\u00ac istries, he made it clear to them privately how much, he disapproved of their conformism. \u2018It is all very well to prevent one\u2019s enemies getting dug in but the alternative of getting buried oneself is equally unpleasant.* In the U.P. it\u00ac self he assisted Pant in dealing with labour troubles in Kanpur, controlling the students and facing the criticism of the provincial Congress committee that Pant was becoming \u2018a second Chhatari\u2019 So vigorous was his support that both Gandhi and the British toyed with the hope of his taking over from Pant as chief minister.

His main objection to federation as envisaged in the Act of  was the inclusion of the feudal and autocratic elements in the Indian States, and he wished the Congress to support the popular movements in the States. But Gandhi himself objected to this and pulled up Jawaharlal in public for permit\u00ac ting a resolution in theAICCcriticizing theGovernment in Mysore. Jawaharlal drafted a sharp rejoinder but refrained from publishing it. All this, however, jarred. So he virtually opted out of the day-to-day activities of domestic politics and was happier visiting the remote areas of Assam or the Frontier Province, writing a long tract on the language problem or indulging in a narcissist jeu d\u2019esprit: an anonymous attack on the latent dictatorial tendencies in himself. \u2018This is\u2019, he wrote to a friend urging him to prolong his stay in Europe, \u2018a dull country.\u2019\nJawaharlal was more at ease and fully integrated in dealing with develop\u00ac ments outside India.

Freedom, like peace, was indivisible. \u2018The frontiers of our struggle lie not only in our own country but in Spain and China also.\u2019 Even in the stress of the election campaign he did not forsake the international aspect of the Indian problem. In the final analysis, it did not matter much where fate had pitched one\u2019s tent. His own lot was cast in India, and he could work most effectively there; but he always thought in terms of the larger world issues, tried to fit India into them and taught his audiences to do the same. Such interest and commitment would also enable the Indian people to play a part, however small, in international affairs and give them a voice in the councils of the world. When Italy attacked Ethiopia, he called for demonstrations throughout the country as an expres\u00ac sion of sympathy and solidarity with the Ethiopians. The people of India could give no substantial assistance, but they should at least express their determina\u00ac tion to stand together with victims of, imperialism elsewhere, especially as the British were making dear their support of Mussolini. Similarly, with all his sympathy for the Jews, he believed that the Arabs were fighting British imperialism in Palestine. The Jews should not rely on British support but reach an agreement with the Arabs to safeguard their position in an indepen\u00ac dent Arab countiy. To Jawaharlal the British appeared to be exploiting the differences between Jews and Arabs in thesame manner as they were promoting\n See Jawaharlal's letter to Asaf All,  August .\nStatement to the press,  August ; Jawaharlal to Bhulabhai Desai,  September .\n*\u2018The Rashtrapati' by ChanaJcya, Modtm Rtvhw.

But imperialism had to be challenged wherever it appeared, and Jawaharlal organized a boycott of Japanese goods, a China relief fund and a medical unit for service in that country.\nHowever, it was the Spanish Civil War which dominated his attention. He felt, like every other sensitive liberal of the time, a personal commitment in this fighting. \u2018From day to day I watch with almost painful anguish the developmentof the trouble in Spain.\u2019 For to him it was a battle not just between the Spanish Government and some rebel generals or even between fascism and democracy in Europe; the conflict was a much wider one, between the forces of progress and of reaction throughout the world, and the result would be of enormous consequence to men and women everywhere. The gates of Madrid had become \u2018the symbols of human liberty\u2019, and Jawaharlal orga\u00ac nized the collection of funds for the dispatch from India of foodgrains and an ambulance unit.\nWith this deep involvement in world issues, it was natural for Jawaharlal to think of a trip abroad in the summer of . His mother had died, after a long illness, in January ; and, with his daughter at Oxford, he had no strong domestic attachment to hold him to India. The national movement was in reverse gear and at Haripura Subhas Bose had taken over the Congress presidency. Jawaharlal was pressed hard to become the general secretary but refused. He had even wished to step out of the Working Committee. He had been prevailed upon not to do so, but his interest was elsewhere, and in June, gleefully turning his back on India, he sailed for what to him were the vital centres of activity in Europe. \u2018It is a curious puzzling world but I get on with it to some extent because I like unusual things happening and rather enjoy taking part in them.\u2019\nHis own attitudes to the European crisis were clear. He felt that the dicta\u00ac tors would have to be halted in their aggression and a world war was in\u00ac evitable; but on no account would India help in such a war even against the fascist powers. The policy of appeasement was less of a surprise to him than to his-friends abroad, for India saw more of the imperialist than of the democratic face of the British Government. Though baffled and concerned, like any other left-wing sympathizer, by the trials in Russia, he declined to lend his name to an appeal for an inquiry. He had close links in Britain with Stafford Cripps and his Socialist League and the Left Book Club and approved of their program\u00ac me of popular fronts and an alliance with Russia. Collective security was the answer, though, presumably as a sop to the method of non-violence which he supported in India, he declared that it was quite possible to control the aggres-\n Statement to the press,  September and speech at Allahabad,  September ; letter to * A.

When, in February , at the Left Book Club rally for world peace and against fascism at the Albert Hall, Victor Gollancz read out an unexpected telegram from Jawaharlal as a message from the people of India, there was deafening and repeated applause. ^Though the Indian Government banned the entry of Left Book Cub books into India, a few managed to get through and were eagerly read. Jawaharlal thought of circumventing this ban by reprinting some of the books in India, but nothing came of the idea. In the circumstances, it is incredible, if characteristic, to find Lord Lothian, who had corresponded at length with Jawaharlal and review* ed the Autobiography, writing to the Aga Khan in the summer of  that Germany should be appeased; for otherwise Germany would try to make alliances with Italy and Japan directed against the Empire. \u2018That will exactly suit Jawaharlal Nehru.\u2019 But no man of normal intelligence could have had any doubt as to Jawaharlal\u2019s total commitment to the fight against fascism. For him the Left meant the struggle for freedom in India, a commitment to the traditions and aspirations of his own people, resistance to Nazism and fascism and a faith in the Russian revolution despite all its crimes and inade\u00ac quacies. He was anti-totalitarian as well as anti-fascist and hoped to blend civil liberties and the parliamentary system with economic progress such as Russia had achieved.\nEn route to Europe Jawaharlal met Nahas Pasha and the leaders of the Wafd party at Alexandria, and then, on landing in Italy, set off immediately on the pilgrimage to Spain as the guest of the Republican Government. He spent five days at Barcelona on the eve of the Battle of the Ebro. He had his first experience of air raids, visited the front and was captivated by the charm and self-confidence of General Lister. Success, he thought, was bound to attend the armies of the Republic, created in the stress of war, with their informality, comradeship and dedication. They would triumph over the professionals and experts of the rebel troops, despite German ami Italian support and superiority in heavy armaments and aircraft, if only the British and French Governments did not deny the Republic food and munitions. An afternoon with the British and American battalions of the International Brigade filled him with longing to join them: \u2018something in me wanted to stay on this inhospitable looking hill-side which sheltered so much human courage, so much of what was worth while in life.\u2019 Meetings with President Azana, Alvarez del Vayo, the Foreign\n Foreword to Foreign Policies ofthe Indian National Congress andthe British Labour Party, by R.

Influenced by his own atti\u00ac tude in India, he was unhappy that the political revolution was being merged with drastic efforts at social change; but this did not cloud his ardent desite that the Republican government should win. Jawaharlal returned from Spain convinced that the chief responsibility for the course of the war lay not with the rebels or even with the dictators but with the British Government, the French being completely under British influence. As Zetland ruefully re ported after talking to him on the subject, \u2018when I referred to the trouble there as a civil war he dissented and rather suggested that he regarded Franco as being supported almost entirely by foreign countries and having little Spanish following. He clearly takes a very biased view of the present situation in Europe and I do not think that any amount of reasoning would cause him to change his view.\u2019\nIn England this time, Jawaharlal was, thanks to the Autobiography and the success of the Congress in the elections, an even better-known figure than before. He attributed the greater interest in him to the importance that attach\u00ac ed to what India might do in a world crisis; she had a tremendous nuisance value. But the fact was that he now commanded greater stature in the world. He was accepted as the true representative of the Indian people and he moved in the mainstream of world opinion. He spoke at the Albert Hall and at Trafalgar Square under the auspices of the \u2018Aid to Spain\u2019 committee, and at a Left Book Club rally organized especially in his honour. There were lunches at the New Statesman (where Attlee was present but unnoticed) and at the House of Commons, long conversations with Robert Vansittart and Tom Jones, and an afternoon with the Webbs.\nAs a contrast Nehru, the leader of the Indian Congress and his lovely daughter spent some hours here on Saturday with Ponsonby  to meet them. I had read and admired his autobiography and welcomed him warmly. He is the last word of aristocratic refinement and culture dedi\u00ac cated to the salvation of the underdog whether in race or class; but I doubt whether he has the hard stuff of a revolutionary leader. He is in theory a communist; but doubts the possibility of the complicated Soviet organi\u00ac zation among the mixed races of the Indian continent. \u2018Between two worlds, one dead and one powerless to be born\u2019 is a quotation which he recognized but did not agree with.

Nehru is convinced that the freedom of the individual, as manifested in the presence of opportunity to live the good life, can\u00ac not be secured without the organization of the principal services and main industries deliberately for communal consumption and without the profit-making motive. Today the Indian people are too primitive for Soviet Communism. But they have been roused, not only by internal conditions of India but by the horror of the invasion of China by Japan and by their sympathy with other oppressed races.\nAnd recalling this meeting over two years later, Beatrice Webb recorded that they had been \u2018struck more by his charm than by his force \u2014 he seemed too ultra refined to influence English official or politician! He is a subtle thinker; an agnostic, in respect of man\u2019s relation to the universe and, through the study of the capitalist system, a convert to communism for India and in the western world . . .\u2019\nJawaharlal also met the executives of the' Labour Party, the Communist Party and the National Council for Gvil Liberties. He even spent a weekend with Lothian and the \u2018Qiveden Set\u2019, and listened in silence to a tirade against socialism by Nancy Astor. George Padmore saw him to explain the problems of Africa. Jewish leaders called on him and put forward their side of the case, and Jawaharlal arranged for the settling in India of some Jewish refugees from Germany. The principal difficulty was the attitude of the Government of India, which insisted on guarantees of employment for life, which no provincial government or industrial firm was in a position to give.\nThis time Jawaharlal, unlike on his previous visit to Britain, was willing to meet figures in the Government. Apart from talks with Halifax and Zetland, he met Linlithgow, then on leave in England. The Viceroy had, especially after the acceptanceofoffice by the Congress, been anxious to meet him, and Gandhi had tried to arrange it. But Jawaharlal had had no wish to have any contact with the leading instrument of British imperialism in India, especially at a time whenprisoners in theAndamanIslands wereon hunger-strike. Now the strike was over and Jawaharlal saw no objection to talking to the Viceroy on leave outside India. The conversation was general and there was no detailed discussion of Indian politics. But as Jawaharlal recorded later, he told\n Entry for  July , Beatrice Webb's diaries. Passfield papers, London School of Economics Library, vol. , pp. -.\n  September .

I was not so far out.\u2019 All that the Viceroy could retort, as they parted, was that a wide gap separated them and they would look at each other across it.\nFrom London Jawaharlal went to Paris to address an international confer\u00ac ence on the bombing of civilian populations. Speaking after Lord Cecil, who had referred to the recent visit to France of the King and Queen of England, Jawaharlal said he spoke not in the name of kings or queens or princes but on behalf of hundreds of millions of down-trodden Indians. Fascism was a recent growth in the west, but they in India had known it for long under the different name of imperialism. If the aggressors of the day had to be checked, the aggres\u00ac sors of yesterday had also to be called to account. They were all deeply moved by the aerial bombing in Spain and China, but this was really no different from the British bombing on the North-West Frontier.\nThe organizers of the conference forbade \u2018La Pasionaria\u2019 from speaking on the ground that she was a communist. When the delegates insisted on hearing her, the chairman adjourned the meeting. Ellen Wilkinson reconvened the meeting unofficially and called on \u2018La Pasionaria\u2019 to speak. She took the floor but two attendants seized her and carried her off behind the platform.\nThen Nehru walked on. Nobody would dare touch him. He was oriental dignity itself, olive-skin face, dream eyes, thin grey hair. But he was angry. Viscount Cecil wished to demonstrate that the Communists did not dominate the peace movement. Nehru wished to assert the right of free speech for Communists fighting Fascism . . . Nehru is not a Com\u00ac munist but in my many years in Russia and Europe I have rarely seen a truer revolutionary.\nThe Nazi Government made informal approaches to Jawaharlal in the hope of inducing him to visit Germany as their guest. In fact, Jawaharlal spent two days in Munich but as a private tourist and declined to meet any Nazi officials. He then went on to Prague, met Dr Ripka, the communist leader dementis and, accompanied by Werzel Jaksch of the German Social Democrat Party, visited the border areas. All his sympathies were with the Czech Government in their resistance to Hitler; and the encouragement given to him by the British Government, with its own class sympathies and leaning towards fascism, nauseated Jawaharlal. \u2018The perfect description has been given by someone. It was the rape of Czechoslovakia by Germany with England and France hold-\n Note written on  October , Nehru papers. * Jawaharlal to J. B.

India would will\u00ac ingly throw her entire weight on the side ofdemocracy and freedom; but Britain should first establish her bonafides by eliminating empire from India. To add weight to his opinion, he urged the Working Committee to pass a resolution condemning Nazi attempts at aggression and stating emphatically that in event of war India could only be committed by a decision of her people.\nIn September, at the height of the crisis, Jawaharlal was at Geneva, and was caught up in the tension. While the League of Nations was meeting peacefully and discussing every question but that of war and peace, the air was full of rumours; and Jawaharlal was swept to and fro, to cafes and press conferences, through the night. \u2018Hello Prague? Hello Paris? Hello London? Is it peace or war?\u2019 Back in London he was fitted with a gas mask which he later presented to the Allahabad municipal museum, heard and was sickened by Neville Cham\u00ac berlain\u2019s broadcast, and was present in the House of Commons to hear Cham\u00ac berlain announce that he was flying the next day to meet Hitler and Mussolini at Munich. Jawaharlal shared the general relief that war had been postponed. But he had no illusions about the attitude of the British Government, their anxiety to abandon Czechoslovakia and isolate Russia, their fear not of defeat but of victory, for that would have been a victory of real democracy. The weak\u00ac ness of England and France was their imperialism, and so the ending of impe\u00ac rialism was necessary even from the wider international viewpoint. Collective security could not function effectively so long as it had an imperialist base; and this made the freedom of India a vital factor in world politics.\nUnable to secure in time a visa to visit Russia, which might have enabled him to fulfil an old desire to take the overland route via the Central Asian republics, Jawaharlal returned to India by the end of the year, and was drawn again into domestic politics. No one in Britain, even when discussing India, had referred to Hindu-Muslim relations or regarded it as of great importance. But in India it could not be ignored. The refusal of the Congress to form coali- \" tions with the League seemed to Jinnah to be a betrayal born of arrogance, and since then his policy had been clear. Acceptance of office by the Congress made it an easy target. He attacked it as a Hindu fascist body which was out, with the assistance of a few Muslim \u2018traitors\u2019, to destroy the Muslim minority. When Jawaharlal and other Congress leaders asked him repeatedly to specify in\u00ac stances, Jinnah, now fast beginning to show the mastery of obstructive tactics and skill in avoidance which were to dominate Indian politics for the next ten\n Article in National Herald,  October .

He talked of the suppression of Urdu although Urdu was not the language only of the Muslims and Jawaharlal had clearly reiterated the Congress policy of developing Hindustani in both Urdu and Devanagari scripts as the national language. Heobjected to the singing of Bande Mataram, ignoring the facts that that song had long rid itself of its Hindu antecedents and that the Congress, on Gandhi\u2019s initiative, had decided that only the first two stanzas, which had no religious overtones, should be sung at public gather\u00ac ings.  But otherwise Jinnah would mention no particular grievances. It would indeed have been difficult for him to do so; for, as even the British Viceroy and Governors conceded, the Congress ministries took special care to avoid harm\u00ac ing Muslim interests. The documentary record of complaints published later by the League carried little conviction and explains why the League would not agree to the Congress proposal for an impartial inquiry. Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan, the premier of the Punjab and the most cool-headed of the League leaders, later toned down the charge of \u2018atrocities\u2019 committed by Congress governments to high-handedness of the majority community in some Congress provinces. When Linlithgow informed Jinnah that he had examined the position and could find no specific instances of oppression, all that Jinnah could say in reply was that the Hindus had \u2018a subtle intention\u2019 of undermining the Muslim posi\u00ac tion.  But this did not mean that Jinnah\u2019s effort to create a legend of the Muslim community being trampled on by the Hindus was a failure. As the majority of Indians happened to be Hindu by religion, it was an easy slide from the fact of Congress ministries representing majority opinion to the suggestion of these ministries representing Hindu majority opinion. That the Congress was in office put it on the defensive, and the League\u2019s successful myth-making was not the least of the unhappy consequences of office acceptance. Jinnah went round the country denouncing the Congress as anti-Islamic and promoted a drive to build up the organization of the League at the provincial and district level. The League was as committed on paper as the Congress to economic and social reforms and proclaimed the objective of full independence in the form of a federation of free democratic states. But the decision to convert the League into a mass party and the resentment of the \u2018mass contact\u2019 campaign of the Congress did not mean the overthrow of the League\u2019s reliance on the upper classes. Indeed, the tenancy reforms proposed by the Congress brought many Muslim talukdars in the U.P. from the National Agriculturist Party into the League, and in the Punjab the link between the League and the Unionist Party was facilitated by support to rich agricultural producers. \u2018What\u2019, Sikandar\nlTbe Question of Language, August ,  Statement of the Working Committee,  October, The Bombay Chronicle,  October .

Nothing except\u2019 (pointing dramatically at Jawaharlal) 'common opposition to you!\u2019\nJinnah, in fact, was prepared to useevery influence and interest to strengthen Muslim communalism, He frightened the wealthy by prophesying that one result of Congress policy would be class bitterness. On the other hand, he encouraged Fazlul Haq of Bengal to support the peasants of that province against the zamindars not on an economic but on a communal basis; and Fazlul Haq agreed to this after failing to secure a coalition with the Congress. Jinnah also made overtures to the British, warning them that if they did not devote more attention to the Muslims there was a real risk that these would be driven into the arms of the Congress. However, if the British \u2018protected\u2019 the Muslims in the Congress provinces, the Muslims in return would \u2018protect\u2019 the British at the Centre. But at this period the British were having a semi-honeymoon with the right wing of the Congress, and paid little heed to Jinnah. Linlithgow, in particular, had a poor opinion of Jinnah as a leader.  * Jawaharlal\u2019s talks in London with Zetland and Linlithgow made the League suspicious, and in desperation Jinnah sent A. R. Siddiqi and Khaliquzzaman to Europe in  to contact the German and Italian Governments.\nThe Government of India ignored these efforts and set aside the Muslim mood of frustration to be exploited in any change of circumstance. But the Congress was baffled. Jawaharlal was willing to go so far as to consider, in any scheme of provincial redistribution, the grant to important groups and minor\u00ac ities of territories within which they could feel that they had full opportunities of self-development, without which a creative life was hardly possible. He disliked the term \u2018communal provinces\u2019 but his scheme contained the germ of territorial redistribution on the basis of religion. But to concede Jinnah\u2019s main demands, that the Congress should not approach the Muslim masses but should recognize the League as representative of Muslim opinion, was unthinkable. However, so long as the Congress was in office it could not ignore even uncor\u00ac roborated allegations of partisanship. One way out of this dilemma was to ap\u00ac proach the Muslim peasantry over the heads of the leaders of the League with a programmeof economic change; but here Jawaharlal found that, with the Con\u00ac gress ministries not proceeding fast enough, the communal approach, however\n DSVA, p. . * Presidential address at the Lucknow session of the Muslim League, October . * Reports of Jinnah's interviews, with Linlithgow in Linlithgow to Zetland,  September , Zetland papers, vol. , and with Brabourne in Brabourne to Zetland,  August , Braboume papers, vol. .

The other alternative was to take advantage of the League\u2019s decision to widen its base and precipitate a conflict between the reactioriaiy outlook of its leaders and the needs of the Muslim masses. So Jawaharlal encouraged the holding of Muslim mass meetings demanding debt relief and abolition of the talukdari system in the interests of the Muslim kisans. But these were long-term projects which hardly gathered any momen\u00ac tum in the context of extreme communal propaganda and violence. The League, which was promoting this activity, understandably rejected all suggestions by the Congress for consultation to promote communal harmony. The British police and magistrates also often did little to curb religious riots in order presumably to discredit the Congress ministries. If this were their objective they gained considerable success, for Hindu-Muslim rioting strengthened the anti-Congress feeling among the Muslim masses. Jawaharlal realized what this might finally mean.\nAsyou know Iamoverwhelmed with this sense of impending catastrophe.\nI find that few persons even among our leading politicians have this sense of tension and this premonition of approaching disaster. I fear we are rapidly heading for what might be called civil war in the real sense of thewordin India. Our future conflicts are nevergoing to beon the straight issue of Indian nationalism versus British imperialism. British impe\u00ac rialism in future is certainly going to play an important part in opposing us. But it will do so more from behind the scenes exploiting all manner of other groups to this end. \nWeakened by office and punched continuously by an enemy on whom it could get no hold, the Congress was now stricken by in-fighting at its highest level. Subhas Bose had, through long years of prison and exile, earned the suc\u00ac cession to Jawaharlal as president of the Congress in . But, during his year of office, he took hardly any interest in problems of organization and gave no clear lead in many matters that came up before the Working Committee. More important, he could- not get on with Gandhi. This was not just difference of viewpoint. Jawaharlal differed with Gandhi just as much, but \u2018we know that neither of us can do without the other, for there is a heart union between us which no intellectual differences can break\u2019. With Bose there was no such affinity, and when he announced early in  that he would seek re-election, Gandhi encouraged the right wing of the Congress to set up its own candidate. But Bose won decisively and Gandhi acknowledged it to be his own defeat. However, thiswasonly thebeginning of the crisis. With his re-election Bose\njawaharlal\u2019s comments on the Muslim League session October , Tb* Bombay Cbroniela,  October .\njawaharlal's letter to Siddiq Ahmed Siddiqui,  September .

Impatient, wilful and endlessly ambitious, he decided to press home his victory. He ignored the fact that many local and regional factors for which he could take no credit had played a part in the election. He stressed only that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the older leaders and believed that he had been chosen to replace them. Incapable of the wider view, he tended to see most events in relation to his own career. A dedicated yet egotistic, complicated, ill-fated being, he lived out the fantasy of his life which ended in premature death; and there was something almost natural and inevitable in his loss of life in an air accident. The elements of tragedy were never absent from Bose\u2019s destiny.\nNow, in , riding on the crest of a wave, Bose launched a fierce struggle of will. He insinuated that the \u2018old guard\u2019 were conspiring with the Govern\u00ac ment to establish federation, announced that the \u2018Right\u2019 and the \u2018Left\u2019 were in confrontation and demanded the immediate issue of an ultimatum to the Government and the launching of a struggle. This was heady stuff. But Bose, though an instinctive fighter, had no ring-craft and he had underestimated Gandhi and his followers. They welcomed a break, and brought it about in their own way. Realizing that, despite Bose\u2019s electoral victory, the majority in the Congress still preferred Gandhi\u2019s leadership with its moderation, twelve leading supporters of Gandhi resigned from the Working Committee and then carried a resolution at the Congress session in Tripuri that Bose should nomi-. nate the new Committee in consultation with Gandhi and accept his advice. Gandhi, however, declined to co-operate, with the result that Bose had to resign the presidency. Then followed, step by step, his ostracism, his setting up of a new party, and his lone path, away from the Congress, during the war.\nIn all this, Jawahadal\u2019s attitude was individualistic and unwelcome to both sides. He disapproved of the manner in which Bose was being hounded out after winning an election, but he could not bring himself to support Bose. So he declined to sign the letter of resignation of the twelve members of the Work\u00ac ing Committee, but resigned on his own. Although some of his statements tended to be critical of Bose, at Tripuri he remained almost silent, tried in private discussions to patch up a compromise and urged Bose not to resign. When Bose insisted, Jawaharlal, while making clear his dislike of Bose\u2019s action, declined to serve in the reconstituted Working Committee till the outbreak of war changed the situation. Such ambivalence Bose could not understand and this, more than the direct offensive of Gandhi and the others which drove him out of the fold, he found most difficult to forgive. \u2018Nobody has done more harm to me personally, ami to our cause in this crisis, than Pandit Nehru.

Jog, In Freedom 's Quest (Delhi, ), p. .\nOUT OF TUNE WITH THE CONGRESS \nTo suggest that Jawaharlal had allowed Bose to be destroyed is, of course, to exaggerate absurdly. Bose had really destroyed himself. The logic of his attitude demanded his expulsion from the movement, and there was-no way back. But Jawaharlal\u2019s seemingly erratic attitude certainly cries out for expla\u00ac nation. Some have hinted the simple, personal, petty answer of consistent opportunism. Jawaharlal, said Rajagopalachari long after these events, had always been a worshipper of success. Applying this yardstick his behaviour in this crisis is easily understood; for Bose was a born loser. In Gandhian India, leadership could come only bygift, never by seizure. So Jawaharlal, it is alleged, preferred to remain in the Congress and by Gandhi\u2019s side, a \u2018safe\u2019 militant who occupied as much of the central ground as possible while he awaited his destiny. Happy on the inside track, he allowed his only rival, on the outer rails, to be pushed off the course.\nThis explanation is too easy. Personalizing clouds and distorts the issues. The quarrel between Bose and Gandhi was not, as Bose sought to make out, a straight fight between the Left and the Right. He hid been tardy in condemn\u00ac ing Germany, Italy and Japan, had in December  met the German Consul. in Bombay, had criticized Jawaharlal for supporting all lost causes such as China and Spain and was not enthusiastic about welcoming Jewish refugees from Europe. While his willingness to exploit the world situation to India\u2019s benefit was not wrong in itself, he had, despite long years in Europe, no acute international sense. In India, while clamouring for struggle with the British and condemning office acceptance, he attempted to establish a coalition ministry in Bengal and sought the Governor\u2019s assistance in this. This again could taf justified on pragmatic grounds as strengthening the prospects of a satyagrahlk campaign, but it weakened Bose\u2019s ideological crusade. In fact, Jawaharlal was right in suspecting aweakness in commitment to anything broader than natitsgg; alism; nor could one have confidence in Bose\u2019s judgment even in this narro^ field. He viewed most problems in too finite, clear-cut and limited a way. TM& distrust on Jawaharlal\u2019s part of Bose\u2019s approach strengthened the temptip^ mental dissimilarity which undoubtedly existed. The autobiographies of a* two men, published within a few months of each other, drive home the contsipf Bose\u2019s book  lacks the intellectual grace and stature of Jawaharlal\u2019s; the idfcaS are jejune and the prose without flavour. The book also shows a matter-of-fact\n\u2022See N. Majumdar, \u2018C.R. The Unfinished Century\u2019, The Statesman,  December .\n\u2019Curiously, this idea is still prevalent, even among left-wing writers. Hiren Mukerjee describes Jawaharlal\u2019s failuretoheal the breach as \u2018a major blemish on Jawaharlal's record\u2019 andthinks history might have been different and brighter if Jawaharlal and Bose had, at this stage, together led left- wing forces.

He was particularly put off by the fact that Bose had#desired re- election and had induced even Rabindranath Tagore to lobby for him. Bose\u2019s eagerness, after the election, to precipitate a conflict also repelled him. With the world on the brink of war and a crisis in India impending, it was foolish to divide the Congress. The left-wing forces within the Congress were not strong enough to act on their own, and the party still needed Gandhi\u2019s leadership. The socialists and the communists, who at first supported the challenge of Bose, were soon disheartened to find themselves in alliance with adventurist ele\u00ac ments out for selfish advantage; and Bose himself reduced the differences to a conspiracy against Bengal. \u2019For the moment Subhas has become a kind of a symbol of Bengal and it is quite impossible to argue with or about symbols.\u2019 Jawaharlal, with his image of the Congress as a broad anti-imperialist front, had never been in favour of homogeneous committees in a sectarian sense; his idea of the Working Committee was of men with different views working to\u00ac gether with mutual confidence. So he resented Bose\u2019s aspersions against his colleagues, but he also disliked the efforts to displace Bose, and in consequence refused to attach himself to either side. To the end he stood out of the intrigues of both groups and sought a settlement by dealing with the crisis as differences among' comrades within a movement. He tried to explain to Bose that any rebellion such as his could only be successful if it was rebellion within a dis\u00ac cipline; and he pleaded with Gandhi to make a friendly approach to Bose. But Gandhi was tougher than Jawaharlal and Bose less accommodating.\nIn this cheerless Atmosphere two developments gave Jawaharlal comfort. The problem of the Indian States had thrust itself into the forefront of Indian politics and the Congress had decided to support the growing movement for civil liberties and responsible government. Gandhi himself went to Rajkot and forced concessions and British intervention by undertaking a fast. Jawaharlal was president for this year of the All-India States Peoples Conference, and he planned to co-ordinate the agitation in the various States and involve the rest of India as well. This should become the major issue in the struggle against the British, transcending the wrangles in the Congress and the controversy with the League, underlining the total unacceptability of federation as envisaged in the Act of  and perhaps even leading to the resignation of the Congress ministries. Though he was considerably hampered by Gandhi\u2019s very different\nSee A.K.

The concept of a planned economy was, even in Europe in the late thirties, still vague and ambiguous. But it was felt that only in Soviet Russia was there national planning in the red sense, with the whole economy geared to the production of plenty for human welfare and not driven by the profit motive or intended for efficiency in war. In other words, planning was a part of socialism. Jawaharlal agreed with this. Howevercritical he might be of the political aspectsof the Stalin regime, he had been deeply impressed by the economic progress achieved by the Soviet Union.\nThe argument about the success or otherwise of the Five Year Plan is rather a pointless one. The answer to it is really the present state of the Soviet Union. And a further answer is the fact that this Plan has im\u00ac pressed itself on the imagination of the world. Everybody talks of \u2018plan\u00ac ning\u2019 now, and of Five-Year and Ten-Year and Three-Year Plans. The Soviets have put magic into the word.\nHe believed that India too had much to learn from the Soviet example. But to apply these lessons in a colonial economy and to consider planning in a country which was not yet free showed a bold and pioneering mind. This was the kind of work, long-term, adventurous and leading to socialism, which excited him. The fact that the Congress was in charge of many provincial administrations, whatever its political drawbacks, could be utilized for planning. Jawaharlal encouraged the Bihar and U.P. Governments, the two ministries with whom he exercised the greatest influence, to recruit experts from Europe and to get in touch with the League of Nations and the International Labour Organisation for the kind of assistance they had given to China. Meantime, at a meeting of ministers of industry from the Congress provinces, it was decided to set up a National Planning Committee with Jawaharlal as its chairman. Jawaharlal took up the work with enthusiasm and constituted a committee with not only Congressmen but scientists, economists, businessmen and industrialists as well. The Congress ministries were represented; in addition Punjab, Baroda and Mysore agreed to send representatives, and contacts were established with the departments of the Government of India. Along questionnaire was drafted and widely distributed and nearly thirty sub-committees were constituted to make detailed recommendations on specific subjects.\nJawaharlal\u2019s own contribution, apart from holding the assorted crowd of planners together, was a dear statement of the general objectives of planning in India. To him planning was inevitably connected with a socialist economy within a democratic structure, but he had no wish to frighten away people by stressing the socialist aspect. The Congress had taken up planning because any\n'See G.D.H. Cole, Practical Economics (Pelican, May ).\n!.etier to Indite,  July , Glimpses, p. .\n*To Syed Mahtnud apd to G. B. Pant,  October .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nvital national movement was bound to interest itself in all aspects of national life, but the Congress itself was not committed to socialism. So what Jawahar- lal hoped to do was to lead his party and the Indian middle classes generally to socialism without their knowing it. Any attempt to dispense with*the middle classes and bring about a premature conflict on class lines would lead to chaos and possibly to prolonged inability to build anything. \u2018The disruptive forces in the country seem to be growing in strength and it almost seems that we are going the way of China.\u2019 Jawaharlal had moved even further away from the doctrinal positions of the left wing and preferred a pragmatic, undefined approach.\nHe was, therefore, deliberately imprecise in formulating the aim of planning. \u2018The ideal of the Congress is the establishment of a free and democratic state in India. Such a free democratic state involves an egalitarian society in which equal opportunities are provided for every member for self-expression and self-fulfilment, and an adequate minimum of a civilised standard of life is assured to each member so as to make the attainment of this equal opportunity a reality. This should be the background or foundation of our Plan.\u2019 A year later he was more forthcoming and acknowledged that the over-all objective was to socialize national life in all its many sectors. Advantage could be taken of the Congress resolution of May  that revolutionary changes, economic and social, were essential in India and of the clause in the  resolution on fundamental rights that the state should own or control key industries and services, to start planning in the socialist direction. Private enterprise was not ruled out but it would have to be strictly controlled and co-ordinated to the general plan. The emphasis placed by the Congress on cottage industries did not exclude large-scale industries and any plan should provide for both; and increasingly the Congress would realize the importance of the latter. He rejected the Gandhian viewpoint that machineiy was evil in itself and resigned from the executive committee of the All-India Spinners Association. For a country to turn its face against industrialization was to render itself a prey to the industrialized countries. Even the development of cottage industries required the control of political and economic power, and this could not be secured by a people dependent wholly on cottage industries. It was not large scale industry that brought injustice and violence but its misuse by capitalists. Private ownership and the acquisitive society encouraged competitive violence, and when replaced by a socialist society the advantages of large-scale indus\u00ac trialization and its co-ordination with cottage industries could be realized. The Congress had devoted more attention to small-scale industries not merely because all its members accepted Gandhi\u2019s views on the subject. Large-scale industries were strong enough to look after themselves, and were also often in the grip of foreign vested interests. The cbarka and khaddaryjx the other hand\nTo K.T. Shah, Secretary, National Planning Committee,  May .\nMemorandum to National Planning Committee,.

This made sense at a time when the Congress was a party of challenge, but it obviously would have to shift its approaches when it planned for a free India.\nThe lack of sovereign authority was another road-block which on first sight was insuperable, for planning assumed independence and freedom from im\u00ac perialist control. Land reforms, for example, were urgently required, but neither peasant proprietorship nor co-operative or collective farming could be introduced so long as British rule prevailed. But while planning, in its full dimension, should be for a free India, steps could be taken immediately to develop national resources, increase the national wealth between two and three times within ten years, raise the standards of the Indian people and prevent the creation of fresh vested interests. This emphasis on concrete sftort-term steps such as improved nutrition, more clothing and better housing for every Indian over the next ten years had the further advantage of by-passing the theoretical and ideological differences among the planners. The immediate national objec\u00ac tive was stated to be self-sufficiency, planning for which might, apart from other benefits, help to weaken economic imperialism even before the British left India.\nThe work of the National Planning Committee alarmed not so much the Government of India as the right wing of the Congress itseli The detailed explanations provided by Jawaharlal that planning did not mean the abandon\u00ac ment of khaddar and the destruction of cottage industries  carried hardly any conviction. The agreement which was gradually developing in the Planning Committee in favour of at least state control of industry and agriculture also roused opposition. Gandhi himself called on his followers to stay away from the Planning Committee. \u2018I have advised you about Jawaharlal\u2019s invitation.. In my opinion, the whole of his planning is a waste of effort. But he cannot be satisfied with anything that is not big.\u2019 He also wrote to Jawaharlal to complain.\nI have never been able to understand or appreciate the labours of the Committee. I do not know that it is working within the four corners of the* resolution creating the committee. I do not know that the W.C. is being kept informed of its doings. I have not understood the purpose of the numerous subcommittees. It has appeared to me that much money and labour are being wasted on an effort which will bring forth little or no fruit. These are my doubts. I seek light.\nWhat saved Jawaharlal from having to fight last-ditch actions was the outbreak of war. The fall in imports of textiles and the boycott of goods from both Britain and Japan increased the demand for hand-spun cloth. The war also gave a boost to industrial and other forms of economic development and\n\u2018To Krishna Kripalanl,  September .\n^Proceedings of the Working Committee reported in The Bombay CbronicU,  June .\n. *To Amrit Keur,  June , quoted in A.H. Hanson, The Process of Planning (Oxford, ), p. n.\n<Gandhi to Jawaharlal,  August  A Bunch of Old Letters, pp. -.\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nmade planning seem all the more necessary. \u2018If we had not had a planning com\u00ac mittee already we ought to have formed one.\u2019 A special sub-committee was created to consider the war situation and its repercussions oh the Indian eco\u00ac nomy. There was scope now, even from the point of view of war production, for promoting industrial development, while the impact of war or? agriculture emphasized the need for planning and state control on a countrywide scale. The over-production of sugar cane in the U.P., for example, could be dealt with, according to Jawaharlal, on the lines of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, by the Government stabilizing prices and buying up surplus stock for distribution gratis to the poor. But the Government of India refused to adapt themselves to the changing context. They were still anxious to assist foreign industrial interests and to leave agricultural problems to laissez-faire and cut-throat competition.\nBy the summer of , despite the tremendous disadvantages of lack of a common viewpoint among the planners, paucity of statistics and other data, and no immediate likelihood of implementation, seventeen sub-committees had presented final or interim reports. These covered not only technical pro\u00ac grammes of production*but also wider issues of distribution, social justice and social welfare. The sub-committee to which Jawaharlal probably attached the most importance was that on the condition and rights of women. The second stage of planning had now been reached. A comprehensive report, based on the suggestions of the various sub-committees, was taking shape. The Com\u00ac mittee met daily for a fortnight in May  and again in June, under Jawahar- lal\u2019s presidency and approved the general framework. Though there were various inconsistencies and frequent ambiguities of phrasing, the broad trend was in favour of state ownership or state control or a blend of the two. How\u00ac ever, political developments now took command. The Congress ministries, which had given the Planning Committee a purchase on the State, were gone. Jawaharlal himself was removed from the scene in October  and the Government refused to permit him to deal with matters concerning the Plan\u00ac ning Committee while in jail. To keep the concept of planning before the public eye, Jawaharlal suggested publication of the reports of the sub-committees; but some other members of the Committee were not in favour. The matter was referred to Gandhi who vetoed publication. *\nJawaharlal\u2019s contribution to planning before  has, therefore, to be considered a mere torso. Even so, it was path-breaking. The plethora of plans drawn up in various quarters during the war years and the setting up by the Government of India in rivalry of a department of planning with an industria\u00ac list from Bombay in charge all had their genesis in the work of the National Planning Committee. Jawaharlal had made India plan-conscious.\n\u2022Jawaharlal to K.T. Shah,  September .\n*To Rajendra Prasad,  August .\n*K.T. Shah to P. Thakurdas,  April, A.D. Shroff to K.T. Shah,  April, and K.T. Shah to P. Thakurdas,  April . Purshotamdas Thakurdas papers, File /-. The War Crisis\nWhen the war broke out, Jawaharlal was in China. Few people in India had approved of his going at a time when Europe was again approaching a crisis, and he himself had beep reluctant to leave India just then. But all plans had been made and it was difficult to back out. So he went to Kunming, Chungking and Chengtu but, before he could go to the north-west and meet Mao and the com\u00ac munists, he had to cut short his visit and return hurriedly to India. He liked the Chinese, who struck him \u2018as a singularly grown-up people\u2019, and he established a personal friendship with Chiang Kai-shek and his wife. He was much moved by the idea of visiting another Asian country with an old civilization and with which India had had centuries of contact; and as a result of the visit, \u2018China has grown very near to me, and all mythoughts are mixed up with her.\u2019 In the new world order that was emerging, he was determined that India and China should work together; and this idea did not leave him till . In fact, he thought in terms of an eastern federation in which India and China would be the senior partners, and called on his countrymen to plan and work for it.\nHowever, throughout the fortnight in China, he kept his sense of humour and balance. He did not fail to notice that the Kuomintang was not a very democratic body though it called itself such, and was unfavourably struck by the fact that every time the name of Chiang was mentioned at a public meeting the audience had to stand up in respect. But the problems faced by India and China were so similar, since both were striving to build national power in order to gain national freedom, that he left a note with Chiang suggesting closer con- tarts between the two national movements and the development of a common outlook and policy on major international issues.\nOn his return from China on  September, Jawaharlal found that Gandhi\u2019s immediate reaction to the war had been, apart from abhorrence at the\n\u2022To Madame Chiang Kai-shek,  December .\n* TheEastern Federation\u2019, article in National Harold,  October .\n*See \u2018Diary of a Journey\u2019, reprinted in China, Spain and tha War.\nA note on the development of contacts between India and China, written at Chungking,  August .\n\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\ntriumph of violence, a spontaneous support of Britain. He had told the Viceroy that he viewed the war \u2018with an English heart\u2019 and, while he could not speak for his colleagues, personally was for full and unquestioning co-operation. At the thought of the possible destruction of the Houses of Parliament and West\u00ac minster Abbey, he had broken down. \u2018I could not\u2019, reported the Viceroy, \u2018help myself being profoundly moved by the emotion which he showed during a con\u00ac siderable part of it [the interview]. . . His whole attitude could not have been better, and in his conversation he showed the same breadth of approach and the same disinclination to trouble about minor or subsidiary issues as I have always noticed in him.\u2019 In the U.P. the ministers seemed willing to give full co\u00ac operation in prosecution of the war, while in Madras the Governor had to restrain Rajagopalachari, on the outbreak of hostilities, from detaining all Germans and seizing their bank balances, \u2018whereupon he commented that the English seemed to want to wage war according to High Court rules\u2019.\nHowever, the Congress attitude to the war was formulated not by Gandhi or Rajagopalachari but by Jawaharlal, and his approach was less emotional. This was to be expected and should have been no surprise to the Government. For years Jawaharlal had been stating his viewpoint on the European crisis and by periodica] resolutions had been committing the Congress to it; and the mere involvement of Britain in war was not going to change it. He had been consist\u00ac ently opposed to fascism and Nazism and believed in some form of collective security to curb their continual aggression. If other Powers co-operated with the Soviet Union, the policy of peace would become unassailable. Neville Cham\u00ac berlain\u2019s policy of appeasement, therefore, had filled him with disgust, and he held Britain primarily responsible for the collapse of Spain and the destruction of Czechoslovakia. India would be no party to this policy, which was an addi\u00ac tional and unanswerable argument for complete independence. His writings and speeches to this effect in Britain in  seem to have evoked Winston' Churchill\u2019s approval, for though Jawaharlal did not meet him, Churchill sent him a message of goodwill through a mutual friend a year later, on the eve of Jawaharlal\u2019s departure to China.\nJawaharlal\u2019s analysis of appeasement was that the British Government were inspired by class interests and were more hostile to Soviet Russia than to Nazi Germany. While Britain had been the leader in introducing political democracy, she was socially backward and the strain of social conflict had been only lessened by the exploitation of her colonies. She was anxious to protect her own empire and for this purpose connived at Nazi aggrandizement. Even when British imperial interests had been threatened by the dictators and there was growing criticism of their foreign policy, the British Government, the most reactionary\n\u2018Glendevon, op. cit., p. ; Linlithgow to Zetland,  September , Zetland papers, vol. ; Tendulkar, Mahatma, vol, , p. .\nHaig\u2019s telegram to Viceroy,  September , Haig papers, vol. ; Erskine's telegram to Viceroy,  September , Erskine papers, vol. .\n*TbaDucov*ry ofIndia, p. .\nTHE WAR CRISIS\n\nforgenerations, had continued tosupport Hitler and Mussolini, for their dislike of democracy and socialism was greater even than theirattachment to empire. Even within Britain a fascist outlook was developing, and Jawaharlal believed that Chamberlainwasfollowing the road to internal fascism under cover of war preparations. As for the opposition, the Labour Party did not seem to know its own mind and played an ineffective role, the pacifists in their eagerness to avoid war supported Hitler while the Independent Labour Party behaved worst of all and praised Chamberlain as a man of peace.\nThe hope of the Chamberlain Government of protecting vested interests at home and abroad while Germany fell on Russia had been defeated by Russia's understanding with Germany. Even though Jawaharlal deplored the cynical opportunism which underlay it, he recognized the diplomatic reasons which had led Stalin to veer his policy. But the fact that Britain and Germany were at war with each other while Russia stood apart did not alter Jawaharlal\u2019s general analysis of the situation and strengthened his attitude on non-participation by India. He had no trust in a Britain which still had Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister. Fascism and imperialism werfe both parts of the same reac\u00ac tionary complex, and India was opposed to both. Jawaharlal\u2019s views on this point had never been in doubt. In London in , he had emphasized that the Indian people should themselves decide on participation in any war, and so long as they did not have independence they would regard any war in which Britain was involved as an imperialist war and an occasion to intensify their own national struggle. The fact that the British Labour Party found this difficult to understand only showed how a dormant imperialism coloured even its out\u00ac look. He wrote a few months later:\nWe want to combat Fascism. But we will not permit ourselves to be ex\u00ac ploited by imperialism, we will not have war imposed upon us by outside authority, we will not sacrifice to preserve the old injustices or to maintain an order that is based on them. We will not and cannot forget our own struggle for freedom for slogans which may souod pleasant to the ear but have little reality behind them or vague promises which have been broken often.\nIt was for India to decide whether she would go to war. The Viceroy had now, without consulting representative opinion, taken that decision. But it was\n\u2018See his articles \u2018The Hoax\u2019 and \u2018England's Dilemma', in the National Herald,  October  ai)d  May , respectively.\naF.Brodcway, 'A Talk with Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019, TbeNewLeader,  July .\n* \u2018TheChoice Before Us\u2019, article in the Nationalteerald,  October .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nabsurd for a subject India to fight for the freedom of Poland. If India were to participate enthusiastically in the war, she would have to be granted freedom. One had to be free and democratic to fight for freedom and democracy. If Britain fought for democracy, her first task was to eliminate empire from India. The Indian people would not bargain or seek to take advantage of Britain\u2019srtlifficulty; but whatever they did would have to be in accord with India\u2019s freedom and dignity.\nThe resolution of the Working Committee was on these lines. On the train to Wardha, Jawaharlal had prepared two drafts, and the Committee accepted a merged version after merely toning down.criticisms of the British and tighten\u00ac ing the prose. It rejected both Gandhi\u2019s advice that there should be no demand for a statement of war aims and the suggestion of Subhas Bose that civil dis\u00ac obedience should be launched immediately. While condemning the Nazi attack on Poland, the Committee reaffirmed that India could not associate herself in a war said to be for democratic freedom when that freedom was denied to her and such limited freedom as she possessed had been taken away from her. The word of the British and French Governments, that they were fighting for demo\u00ac cracy and freedom, was not enough. If Britain fought for democracy, she should necessarily end imperialism in herown possessions and establish full democracy in India. Afree democratic India would gladly associate herself with other free nations for mutual defence against aggression and for economic co-operation. The British Government were, therefore, invited to declare their war aims clearly and state how these would be applied to India and given effect to imme\u00ac diately, so that India could assume her proper role in the emergence of the new I world order. ;\nThe author of the resolution, commented Gandhi, was an artist, an ardent patriot who was also a humanitarian and an internationalist. Jawaharlal made clear the commitment of the Congress to an anti-fascist position and to national freedom in the larger world context. Theyears of continuing Nazi aggression in Europe were to him the basic cause of the war, and this knowledge was never clouded in his mind by the intensity of his dislike of British imperialism. .Even after the Government had rejected the Congress offer, he rebuked the editor of the National Herald for pro-German headlines and ordered the dismissal of the sub-editor responsible. He wrote to Edward Thompson:\ni\nSome Congressmen tell you that it is not possible to make India enthu\u00ac siasticonyour side. But I know that they are wrong \u2014 I would guarantee to do it myself. In the last war there was a doubt about your cause, and whenever you had a defeat there was rejoicing in the bazaars.

Thompson, Enlist India for Fraadom! p. .\nTHE WAR CRISIS\n\nthere will be the old temptation to rejoice. But everyone knows your\ncause is \u2018just\u2019.\nHowever, Jawaharlal was unwilling to be stampeded by sentiment as Gandhi had been. The war was clearly going to be a long one which in time would probably extend beyond Europe and involve the United States. So what was required of the Congress was to state the general attitude not only of the Indian nationalist movement but of all colonial peoples, and wait for the British Government to clarify their cause by appropriate action. His lack of faith in Neville Chamberlain\u2019s Government was, it should be remembered, widely shared in Britain. The Manchester Guardian approved of the resolution. \u2018Nehru\u2019, recorded Beatrice Webb in her diary, \u2018has called the British bluff, the pretence of fighting for political democracy and the rights of man.\u2019 Stafford Cripps urged Jawaharlal not to accept anything short of conclusive action and to see to it that the Congress stood firm as a rock, while Attlee counselled the British Cabinet to respond to the demand of the Congress with \u2018imaginative insight\u2019. Even a considerable number of Conservative back-benchers pressed Zetland to reach an agreement with the Congress. But the Viceroy had made up his mind that his present duty was neither to move even at snail\u2019s pace along the path of constitutional progress nor to seek ways of harnessing India's enthu\u00ac siasm for democratic principles. He had no commitment to the Indian people, and even the tragedy of famine in Bengal caused him no concern. He was now a war Viceroy, whose first objective was to make India a safe base for the me\u00ac chanical prosecution of the war, and to provide men and money. Every decision had to be judged soley by the extent to which it would promote an Allied victory; and Linlithgow lacked the imagination to see that wars are not won by guns and soldiers alone. In this projection the Congress, as guided by \u2018a doctrinaire like Nehru with his amateur knowledge of foreign politics and of the inter\u00ac national stage\u2019/' had no place. On the other hand, more importance should be given to the Muslim League; and the Viceroy thought that this would have the added advantages of appeasing the army, which was largely Muslim, and the tribal elements on the North-West Frontier. Linlithgow decided, therefore, to ignore Jawaharlal and to break with the Congress; \u2018the present is probably abetteropportunity than may present itself later\u2019.

Jawaharlal was less impulsive on this occasion than Gandhi; but his preference for the Allies was no weaker. He madedear, even if only indirectly, his anxiety to assist personally to the full in the war effort, and wanted the association of persons like himself, who were representative of public opinion, with some form of a National War Council. If India and Britain waged war together as equal partners, with no formal legal changes, but with Indian leaders being taken into confidence and associated with decisions on such matters as the extent of India\u2019s war effort, the raising of armies and industrial mobilization, this in itself would have removed most of the constitutional difficulties by the time the war had been successfully concluded. But it was hinted that Jawaharlal would not insist on even this.\nZetland, the Secretary of State, approved of Jawaharlal\u2019s proposals, but by then it was too late. Desmond Young, the editor of the Pioneer, had rushed \u2018 to Delhi carrying Jawaharlal\u2019s message; Linlithgow was half-convinced but Sir Gilbert Laithwaite, the Viceroy\u2019s private secretary, brushed it off. Gandhi himself was told, unbelievably, that the British Government would be most unwilling to define their war aims at this stage and had never committed them\u00ac selves in the least degree to fighting for democracy. Jawaharlal began to lose hope of any reasonable arrangement, and his interview, along with Rajendra Prasad, with the Viceroy on  October confirmed his fears. The Viceroy made no secret of his \u2018rather negative\u2019 conclusions. The British Government could not ignore the Muslims and the Princes, and could make no specific commit\u00ac ment about Dominion Status till federation had been introduced. There could be no extensive expansion of the Executive Council or sharing of power with political parties in the central government. All he was prepared to do was to form a group consisting of a few members from the two houses of the central legislature with whom the Government would keep in touch on defence matters.\n Linlithgow to Zetland,  September , Zetland papers, vol. .\nLinlithgow's record of interview with Jinnah,  September , Zetland papers, vol. . \u2019Haig's telegram to Viceroy reporting conversation with Mrs bandit,  September, and Des\u00ac mond Young\u2019s report of conversation with Jawaharlal,  September , Haig papers, vol. ; Viceroy's note on interview, with Gandhi,  September , Zetland papers, vol. .\nZetland to Linlithgow, October , Zetland papers, vol. .\nD.

Heeven took the step, unusual for him, considering that he viewed events in an impersonal framework, of making a private appeal to Linlithgow. Ignoring the disappointing trend of his interview with the Viceroy, he acted on Gandhi\u2019s suggestion that he explain developments in the U.P. and used the opportunity to touch on wider issues. ,\nThis letter, written in the train to Wardha, has grown long. But I want to add a few words to it and to tell you how much I desire that the long conflict of India and England should be ended and that they should cooperate together. I have felt that this war, with all its horrors, has brought this opportunity to our respective countries and it would be sad and tragic if we are unable to take advantage of it. None of us, in India or England, dare remain in the old grooves or think in terms of past con\u00ac ditions. But events are moving so fast that sometimes I fear that they will overtake our slow moving minds. There are all the elements of a Greek tragedy in the world situation today and we seem to be pushed along inevitably to a predestined end. You told me that I moved too much in the air. Probably you are right. But it is often possible to get a better view of the lie of the land from the heights than from the valleys. And I have wandered sufficiently on the solid earth of India and mixed with the people who labour there to think of India in earthly terms.\nMay I say how much I appreciate your friendly courtesy to me? It was a pleasure to meet you for a second time, and whenever chance offers an opportunity for this again, I shall avail myself of it. But whether we meet or, as you once said, look at each other from a distance over a gulf that has not been bridged, we shall do so, I earnestly trust, with no trace of unfriendliness, and realizing the difficulties which encompass us and which compel us to pursue different paths.\nThe two paragraphs justify full quotation, for they mark the only occasion, at any time from the Amritsar tragedy in April  till Lord Mountbatten\u2019s arrival in India in March , when Jawaharlal broke through to a human level in his dealings with British officials. It is curious that the recipient of such warmth should have been Linlithgow, the least emotional of men, \u2018heavy of body and slow of mind, solid as a rock and with almost a rock\u2019s lack of aware\u00ac ness,\u2019 as Jawaharlal later bitterly described him. It is not so much that there was in Linlithgow a hidden vein of a finer quality that had struck a chord in Jawaharlal as that Jawaharlal wasdesperately anxious to find away which would\n*Mesuge toNows ChronicIt,  October .\naTo Linlithgow,  October .\n*Tb* Discovtry of India, p. .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nenable the Congress to co-operate with the Government. So, though all reason weighed against it, he sought to reach out to the Viceroy. Awaiting a response, he pushed through, to the annoyance of the socialists, a resolution at the ACC meeting, endorsing the stand taken by the Working Committee. India should for the present stand aloof, but if given the opportunity she should jgin the war. It was an imperialist war but might not continue as such; it would certainly create a new world order and if India played her part in the right direction she could influence this change for the better. But if the response were not forth\u00ac coming, there was no alternative to conflict with the British. \u2018The next few weeks will probably make a big difference in India, this way or that.\u2019\nWithin not weeks but days, however, there came the stinging British reply. Linlithgow had sent a friendly but non-committal answer to Jawaharlal\u2019s letter, and his public statement (eft no doubt that the Government had not revised their policy in the context of the war situation. The Viceroy stressed the differences among the Indian political parties, contended that no precise definition ofwar aims was as yet practicable, and was ready to say no more than that Britain was fighting to resist aggression. As for India\u2019s future, attention was gravely drawn to the preamble of the Act of , to the statement on Dominion Status in  and to the virtues of the Act of . At the end of the war, the British Government would be very willing to enter into consulta\u00ac tions as to any modifications of that\u2019 Act that might be made with the agree\u00ac ment of all the vested interests in India; and in the meantime, a consultative group for war activities could be set up.\nThoughJawaharlal knew that his hope had been faint, yet hisdisappointment was intense. It had been made dear that Britain dung to her imperialism and was fighting to preserve it; and Indians were asked to shed their blood in order to strengthen their shackles. The statement showed the most amaziqg ignor\u00ac ance of India and of the temperof the Indian people. The Congress in turn could only say \u2018an emphatic no\u2019 to this and once more prepare togo into the wilderness. If one door, that of co-operation, was barred to them, they would open other doors. * Jawaharlal was for the Congress declining to assist in the war effort and preparing for the resignation or dismissal of the provincial ministries, but the Working Committee went further and directed the Congress ministries to resign as a first step. There had never been so much unanimity in all Congress drdes. But theGovernmentwere still incapable of grasping the consequences of their mulishness, and sought to evade the conflict by relying on Gandhi\u2019s\n To Frances Gunther,  October . a  October . * Speech,  October , Indian AnnualRegister, , vol. , pp. -.

The subtlety of Gandhi's reactions, and his placing of this offer in the context of total non-violence, were beyond their comprehension. The Congressleaders weresummoned to Delhi again and asked to reach an agreement with the League in the provinces, in which case the Government would be willing to create two or three more seats in the central Executive Council. To ensure that Gandhi accepted and was satisfied with this trivial change, the Government manoeuvred to secure Rajagopala- chari\u2019s presence in Delhi to advise Gandhi. But Gandhi, to the surprise of no one except the Government of India, refused to abandon the Working Com\u00ac mittee, and merely assured the Viceroy that he was anxious to avoid dvil disobedience. The sentence in Rajendra Prasad\u2019s official letter to the Viceroy of  November, that till \u2018the main and moral issue' about clarification of war aims had been dealt with the Congress could not consider any subsidiary proposal was, in fact, drafted by Gandhi.\nFrom the start of the war crisis, the Congress had hoped for a joint approach with the League to the British Government. Jinnah had been invited to the meeting of the Working Committee in September, but had declined. However, the Congress thought the idea worth pursuing. The League was also committed to independence, and it was this demand which the Government had spurned. So the Congress might utilize the urgency of the situation to secure priority for the political issue over communal differences. Jawaharlal met Jinnah informally early in October and thought the latter had not been totally immune to this suggestion. To humour Jinnah's vanity, Azad stayed away from the talks with the Viceroy. Sikandar Hyat Khan rang up Azad to say that acompro\u00ac mise might be reached if the Congress recognized the League as an \u2018important\u2019 organization even if not the sole organization representing Muslim opinion. This was unobjectionable, and made an agreement seem ^possible. The day after Linlithgow\u2019s statement, Jawaharlal wrote a friendly letter to Jinnah, offering to meet him again wherever it suited him to come to doser grips with their differences.\nI entirely agree with you that it is a tragedy that the Hindu-Muslim pro\u00ac blem has not so far been settled in a friendly way. I feel terribly distressed about it and ashamed of myself in so far as  have not been able to con\u00ac tribute anything substantial towards its solution ... With your goodwill and commanding position in the Muslim League that should not be so difficult as people imagine ...

I feel strongly that our dignity and self-respect as Indians have been insulted by the British Government. They take us for granted as hangers-on of their system, to be ordered about when and where they will. *\nAt the end of the month, Gandhi, Jawaharlal and Rajendra Prasad met Jinnah again. He was assured that the Constituent Assembly would be formed on the widest possible franchise and by agreement on communal representation, and that Assembly would frame full protection for the rights and interests of all minorities. Jawaharlal thought this had satisfied Jinnah. \u2018And so the whole fabric of communal disunion as a bar to India\u2019s progress, conjured up by the Viceroy, fades away and vanishes at the touch Of reason and reality.\u2019 He had found, he said later, that he and Jinnah had a great deal in common in regard to the objective and this had brought them much nearer than they had been for years.\nThese efforts worried the Government, who were relying heavily on the antagonism of the League to the Congress. The nationalist leaven-was bound to work in that body, particularly among its younger members, while Jinnah was unpredictable, \u2018and I had one or two rather anxious moments during the periodwhen he, Jawaharlal and Gandhi were discussing the situation together\u2019. But the Viceroy\u2019s fear was short-lived. A Constituent Assembly elected on adult franchise and framing a constitution after the British had left held fin appeal for Jinnah, because the Muslim masses might well smother communal tendencies even in separate electorates. But Jawaharlal might have been led to believe that in their talks Jinnah had agreed to this, by Jinnah\u2019s lack of real interest in this subject. He was still thinking in terms not of the future but of the immediate present, and trying to force the Congress to form coalition ministries with the League. In the talks, communal matters were only raised by him casually, but he was very keen on the Congress reversing its general policy and becoming again a liberal and moderate party. Jawaharlal and the Con* gress may have temporarily forgotten that the League\u2019s chief interest was jobs for the upper classes and felt confident that it would not oppose the freedom movement. But Jinnah's premiss throughout was that no alliance was possible with a politically advanced party. When, therefore, the Congress announced that its ministries would resign, h\u00a3 lost interest in these conversations. He had\nJawaharlal to Jinnah,  October .\nJThe Right and the Wrong of It\u2019, editorial in the National Herald, written by Jawaharlal,\n November .\n*Statement to the press,  November, The Bombay Chronicle,  November .\n Linlithgow to Zetland,  October , Zetland papers, vol. .\nIdem,  November , Zetland papers, vol. .

To the Congress resolutions in the provincial assemblies on India\u2019s attitude to the war, the members of the League were directed to move amend\u00ac ments asserting that democracy was unsuited to India. Fazlul Haq, the premier of Bengal, a volatile politician who at this time was passing through a phase of devotion to the League, challenged Jawaharlal to join him in a joint inquiry into atrocities committed by the Congress against the Muslims. Jinnah himself declined to sign a communique, drafted by Jawaharlal, stating that the Congress and the League had much in common on the political issue and the general objective; and, soon after the Congress ministries resigned in the first week of November, he called on all Muslims to celebrate a \u2018deliverance day'. The chal\u00ac lenge of Fazlul Haq, which Jawaharlal had promptly accepted, was conveniently submerged in the demand for a Royal Commission which obviously the Con\u00ac gress could not accept as it implied acquiescence in British intervention in Indian affairs. Their suggestion of a reference to Sir Maurice Gwyer, the chief Justice of the Federal Court, held to interest for Jinnah.\nThere was clearly no scope for further talks with Jinnah, and Jawaharlal called them off. Though he had, in the first shock of anger at the British atti\u00ac tude, made overtures to Jinnah, the failure of these efforts now caused him little concern. The \u2018deliverance day' celebrations had been no great success, and the League seemed to be visibly weakening. The Muslim peasantry, particularly in the U. P., and industrial workers did not support it, and Jinnah was relying on the feudal and upper middle classes. There was also no room for further negotiations with the Government. Zetland\u2019s reference to the Congress as a Hindu organization which should reach a settlement with the Muslim League put a lid on all talks. 'Lord Zetland and his Government have put the final seal on this bill of divorce, and the gulf that separates us is wider than the many oceans that intervene between his country and ours.\u2019 The Congress would go its own way with no turning back or regrets. But that way was not clear. The resignation of the ministries was the beginning of \u2018partial non-co-operation\u2019, but the next step was uncertain. Gandhi was firm that while the Congress could not co-operate with the British, it should not embarrass them in the prosecution of the war. Gvil disobedience should be begun only when it became inevitable because of some aggressive action by the Govern\u00ac ment, and the people were strong and prepared for struggle. As it was, in view of the hostility of the League, any such campaign would almost certainly de\u00ac teriorate into communal rioting. The Working Committee decided that the\n\u2022To Stafford Cripps,  January .\nJawaharla! toGandhi, November , on Zetland's speech of  November.\n* Lord Zetland's Apologia\u2019, editorial in the National Harold, written by Jawaharlal,  November .\nJawaharlaI toE.M.S. Namboodripad,  December .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\npolicy of non-co-operation should continue till the Government ceased to maintain their imperialist domination in alliance with the reactionary elements in the country. But, after slight wavering, the Committee returned to the Gandhian path. Stress was laid on non-violence and on the constructive pro\u00ac gramme as the only ways of preparing the country for civil resistance; and the Committee reaffirmed that it was inherent in every form of satyagraha that no effort should be spared to achieve an honourable settlement.\nFor the present, wrote Jawaharlal, all of us have to go through the valley of the shadow. But in some ways the darkness was much greater for him. He had never been happy about Stalin\u2019s alliance with Hitler, and did not expect it to last long. There had been some justification for it in Russia\u2019s need to pro\u00ac tect her own interests; it had strengthened Russia\u2019s whip hand in Europe, kept her out of war, and halted Germany\u2019s eastward drive. However, the partition of Poland had been bad enough; and now Russia had gone to war with Finland. This again, as Jawaharlal saw, could be justified as intended to stave off the possibility of Finland being used by other powers as a platform for attacking Russia. Nevertheless, he did not conceal that the invasion had been a great shock to him. Russia\u2019s strength in the outside world lay in her principles and her idealism. The principles, for all he knew, might still be there, but the ideal\u00ac ism was wearing thin. Russia, the symbol to all progressive forces of hope and fulfilment, had descended from the pedestal onwhich her ardent champions had placed her, and bartered away her moral prestige and the support of so many of her friends for seeming political advantage. In a signed article, intended to correct the pro-Soviet bias of some editorials in the National Herald, Jawa\u00ac harlal recounted the gloom which had been cast on him by the purges within Russia and the too facile opportunism of Soviet foreign policy. By lining herself with the aggressor nations, and attacking a small democratic country, she was paying heavily and \u2019in a coin which cannot be counted, for it is made up of the wishes and ideals of innumerable human beings\u2019. Stalin\u2019s government had dealt themselves a severer blow than any combination of enemies could have.done and in the process injured the cause of socialism itself.\nIn these circumstances, Jawaharlal looked to the United States. He had admired Roosevelt\u2019s attitude in the Czech crisis, and what now gave him con\u00ac fidence was the belief that the burden of the future would ultimately fall on the United States. \u2018India is far from America, but more and more our thoughts go to this great democratic country, which seems, almost alone, to keep the torch ofdemocratic freedom alight, in a world given over to imperialism and fascism,\n Working Committee resolutions,  November and  December .\n ToMadame Chiang Kai-shek,  December .\n*See his editorials in National Harald, \u2018What is Stalin aiming at?* and \u2018Russ|a and Finland\u2019,\n November and  December , respectively.\n* Press conference at Bombay,  December, reported in Tba Bombay Chroniclt,  December i. ^\n \u2018What of Russia now?', article written on  January  for the National Harald.\nTHE WAR CRISIS\n\nand violence and aggression, and opportunism of the worst type.* But Soviet policy and action strengthened his acceptance of the Gandhian method. It was Russia\u2019s failure to keep her means above reproach that had led to the ends being twisted to fit in with these means. This example of violence and oppor\u00ac tunism distorting objective impressed on him the necessity of relying on non\u00ac violence and ethical action in achieving a free India. It is difficult otherwise to comprehend his meek acceptance of the constructive programme as the next step to be taken after the abandonment of provincial office. He himself resumed regular spinning after a break of nearly four years.\nSo, if Jawaharlal had laid down the Congress policy of non-co-operation, it was for Gandhi to implement it. His mind was preparing for a struggle, and he continually laid stress on discipline and non-violence. But he could not see his way ahead. Having said 'nothing doing\u2019, the Congress could do little more. There was no question of any compromise or manoeuvring, but there was also no desire to precipitate a conflict. Jawaharlal does not seem to have expected anything much to happen immediately, and was almost in a relaxed mood. He took slow trains as a diversion and was considering a trip in the summer first to Switzerland to see his daughter and then perhaps even to the United States.\nThe world is in a curious muddle and we in India are also tied up in many knots. But there is no need to worry overmuch either about our personal affairs or about national affairs. When there is so much that is bad taking,place in the world, we can shoulder our own burdens, which are relatively light, more easily.\nThe Government thought they were better placed. They had no intention of breaking the stalemate they had created. But they fancied, perhaps because Gandhi was guiding the Congress again and was reluctant to resort to civil dis\u00ac obedience, that a settlement on their terms was feasible. Linlithgow felt that despite Jawaharlal\u2019s irreconcilable attitude, the general atmosphere was a good deal more conducive to an agreement than one could have hoped, while Harold Laski, with his access to official quarters, reported that India 'is abrighter spot. I think there is agood chanceof Congress settlingon the basis of Dominion Status at the close of the war plus representation in the Viceroy\u2019s Council now. There is a long story behind this, but I feel better about the Indian pros\u00ac pect than for years.\u2019 The Viceroy reverted to his old, foredoomed policy of seeking to detach Gandhi from Jawaharlal. When he saw Gandhi early in\n'India\u2019s Demand and England's Answer\u2019, article written on  January  and published in the Atlantic Monthly, April .\n\u2019Jawaharlal to the press at Bombay,  February,' The Hindustan Tjmas,  February .\n*ToMadameChiang Kai-shek, February .\nTo Syed Mahmud,  February .\n\u2019Linlithgow to Erskine,  January , Erskine papers, vol. ; Laski to Felix Frankfurter,  January , Laski papers.\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nFebruary, he flattered him, declared that Jawaharlal lacked Gandhi\u2019s experi\u00ac ence, steady vision and control of utterance and said that he could not accept responsibility for his share of any agreement unless he had a firm assurance that Gandhi would direct the Congress. This ridiculous attempt at low cunn\u00ac ing came, of course, to nothing, for beneath Gandhi\u2019s courtesy ancj attachment to Britain lay a steely determination to press for India\u2019s freedom. There was a shift in emphasis, in the resolution of  March of the Working Committee, from the importance of preparing for civil disobedience to the inevitability of such action as soon as organization permitted or circumstances demanded it. To avoid any blurring of issues, the paragraph in Jawaharlal\u2019s draft condemn\u00ac ing Soviet action in Finland was omitted; and Jawaharlal himself seems to have been converted to the view that Russia\u2019s error in attacking Finland should not divert attention from the actions of Britain and France, who were exploiting the Finnish war to weaken Russia, seeking to entangle her in a war in West Asia and converting the war in Europe into a side-show of the real battle against Russia, who was the one irreconcilable opponent of all forms of imperialism. The option of restricted or mass civil disobedience, suggested by Jawaharlal, was also deleted by the Committee; and to dispel suggestions that the Congress was prepared to compromise, the Committee reaffirmed that nothing short of complete independence \u2014 not even Dominion Status \u2014 and a constituent assembly would be acceptable. Only then would a permanent solution of the communal problem be possible, and the difficulty of the States, which was of British creation, disappear. * Gandhi and Jawaharlal favoured the issue of another resolution defining the content of sivaraj \u2014 deepening, as it were, the Karachi resolution on fundamental rights. They thought this would strengthen the Congress in the coming struggle; but as Patel, Azad and Rajendra Prasad disapproved, the idea was dropped.\nJawaharlal, with the support of Azad, was for the early, if not immediate, commencement of civil disobedience. The question of preparation did not arise for it was not a matter of taking the offensive but of repelling the Govern\u00ac ment\u2019s attack. They could not avoid the struggle by. sitting still. In Bengal the press was being stifled by censorship and demands for security, and large numbers of Congress workers were being arrested in various parts of the coun\u00ac try. The Government seemed to be tiying to see how much goading the Con\u00ac gress could bear. The possible hostility of the Muslim League should not be a deterrent to mass action. The Pakistan resolution passed by the League was a 'mad scheme\u2019 which could not last a day and was beyond discussion. To con\u00ac sider it seriously would be to encourage diverse separatist and disruptive forces.\n Linlithgow to Zetland,  January, and note of conversation with Gandhi,  February , Zetland papers, vol. .\n*\u2018On the Eve of Ramgarh\u2019, editorial written by Jawaharlal for the National Harold,  March, and published  March .\n*Jawaharlal\u2019s twodrafts of February , and final resolution of  March .\nTHE WARCRISIS\n\nThe communal problem was best shelved till the British leh India, because not only would the British base of that problem drop out but, if there were civil war, Jawaharlal could not envisage utilizing British assistance to suppress the Muslims.\nGandhi was not convinced. He dare not, he said, start civil disobedience, because if he did, disobedience would remain and civil would disappear. Even in the Frontier Province discipline had cracked. The Congress should form satyagraba committees and prepare the people, but there was no hurry to launch the movement. Once it started, the Government would probably take no action and allow the League and other anti-Congress forces to complicate the situa tion. Patel agreed but suggested individual civil disobedience to avoid demora\u00ac lization, and Gandhi was willing to consider this either on a large scale or restricted to a few or confined only to him.\nAware of the general trend of these discussions, the Government showed no concern. They did not take the demand for Pakistan seriously, but saw no reason to throw too much cold water on it, for it weakened the position of the Congress. On learning that Sikandar Hyat Khan was trying to get in touch with moderate Congress leaders so as to bring the Congress and the League together, Linlithgow cracked the whip and called him off. The widening gulf between the two parties enabled the Government to abandon all efforts to reach a settle\u00ac ment. Nothing more seemed to be required than preparations to deal firmly and promptly with any form of civil disobedience. I am not too keen to start talking\u2019, commented the Viceroy, \u2018about a period after which British rule will have ceased in India. I suspect that that day is very remote and I feel the least we say about it in all probability the better.\u2019 There could be no more revealing gloss on all the statements made by British authorities over the y$ars on their deter\u00ac mination to leave India.\nIn contrast, Jawaharlal thought that the British empire was doomed, and the war had made this more certain than ever. But his enthusiasm for action was now dimmed by his sense of chivalry. Events in Europe took charge of devel\u00ac opments in India. The Nazi Blitzkrieg brought him in line with Gandhi. He had surmised that the war could not continue for long in its \u2018phoney\u2019 phase and the German advance did not rattle him.

Neville Chamberlain's Govern\u00ac ment had gone, but a Cabinet with Winston Churchill and Leopold Amer> determining Indian policywas not likely to be more sympathetic to the national\u00ac ist viewpoint; nor, despite its earlier attitude, could much be hoped for from the Labour Party. Therefore, while India had no wish to see the triumph of Nazism, she could not be expected to rally to the cause of a tottering imperialism which spoke with arrogance and in terms of domination. To contend that British rule was preferable to that of the Nazis was to accept that Indians were a helpless people whoseonly choice was between masters. The Congress should adhere to its policy and add to its strength by preparing for satyagraha but take no action so long as Britain was in peril.\nIt wasdecided, as a demonstration of coolness, not to summon an emergency meeting of the Working Committee; but the policy as formulated by Gandhi and Jawaharlal was stated in a resolution, drafted by Jawaharlal, of the United Provinces Congress committee. As the British Government still thought in terms of empire and the picture of India was still one of British imperialism in action, so, whatever might happen in Europe and however deep the sympathy of India for the victims of aggression, there could be no change in India's atti\u00ac tude towards Britain. But Jawaharlal opposed an amendment that civil dis\u00ac obedience should be started immediately on the ground that it was not worthy of the Congress to take advantage of Britain\u2019s difficulties.\n\u2018It is heartening\u2019, wrote the Manchester Guardian* \u2018at this grave moment to have this knowledge, but since common danger has evoked this response, the Government of India should take advantage of it.\u2019 But the authorities were unequal to this level of honour. Amery wrote of a possible partnership with Jawaharlal. \u2018The new War Cabinet seems to be working well and the whole machine has been speeded up beyond recognition. Bevin is itiaking an admirable driver of the working man.

The Government were incapable of the magnanim\u00ac ity of the Congress, which with eveiy reverse suffered by the British became moregenerous and accommodating.

In other words, it the British made it possible, the Congress was willing to join in the fight in India's defence. Meeting again in the first week of July, the Working Com\u00ac mittee went even further. Setting aside on this occasion not only Gandhi but even Jawaharlal, the majority in the Committee did not insist on a declaration about independence by the British but offered to assist in defence if a fully national government were established. Jawaharlal argued that jto reduce acqui\u00ac sition of power to assumption of office and to seek to worm into it was to move along constitutional lines. Real power was the hold on the people, and this would be lessened by \u2018office power\u2019. This form of power, secured on terms dif\u00ac ferent from those laid down in earlier resolutions, would prove disastrous. But Rajagopalachari, the author of the proposal, wOn over Patel and Azad, and Jawaharlal agreed to abide by it. He was not convinced that this was the best way of serving India, but his concern for Britain swung him into acceptance.\nIt had not been easy for Jawaharlal to keep his emotions out of the way, to differentiate persistently between the British people and British imperialism and think clear-sightedly about India\u2019s own problem. He had always seen it in the context of world affairs and argued that an acceptance of India\u2019s freedom was not only right and just in itself but would strengthen the Allied cause immeasurably. Even so, the skittling of the European countries by the German war machine had depressed him intensely. On the fall of France, he wrote one of his most moving articles, looking beyond Petain and Laval to another France:\nthere must be one, for the heritage of a thousand years does not vanish in a night. That other France will rise again and assert the invincible spirit of freedom which made her great ... let us pay homage to the France of the Revolution, the breaker of the Bastille and of all the bonds that hold the human body and spirit captive.\nAnd so, though he believed that his colleagues were hustling themselves, he was willing not to assert his dissent. At the Working Committee he had declar\u00ac ed that, considering the mentality of the British Government, he would wel\u00ac come chaos if the alternative was association with that Government; but at Poona towards the end of the month, commending the resolution to the AICC, he acknowledged the merit of its offer. \u2018It may be that the dancing star of inde\u00ac pendence may emerge out of chaos, but it may also be that nothing but black clouds may emerge out of chaos.\u2019\nThe Congress, having offered a way out of the stalemate without compro\u00ac mising its basic position, awaited official reaction. The situation was bringing\n* Discussions in the Working Committee, July , Anand Bbawan papers.

But the Government persisted in refusing to accept this opportunity. It was sol, as JawaharJal wrote, to see a greatpeople so blind to everything except the narrow interestsof a class, and risking everything but not taking the step which would put them right with the world and with the historic processes that were marching on with giant strides. Even now the independence of India stuck in the throat of the British Government, and they continued in the old lordly way, threatening their penalties and preaching their homilies. They were still plac\u00ac ing their faith in the League as the propof empire. The section of the Urdu press which was controlled by the League fed the Muslim masses with abusive mis- representation of the Congress. Such propaganda was not without effect, enabling the British to rely on the communal problem and charge the Congress with being unrepresentative of total Indian opinion. The response of the Government therefore, when it came at last, was the usual stale anti-climax. They offered to appoint a few \u2018representative Indians\u2019 to the Executive Council and set up a War Advisory Council. The future constitution of India should be framed by a small body \u2018representative of the principal elements in India\u2019s national life\u2019 \u2014 and these elements included the Princes and British com\u00ac mercial interests; and any decision of that body would be subject to the fulfil\u00ac ment of Britain\u2019s obligations in India. \u2018The whole thing\u2019, commented Jawa- harlal, \u2018is fantastic and absurd and has not even the merit of decent phraseology about it.\u2019\nThis \u2018offer\u2019, which was made almost simultaneously with the publication of an ordinance banning all volunteer organizations, left no doubt that the British attitude remained unchanged. As a result, the Congress resolutions died a natural death and there was no further need for intellectual debate as to when non-violence was obligatory and when it was not feasible. The Congress had been driven from its moorings by emotional reaction to Britain\u2019s distress and the Nazi victories in Europe, but the British Government restored the old position. The travail of spirit and mental conflict was ended.\nThere was a fear in some people\u2019s minds that the British Government might be clever enough to take advantage of the situation. But they gave\n*'A Crumbling World\u2019 and \u2018What of Us?', articles in Notional Harold,  and  July .\ne. g. Maulvi, an Urdu monthly published from Delhi, wrote (July ): \u2018Atheists like Pandit lawaharlal Nehru who do not like even to swear in the name of God are placed in the forefront' when the issue is the construction of a slaughter house in Lahore, but when there is.any question relating to a mandir, or the language and customs of the Hindus, the same Pandit reveals him\u00ac self in his true colours as a staunch Hindu. He can, however, never tolerate that the Muslims shall also remain staunch Muslims. It is people of such low mentality who have disgraced the Congress and whoare responsible for the separation of theMuslims from it.\u2019^\n*Press Conference at Bombay August, The Hindustan Timas  August .\n\nTHE WAR CRISIS\ncredit for intelligence where itwas not due ... Nothing is more astonish\u00ac ing than the ineptitude of the British ruling class in England during the last few years, nothing with one notable exception. That exception is the Government of India.\ns\nDespite all the resistance and suspicion that had been built up over a long period, the Congress had sought to work with the British in their crisis of survival; and the offer had been contemptuously rejected. It was \u2018the final breaking of such slender bonds as held our minds together, it means the ending of all hope that we shall ever march together\u2019.\nThe Congress had, therefore, been pushed back into the mood of civil dis\u00ac obedience. It accepted again the leadership of Gandhi and prepared for conflict. The Government of India, on their part, decided to strike at once and with the utmost vigour if faced by a challenge from the Congress and to destroy it as a political party. On the very day that the constitutional proposals were announc\u00ac ed, the Viceroy wrote to the Governors that he felt very strongly that the only possible answer to a \u2018declaration of war' by any section of the Congress should be a proclaimed determination to crush that organization as a whole. They believed that the Congress was losing its grip and had little support among the Muslims. The British Government agreed that immediate action to paralyse the movement was preferable to a policy of waiting to see how the movement developed and only wished to be consulted before any action was taken. The Labour Party, which was now in the coalition government, supported this policy and disapproved of the attitude of the Congress.\nThe Government, therefore, went ahead with the arrests of Congressmen and Jawaharlal expected to return at any moment to prison. As he cabled to his daughter in Switzerland, an early resumption of the old pilgrimage was likely. He even courted it by wandering about the U.P. in the uniform of a Congress volunteer and advising the volunteer corps to continue its activities. But again Gandhi moved away from a head-on collision, because it was not in his nature to press the British Government at a time when they were themselvesthreaten\u00ac ed in their hoipe. All that he committed the Congress to was non-violence and a demand for freedom of speech to preach against participation in the war; self-imposed restraint could not be taken to the extent of self-extinction. The demand would be expressed by individual civil disobedience. The first to court arrest by making a public speech against support of the war would be Vinoba Bhave, and the second Jawaharlal.\n* \u2018India in Travail\u2019, Jawaharlal\u2019s article in NationalHnnU,  August .\n'The parting of the ways\u2019, article written by Jawaharlal on  August .\n* Letter of  August , Home Dept.

But they decided to arrest Jawaharlal even before he offered satyagraha. He was thought to begoing faster than Gandhi, and to be one step ahead of him. Gandhi appeared to be determined to carry on with civil disobedience at a lew tempera\u00ac ture and in very small doses, but Jawaharlal seemed eager to push things to extremes. He had been touring the United Provinces drawing attention once more to agrarian grievances. His arrest might well upset whatever long-term plans Gandhi might have. TheWar Cabinet approved and, on its own, suggested that Jawaharlal be prosecuted on a substantive charge rather than merely kept in detention.\nJawaharlal himself probably preferred this, for while he loyally accepted Gandhi\u2019s decision about the manner and object of civil disobedience he could not have been greatly excited by individual satyagraha. The issue remained that of India and the war, and the goal was still independence; but the fight was being waged for the moment on a very narrow front. Jawaharlal was in an almost tranquil mood. His life was wrapped up in public affairs, and he had hardly any private life. An attractive personality brought him a large circle of friends and he had, when he cared to make the effort, a \u2018knock-down\u2019 charm. But throughout his life none of these friendships, with either men or women, impinged deeply on him; and his was a life of crowded loneliness. He could, as we have seen, be an emotional client; but he would seem to have been normally incapable of an equal relationship. This probably explains why in these years the men whom he allowed to get close to him were those, like Syed Mahmud and Sri Prakasa, who really had nothing to offer. His only deep attachment was to his daughter, and to her he was the ideal of perfection. His name for her, \u2018Indu-boy\u2019, makes clear the effort at compensation for lack of a son, and he pro\u00ac bably thought of her as carrying on his work. But he never forced his affection or his will on her and,'while always willing to give advice when sought, never imposed his directives. So the thought of going under completely or at least for years did not worry him. There were, to him, no separate causes left in the world, as all of them ran into one another, but his primary commitment was to India\u2019s freedom and on that he was not prepared to compromise. His speeches to the peasants of his province were clear and calm.\nHe was evidently moved. There was a sense of vast issues, of great deci\u00ac sions, of the call which might come to anyone at any moment. The multitude of listeners seemed to be in tune with the speaker'and seemed .to rise above themselves for the moment. There was a hush and a solem\u00ac nity which pervaded the atmosphere . . .

He developed this theme and the picture became a living and a glowing one. And then, suddenly, he grew sad. For twenty years and more, he said, he had seen this vision and sought to make it a reality. And yet when he saw the condition of the people round about him, their appalling poverty, their miserable environment, his heart misgave him. Was this all the result they had Obtained after twenty years travail and labour? Then again, he changed his mood and spoke triumphantly of the vast inner changes that had come over the people. They were poor still, and over-burdened with care and sorrow, but they had got rid of the fear that oppressed them and the hopelessness that enveloped their lives from birth to death. That was a mighty change which had brought them near to Swaraj. And now they stood on the threshold of the future, a future which would mean a changed world and a new India. What this new India would be he could not say. That would depend on their stout hearts and strong arms. Fate, Destiny, Karmal We were not going to be their slaves, but we would bend them to our will and make India after the picture in our own hearts.\nHastening to Wardha to dissuade Gandhi from undertaking a fast unto death in protest against British obduracy, Jawaharlal was arrested on  October at Gheoki station on his way back to Allahabad and taken to Gorakhpur for trial. He declined to plead, stating merely that it was his particular function and privilege to spread disaffection against the British Government in India. But he read a long statement which, over twenty years later, still gave him satisfaction. He pointed out that the reports of his speeches at Gorakhpur earlier in the month were scrappy, incomplete and often distorted; but this was not of importance. He stood by the policy of the Congress on the war and had in fact been chosen to give expression to it. It was monstrous that the Indian people should be thrust into a war without their consent; but the Congress had sought a way out which would be honourable to all parties concerned. There were very few persons in India, whether Indians or Englishmen, who had so consistently raised their voices against fascism and Nazism as he had done; but the actions of the British Government compelled the Indian people to resist to the uttermost. They had therefore decided to be no parties to this war ami to declare this to the world.\nIt is not me that you are seeking to judge and condemn, but rather the hundreds of millions of the people of India, and that is a large task even for a proud Empire. Perhaps it may be that, though I am standing before\n\u2019\u2018Jawaharlal reports himself'. National Hamid,  October .\n*B. V.

That is the issue before me, and that ultimate\u00ac ly is the issue before you, Sir.\nThe district judge gave Jawaharlal what was intended to be a deterrent sentence of four years. The savagery surprised Whitehall and New Delhi as well as Sir Maurice Hallett, the Governor at Lucknow; but Hallett vetoed any change in the terms. However, Churchill directed Amery to telegraph at once to the Viceroy expressing the hope that the actual rigour of the sentence would be modified and Jawaharlal not treated like a common criminal. Even this hope was unanswered. After a week in Gorakhpur jail, Jawaharlal was moved by stealth and under cover of night, in a railway compartment with shutters down and a car with curtains drawn, to his old quarters in Dehra Dun jail. There he remained, except for a week in Lucknow prison in April , till his release at the end of the year. This time the Government had no intention of easing in any way the harshness of jail life. The Viceroy even reprimanded the superin\u00ac tendent of police who had arrested Jawaharlal at Cheoki for giving him dinner at his house before having him driven down to Gorakhpur. It was made explicit that no personal friendliness was to be shown or social relations developed. In jail he was allowed one weekly newspaper and six books at any one time, and he could have one interview, send one letter without enclosures and receive one every fortnight. There were also many petty harassments. He was not for some time permitted a washerman or a barber, a warder was fined for allowing a prisoner who had been discharged to say good-bye to Jawaharlal, and the prisoner himself was not allowed to collect ten rupees which Jawaharlal had given him for his fare home. Friends from outside were not allowed to send Jawaharlal packed lunches, and he could only receive, fruit if he happened to know the sender. On one occasion, fruit sent by an unknown well-wisher from Rawalpindi was sent back at Jawaharlal\u2019s expense. When Jawaharlal wrote home asking his secretary to make a public announcement that no parcels or letters should be sent to him, this passage was blotted out by the censor. As he was to buy everything he needed through the jail staff (who wpre not known for promptitude) and get nothing from home, he was sometimes short even of toothpaste. He was directed, for the first time in his prison career, to give his thumb impression and he refused. He was, after a while, given all the letters\n\u2018Statement of  November , reprinted in J.

II).\nthe war crisis\n\nreceived from his daughter abroad, but the others were piled up in the office for weeks before Jawaharlal was told of them and asked to pick one. Permission to deal with the business of the National Planning Committee was refused. Papers pertaining to the Kamala Nehru Memorial Hospital were, after many months, exempted, but this delay had so held up work that Jawaharlal resigned the chairmanship. His plan for sorting out his father\u2019s letters was defeated by the authorities insisting that they would first have to go through these letters beforesending them to him; for as they obviously would be unable to understate the significance of these letters, Jawaharlal dropped the proposal. The limit on the number of letters he could write was later withdrawn, but on condition that none of these was published in the press \u2014 which was absurd because, apart from Jawaharlal\u2019s known aversion to giving any kind of undertaking, he was obviously in no position to give assurances about the behaviour of the recipients of his letters. In fact, Jawaharlal virtually gave up letter-writing and depended on interviews for keeping in touch with the outside world. Indira, who returned to India in May, took a cottage near Mussoorie; and this in itself made life a little pleasanter for Jawaharlal.\nHe had sought no favours. On the other hand, after hearing reports of ill- treatment of political prisoners in the camp jail in Lucknow, he wrote to the jail authorities that even the few privileges he was receiving had become hate\u00ac ful to him and he might defy jail discipline and invite the consequences.A les\u00ac ser man might have become personally embittered. But Jawaharlal accepted all this as part of his life and work without worrying about it. A sentence which he jotted down in his notebook at this time and was fond of quoting was that one could enjoy life perfectly only after resolving not to count the cost. What he understood by this was something very close to the teaching of the Gita; one should face the risks and perils of the adventure of life without calculating either what it involved or what might be its results. By enjoyment he meant something much more than a round of eating and sleeping and amusing one\u00ac self; it was doing what one had to. \u2019All we can do\u2019, he advised his daughter, \u2019is to face our job and do it as well as we can and to remain tranquil in spite of shock and disaster.\u2019 The certainties of moral and ethical, values which he had built around himself gave him serenity and strength. It is not surprising that though he had long ago moved away from the simple religious faith of the \u2019twenties and had now no anchorage of scriptural or secular dogma, he carried about with him a tiny edition of the Gita.\nIn this spirit, as soon as he found himself again in prison, he closed the various drawers of his mind which related to his activities outside and fell into the rhythm of jail life. The purpose was to prepare himself in body and mind\n*See letters to the jail superintendent,  January,  February,  February,  March,  July and  August ; to thelnspector-General ofPrisons,  February and lOMarch ; Padmaja Naidu toFrancesGunther,  March , HomeDept. File //Pol. ().\naTo the Inspector-General of Prisons,  August .\n^Letter,  November .\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nfor his work on release and to store energy so that he might be able to squander it later. Spinning, reading, regular exercise and plenty of sleep formed the main planks of his existence. He spent considerable time in cleaning and washing up and even \u2014 though food nevergreatly interested him \u2014 helped in the cook\u00ac ing. But the chief physical activity was gardening. On arrival in Dehra Dun, for about a week he did nothing all day long but dig the rather stohy ground. He then planted some seedlings but seems to have over-watered them, for the results were not very successful. But he was joined in his cell in January by Ranjit Pandit, who brought a more expert touch to this effort; and soon the barrack garden, despite the high walls and lack of sun, could boast of a few dahlias and sunflowers.\nIt was not, however, easy to forget about events in the world and only culti\u00ac vate his garden. Jawaharlal might ignore the unexciting progress of individual civil disobedience, but he could not shut out the war in Europe which was destroying the old order. Especially after the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, he was infuriated by the British ineptitude which excluded him and his coun\u00ac trymen from participation in these developments. Though he had almost no private correspondence, he sent what were virtually long articles to British acquaintances, and in these his pent-up bitterness exploded. Aperceptive mind like Beatrice Webb\u2019s, unswayed by passing winds, could grasp the quality of India\u2019s leaders.\nWhat is outstanding in the leadership of Gandhi and Nehru is the keen\u00ac ness and subtlety of intellect, the depth and refinement of the emotional life of thesetwo men, compared not only to the brutality and ultra coarse\u00ac ness of Mussolini and Hitler, but even to the conventional outfit, in thought and feeling, of Churchill and Roosevelt.\nBut most well-meaning British individuals and groups felt that the Congress had acted in a huff and forgotten the larger issues of the war in a narrow nationalism. They showed no real understanding of the Indian problem, and they certainly had no influence on the policy of their Government. But Jawa- harlal had never been surer of the rightness of any decision and, though he did not share Gandhi\u2019s total pacifism, was entirely at one with him in the political decisions about the war crisis.^\nHalf-relaxed and half-resentful, determined not to worry and yet driven to exasperation by inactivity in a cataclysmic situation, Jawaharlal frequently set aside the present for thoughts of the future. But even more often his mind wandered back into the past. It was during this spell in jail that he began his\n\u2018See H. C. Bajpai, 'In the same cell with Jawaharlal Nehru', National Harold,  December .\n  September , Beatrice Webb diaries, vol. , p. .\n* To Col. Wedgwood  April and  November ; to Eleanor Rfcthbone,  June and November ; and to SirGeorge Schuster,  December .\nTHE WAR CRISIS\n\njourney into the five thousand years of India\u2019s history. \u2018We have undertaken many a voyage in time and space, as well as geographically in the present, for the discovery of India.\u2019 His election tours had woken him to the myriad aspects of India\u2019s diverse unity; and to this was added an increasing apprecia\u00ac tion of India\u2019s thought and culture. Earlier he had wanted to change his country and bring her abreast of the twentieth century. This aspiration never left him. But with it was now blended a pride in India\u2019s achievement and a firm sense of his own basic Indian-ness. \u2018It is a debt I can never repay; but it is an obli\u00ac gation that I cannot forget and which I shall seek to discharge to the end of my days.\u2019\nA further element in his mental ferment was the conscious increase in the intellectual influence of Gandhi and Tagore. The horrors of war drove him to a deeper acceptance of non-violence not merely as a political weapon for India but as perhaps the only promise for the future of man. There was a reversion in this respect to his attitude in the early \u2019twenties. Tagore, who died that August, had been very different from Gandhi, but he had also been basically of India\u2019s soil, the inheritor and expositor of her wisdom. \u2018Again I think of the richness of India\u2019s agelong cultural genius which can throw up in the same generation two such master-types, typical of her in every way, yet representing different aspects of her many-sided personality.\u2019\nThe result of these varied yet converging impacts could be seen when Jawaharlal, in the latter half of , again took up serious writing. In  he had sent to the American publishers of his Autobiography a hurriedly written postscript, \u2018Five Years After\u2019. Now he set out to write a fuller version of a second volume of his autobiography. He drafted a few chapters but rejected them, using some of the material in the long work which he completed when again in prison. But he was more interested in the making of India than in his personal development. Even in his first draft he was often tugged- for long stretches by the pull of the past from an account of himself into flashbacks into India\u2019s histoiy, and the factors which moulded her personality. This tendency became more pronounced in the second, larger effort which was published as The Discovery of India.\nTowards the end of the year the Government of India came round to the view that all Congressmen in jail, including Jawaharlal, could be released. Hallett, the Governor of the U.P., opposed Jawaharlal\u2019s release because he thought it would demoralize the civil services and the Muslim League, while Winston Churchill thought any such general release would be \u2018surrender at the moment of success\u2019. But the War Cabinet supported the Government of India, with Churchill muttering something to the effect, \u2018when you lose India, don\u2019t blame me.\u2019 So Jawaharlal was out again on  December.\n*To Col. Wegwood,  April .\naTo Eleanor Rathbone,  June .\n*To Krishna Kripalani,  August .\nGtendevon, op. cit., pp. -.\n\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nHis personal mood of bitterness against British policy seemed but a reflec\u00ac tion of the general hardening of Indian public opinion. There was a widespread conviction that the British were not only alien oppressors but the greatest disruptive force in India and the champion of all reactionary elements. Pro\u00ac fessor Coupland, visiting India at this time, thought that one particular incident, Churchill\u2019s categorical announcement in September  that the Atlantic Charter would not apply to India, had led to a spreading of a new and uncomfor\u00ac table suspicion of British intent even beyond nationalist circles. On the other hand, the involvement of Russia and the United States and the spread of the war in Asia had altered the nature of the conflict. Jawaharlal had no hesitation in expressing publicly his hope that the progressive forces, as represented by Russia, the United States, Britain and China, would emerge victorious. But the Government of India continued their Rip Van Winkle policy. \u2018It is very difficult\u2019, commented Jawaharlal in exasperation, \u2018for intelligent people to submit to the decisions of unintelligent people.\u2019 What was required to enable India to do what it wanted to do, join the war wholeheartedly on the side of the Allies, was \u2018a pleasant psychological shock\u2019 establishing that the old order had changed in India as well; but of any such imaginative action the Government of India were wholly incapable. They were Asia\u2019s men of Vichy, living in the past and looking backwards, clinging to their interests and afraid of the people.\nJawaharlal was, therefore, keen that the Congress should not waver in its refusal to change its policy so long as the British gave no indication of anything more than remote assurances. Just as the British Labour Party had been in favour of the war but had declined to join Chamberlain\u2019s cabinet, so the Con\u00ac gress, while expressing its support for the Allies, should not offer any positive collaboration. The offers of , to assist in defence on certain conditions, should not be resurrected. \u2018I am not a believer in revivalism either in religion or politics.\u2019 The party should hold together under Gandhi\u2019s leadership and present an unshakeable front to the British while keeping in line with inter\u00ac national events. But at Bardoli in Christmas week Rajagopalachari once again persuaded the Working Committee to set aside Gandhi and ignore Jawaharlal and offer the co-operation of a free India in the defence of the country on a national basis. Civil disobedience seemed to Rajagopalachari to have served its purpose; the people were exhausted and unless Congress did something defi\u00ac nite in this crisis its cause would suffer. Wisdom lay in making as much political progress as possible during the war.\nJawaharlal attached hardly any importance to this resolution. As the British showed no sign of responding to the demand of the Congress, this was\n The Cripps Mission (Oxford, ), p. .\n Press conference at Lucknow, The Hindustan Timas,  December .\n Message.to theNews Chronicle,  December .\n\u00abStatement at Bombay,  December, The Hindustan Times,  December .\n\u2019To Sampurnanand,  December .\nJawaharlal\u2019s notes of Working Committee meetings,  to  December .\nTHE WAR CRISIS\n\na mere theoretical exercise. No compromise was possible between imperialism and nationalism, and Rajagopalachari\u2019s persistent suggestions of a settlement only added to the confusion. Gandhi, unwilling even to consider freedom at the cost of non-violence, formally withdrew from the organization. But he commended the resolution to the AICC and utilized the occasion to designate Jawaharlal formally as his chosen successor.\nSomebody suggested that Pandit Jawaharlal and I were estranged. It will require much more than differences of opinion to estrange us. We have had differences from the moment we became co-workers, and yet I have said for some years and say now that not Rajaji [Rajagopalacharil but Jawaharlal will be my successor. He says that he does not understand my language, and that he speaks a language foreign to me. This may or may not be true. But language is no bar to a union of hearts. And I know this\u2014that when I am gone he will speak my language."
