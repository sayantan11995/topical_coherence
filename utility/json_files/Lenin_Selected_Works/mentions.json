                "Thus, from the country\u2019s total product Adam Smith excluded capital, asserting that it resolves itself into wages, profit and rent, i.e., into (net) revenue; but in the gross revenue of society he includes capital, separating it from articles of consumption (= net revenue).",
                "This is the contradiction in which Marx catches Adam Smith: how can there be capital in the revenue if there was no capital in the product?",
                ")[10] Without noticing it himself, Adam Smith here recognises three component parts in the value of the total product: not only variable capital and surplus-value, but also constant capital.",

                "There has been ample evidence since then to show that Skaldin was perfectly right: the fact that the peasant remains tied to the land, and that the peasant community is an exclusive social estate only worsens the position of the rural proletariat and retards the country\u2019s economic development, while being unable in any degree to protect the \u201csettled proletarian\u201d from the worst forms of bondage and subjection, or from the decline of his wages and living standards to the very lowest level.",
                "The reader may have already seen from the above-quoted excerpts that Skaldin is a foe of the village community.",
                "To the defenders of the village community Skaldin retorts that \u201cthe ancient common law\u201d has outlived its day.",
                "In Skaldin\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe patriarchal family, communal ownership of the land and common law\u201d have been irrevocably condemned by history.",
                "this correct observation Skaldin adds hot Manchester School philippics.",
                "Therefore, Skaldin\u2019s unreserved hostility to the village community from the purely bourgeois standpoint is combined with his consistent defence of the peasants\u2019 interests.",
                "Hostile though he is to the village community, Skaldin does not advance foolish projects for forcibly abolishing the community and forcibly introducing some other, similar system of land ownership, such as are usually concocted by the present-day opponents of the village community, who favour gross interferences in the peasants\u2019 life and attack the village community from anything but the standpoint of the peasants\u2019 interests.",
                "Skaldin, on the contrary, strongly protests against being classed with the believers in \u201cforcible abolition of communal Land tenure\u201d (144).",
                "Indeed, none but the peasants themselves can properly decide the best time for such passage.\u201d Consequently, Skaldin is opposed to the village community only for the reason that it hampers economic development, prevents the peasant from withdrawing from the community and giving up his land, that is, for the same reason that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d are opposed to it today; this hostility has nothing in common with defence of the selfish interests of the landlords, with defence of the survivals and the spirit of serfdom, with advocacy of interference in the life of the peasants.",
                "Skaldin\u2019s general opinion about the causes of the peasants\u2019 distressed condition is that they are all survivals of serfdom.",
                "Skaldin heatedly refutes these views.",
                "It is absurd to attack the family division of the land: \u201cEven if divisions do injure the peasants\u2019 material interests for a while, they save their personal freedom and the moral dignity of the peasant family, that is, those higher human blessings without which no civil progress is possible\u201d (217), and Skaldin rightly points to the real reasons for the campaign against land divisions: \u201cmany landlords highly exaggerate the harm caused by divisions, blaming them, as well as drunkenness, for all the consequences of the various causes of the peasants\u2019 poverty, which the landlords are so unwilling to recognise\u201d (218).",
                "To those who say that much is being written today about the peasants\u2019 poverty, but that formerly it was not so and that therefore the peasants\u2019 conditions must have deteriorated, Skaldin replies that: \u201cIn order to form a judgement of the results of the peasants\u2019 emancipation from the landlords\u2019 power, by comparing the peasants\u2019 present with their former condition, it would have been necessary, while serfdom still prevailed, to trim down the peasants\u2019 allotments as they have been now trimmed down, and to tax the peasants with all the duties which have appeared since the emancipation, and then see how the peasant serfs would have borne such conditions\u201d (219).",
                "It is a supremely characteristic and important feature of Skaldin\u2019s views that\u2019 he reduces all the causes of the deterioration in the peasants\u2019 condition to survivals of serfdom, to its legacy of labour service, quit-rent, cut-off land, and the peasants\u2019 lack of rights, and immobility.",
                "Skaldin not only does not see that the causes of the peasants\u2019 impoverishment might be found in the very structure of the new socio-economic relations, in the very structure of the post-Reform economy; he absolutely refuses to entertain the thought, being profoundly convinced that the complete abolition of all these survivals of serfdom would usher in an era of universal well-being.",
                "Skaldin writes: \u201cHere\u201d (i. e., in relation to the peasantry) \u201cthere is only one course the government can follow: to eliminate steadily and unflaggingly the causes which have reduced our peasants to their present state of dullness and poverty and which do not allow them to rise to their feet\u201d (224, my italics).",
                "Highly characteristic in this respect is the reply given by Skaldin to those who defend the \u201ccommunity\u201d (that is, binding the peasants to the village communities and allotments) on the ground that, without it, \u201ca rural proletariat will emerge.\u201d \u201cThis objection,\u201d Skaldin says, \u201cfalls to the ground when we remember what boundless tracts of land lie idle in our country from lack of hands to cultivate them.",

                "The Narodnik would no doubt look down on Skaldin with disdain and say that he was simply a bourgeois.",
                "Yes, of course, Skaldin was a bourgeois, but he was a representative of the progressive bourgeois ideology which the Narodniks have replaced by one that is petty-bourgeois and, on a whole number of points, reactionary.",
                "[5]\nTo complete our account of Skaldin\u2019s views, let us add that he is opposed to the system of social estates, advocates a single court of justice for all of them, sympathises \u201ctheoretically\u201d with the idea that the volost authorities should not be constituted on the basis of social estates, is an ardent advocate of public education, especially general education, favours local self-government and Zemstvo institutions, and believes that land credits, especially small, should be widely available, for there is a strong desire among the peasants to buy land.",
                "Here, too, Skaldin is a true \u201cMancunian\u201d: he says, for instance, that Zemstvo and municipal banks are \u201ca patriarchal or primitive form of bank\u201d and should give way to private banks, which are \u201cvastly superior\u201d (80).",
                "In outlook, Skaldin may be called a bourgeois enlightener.",
                "Like the West-European enlighteners and the majority of the literary representatives of the sixties, Skaldin was imbued with a violent hostility to serfdom and all its economic, social and legal products.",
                "We have taken Skaldin[6] as an example precisely because, while he was undoubtedly a representative of the \u201cheritage,\u201d he was at the same time a confirmed enemy of those ancient institutions which the Narodniks have taken under their protection.",
                "We have said that Skaldin was a bourgeois.",
                "It is not for nothing that Skaldin in one part of his book quotes Adam Smith: we have seen that both his views and the character of his arguments in many respects repeat the theses of that great ideologist of the progressive bourgeoisie.",
                "And so, if we compare Skaldin\u2019s practical suggestions with the views of the present-day Narodniks, on the one hand, and with the attitude to them of the \u201cRussian disciples,\u201d on the other, we shall find that the \u201cdisciples\u201d will always support Skaldin\u2019s suggestions, since the latter reflect the interests of the progressive social classes, and the vital interests of social development generally along the present, i. e., capitalist, path.",

                "The things that the Narodniks have changed in Skaldin\u2019s practical wishes, or in his presentation of problems, are a change for the worse, and are rejected by the \u201cdisciples.\u201d It is not against the \u201cheritage\u201d that the disciples \u201churl themselves\u201d (that is an absurd fabrication), but against the romantic and petty-bourgeois additions to the heritage made by the Narodniks.",
                "His Letters from the Countryside are likewise essays on the social aspects of rural life, so that in substance and even in form his book very much resembles that of Skaldin\u2019s.",
                "Engelhardt is much more talented than Skaldin, and his letters from the country are incomparably more lively and imaginative.",
                "It is not surprising that Engelhardt\u2019s book enjoys the steady sympathy of the reading public, and only recently appeared in a fresh edition, while Skaldin\u2019s book is almost completely forgotten, although it was only two years after its publication that Otechestvenniye Zapiski began printing Engelhardt\u2019s letters.",
                "There is therefore no need for us to acquaint the reader with the contents of Engelhardt\u2019s book, and we shall confine ourselves to a brief exposition of two aspects of his views: first, views that are characteristic of the \u201cheritage\u201d in general, and common to Engelhardt and Skaldin in particular; and, second, views that are specifically Narodnik.",
                "Having set himself the aim of conducting his farm on rational lines, Engelhardt was compelled, by virtue of surrounding circumstances, to strive for this by purely capitalistic methods and to leave aside all his theoretical and abstract misgivings concerning the \u201cemployment of farm labourers.\u201d In the field of theory Skaldin argued like a typical member of the Manchester School, completely failing to realise both that his arguments were of just this character, and that they corresponded to the needs of Russia\u2019s capitalist evolution."

                "It goes without saying that, such being Skaldin\u2019s opinion of the Reform, he could not possibly sentimentally idealise it in the way the Narodniks did, and still do, when they say that it sanctioned people\u2019s production, that it was superior to the West-European peasant reforms, that it made a tabula rasa of Russia, and so on.",

                "In posing these problems the Narodniks performed a great historical service, and it is quite natural and understandable, that, having offered a solution (whatever it maybe worth) for these problems, Narodism thereby occupied a foremost place among the progressive trends of Russian social thought.",
                "Very soon after the problem of capitalism in Russia had been posed, it became clear that our economic development was capitalistic, and the Narodniks proclaimed this development a retrogression, a mistake, a deviation from the path supposedly prescribed by the whole history of the nation\u2019s life, from the path supposedly hallowed by age-old foundations, and so on and so forth.",
                "Carried away by their desire to retard and stop the break-up of the age-old foundations by capitalism, the Narodniks display an amazing lack of historical tact, they forget that antecedent to this capitalism there was nothing but the same exploitation combined with countless forms of bondage and personal dependence, which burdened the position of the labourer, nothing but routine and stagnation in social production and, hence, in all spheres of social life.",

                "Idealisation of the peasant and his village community is one of the essential components of Narodism, and Narodniks of all shades, from Mr. V. V. to Mr. Mikhailovsky, have given full rein to this effort to idealise and embellish the \u201ccommunity.\u201d There is not the slightest trace of such embellishment in Engelhardt.",

                "On the other hand, there are people whose views resemble the aforementioned fundamental principles of Narodism, yet who plainly and frankly \u201crenounce the heritage\u201d\u2014we might mention, for example, the same Mr. Y. Abramov to whom Mr. Mikhailovsky refers, or Mr. Yuzov.",

                "We repeat, what is important for us is to establish that the \u201cheritage\u201d of the sixties, in the sense outlined above, has nothing in common with Narodism, i.e., that there is nothing in common in the substance of their views, that they pose different problems.",
                "That is why we speak of a connection between the heritage and Narodism.",
                "First, Narodism made a big step forward compared with the heritage by posing for the attention of society problems which the guardians of the heritage were partly (in their time) not yet able to pose, or partly did not, and do not, pose because of their inherent narrowness of outlook.",
                "In posing these problems the Narodniks performed a great historical service, and it is quite natural and understandable, that, having offered a solution (whatever it maybe worth) for these problems, Narodism thereby occupied a foremost place among the progressive trends of Russian social thought.",
                "But the solution of these problems proposed by Narodism proved to be worthless, to be based on backward theories, long ago discarded in Western Europe, on a romantic and petty-bourgeois criticism of capitalism, on a disregard for the cardinal facts of Russian history and reality.",
                "But Narodism is absolutely incapable of measuring up to the contemporary development of capitalism in Russia, the contemporary state of our knowledge of Russian economic history and reality, the contemporary demands made on sociological theory.",
                "The \u201cheritage\u201d of the sixties with their ardent faith in the progressive character of the existing course of social development, their relentless enmity directed wholly and exclusively against the relics of the past, their conviction that these relics had only to be swept clean away and everything would go splendidly\u2014this \u2019heritage,\u201d far from having any part in the aforementioned views of Narodism, runs directly counter to them.",
                "The second feature of Narodism is belief in Russia\u2019s exceptionalism, idealisation of the peasantry, the village community, etc.",
                "Even more at variance with this tradition is Narodism\u2019s idealisation and over-embellishment of the countryside.",

                "Narodism, on the contrary, strives to retard and halt this development, is afraid of abolishing certain obstacles to the development of capitalism.",
                "Narodism, on the contrary, naturally tends to historical pessimism: the farther things go as they are, the worse it will be.",
                "Narodism posed the question of capitalism in Russia, but answered it in the sense that capitalism is reactionary, and therefore could not wholly accept the heritage of the enlighteners: the Narodniks always warred against people who in general strove to Europeanise Russia from the standpoint of a \u201csingle civilisation\u201d; warred against them not only because they, the Narodniks, could not confine themselves to these people\u2019s ideals (such a war would have been lust), but because they did not want to go so far in the development of this, i.e., capitalist, civilisation.",
                "By the nature of their aims, the first and last trends correspond to the interests of the classes which are created and developed by capitalism; Narodism, by its nature, corresponds to the interests of the class of small producers, the petty bourgeoisie, which occupies an intermediate position among the classes of contemporary society.",
                "Consequently, Narodism\u2019s contradictory attitude to the \u201cheritage\u201d is not accidental, but is a necessary result of the very nature of the Narodnik views: we have seen that one of the basic features of the enlighteners\u2019 views was the ardent desire to Europeanise Russia, but the Narodniks cannot possibly share this desire fully without ceasing to be Narodniks.",
                "The other heritage is Narodism.",
                "We have already shown that to confuse these two different things would be a gross error, for everyone knows that there have been, and still are, people who guard the \u201ctraditions of the sixties\u201d but have nothing in common with Narodism.",
                "Did Moskovskiye Vedomosti hurl itself against Narodism specifically?",
                "Not at all: it hurled itself no less, if not more, against the enlighteners in general, and Vestnik Yevropy, which absolutely abhors Narodism, is in its eyes no less an enemy than the Narodnik Russkoye Bogatstvo.",
                "Did Mr. Abramov or Mr. Volynsky hurl himself against Narodism?",
                "Mr. Mikhailovsky may not agree with these denunciations\u2014being a Narodnik, he certainly will not agree with them\u2014 but to assert that certain people \u201cfuriously\u201d attack the \u2018heritage of the sixties and the seventies,\u201d when, actually, they \u201cfuriously\u201d attack only Narodism, and attack it for having failed to solve the new problems posed by post-Reform history in the spirit of this heritage and without contradicting it\u2014such an assertion is a direct misrepresentation of the truth.",
                "This curious attempt at dissociation from the \u201cNarodniks,\u201d while at the same time preserving all the basic views of Narodism, can evoke nothing but laughter.",
                "Consequently, if the pillars of Russkoye Bogatstvo, who have done so much to develop, reinforce and disseminate the views of Narodism (in the broad sense), now think that they can escape the criticism of the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d simply by declaring that they are not \u201cNarodniks\u201d (in the narrow sense), that they constitute a quite specific \u201cethico-social school\u201d\u2014such subterfuges, of course, can only expose to justified ridicule people who are so brave and at the same time so diplomatic.",

                "Jeidels gives us a fairly exact answer to this important question:\n\n\u201cThe connections between the banks and industrial enterprises, with their new content, their new forms and their new organs, namely, the big banks which are organised on both a centralised and a decentralised basis, were scarcely a characteristic economic phenomenon before the nineties; in one sense, indeed, this initial date may be advanced to the year 1897, when the important mergers took place and when, for the first time, the new form of decentralised organisation was introduced to suit the industrial policy of the banks.",

                "In regard to the rapidity of Germany\u2019s economic development, Riesser, the author of the book on the big German banks, states: \u201cThe progress of the preceding period (1848-70), which had not been exactly slow, compares with the rapidity with which the whole of Germany\u2019s national economy, and with it German banking, progressed during this period (1870-1905) in about the same way as the speed of the mail coach in the good old days compares with the speed of the present-day automobile ... which is whizzing past so fast that it endangers not only innocent pedestrians in its path, but also the occupants of the car.\u201d In its turn, this finance capital which has grown with such extraordinary rapidity is not unwilling, precisely because it has grown so quickly, to pass on to a more \u201ctranquil\u201d possession of colonies which have to be seized\u2014and not only by peaceful methods\u2014from richer nations.",

                "Cecil Rhodes was a somewhat more honest social-chauvinist....\n\nTo present as precise a picture as possible of the territorial division of the world and of the changes which have occurred during the last decades in this respect, I shall utilise the data furnished by Supan in the work already quoted on the colonial possessions of all the powers of the world.",
                "Supan takes the years 1876 and 1900; I shall take the year 1876\u2014a year very aptly selected, for it is precisely by that time that the pre-monopolist stage of development of West-European capitalism can be said to have been, in the main, completed\u2014and the year 1914, and instead of Supan\u2019s figures I shall quote the more recent statistics of H\u00fcbner\u2019s Geographical and Statistical Tables.",

                "Supan gives figures only for colonies; I think it useful, in order to present a complete picture of the division of the world, to add brief data on non-colonial and semi-colonial countries, in which category I place Persia, China and Turkey: the first of these countries is already almost completely a colony, the second and third are becoming such."

            "18": [
                "Hobson, in his work on imperialism, marks the years 1884-1900 as the epoch of intensified \u201cexpansion\u201d of the chief European states.",
                "We take up the work by the English writer Hobson, Imperialism, which appeared in 1902, and there we read:\n\n\u201cThe new imperialism differs from the older, first, in substituting for the ambition of a single growing empire the theory and the practice of competing empires, each motivated by similar lusts of political aggrandisement and commercial gain; secondly, in the dominance of financial or investing over mercantile interests.\u201d [2]\n\nWe see that Kautsky is absolutely wrong in referring to English writers generally (unless lie meant the vulgar English imperialists, or the avowed apologists for imperialism).",
                "We see that Kautsky, while claiming that he continues to advocate Marxism, as a matter of fact takes a step backward compared with the social-liberal Hobson, who more correctly takes into account two \u201chistorically concrete\u201d (Kautsky\u2019s definition is a mockery of historical concreteness!)",
                "One of the shortcomings of the Marxist Hilferding is that on this point he has taken a step backward compared with the non-Marxist Hobson.",
                "\u201cIn 1893,\u201d writes Hobson, \u201cthe British capital invested abroad represented about 15 per cent of the total wealth of the United Kingdom.\u201d [1] Let me remind the reader that by 1915 this capital had increased about two and a half times.",
                "\u201cAggressive imperialism,\u201d says Hobson further on, \u201cwhich costs the tax-payer so dear, which is of so little value to the manufacturer and trader ... is a source of great gain to the investor....",
                "To demonstrate this in the clearest possible manner let me quote Hobson, who is a most reliable witness, since he cannot be suspected of leaning towards Marxist orthodoxy; on the other hand, he is an Englishman who is very well acquainted with the situation in the country which is richest in colonies, in finance capital, and in imperialist experience.",
                "With the Anglo-Boer War fresh in his mind, Hobson describes the connection between imperialism and the interests of the \u201cfinanciers\u201d, their growing profits from contracts, supplies, etc., and writes: \u201cWhile the directors of this definitely parasitic policy are capitalists, the same motives appeal to special classes of the workers.",
                "As for the second circumstance, Hobson writes: \u201cOne of the strangest symptoms of the blindness of imperialism is the reckless indifference with which Great Britain, France and other imperial nations are embarking on this perilous dependence.",
                "Most of the fighting by which we have won our Indian Empire has been done by natives; in India, as more recently in Egypt, great standing armies are placed under British commanders; almost all the fighting associated with our African dominions, except in the southern part, has been done for us by natives.\u201d\n\nHobson gives the following economic appraisal of the prospect of the partitioning of China: \u201cThe greater part of Western Europe might then assume the appearance and character already exhibited by tracts of country in the South of England, in the Riviera and in the tourist-ridden or residential parts of Italy and Switzerland, little clusters of wealthy aristocrats drawing dividends and pensions from the Far East, with a somewhat larger group of professional retainers and tradesmen and a larger body of personal servants and workers in the transport trade and in the final stages of production of the more perishable goods; all the main arterial industries would have disappeared, the staple foods and manufactures flowing in as tribute from Asia and Africa.",
                "We must not, however, lose sight of the forces which counteract imperialism in general, and opportunism in particular, and which, naturally, the social-liberal Hobson is unable to perceive.",
                "The German opportunist, Gerhard Hildebrand, who was once expelled from the Party for defending imperialism, and who could today be a leader of the so-called \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d Party of Germany, supplements Hobson well by his advocacy of a \u201cUnited States of Western Europe\u201d (without Russia) for the purpose of \u201cjoint\u201d action ... against the African Negroes, against the \u201cgreat Islamic movement\u201d, for the maintenance of a \u201cpowerful army and navy\u201d, against a \u201cSino-Japanese coalition\u201d, [8] etc.",
                "As Hobson observes, emigration from Great Britain has been declining since 1884.",
                "The leaders of the present-day, so-called, \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d Party of Germany are justly called \u201csocial-imperialists\u201d, that is, socialists in words and imperialists in deeds; but as early as 1902, Hobson noted the existence in Britain of \u201cFabian imperialists\u201d who belonged to the opportunist Fabian Society.",
                "This is also the main attitude taken by Hobson in his critique of imperialism.",
                "Hobson anticipated Kautsky in protesting against the \u201cinevitability of imperialism\u201d argument, and in urging the necessity of \u201cincreasing the consuming capacity\u201d of the people (under capitalism!).",
                "Compare his arguments on this subject in 1915, with Hobson\u2019s arguments in 1902.",
                "Sufficient premises are still lacking to enable us to answer this question.\u201d [7]\n\nHobson: \u201cChristendom thus laid out in a few great federal empires, each with a retinue of uncivilised dependencies, seems to many the most legitimate development of present tendencies, and one which would offer the best hope of permanent peace on an assured basis of inter-Imperialism.\u201d\n\nKautsky called ultra-imperialism or super-imperialism what Hobson, thirteen years earlier, described as inter- imperialism.",

                "Except for coining a new and clever catchword, replacing one Latin prefix by another, the only progress Kautsky has made in the sphere of \u201cscientific\u201d thought is that he gave out as Marxism what Hobson, in effect, described as the cant of English parsons."

                "Lloyd George argued that a coalition\u2014and a close coalition at that\u2014between the Liberals and the Conservatives was essential, otherwise there might be a victory for the Labour Party, which Lloyd George prefers to call \u201cSocialist\u201d and which is working for the \u201ccommon ownership\u201d of the means of production.",
                "To Liberals this is unacceptable on principle, Lloyd George explained, because they stand in principle for private property.",
                "If you go to the agricultural areas,\u201d said Lloyd George, \u201cI agree you have the old party divisions as strong as ever.",
                "We too have something to learn from Lloyd George.",
                "Of definite interest is the following episode, which occurred in the course of the discussion after Lloyd George\u2019s speech:\n\n\u201cMr.",
                "The Communist Party must keep its doctrine pure, and its independence of reformism inviolate, its mission is to lead the way, without stopping or turning, by the direct road to the communist revolution.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, the fact that most British workers still follow the lead of the British Kerenskys or Scheidemanns and have not yet had experience of a government composed of these people\u2014an experience which was necessary in Russia and Germany so as to secure the mass transition of the workers to communism\u2014undoubtedly indicates that the British Communists should participate in parliamentary action, that they should, from within parliament, help the masses of the workers see the results of a Henderson and Snowden government in practice, and that they should help the Hendersons and Snowdens defeat the united forces of Lloyd George and Churchill.",
                "\u201cTo lead the way without compromises, without turning\u201d\u2014this slogan is obviously wrong if it comes from a patently impotent minority of the workers who know (or at all events should know) that given a Henderson and Snowden victory over Lloyd George and Churchill, the majority will soon become disappointed in their leaders and will begin to support communism (or at all events will adopt an attitude of neutrality, and, in the main, of sympathetic neutrality, towards the Communists).",
                "Incidentally, as can also be seen from Lloyd George\u2019s speech, both conditions for a successful proletarian revolution are clearly maturing in Great Britain.",
                "If we are the party of the revolutionary class, and not merely a revolutionary group, and if we want the masses to follow us (and unless we achieve that, we stand the risk of remaining mere windbags), we must, first, help Henderson or Snowden to beat Lloyd George and Churchill (or, rather, compel the former to beat the latter, because the former are afraid of their victory!",
                "); second, we must help the majority of the working class to be convinced by their own experience that we are right, i.e., that the Hendersons and Snowdens are absolutely good for nothing, that they are petty-bourgeois and treacherous by nature, and that their bankruptcy is inevitable; third, we must bring nearer the moment when, on the basis of the disappointment of most of the workers in the Hendersons, it will be possible, with serious chances of success, to overthrow the government of the Hendersons at once; because if the most astute and solid Lloyd George, that big, not petty, bourgeois, is displaying consternation and is more and more weakening himself (and the bourgeoisie as a whole) by his \u201cfriction\u201d with Churchill today and with Asquith tomorrow, how much greater will be the consternation of a Henderson government!",
                "The Communist Party should propose the following \u201ccompromise\u201d election agreement to the Hendersons and Snowdens: let us jointly fight against the alliance between Lloyd George and the Conservatives; let us share parliamentary seats in proportion to the number of workers\u2019 votes polled for the Labour Party and for the Communist Party (not in elections, but in a special ballot), and let us retain complete freedom of agitation, propaganda and political activity.",
                "We shall be the gainers, because we shall carry our agitation among the masses at a time when Lloyd George himself has \u201cincensed\u201d them, and we shall not only be helping the Labour Party to establish its government sooner, but shall also be helping the masses sooner to understand the communist propaganda that we shall carry on against the Hendersons, without any reticence or omission.",
                "We shall immediately gain in the eyes of the masses, who, particularly after the brilliant, highly correct and highly useful (to communism) explanations given by Lloyd George, will be sympathetic to the idea of uniting all the workers against the Lloyd George-Conservative alliance.",
                "We shall gain immediately, because we shall have demonstrated to the masses that the Hendersons and the Snowdens are afraid to beat Lloyd George, afraid to assume power alone, and are striving to secure the secret support of Lloyd George, who is openly extending a hand to the Conservatives, against the Labour Party.",
                "We shall gain immediately, because we shall have demonstrated to the masses that the Hendersons and the Snowdens are afraid to beat Lloyd George, afraid to assume power alone, and are striving to secure the secret support of Lloyd George, who is openly extending a hand to the Conservatives, against the Labour Party.",
