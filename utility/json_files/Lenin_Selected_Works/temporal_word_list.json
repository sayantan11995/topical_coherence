    "1890-1894": " Chapter I. The Theoretical Mistakes of the Narodnik Economists\nThe market is a category of commodity economy, which in the course of its development is transformed into capitalist economy and only under the latter gains complete sway and universal prevalence. Therefore, in order to examine basic theoretical propositions concerning the home market we must proceed from simple commodity economy and trace its gradual transformation into capitalist economy.\n\nI. The Social Division of Labour\nThe basis of commodity economy is the social division of labour. Manufacturing industry separates from the raw materials industry, and each of these subdivides into small varieties and subvarieties which produce specific products as commodities, and exchange them for the products of all the others. Thus, the development of commodity economy leads to an increase in the number of separate and independent branches of industry; the tendency of this development is to transform into a special branch of industry the making not only of each separate product, but even of each separate part of a product\u2014and not only the making of a product, but even the separate operations of preparing the product for consumption. Under natural economy society consisted of a mass of homogeneous economic units (patriarchal peasant families, primitive village communities, feudal manors), and each such unit engaged in all forms of economic activity, from the acquisition of various kinds of raw material to their final preparation for consumption. Under commodity economy heterogeneous economic units come into being, the number of separate branches of economy increases, and the number of economic units per forming one and the same economic function diminishes. It is this progressive growth in the social division of labour that is the chief factor in the process of creating a home market for capitalism. \u201c...Where the basis is commodity production and its absolute form, capitalist production,\u201d says Marx, \u201c... products are commodities, or use-values, which have an exchange-value that is to be realised, to be converted into money, only in so far as other commodities form an equivalent for them, that is, other products confront them as commodities and values; thus, in so far as they are not produced as immediate means of subsistence for the producers themselves, but as commodities, as products which become use-values only by their transformation into exchange values (money), by their alienation. The market for these commodities develops through the social division of labour ; the division of productive labours mutually transforms their respective products into commodities, into equivalents for each other, making them mutually serve as markets\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , -. Russ. trans., .[] Our italics, as in all quotations, unless otherwise stated).\n\nIt goes without saying that the above-mentioned separation of the manufacturing from the raw materials industry, of manufacture from agriculture, transforms agriculture itself into an industry, into a commodity-producing branch of economy. The process of specialisation that separates from each other the diverse varieties of the manufacture of products, creating an ever-growing number of branches of industry, also manifests itself in agriculture, creating specialised agricultural districts (and systems of farming)[] and giving rise to exchange not only between the products of agriculture and industry but also between the various products of agriculture. This specialisation of commercial (and capitalist) agriculture manifests itself in all capitalist countries, in the international division of labour; this is true of post-Reform Russia as well, as we shall show in detail below.\n\nThus, the social division of labour is the basis of the entire process of the development of commodity economy and of capitalism. It is quite natural, therefore, that our Narodnik theoreticians, who declare this process to be the result of artificial measures, the result of a \u201cdeviation from the path,\u201d and so on and so forth, have tried to gloss over the fact of the social division of labour in Russia or to belittle its significance. Mr. V. V., in his article \u201cDivision of Agricultural and Industrial Labour in Russia\u201d (Vestnik Yevropy [European Messenger ], , No. ), \u201cdenied\u201d \u201cthe dominance in Russia of the principle of the social division of labour\u201d (p. ), and declared that in this country the social division of labour \u201chas not sprung from the depths of the people\u2019s life, but has attempted to thrust itself into it from outside\u201d (p. ). Mr. N.\u2013on, in his Sketches, argued as follows about the increase in the quantity of grain offered for sale: \u201cThis phenomenon might imply that the grain produced is more evenly distributed over the country, that the Archangel fisherman now consumes Samara grain, and that the Samara farmer supplements his dinner with Archangel fish. Actually, however, nothing of the kind is happening\u201d (Sketches on Our Post-Reform Social Economy, St. Petersburg, , p. ). Without any data and contrary to generally known facts, the categorical assertion is bluntly made here that there is no social division of labour in Russia! The Narodnik theory of the \u201cartificial character\u201d of capitalism in Russia could only have been evolved by rejecting, or proclaiming as \u201cartificial,\u201d the very foundation of all commodity economy, namely, the social division of labour.\n\nII. The Growth of the Industrial Population at the Expense of the Agricultural\nIn view of the fact that in the epoch preceding commodity economy, manufacturing is combined with the raw materials industry, and the latter is headed by agriculture, the development of commodity economy takes the shape of the separation from agriculture of one branch of industry after another. The population of a country in which commodity economy is poorly developed (or not developed at all) is almost exclusively agricultural. This, however, must not be understood as meaning that the population is engaged solely in agriculture: it only means that the population engaged in agriculture, also process the products of agriculture, and that exchange and the division of labour are almost non-existent. Consequently, the development of commodity economy eo ipso means the divorcement of an ever-growing part of the population from agriculture, i.e., the growth of the industrial population at the expense of the agricultural population. \u201cIt is in the nature of capitalist production to continually reduce the agricultural population as compared with the non-agricultural, because in industry (in the strict sense) the increase of constant capital at the expense of variable capital goes hand in hand with an absolute increase in variable capital despite its relative decrease; on the other hand, in agriculture the variable capital required for the exploitation of a certain plot of land decreases absolutely; it can thus only increase to the extent that new land is taken into cultivation, but this again requires as a prerequisite a still greater growth of the non-agricultural population\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , . Russ. trans., p. ).[] Thus one cannot conceive of capitalism without an increase in the commercial and industrial population at the expense of the agricultural population, and everybody knows that this phenomenon is revealed in the most clear-cut fashion in all capitalist countries. It need hardly be proved that the significance of this circumstance as regards the problem of the home market is enormous, for it is bound up inseparably both with the evolution of industry and with the evolution of agriculture; the formation of industrial centres, their numerical growth, and the attraction of the population by them cannot but exert a most profound influence on the whole rural system, and cannot but give rise to a growth of commercial and capitalist agriculture. All the more noteworthy is the fact that the exponents of Narodnik economics completely ignore this law both in their purely theoretical arguments and in their arguments about capitalism in Russia (we shall deal at length with the specific manifestations of this law in Russia later on, in Chapter VIII). The theories of Messrs. V. V. and N.\u2013on regarding the home market for capitalism overlook a mere trifle\u2014the diversion of the population from agriculture to industry, and the influence exerted by this fact on agriculture.[]\nIII. The Ruin of the Small Producers\nSo far we have dealt with simple commodity production. Now we pass to capitalist production, that is, we presume that instead of simple commodity producers we have, on the one hand, the owner of means of production and, on the other, the wage-worker, the seller of labour-power. The conversion of the small producer into a wage-worker presumes that he has lost the means of production\u2014land, tools, workshop, etc.\u2014i.e., that he is \u201cimpoverished,\u201d \u201cruined.\u201d The view is advanced that this ruin \u201cdiminishes the purchasing power of the population,\u201d \u201cdiminishes the home market\u201d for capitalism (Mr. N.\u2013on, loc. cit., p. . Also pp. , , , -, etc. The same view is held by Mr. V. V. in the majority of his writings). We do not deal here with the factual data relating to this process in Russia\u2014they will be examined in detail in later chapters. At the moment the question is posed purely theoretically, i.e., it relates to commodity production in general where it is transformed into capitalist production. The writers mentioned also pose this question theoretically, i.e., from the mere fact of the ruin of the small producers they deduce a shrinkage of the home market. This view is absolutely incorrect, and its persistent survival in our economic literature can only be explained by the romantic prejudices of Narodism (see the article referred to in the footnote). It is forgotten that the \u201cfreeing\u201d of one section of the producers from the means of production necessarily presumes the passage of the latter into other hands, their conversion into capital; presumes, consequently, that the new owners of these means of production produce as commodities the products formerly consumed by the producer himself, i.e., expand the home market; that in expanding production the new owners of the means of production present a demand to the market for new implements, raw materials, means of transport, etc., and also for articles of consumption (the enrichment of these new owners naturally presumes an increase in their consumption). It is forgotten that it is by no means the well-being of the producer that is important for the market but his possession of money; the decline in the well-being of the patriarchal peasant, who formerly conducted a mainly natural economy, is quite compatible with an increase in the amount of money in his possession, for the more such a peasant is ruined, the more he is compelled to resort to the sale of his labour-power, and the greater is the share of his (albeit scantier) means of subsistence that he must acquire in the market. \u201cWith the setting free (from the land) of a part of the agricultural population, therefore, their former means of nourishment were also set free. They were now transformed into material elements of variable capital\u201d (capital spent on the purchase of labour-power) (Das Kapital, I, ). \u201cThe expropriation and eviction of a part of the agricultural population not only set free for industrial capital the labourers, their means of subsistence, and material for labour; it also created the home market \u201d (ibid., ).[] Thus, from the standpoint of abstract theory, the ruin of the small producers in a society of developing commodity economy and capitalism means the very opposite to what Messrs. N.\u2013on and V. V. want to deduce therefrom; it means the creation and not the shrinkage of the home market. If the very same Mr. N.\u2013on, who declares a priori that the ruin of the Russian small producers means the shrinkage of the home market, nevertheless cites the just quoted contrary assertions of Marx (Sketches, pp.  and ), it only proves the remarkable ability of that writer to belabour himself with quotations from Capital.\n\n\nIV. The Narodnik Theory of the Impossibility of Realising Surplus-Value\nThe next question in the theory of the home market is the following. We know that the value of a product in capitalist production resolves into three parts: ) the first part replaces the constant capital, i.e., the value that existed previously in the shape of raw and auxiliary materials, machines and instruments of production, etc., and that is merely reproduced in a certain part of the finished product; ) the second part replaces the variable capital, i.e., covers the maintenance of the worker; and, lastly, ) the third part constitutes the surplus-value, which belongs to the capitalist. It is usually granted (we state the question in the spirit of Messrs. N.\u2013on and V. V.) that the realisation (i. e., the finding of a corresponding equivalent, sale in the market) of the first two parts presents no difficulty, because the first part goes into production, and the second into consumption by the working class. But how is the third part\u2014surplus-value\u2014realised? It cannot, surely, be consumed in its entirety by the capitalists! So our economists come to the conclusion that \u201cthe way out of the difficulty\u201d of realising surplus-value is \u201cthe acquisition of a foreign market\u201d (N.\u2013on, Sketches, Part II, \u00a7 XV in general, and p.  in particular; V. V., \u201cThe Excess in the Market Supply of Commodities\u201d in Otechestvenniye Zapiski [Fatherland Notes ], , and Essays on Theoretical Economics, St. Petersburg, , p.  and foll.). The writers mentioned explain the need for a capitalist nation to have a foreign market by the suggestion that the capitalists cannot realise their products in any other way. The home market in Russia, they say, is shrinking because of the ruin of the peasantry and because of the impossibility of realising surplus-value without a foreign market, while the foreign market\u2019s closed to a young country that enters the path of capitalist development too late\u2014and so, it is declared as proven that Russian capitalism has no basis, is still-born, a claim founded on mere a priori (and, moreover, theoretically incorrect) assumptions!\n\nWhen expressing his views on realisation, Mr. N.\u2013on evidently had in mind Marx\u2019s theory on this subject (although he said not a single word about Marx in this part of his Sketches), but he absolutely failed to understand it and distorted it beyond recognition, as we shall see in a moment. This explains the curious fact that his views coincided in all essentials with those of Mr. V. V., who cannot possibly be accused of \u201cnot understanding\u201d theory, for it would be the height of injustice to suspect him of even the slightest acquaintance with it. Both authors expound their theories as though they are the first to have dealt with the subject, and have reached certain solutions \u201call by themselves\u201d; both of them most sublimely ignore the arguments of the old economists on the subject, and both repeat old errors that have been most thoroughly refuted in Volume II of Capital.[] Both authors reduce the whole problem of the realisation of the product to the realisation of surplus-value, evidently imagining that the realisation of constant capital presents no difficulties. This naive opinion contains a most profound error, one that is the source of all further errors in the Narodnik theory of realisation. As a matter of fact, the difficulty of explaining realisation is precisely one of explaining the realisation of constant capital. In order to be realised, constant capital must be put back again into production, and that is directly practicable only in the case of that capital whose product consists of means of production. If, however, the product which makes good the constant part of capital consists of articles of consumption, it cannot be directly put back into production; what is required is exchange between the department of social production that makes means of production and that which makes articles of consumption. It is this point that constitutes the whole difficulty of the problem, a difficulty unnoticed by our economists. Mr. V. V. presents the matter, generally speaking, as if the aim of capitalist production is not accumulation but consumption, advancing the profound argument that \u201cinto the hands of a minority flows a mass of material objects in excess of the consuming power of the organism\u201d (sic !) \u201cat the given stage of their development\u201d (loc. cit., ) and that \u201cit is not the moderation and abstemiousness of the manufacturers which are the cause of the superfluity of products, but the limitations and insufficient elasticity of the human organism (!!), which fails to increase its consuming power at the rate at which surplus-value grows\u201d (ibid., ). Mr. N.\u2013on tries to present the matter as though he does not regard consumption as the aim of capitalist production, as though he takes account of the role and significance of means of production in regard to the problem of realisation; as a matter of fact, however, he has no clear idea whatsoever about the process of the circulation and reproduction of the aggregate social capital, and has become entangled in a host of contradictions. We shall not stop to examine all these contradictions in detail (pp. - of Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s Sketches ); that would be too thankless a task (and one already performed in part by Mr. Bulgakov[] in his book Markets Under Capitalist Production, Moscow, , pp. -), and furthermore, to prove the justice of the appraisal given here of Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s arguments, it will suffice to examine his final conclusion, namely, that the foreign market is the way out of the difficulty of realising surplus-value. This conclusion of Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s (essentially a mere repetition of the one drawn by Mr. V. V.) shows in most striking fashion that he did not in any way understand either the realisation of the product in capitalist society (i.e., the theory of the home market) or the role of the foreign market. Indeed, is there even a grain of common sense in this dragging of the foreign market into the problem of \u201crealisation\u201d? The problem of realisation is how to find for each part of the capitalist product, in terms of value (constant capital, variable capital and surplus-value) and in its material form (means of production, and articles of consumption, specifically necessities and luxuries), that other part of the product which replaces it on the market. Clearly, foreign trade must here be excluded, for dragging it in does not advance the solution of the problem one iota, but merely retracts it by extending the problem from one country to several. The very same Mr. N.\u2013on who discovered in foreign trade \u201cthe way out of the difficulty\u201d of realising surplus-value, argues about wages, for example, as follows: with the part of the annual product which the direct producers, the workers, receive in the shape of wages \u201conly that part of the means of subsistence can be drawn from circulation which is equal in value to the sum total of wages\u201d (). How, the question arises, does our economist know that the capitalists of a given country will produce means of subsistence in just the quantity and of just the quality requisite for their realisation by wages? How does he know that in this connection the foreign market can be dispensed with? Obviously, he cannot know this, and has simply brushed aside the problem of the foreign market, for in discussing the realisation of variable capital the important thing is the replacement of one part of the product by another, and not at all whether this replacement takes place in one country or in two. With respect to surplus-value, however, he departs from this necessary premise, and instead of solving the problem, simply evades it by talking of the foreign market. The sale of the product in the foreign market itself needs explanation, i.e., the finding of an equivalent for that part of the product which is being sold, the finding of another part of the capitalist product that can replace the first. That is why Marx says that in examining the problem of realisation, the foreign market, foreign trade \u201cmust be entirely discarded,\u201d for \u201cthe involvement of foreign commerce in analysing the annually reproduced value of products can...only confuse without contributing any new element of the problem, or of its solution\u201d (Das Kapital, , ).[] Messrs. V. V. and N.\u2013on imagined that they were giving a profound appraisal of the contradictions of capitalism by pointing to the difficulties of realising surplus-value. Actually, however, they were giving an extremely superficial appraisal of the contradictions of capitalism, for if one speaks of the \u201cdifficulties\u201d of realisation, of the crises, etc., arising therefrom, one must admit that these \u201cdifficulties\u201d are not only possible but are necessary as regards all parts of the capitalist product, and not as regards surplus-value alone. Difficulties of this kind, due to disproportion in the distribution of the various branches of production, constantly arise, not only in realising surplus-value, but also in realising variable and constant capital; in realising not only the product consisting of articles of consumption, but also that consisting of means of production. Without \u201cdifficulties\u201d of this kind and crises, there cannot, in general, be any capitalist production, production by isolated producers for a world market unknown to them.\n\n\nV. The Views of Adam Smith on the Production and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Product in Capitalist Society and Marx\u2019s Criticism of These Views\nIn order properly to understand the theory of realisation we must start with Adam Smith, who laid the foundation of the erroneous theory on this subject that held undivided sway in political economy until Marx. Adam Smith divided the price of a commodity into only two parts: variable capital (wages, in his terminology) and surplus-value (he does not combine \u201cprofit\u201d and \u201crent,\u201d so that actually he counted three parts in all.)[] Similarly, he divided the sum-total of commodities, the total annual social product, into the same parts and allocated them directly to the \u201crevenue\u201d of the two classes of society: the workmen and the capitalists (undertakers and landlords, as Smith calls them).[]\n\nOn what did he base his omission of the third component of value, constant capital? Adam Smith could not fail to observe this part, but he assumed that it also is made up of wages and surplus-value. Here is how he argued on this subject: \u201cIn the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord, another pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring cattle employed in producing it, and the third pays the profit of the farmer. These three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up the whole price of corn. A fourth part, it may perhaps be thought, is necessary for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the wear and tear of his labouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry. But it must be considered that the price of any instrument of husbandry, such as a labouring horse, is itself made up of the same three parts\u201d (namely, rent, profit and wages). \u201cThough the price of the corn, therefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the whole price still resolves itself either immediately or ultimately into the same three parts of rent, labour and profit.\u201d[] Marx calls this theory of Smith\u2019s \u201castonishing.\u201d \u201cHis proof consists simply in the repetition of the same assertion\u201d (II, S. ).[] Smith sends us \u201cfrom pillar to post\u201d (I. B., . Aufl., S. []).[] In saying that the price of farming instruments itself resolves into the same three parts, Smith forgets to add: and also into the price of the means of production employed in the making of these instruments. The erroneous exclusion by Adam Smith (and also by subsequent economists) of the constant part of capital from the price of the product is due to an erroneous conception of accumulation in capitalist economy, i.e., of the expansion of production, the transformation of surplus-value into capital. Here too Adam Smith omitted constant capital, assuming that the accumulated part of surplus-value, the part converted into capital, is entirely consumed by the productive workers, i.e., goes entirely in wages, whereas actually the accumulated part of surplus-value is expended on constant capital (instruments of production, raw and auxiliary materials) plus wages. Criticising this view of Smith (and also of Ricardo, Mill and others) in Capital, Volume I (Part VII, \u201cThe Accumulation of Capital,\u201d Chapter , \u201cConversion of Surplus-Value into Capital,\u201d \u00a7 , \u201cErroneous Conception, by Political Economy, of Reproduction on a Progressively Increasing Scale\u201d), Marx there states that in Volume II \u201cit will be shown that Adam Smith\u2019s dogma, inherited by all his successors, prevented political economy from understanding even the most elementary mechanism of the process of social reproduction\u201d (I, ).[] Adam Smith committed this error because he confused the value of the product with the newly created value: the latter does indeed resolve itself into variable capital and surplus-value, whereas the former includes constant capital in addition. This error had been earlier exposed by Marx in his analysis of value, when he drew a distinction between abstract labour, which creates new value, and concrete, useful labour, which reproduces the previously existing value in the new form of a useful product.[]\n\nAn explanation of the process of the reproduction and circulation of the total social capital is particularly necessary to settle the problem of the national revenue in capitalist society. It is extremely interesting to note that, when dealing with the latter problem, Adam Smith could no longer cling to his erroneous theory, which excludes constant capital from the country\u2019s total product. \u201cThe gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country comprehends the whole annual produce of their land and labor; the neat revenue, what remains free to them after deducting the expense of maintaining; first, their fixed; and, secondly, their circulating capital; or what, without encroaching upon their capital, they can place in their stock reserved for immediate consumption, or spend upon their subsistence, conveniences, and amusements\u201d (A. Smith, Wealth of Nations, Book II. \u201cOf the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock,\u201d Chapter II, Vol. II, p. . Russ. trans., II, p. ). Thus, from the country\u2019s total product Adam Smith excluded capital, asserting that it resolves itself into wages, profit and rent, i.e., into (net) revenue; but in the gross revenue of society he includes capital, separating it from articles of consumption (= net revenue). This is the contradiction in which Marx catches Adam Smith: how can there be capital in the revenue if there was no capital in the product? (Cf. Das Kapital, II, S. .)[] Without noticing it himself, Adam Smith here recognises three component parts in the value of the total product: not only variable capital and surplus-value, but also constant capital. Further on, Adam Smith comes up against another very important difference, one of enormous significance in the theory of realisation. \u201cThe whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital,\u201d he says, \u201cmust evidently be excluded from the neat revenue of the society. Neither the materials necessary for supporting their useful machines and instruments of trade, their profitable buildings, etc., nor the produce of the labor necessary for fashioning those materials into the proper form, can ever make any part of it. The price of that labor may indeed make a part of it; as the workmen so employed may place the whole value of their wages in their stock reserved for immediate consumption.\u201d But in other kinds of labour, both the \u201cprice\u201d (of labour) \u201cand the produce\u201d (of labour) \u201cgo to this stock, the price to that of the workmen, the produce to that of other people\u201d (A. Smith, ibid.). Here we find a gleam of recognition of the need to distinguish two kinds of labour: one that produces articles of consumption which may enter into the \u201cneat revenue,\u201d and another which produces \u201cuseful machines and instruments of trade...buildings, etc.,\u201d i.e., articles that can never be used for personal consumption. From this it is only one step to the admission that an explanation of realisation absolutely requires that two forms of consumption be distinguished: personal and productive (= putting back into production). It was the rectification of these two mistakes made by Smith (the omission of constant capital from the value of the product, and the confusing of personal with productive consumption) that enabled Marx to build up his brilliant theory of the realisation of the social product in capitalist society.\n\nAs for the other economists, those between Adam Smith and Marx, they all repeated Adam Smith\u2019s error[] and for that reason did not advance one step. Of the confusion that consequently reigns in the theories of revenue we shall speak later. In the controversy as to the possibility of a general overproduction of commodities that was waged by Ricardo, Say, Mill and others, on the one hand, and by Malthus, Sismondi, Chalmers, Kirchmann and others, on the other, both sides adhered to Smith\u2019s erroneous theory, and consequently, as Mr. S. Bulgakov justly remarks, \u201cin view of the false premises and the wrong formulation of the problem itself, these controversies could only lead to empty and scholastic wordspinning\u201d (loc. cit., p. . See an account of this wordspinning in Tugan-Baranovsky\u2019s Industrial Crises, etc., St. Petersburg, , pp. -).\nVI. Marx\u2019s Theory of Realisation\nIt follows automatically from what has been said that the fundamental premises on which Marx\u2019s theory is based are the following two propositions. The first is that the total product of a capitalist country, like the individual product, consists of the following three parts: ) constant capital, ) variable capital, and ) surplus-value. To those who are familiar with the analysis of the process of production of capital given in Vol. I of Marx\u2019s Capital this proposition is self-evident. The second proposition is that two major departments of capitalist production must be distinguished, namely (Department I), the production of means of production\u2014of articles which serve for productive consumption, i.e., are to be put back into production, articles which are consumed, not by people, but by capital; and (Department II) the production of articles of consumption, i.e., of articles used for personal consumption. \u201cThere is more theoretical meaning in this division alone than in all the preceding controversies over the theory of markets\u201d (Bulgakov, loc. cit., p. ). The question arises as to why such a division of products according to their natural form is now necessary to analyse the reproduction of social capital, when the analysis of the production and reproduction of individual capital dispensed with such a division and left the question of the natural form of the product entirely on one side. On what grounds can we introduce the question of the natural form of the product into a theoretical investigation of capitalist economy, which is based entirely on the exchange-value of the product? The fact is that when the production of individual capital was analysed, the question of where and how the product would be sold, and of where and how articles of consumption would be bought by the workers and means of production by the capitalists, was set aside as making no contribution to this analysis and as having no relation to it. All that had to be examined then was the problem of the value of the separate elements of production and of the results of production. Now, however, the question is: where will the workers and the capitalists obtain their articles of consumption, where will the capitalists obtain their means of production, how will the finished product meet all these demands and enable production to expand? Here, consequently, we have not only \u201ca replacement of value, but also a replacement in material\u201d (Stoffersatz.\u2014Das Kapital, II, ),[] and hence it is absolutely essential to distinguish between products that play entirely different parts in the process of social economy.\n\nOnce these basic propositions are taken into account, the problem of the realisation of the social product in capitalist society no longer presents any difficulty. Let us first assume simple reproduction, i.e., the repetition of the process of production on its previous scale, the absence of accumulation. Obviously, the variable capital and the surplus-value in Department II (which exist in the form of articles of consumption) are realised by the personal consumption of the workers and capitalists of this department (for simple reproduction presumes that the whole of the surplus-value is consumed, and that no portion of it is converted into capital). Further, the variable capital and the surplus-value which exist in the form of means of production (Department I) must, in order to be realised, be exchanged for articles of consumption for the capitalists and workers engaged in the making of means of production. On the other hand, neither can the constant capital existing in the form of articles of consumption (Department II) be realised except by an exchange for means of production, in order to be put back again into production the following year. Thus we get variable capital and surplus-value in means of production exchanged for constant capital in articles of consumption: the workers and the capitalists (in the means of production department) in this way obtain means of subsistence, while the capitalists (in the articles of consumption department) dispose of their product and obtain constant capital for further production. Under simple reproduction, the parts exchanged must be equal: the sum of variable capital and surplus-value in means of production must be equal to the constant capital in articles of consumption. On the other hand, if we assume reproduction on a progressively increasing scale, i.e., accumulation, the first magnitude must be greater than the second, because there must be available a surplus of means of production with which to begin further production. Let us revert, however, to simple reproduction. There has been left unrealised one more part of the social product, namely, constant capital in means of production. This is realised partly by exchange among the capitalists of this same department (coal, for example, is exchanged for iron, because each of these products serves as a necessary material or instrument in the production of the other), and partly by being put directly into production (for example, coal extracted in order to be used in the same enterprise again for the extraction of coal; grain in agriculture, etc.). As for accumulation, its starting-point, as we have seen, is a surplus of means of production (taken from the surplus-value of the capitalists in this department), a surplus that also calls for the conversion into capital of part of the surplus-value in articles of consumption. A detailed examination of how this additional production will be combined with simple reproduction we consider to be superfluous. It is no part of our task to undertake a special examination of the theory of realisation, and the foregoing is enough to elucidate the error of the Narodnik economists and to enable us to draw certain theoretical conclusions regarding the home market.[]\n\nOn the problem of interest to us, that of the home market, the main conclusion from Marx\u2019s theory of realisation is the following: capitalist production, and, consequently, the home market, grow not so much on account of articles of consumption as on account of means of production. In other words, the increase in means of production outstrips the increase in articles of consumption. Indeed, we have seen that constant capital in articles of consumption (Department II) is exchanged for variable capital + surplus-value in means of production (Department I). According, however, to the general law of capitalist production, constant capital grows faster than variable capital. Hence, constant capital in articles of consumption has to increase faster than variable capital and surplus-value in articles of consumption, while constant capital in means of production has to increase fastest of all, outstripping both the increase of variable capital ( + surplus-value) in means of production and the increase of constant capital in articles of consumption. The department of social production which produces means of production has, consequently, to grow faster than that producing articles of consumption. For capitalism, therefore, the growth of the home market is to a certain extent \u201cindependent\u201d of the growth of personal consumption, and takes place mostly on account of productive consumption. But it would be a mistake to understand this \u201cindependence\u201d as meaning that productive consumption is entirely divorced from personal consumption: the former can and must increase faster than the latter (and there its \u201cindependence\u201d ends), but it goes without saying that, in the last analysis, productive consumption is always bound up with personal consumption. Marx says in this connection: \u201c...We have seen (Book II, Part III) that continuous circulation takes place between constant capital and constant capital...\u201d (Marx has in mind constant capital in means of production, which is realised by exchange among capitalists in the same department). \u201cIt is at first independent of individual consumption because it never enters the latter. But this consumption definitely limits it nevertheless, since constant capital is never produced for its own sake but solely because more of it is needed in spheres of production whose products go into individual consumption\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , . Russ. trans., p. ). []\n\nThis larger consumption of constant capital is nothing but a higher level of the development of the productive forces, one expressed in terms of exchange-value, because the rapidly developing \u201cmeans of production\u201d consist, in the main, of materials, machines, instruments, buildings and all sorts of other accessories for large-scale, especially machine, production. It is quite natural, therefore, that capitalist production, which develops the productive forces of society and creates large-scale production and machine industry, is also distinguished by a particular expansion of that department of social wealth which consists of means of production....\u201cIn this case\u201d (namely, the production of means of production), \u201cwhat distinguishes capitalist society from the savage is not, as Senior thinks, the privilege and peculiarity of the savage to expend his labour at times in a way that does not procure him any products resolvable (exchangeable) into revenue, i.e., into articles of consumption. No, the distinction consists in the following:\n\n\u201ca) Capitalist society employs more of its available annual labour in the production of means of production (ergo, of constant capital) which are not resolvable into revenue in the form of wages or surplus-value, but can function only as capital.\n\n\u201cb) When a savage makes bows, arrows, stone hammers, axes, baskets, etc., he knows very well that he did not spend the time so employed in the production of articles of consumption, but that he has thus stocked up the means of production he needs, and nothing else\u201d (Das Kapital, II, . Russ. trans., ).[] This \u201cvery good knowledge\u201d of one\u2019s relation to production has disappeared in capitalist society owing to the latter\u2019s inherent fetishism, which presents the social relations of men as relations of products\u2014owing to the conversion of every product into a commodity produced for an unknown consumer and to be realised in an unknown market. And as it is a matter of the utmost indifference to the individual entrepreneur what kind of article he produces\u2014every product yields a \u201crevenue,\u201d\u2014this same superficial, individual point of view was adopted by the economist-theoreticians in relation to the whole of society and prevented the process of the reproduction of the total social product in capitalist economy from being understood.\n\nThe development of production (and, consequently, of the home market) chiefly on account of means of production seems paradoxical and undoubtedly constitutes a contradiction. It is real \u201cproduction as an end in itself\u201d\u2014the expansion of production without a corresponding expansion of consumption. But it is a contradiction not of doctrine, but of actual life; it is the sort of contradiction that corresponds to the very nature of capitalism and to the other contradictions of this system of social economy. It is this expansion of production without a corresponding expansion of consumption that corresponds to the historical mission of capitalism and to its specific social structure: the former consists in the development of the productive forces of society; the latter rules out the utilisation of these technical achievements by the mass of the population. There is an undoubted contradiction between the drive towards the unlimited extension of production inherent in capitalism, and the limited consumption of the masses of the people (limited because of their proletarian status). It is this contradiction that Marx records in the propositions so readily quoted by the Narodniks and which are supposed to corroborate their views on the shrinkage of the home market, the non-progressive character of capitalism, etc., etc. Here are some of these propositions: \u201cContradiction in the capitalist mode of production: the labourers as buyers of commodities are important for the market. But as sellers of their own commodity\u2014labour-power\u2014capitalist society tends to keep them down to the minimum price\u201d (Das Kapital, II, ).[]\n\n\u201c...The conditions of realisation are limited by the proportional relation of the various branches of production and the consumer power of society....But the more productiveness develops, the more it finds itself at variance with the narrow basis on which the conditions of consumption rest\u201d (ibid., III, , -).[] \u201cThe limits within which the preservation and self-expansion of the value of capital resting on the expropriation and pauperisation of the great mass of producers can alone move\u2014these limits come continually into conflict with the methods of production employed by capital for its purposes, which drive towards unlimited extension of production, towards production as an end in itself, towards unconditional development of the social productivity of labour....The capitalist mode of production is, for this reason, a historical means of developing the material forces of production and creating an appropriate world market, and is, at the same time, a continual conflict between this its historical task and its own corresponding relations of social production.\u201d (III, , . Russ. trans., p. ).[] \u201cThe ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as opposed to the drive of capitalist production to develop the productive forces as though only the absolute consuming power of society constituted their outer limit\u201d[] (III, , . Russ. trans., p. ).[] These propositions all speak of the contradiction we have mentioned, namely, the contradiction between the unrestricted drive to expand production and limited consumption\u2014and of nothing else.[] Nothing could be more senseless than to conclude from these passages in Capital that Marx did not admit the possibility of surplus-value being realised in capitalist society, that he attributed crises to under-consumption, and so forth. Marx\u2019s analysis of realisation showed that the circulation between constant capital and constant capital is definitely limited by personal consumption; but this same analysis showed the true character of this \u201climitedness,\u201d[] it showed that, compared with means of production, articles of consumption play a minor role in the formation of the home market. And, furthermore, there is nothing more absurd than to conclude from the contradictions of capitalism that the latter is impossible, non-progressive, and so on\u2014to do that is to take refuge from unpleasant, but undoubted realities in the transcendental heights of romantic dreams. The contradiction between the drive towards the unlimited expansion of production and limited consumption is not the only contradiction of capitalism, which cannot exist and develop at all without contradictions. The contradictions of capitalism testify to its historically transient character, and make clear the conditions and causes of its collapse and transformation into a higher form; but they by no means rule out either the possibility of capitalism, or its progressive character as compared with preceding systems of social economy.[]\nVII. The Theory of the National Income\nHaving outlined the main propositions of Marx\u2019s theory of realisation, we still have briefly to point to its enormous importance in the theory of national \u201cconsumption,\u201d \u201cdistribution,\u201d and \u201cincome\u201d. All these problems, particularly the last, have hitherto been a veritable stumbling-block for economists. The more they have spoken and written about it, the greater has been the confusion caused by Adam Smith\u2019s fundamental error. We shall cite here some examples of this confusion.\n\nIt is interesting to note, for example, that Proudhon repeated essentially the same error, except that he formulated the old theory somewhat differently. He said:\n\n\u201cA (which stands for all property owners, entrepreneurs and capitalists) starts an enterprise with , francs, and with them makes advance payment to the workers, who must produce goods in return; after A has thus converted his money into commodities he must, at the end of the production process, at the end, say, of a year, convert the commodities again into money. To whom does he sell his commodities? To the workers, of course, for there are only two classes in society\u2014the entrepreneurs on the one hand, and the workers on the other. These workers, having for the product of their labour received , francs as pay, which covers their essential requirements of life, must now, how ever, pay more than , francs, that is, they must pay for the addition that A receives in the shape of the interest and other profits he counted on at the beginning of the year. The worker can cover these , francs only by borrowing, and, as a consequence, he sinks deeper and deeper into debt and poverty. One of two things must necessarily take place: either the worker may consume , although he produced , or he pays the entrepreneur only the amount of his wages, in which case the entrepreneur himself suffers bankruptcy and disaster, for he does not receive interest on capital, which he on his part, however, must pay.\u201d (Diehl, Proudhon, II, , quoted from the compilation \u201cIndustry.\u201d Articles from Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Staatswissenschaften,[] Moscow, , p. .)\n\nAs the reader sees, this is the same difficulty\u2014how surplus-value is to be realised\u2014that Messrs. V. V. and N.\u2013on are fussing over. Proudhon only expressed it in a somewhat specific form. And this specific character of his formulation brings our Narodniks still closer to him: they too, like Proudhon, consider the \u201cdifficulty\u201d to lie in the realisation of surplus-value (interest or profit, in Proudhon\u2019s terminology) and do not understand that the confusion they have acquired from the old economists prevents them from explaining the realisation not only of surplus-value, but also of constant capital, i.e., that their \u201cdifficulty\u201d is in their not understanding the whole process of the realisation of the product in capitalist society.\n\nRegarding this \u201ctheory\u201d of Proudhon\u2019s, Marx sarcastically observes:\n\n\u201cProudhon exposes his inability to grasp this\u201d (namely, the realisation of the product in capitalist society) \u201cin the ignorant formulation: l\u2019ouvrier ne peut pas racheter son propre produit (the labourer cannot buy back his own product), because the interest which is added to the prix derevient (cost-price) is contained in the product\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , . Russ. trans., , in which there are mistakes).[]\n\nAnd Marx quotes the remark directed against Proudhon by a certain vulgar economist named Forcade, who \u201cquite correctly generalises the difficulty put forward in so narrow a form by Proudhon.\u201d Forcade said that the price of commodities contains not only something over and above the wages\u2014the profit\u2014but also the part that replaces constant capital. Hence, concludes Forcade in opposition to Proudhon, the capitalist is also unable to buy back commodities with his profit (not only did Forcade not solve the problem, he did not even understand it).\n\nNeither did Rodbertus make any contribution to the solution of the problem. While laying particular stress on the thesis that \u201cground-rent, profit on capital and wages are income,\u201d[] he proved quite unable to arrive at a clear understanding of the concept \u201cincome.\u201d Stating his view as to what the tasks of political economy would have been had it pursued \u201ca correct method\u201d (loc. cit., S. ), he also speaks about the distribution of the national product. \u201cIt\u201d (i.e., the true \u201cscience of the national economy\u201d\u2014Rodbertus\u2019s italics) \u201cshould have shown how out of the total national product one part always goes to replace the capital consumed in production or worn out, while the other, as national income, goes to satisfy the direct requirements of society and of its members\u201d (ibid., S. ). But although true science should have shown this, Rodbertus\u2019s \u201cscience\u201d did nothing of the kind. The reader will see that he merely repeated Adam Smith word for word, evidently not even seeing that this is only the beginning of the problem. Which workers \u201creplace\u201d the national capital? How is their product realised? Not a word did ho say about this. Summing up his theory (diese neue Theorie, die ich der bisherigen gegen\u00fcberstelle,[] S. ) in the shape of separate theses, Rodbertus first speaks of the distribution of the national product as follows: \u201cRent\u201d (by this, as we know, Rodbertus meant what is usually termed surplus-value) \u201cand wages are, consequently, the parts into which the product resolves itself, in so far as it is income\u201d (S. ). This extremely important reservation should have suggested a very vital question to him: he had only just said that by income he meant articles which serve \u201cto satisfy direct requirements\u201d; hence, there are products that do not serve for personal consumption. How are they realised? But Rodbertus sees no unclarity here and soon forgets this reservation, speaking outright of the \u201cdivision of the product into three parts \u201d (wages, profit and rent) (S. - and others). Thus Rodbertus virtually repeated Adam Smith\u2019s theory together with his fundamental mistake and explained nothing at all regarding the question of income. The promise of a new, full and better theory of the distribution of the national product[] proved to be just empty talk. As a matter of fact, Rodbertus did not advance the theory of this subject a single step. How confused were his conceptions of \u201cincome\u201d is shown by his lengthy speculations in his Fourth Social Letter to von Kirchmann (Das Kapital, Berlin, ) about whether money should be included in the national income, and whether wages are taken from capital or from income\u2014speculations of which Engels said that they \u201cbelong to the domain of scholasticism\u201d (Vorwort to Vol. II, Capital, S. XXI).[] []\n\nUtter confusion on the problem of the national income reigns supreme among economists to this day. For example, in his article on \u201cCrises\u201d in Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Staatswissenschaften (the afore-mentioned compilation, p. ), Herkner, speaking of the realisation of the product in capitalist society (\u00a7 , \u201cdistribution\u201d), expresses the opinion that the speculations of K. H. Rau are \u201csound,\u201d although he merely repeats Adam Smith\u2019s mistake by dividing the whole product of society into incomes. R. Meyer, in his article on \u201cincome\u201d (ibid., p.  and foll.), quotes the confused definitions of A. Wagner (who also repeats Adam Smith\u2019s error) and frankly admits that \u201cit is difficult to distinguish income from capital,\u201d and that \u201cthe most difficult thing is to distinguish between returns (Ertrag) and income (Einkommen).\u201d\n\nWe thus see that the economists who have discoursed at length on the inadequate attention paid by the classical economists (and Marx) to \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cconsumption\u201d have not been able to give the slightest explanation of the most fundamental problems of \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cconsumption.\u201d That is understandable, for one cannot even discuss \u201cconsumption\u201d unless one understands the process of the reproduction of the total social capital and of the replacement of the various component parts of the social product. This example once again proved how absurd it is to single out \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cconsumption\u201d as though they were independent branches of science corresponding to certain independent processes and phenomena of economic life. It is not with \u201cproduction\u201d that political economy deals, but with the social relations of men in production, with the social system of production. Once these social relations have been ascertained and thoroughly analysed, the place in production of every class, and, consequently, the share they get of the national consumption, are thereby defined. And the solution of the problem which brought classical political economy to a halt, and which has not been advanced a hair\u2019s breadth by all sorts of experts on \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cconsumption,\u201d is provided by the theory which comes directly after those of the classical economists and which completes the analysis of the production of capital, individual and social.\n\nThe problem of \u201cnational income\u201d and of \u201cnational consumption,\u201d which is absolutely insoluble when examined independently, and has engendered nothing but scholastic speculations, definitions and classifications, proves to be solved in its entirety when the process of the production of the total social capital has been analysed. Furthermore, it ceases to exist as a separate problem when the relation of national consumption to the national product and the realisation of each separate part of this product have been ascertained. All that remains is to give names to these separate parts.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid unnecessary difficulty, one should distinguish gross output (Rohertrag) and net output from gross income and net income.\n\n\u201cThe gross output, or gross product, is the total reproduced product....\n\n\u201cThe gross income is that portion of value and that portion of the gross product\u201d (Bruttoprodukts oder Rohprodukts) measured by it which remains after deducting that portion of value and that portion of the product of total production measured by it which replaces the constant capital advanced and consumed in production. The gross income, then, is equal to wages (or the portion of the product destined to again become the income of the labourer) + profit + rent. The net income, on the other hand, is the surplus-value, and thus the surplus-product, which remains after deducting wages, and which, in fact, thus represents the surplus-value realised by capital and to be divided with the landlord, and the surplus-product measured by it.\n\n\u201c...Viewing the income of the whole society, national income consists of wages plus profit plus rent, thus, of the gross income. But even this is an abstraction to the extent that the entire society, on the basis of capitalist production, bases itself on the capitalist standpoint and thereby considers only the income resolved into profit and rent as net income\u201d (III, , -. Russ. trans., pp. -).[]\n\nThus, the explanation of the process of realisation also made clear the question of income and removed the main difficulty that had prevented the achievement of clarity on this question, namely: how does \u201cincome for one become capital for another\u201d, how can the product which consists of articles of personal consumption and resolves itself totally into wages, profit and rent, also include the constant part of capital, which can never be income? The analysis of realisation given in Capital, Volume II, Part III, gave a full answer to these questions, and in the concluding part of Volume III of Capital, which deals with \u201crevenues,\u201d Marx had only to give names to the separate parts of the social product and refer the reader to the analysis given in Volume II.[]\nVIII. Why Does the Capitalist Nation Need a Foreign Market?\nRegarding the above-stated theory of the realisation of the product in capitalist society, the question may arise: Does not this theory contradict the proposition that the capitalist nation cannot dispense with foreign markets?\n\nIt must be remembered that the analysis given of the realisation of the product in capitalist society proceeded from the assumption that there is no foreign trade: this assumption has already been mentioned above and it has been shown to be essential in such an analysis. Obviously, imports and exports would only have confused the issue, without in the least helping to clear up the problem. The mistake made by Messrs. V. V. and N.\u2013on is that they bring in the foreign market to explain the realisation of surplus-value: while explaining absolutely nothing, this reference to the foreign market merely conceals their theoretical mistakes; that is one point. Another point is that it enables them, with the aid of these mistaken \u201ctheories,\u201d to avoid the need to explain the fact of the development of a home market for Russian capitalism.[] The \u201cforeign market\u201d merely serves them as a pretext for obscuring the development of capitalism (and, consequently, of the market) inside the country\u2014a pretext all the more convenient in that it also relieves them of the need to examine the facts which show that Russian capitalism is winning foreign markets.[]\n\nThe need for a capitalist country to have a foreign market is not determined at all by the laws of the realisation of the social product (and of surplus-value in particular), but, firstly, by the fact that capitalism makes its appearance only as a result of widely developed commodity circulation, which transcends the limits of the state. It is therefore impossible to conceive a capitalist nation without foreign trade, nor is there any such nation.\n\nAs the reader sees, this reason is of a historical order. And the Narodniks could not escape it with a couple of threadbare phrases about \u201cthe impossibility of the capitalists consuming surplus-value.\u201d Had they really wanted to raise the question of the foreign market, they would have had to examine the history of the development of foreign trade, the history of the development of commodity circulation. And having examined this history, they could not have, of course, depicted capitalism as a casual deviation from the path.\n\nSecondly, the conformity between the separate parts of social production (in terms of value and in their natural form) which was necessarily assumed by the theory of the reproduction of social capital, and which is actually established only as the average magnitude of a number of continual fluctuations\u2014this conformity is constantly disturbed in capitalist society owing to the separate existence of different producers working for an unknown market. The various branches of industry, which serve as \u201cmarkets\u201d for one another, do not develop evenly, but outstrip one another, and the more developed industry seeks a foreign market. This does not mean at all \u201cthe impossibility of the capitalist nation realising surplus-value,\u201d\u2014the profound conclusion so readily drawn by the Narodnik. It merely indicates the lack of proportion in the development of the different industries. If the national capital were distributed differently, the same quantity of products could be realised within the country. But for capital to abandon one sphere of industry and pass into another there must be a crisis in that sphere; and what can restrain the capitalists threatened by such a crisis from seeking a foreign market, from seeking subsidies and bonuses to facilitate exports, etc.?\n\nThirdly, the law of pre-capitalist modes of production is the repetition of the process of production on the previous scale, on the previous technical basis: such are the corv\u00e9e economy of the landlords, the natural economy of the peasants, the artisan production of the industrialists. The law of capitalist production, on the contrary, is constant transformation of the modes of production, and the unrestricted growth of the scale of production. Under the old modes of production, economic units could exist for centuries without undergoing any change either in character or in size, and without extending beyond the landlord\u2019s manor, the peasant village or the small neighbouring market for the rural artisans and small industrialists (the so-called handicraftsmen). The capitalist enterprise, on the contrary, inevitably out grows the bounds of the village community, the local market, the region, and then the state. Since the isolation and seclusion of the states have already been broken down by commodity circulation, the natural trend of every capitalist industry brings it to the necessity of \u201cseeking a foreign market.\u201d\n\nThus, the necessity of seeking a foreign market by no means proves that capitalism is unsound, as the Narodnik economists like to picture matters. Quite the contrary. This necessity demonstrates the progressive historical work of capitalism, which destroys the age-old isolation and seclusion of systems of economy (and, consequently, the narrowness of intellectual and political life), and which links all countries of the world into a single economic whole.\n\nFrom this we see that the two latter causes of the need for a foreign market are again causes of a historical character. In order to understand them one must examine each separate industry, its development within the country, its transformation into a capitalist industry\u2014in short, one must take the facts about the development of capitalism in the country; and it is not surprising that the Narodniks take the opportunity to evade these facts under cover of worthless (and meaningless) phrases about the \u201cimpossibility\u201d of both the home and the foreign markets.\n\nIX. Conclusions From Chapter I\nLet us now sum up the theoretical propositions examined above, which have a direct bearing on the problem of the home market.\n\n) The basic process of the formation of a home market (i.e., of the development of commodity production and of capitalism) is the social division of labour. This consists of various forms of processing raw materials (and various operations in this processing) separating from agriculture one after another and becoming independent branches of industry, which exchange their products (now commodities ) for the products of agriculture. Thus, agriculture itself becomes industry (i.e., produces commodities), and the same process of specialisation takes place in it.\n\n) A direct conclusion from the preceding proposition is the law governing all developing commodity economy, and the more so capitalist economy\u2014the industrial (i.e., non-agricultural) population grows faster than the agricultural and diverts an ever-growing part of the population from agriculture to manufacturing industry.\n\n) The separation of the direct producer from the means of production, i.e., his expropriation, signifying the transition from simple commodity production to capitalist production (and constituting the necessary condition for this transition), creates the home market. The process of this creation of the home market proceeds in two directions: on the one hand, the means of production from which the small producer is \u201cfreed\u201d are converted into capital in the hands of their new owner, serve to produce commodities and, consequently, are themselves converted into commodities. Thus, even the simple reproduction of these means of production now requires that they be purchased (previously, these means of production were reproduced in greater part in the natural form and partly were made at home), i.e., provides a market for means of production, and then the product now produced with the aid of these means of production is also converted into a commodity. On the other hand, the means of subsistence of the small producer become the material elements of the variable capital, i.e., of the sum of money expended by the employer (whether a landowner, contractor, lumber-dealer, factory owner, etc., makes no difference) on hiring workers. Thus, these means of subsistence are now also converted into commodities, i.e., create a home market for articles of consumption.\n\n) The realisation of the product in capitalist society (and, consequently, the realisation of surplus-value) cannot be explained without clearing up the point\u2014) that the social product, like the individual product, resolves itself in terms of value into three parts and not two (constant capital + variable capital + surplus-value, and not only into variable capital + surplus-value, as taught by Adam Smith and the entire school of political economy that came after him and before Marx), and ) that in its natural form it must be divided into two big departments: means of production (consumed productively) and articles of consumption (consumed personally). By establishing these main theoretical propositions, Marx fully explained the process of realisation of the product in general and of surplus-value in particular in capitalist production, and revealed that it is utterly wrong to drag the foreign market into the problem of realisation.\n\n) Marx\u2019s theory of realisation also threw light on the problem of national consumption and income.\n\nFrom what has been said above, it follows automatically that the problem of the home market as a separate, self-sufficient problem not depending on that of the degree of capitalist development does not exist at all. That is why Marx\u2019s theory does not anywhere or ever raise this problem separately. The home market appears when commodity economy appears; it is created by the development of this commodity economy, and the degree to which the social division of labour is ramified determines the level of its development; it spreads with the extension of commodity production from products to labour-power, and only in proportion as the latter is transformed into a commodity does capitalism embrace the entire production of the country, developing mainly on account of means of production, which occupy an increasingly important place in capitalist society. The \u201chome market\u201d for capitalism is created by developing capitalism itself, which deepens the social division of labour and resolves the direct producers into capitalists and workers. The degree of the development of the home market is the degree of development of capitalism in the country. To raise the question of the limits of the home market separately from that of the degree of the development of capitalism (as the Narodnik economists do) is wrong.\n\nThat is why the question of how a home market is being formed for Russian capitalism reduces itself to the following: How and in what direction are the diverse aspects of the Russian national economy developing? What constitutes the connection between and interdependence of these diverse aspects?\n\nThe next chapters will be devoted to an examination of data containing the answers to these questions.\n\nChapter II. The Differentiation of the Peasantry\nWe have seen that in capitalist production the basis for the formation of a home market is the process of the disintegration of the small cultivators into agricultural entrepreneurs and workers. Almost every work on the economic position of the Russian peasantry in the post-Reform period refers to the so-called \u201cdifferentiation\u201d of the peasantry. It must consequently be our task to study the principal features of this phenomenon and to determine its significance. In the following exposition we employ the statistical data of Zemstvo house-to-house censuses.[]\n\nI. Zemstvo Statistics For Novorossia[]\nMr. V. Postnikov, in his book Peasant Farming in South Russia (Moscow, ),[] has collected and processed the Zemstvo statistics for the Taurida and partly the Kherson and the Ekaterinoslav gubernias. This book should be given first place in the literature on the differentiation of the peasantry, and we consider it necessary to arrange according to the system we have adopted the data gathered by Mr. Postnikov, supplementing them occasionally with data from Zemstvo publications. The Zemstvo statisticians of Taurida have grouped the peasant households according to area under crops\u2014a very sound method, one that renders it possible to form a precise judgement of the economy of each group due to the predominance in that locality of grain cultivation with extensive farming. Here are the general data for the economic groups of the Taurida peasantry.[]\n\nGeneral data for the economic groups of the Taurida peasantry.\nDessiatines[]\n\nThe unevenness in the distribution of the area under crops is very considerable: / of the total households (comprising about / of the population, for the size of these families s below the average) possess about / of the total area under crops; they belong to the poor group, cultivating little land, who cannot cover their needs with their income from farming. Further, there are the middle peasants, also constituting about / of the total households, who cover their average expenditure by income from the land (Mr. Postnikov considers that a family requires from  to  dessiatines [Dessiatine = . acres. \u2014Ed] under crops to cover its average expenditure). Lastly, there are the well-to-do peasants (about / of the households and / of the population), who concentrate in their hands over half the area cultivated, the crop area per household clearly indicating the \u201ccommercial\u201d character of the farming done by this group. In order exactly to estimate the extent of this commercial agriculture in the various groups, Mr. Postnikov employs the following method. From the total crop area of the farm, he separates the following: the food area (which provides sustenance for the family and the farm labourers), the fodder area (which provides fodder for the cattle) and the farm-service area (seed-plot, land occupied by buildings, etc.), and thus arrives at the size of the market or commercial area, the produce of which goes for sale. It is shown that in the group with  to  dess. under crops, only .% of the cultivated area yields produce for the market, whereas this percentage grows with the increase in the area under crops (by groups) as follows: .%\u2014%\u2014%. Consequently, the well-to-do peasants (the top two groups) engage in what is commercial cultivation, and secure a gross money income ranging from  to , rubles per annum. This commercial cultivation then becomes capitalist farming, for the areas cultivated by the well-to-do peasants exceed the family labour norm (i.e., the amount of land that a family can cultivate by its own labour), and compel them to resort to the hiring of workers: in the three northern uyezds of Taurida Gubernia, the author estimates, the well-to-do peasants hire over , rural workers. The poor peasants, on the contrary, \u201cprovide workers\u201d (over ,), that is, resort to the sale of their labour-power, since the income from cultivating the land amounts, in the  to  dess. group, for example, to only about  rubles in cash per household.[] We observe here, consequently, the very process of the creation of a home market that is dealt with by the theory of capitalist production\u2014the \u201chome market\u201d grows as a result of the conversion into a commodity of the product of commercial, entrepreneur farming, on the one hand, and of the conversion into a commodity of the labour-power sold by the badly-off peasants, on the other.\n\nIn order to acquaint ourselves more closely with this phenomenon, let us examine the position of each separate group of the peasantry. Let us start with the top group. Here are the data for the amount of land it owns and uses:\n\nAmount of land owned and used by group of the peasantry.\nWe see, accordingly, that the well-to-do peasants, not withstanding the fact that they are best provided with allotment land,[] concentrate in their hands the bulk of the purchased and the rented land and turn into small land owners and capitalist farmers.[] On the renting of  to  dess. of land there is an annual expenditure, at local prices, of about  to  rubles. Obviously we are dealing here with a commercial transaction: the land becomes a commodity, \u201ca money-making machine.\u201d\n\nLet us take the data for livestock and implements [Carting: carts, covered and open wagons, etc. Ploughing: iron ploughs, scarifiers (cultivators), etc.]:\n\nData for livestock and implements.\nimplements[]\n\nThus the well-to-do peasantry are far better supplied with implements than the poor and even the middle peasantry. It is sufficient to glance at this table to see how totally fictitious are the \u201caverage\u201d figures which people are so fond of bringing into play when they talk of the \u201cpeasantry\u201d. The commercial cultivation of the peasant bourgeoisie is accompanied here by commercial livestock farming, namely, the breeding of coarse-wool sheep. Regarding implements, we shall quote in addition figures for improved implements, which we have taken from Zemstvo statistical returns.[] Out of the total reaping and mowing machines (,), ,, or .%, belong to the peasant bourgeoisie (/ of the total households).\n\nIt is quite natural that the well-to-do peasantry also employ a farming technique much above the average (larger size of farm, more plentiful supply of implements, available financial resources, etc.); that is to say, the well-to-do peasants \u201cdo their sowing faster, make better use of favourable weather, sow the seed in more humid soil,\u201d and reap their harvest in proper time; they thresh their grain as it is carted in from the field, etc. It is also natural that the expenditure on the production of agricultural produce diminishes (per unit of product) as the size of the farm increases. Mr. Postnikov proves this proposition in particular detail, using the following system of calculation: he determines the number of people working (including hired labourers), the number of draught animals, implements, etc., per  dessiatines of crop area in the various groups of the peasantry. It is proved that these numbers diminish as the size of the farm increases. For example, those cultivating under  dessiatines have per  dessiatines of allotment land  people working,  draught animals, . ploughs and scarifiers, and  carts, whereas those cultivating over  dessiatines have  people working,  draught animals, . ploughs and scarifiers, and . carts. (We omit more detailed data for all groups, referring those interested in the details to Mr. Postnikov\u2019s book.) The author\u2019s general conclusion is: \u201cWith the increase in the size of the farm and in the area cultivated by the peasant, the expenditure on the maintenance of labour-power, human and animal, that prime item of expenditure in agriculture, progressively decreases, and, among the groups that cultivate large areas, drops to nearly one half per dessiatine under crops of the expenditure among the groups with small cultivated areas\u201d (op. cit., p. ). To this law of the greater productivity and, hence, of the greater stability of the big peasant farms Mr.Postnikov quite rightly attaches great importance, proving it with very detailed data not only for Novorossia alone, but also for the central gubernias of Russia.[] The further the penetration of commodity production into crop cultivation, and, consequently, the keener the competition among the agriculturists, the struggle for land and for economic independence, the more vigorously must this law be manifested, a law which leads to the ousting of the middle and poor peasants by the peasant bourgeoisie. It must, however, be noted that technical progress in agriculture expresses itself in different ways, depending on the system of agriculture, on the system of field cultivation. Whereas in the case of grain growing and extensive cultivation this progress may find expression in a mere expansion of the crop area and reduction of the number of workers, animals, etc., per unit of crop area, in the case of livestock or industrial crop farming, with the adoption of intensive agriculture, this same progress may find expression, for example, in the cultivation of root crops, which require more workers per unit of crop area, or in the acquisition of dairy cattle, the cultivation of fodder grasses, etc., etc.\n\nThe description of the top group of the peasantry must be supplemented by indicating the considerable employment of wage-labour. Here are the data for the three uyezds of Taurida Gubernia:\n\nEmployment of wage-labour for three uyezds of Taurida Gubernia.\nMr. V. V., in the above-mentioned article, argued about this question as follows: he took the farms employing workers as a percentage of the total number of peasant farms and arrived at the conclusion that \u201cthe number of peasants resorting to hired labour for the cultivation of the land, as compared to the aggregate mass of the people, is quite insignificant:  to , a maximum of  peasant farmers out of  are all that represent peasant capitalism . . . it\u201d (peasant farming in Russia employing labourers) \u201cis not a system firmly rooted in contemporary economic life, but something fortuitous, such as occurred  and  years ago\u201d (Vestnik Yevropy, , No. , p. ). What sense is there in comparing the number of farms employing workers with the total number of \u201cpeasant\u201d farms, when the latter figure also includes the plots of farm labourers? Why, by this method one could also get rid of capitalism in Russian industry: one would only need to take the families engaging in industries who employ wage-workers (i.e., the families of manufacturers, large and small) as a percentage of the total number of families engaging in industries in Russia; the result would be a quite insignificant\u201d percentage of the \u201cmass of the people.\u201d It is far more correct to compare the number of farms employing labourers with the number of actually independent farms, i.e., of those living on agriculture alone and not resorting to the sale of their labour power. Furthermore, Mr. V. V. lost sight of a trifle, namely, that the peasant farms employing labourers are among the biggest: the percentage of farms employing labourers, \u201cinsignificant\u201d when taken \u201cin general and on the average,\u201d turns out to be very imposing (-%) among the well-to-do peasantry, who account for more than half of the total production and produce large quantities of grain for sale. One can therefore judge how absurd is the opinion that farming based on the employment of labourers is \u201cfortuitous,\u201d something that occurred  to  years ago! Thirdly, only by disregarding the real specific features of cultivation can one take as the criterion of \u201cpeasant capitalism\u201d only farm labourers, i.e., regular workers, and ignore the day labourers. It is commonly known that the hiring of day labourers plays a particularly important role in agriculture.[]\n\nLet us take the bottom group. It consists of peasants who cultivate no land or who cultivate little; they \u201cdo not differ much in economic status . . . both groups serve as farm labourers for their fellow villagers, or engage in outside, mainly agricultural employments\u201d (p. , op. cit.), i.e., belong to the rural proletariat. Let us note, for example, that in Dnieper Uyezd the bottom group constitutes % of the households, and those having no ploughing implements % of the total households. In addition to selling their labour-power, the rural proletariat obtain an income from leasing their allotment land:\n\nLeasing of allotment land by rural proletariat.\nIn the three uyezds of Taurida Gubernia, the land leased (in -) amounted to % of the total peasant arable; this does not include land leased, not to peasants, but to middle-class intellectuals. In all, nearly / of the population in these three uyezds lease land; the allotments of the rural proletariat are rented mainly by the peasant bourgeoisie. Here are data in this regard:\n\nAllotment land rented from neighbours\n\u201cAllotment land is now an object of extensive speculation among the South-Russian peasants. Land is used as security for loans on promissory notes. . . . Land is leased, or sold, for one or two years and for longer periods\u2014,  or  years\u201d (p. , op. cit.). Thus, the peasant bourgeoisie is also a representative of merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital.[] Here we have a striking refutation of the Narodnik prejudice that the \u201ckulak\u201d and the \u201cusurer\u201d have nothing in common with the \u201centerprising muzhik.\u201d On the contrary, the threads both of merchant\u2019s capital (the loaning of money on the security of land, the buying-up of various products, etc.) and of industrial capital (commercial agriculture with the aid of wage-workers, etc,.) merge in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. It depends on surrounding circumstances, on the greater or lesser degree to which the Asiatic way of life is eliminated and culture is widespread in our countryside as to which of these forms of capital will develop at the expense of the other.\n\nLet us examine, finally, the position of the middle group (cultivating from  to  dess. per household, with an average of . dess.). Its position is a transitional one: its money income from agriculture ( rubles) is somewhat lower than the sum annually spent by the average Tauridian ( to  rubles). Here draught animals work out at . head per household, whereas for a full team  are required. Hence the position of the middle peasant\u2019s farm is an unstable one, and to till his land he has to resort to \u201cyoking.\u201d[] []\n\nThe cultivation of the land on a \u201cyoking\u201d basis is, it goes without saying, less productive (time lost in moving from place to place, shortage of horses, etc.), so that in one village, for example, Mr. Postnikov was informed that \u201cyokers often scarify no more than one dessiatine per day, which is half the normal rate.\u201d[] If to this we add that in the middle group about  of the households have no ploughing implements, that this group provides more workers than it hires (according to Mr. Postnikov\u2019s calculations), its unstable character and its transitional position between the peasant bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat will be clear. We shall quote somewhat more detailed data about the ousting of the middle group.\n\nLand used by group\nGubernia[]\n\nThus, the distribution of allotment land is the most \u201cequalised,\u201d although here, too, the ousting of the bottom group by the top ones is marked. But the situation radically changes when we pass from this compulsorily-held land to the free, i.e., to the purchased and the rented land. The concentration of this land is enormous, and as a result, the distribution of the total land in use by the peasants is quite unlike the distribution of the allotment land: the middle group is pushed into second place (% of allotment land\u2014% of land in use), the well-to-do group very considerably enlarges its holdings (% of allotment land\u2014% of land in use), while the poor group is being pushed out of the ranks of the cultivators (% of allotment land\u2014% of land in use).\n\nThe table reveals an interesting phenomenon, one that we shall meet again, namely, the decline in the role of allotment land in peasant farming. In the bottom group this is due to the leasing out of land; in the top group to the fact that in the total farming area purchased and rented land is overwhelmingly predominant. The remnants of the pre-Reform system (the tying of the peasants to the land, and equalised, tax-assessed land tenure) are being utterly destroyed by the penetration of capitalism into agriculture.\n\nAs for land renting in particular, the figures given enable us to clear up a very common mistake in the arguments of the Narodnik economists on this subject. Take the arguments of Mr. V. V. In the article quoted above he bluntly raised the issue of the relation of the renting of land to the break-up of the peasantry. \u201cDoes the renting of land help to differentiate the peasant farms into big and small and to destroy the average, typical group?\u201d (Vestnik Yevropy, loc. cit., pp. -.) Mr. V. V. answered this question in the negative. Here are his arguments: ) \u201cThe large percentage of persons who resort to the renting of land.\u201d Examples:  to %;  to %;  to %;  to % respectively in different uyezds of different gubernias.\u2014) The small size of the rented plots per household:  to  dess., according to Tambov statistical returns.\u2014) The peasants with small allotments rent more land than those with big ones.\n\nTo enable the reader clearly to judge the appropriateness of such arguments, let alone their soundness, we quote the corresponding figures for Dnieper Uyezd.[]\n\nArable per renting household\nThe question arises, of what importance can \u201caverage\u201d figures be here? Does the fact that those who rent land are \u201cmany\u201d\u2014%\u2014really do away with the concentration of the rented land in the hands of the rich? Is it not ridiculous to take the \u201caverage\u201d area of rented land [ dess. per renting household. Very often it is not even per renting household, but per existing household that is taken. That is what Mr. Karyshev, for example, does in his work \u201cPeasant Rentings of Non-Allotment Land\u201d (Dorpat, ; Vol. II of Results of Zemstvo Statistical Investigations)] by putting together peasants of whom one takes  dessiatines at a fabulous price ( rubles), evidently out of dire need, on ruinous terms, while another takes  dessiatines, over and above his own adequate amount of land, \u201cbuying\u201d the land wholesale at the incomparably lower price of . rubles per dessiatine? No less hollow is the third argument: Mr. V. V. himself took care to refute it by admitting that figures relating \u201cto entire village communities\u201d (in classifying the peasants according to allotment) \u201cdo not present a true picture of what is taking place in the community itself\u201d (p. , op. cit.).[]\nIt would be a great mistake to imagine that the concentration of rented land in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie is limited to individual renting and does not apply to renting by the village community. Nothing of the kind. The rented land is always distributed \u201caccording to where the money lies,\u201d and the relation between the groups of the peasantry does not change in the least where land is rented by the community. Hence, the argument of Mr. Karyshev, for example, that the relation between community renting and individual renting expresses a \u201cconflict between two principles (!?),the communal and the individual\u201d (p., loc. cit.), that community renting \u201cis characterised by the labour principle and the principle of even distribution of rented land among the community members\u201d (ibid., )\u2014this argument belongs entirely to the sphere of Narodnik prejudices. Not withstanding the task he set himself of summing up the \u201cresults of Zemstvo statistical investigation,\u201d Mr. Karyshev carefully avoided all the abundant Zemstvo statistical material about the concentration of rented land in the hands of small groups of well-to-do peasants. Let us quote an example. In the three indicated uyezds of Taurida Gubernia, state lands rented by peasant communities are distributed among the groups as follows:\n\nState lands rented by peasant communities\nA little illustration of the \u201clabour principle\u201d and of the \u201cprinciple of even distribution\u201d!\n\nSuch are the Zemstvo statistical data on peasant farming in South Russia. No room is left by these data for doubting the complete differentiation of the peasantry, the complete domination in the countryside of the peasant bourgeoisie.[] Highly interesting, therefore, is the attitude of Messrs. V. V. and N.\u2013on towards these data, the more so that formerly both these writers admitted the need of raising the problem of the differentiation of the peasantry (Mr. V. V. in the above mentioned article of , and Mr. N.\u2013on in Slovo[The Word] in , when he remarked on the interesting phenomenon in the village community itself that the \u201cunenterprising\u201d muzhiks neglect their land, while the \u201centerprising\u201d ones take the best land for themselves; cf. Sketches, p. ). It should be noted that Mr. Postnikov\u2019s work is of a dual character: on the one hand the author skillfully gathered and carefully processed extremely valuable Zemstvo statistics and managed, in doing so, to escape the \u201ctendency to regard the peasant community as something integral and homogeneous, as it is still held to be by our urban intelligentsia\u201d (p. , op. cit.). On the other hand, the author, not being guided by theory, failed totally to appraise the data he had processed, and regarded them from the extremely narrow point of view of \u201cmeasures,\u201d proceeding to concoct projects about \u201cagricultural-handicraft-factory communities\u201d and about the necessity of \u201crestricting,\u201d \u201cenjoining,\u201d \u201cobserving,\u201d etc., etc. Well then, our Narodniks did their best to ignore the first, the positive part of Mr. Postnikov\u2019s work and concentrated their attention on the second part. Both Mr. V. V. and Mr. N.\u2013on began with highly serious air to \u201crefute\u201d Mr. Postnikov\u2019s absolutely unserious \u201cprojects\u201d (Mr. V. V. in Russkaya Mysl[Russian Thought ], , No. ; Mr. N.\u2013on in his Sketches, p. , footnote), accusing him of the evil intention of introducing capitalism into Russia, and carefully avoiding the data which revealed the prevalence of capitalist relations in the countryside of South Russia today.[]\n\nII. Zemstvo Statistics For Samara Gubernia\nFrom the country\u2019s southern outer area let us pass to the eastern region, to Samara Gubernia. Let us take Novouzensk Uyezd, the last one investigated; in the statistical report for this uyezd we find the most detailed classification of the peasants according to economic status.[] Here are the general data on the groups of the peasantry (the data that follow cover , allotment-holding households, numbering , persons of both sexes, i.e., only the Russian population of the uyezd, without Germans or farmsteaders\u2014householders who farm both on community land and on separate non-community farmsteads. The inclusion of the Germans and the farmsteaders would considerably heighten the picture of differentiation).\n\nTable, page , first\nThe concentration of agricultural production turns out to be very considerable: the \u201ccommunity\u201d capitalists (/ of the total households, namely, households with  and more draught animals) possess .% of the area under crops\u2014as much as do . %, the poor and middle peasantry put together! Here, too, as always, the \u201caverage\u201d figure (. dess. under crops per household) is absolutely fictitious and creates the illusion of universal prosperity. Let us examine other data on the economy of the various groups.\n\nTable, page , second\nThus, in the bottom group there are very few independent peasant farmers; the poor peasants have no improved implements at all, while the middle peasantry have them in insignificant numbers. The concentration of animals is still greater than the concentration of area under crops; the well to-do peasants evidently combine capitalist livestock raising with their large-scale capitalist cropping. At the opposite pole we have \u201cpeasants\u201d who ought to be classed as allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers, for their main source of livelihood is the sale of their labour-power (as we shall see in a moment), and the landowners sometimes give one or two animals to their labourers to tie them down to their farms and to reduce wages.\n\nIt goes without saying that the peasant groups differ not only as to the size of their farms, but also in their methods of farming: firstly, in the top group a very large proportion of the peasant farmers ( to %) are supplied with improved implements (mainly iron ploughs, and also horse and steam threshers, winnowing machines, reapers, etc.). In the hands of .% of the households, the top group, are concentrated .% of the total improved implements; .% of the households, the middle group, possess % of the improved implements; .%, the poor, possess .% ( implements out of ,).[] Secondly, the peasants with few horses are compelled by necessity to carry on \u201ca different system of farming, a system of economic activity\u201d entirely different from that of the peasants with many horses, as the compiler of Returns for Novouzensk Uyezd says (pp. -). The well-to-do peasants \u201clet their land rest . . . plough in the autumn . . . plough it again in the spring and sow after harrowing . . . roll the ploughed land when the soil has aired . . . plough twice for rye,\u201d whereas the badly-off peasants \u201cdo not let their land rest but sow Russian wheat year after year . . . for wheat they plough in the spring once . . . for rye they provide neither fallow nor ploughed land, but merely break the surface before sowing . . . for wheat they plough in the late spring, and as a result the corn often does not come up . . . for rye they plough once, or merely break the surface and not at the proper time . . . they plough the same plot of land unwisely year after year, without allowing it to rest.\u201d \u201cAnd so on and so forth without end,\u201d the compiler concludes this list. \u201cThe facts enumerated concerning the radical difference between the farming systems of the better- and the badly-off peasants result in grain of poor quality and bad harvests for the latter and comparatively better harvests for the former\u201d (ibid.).\n\nBut how could such a big bourgeoisie arise under the agricultural community system? The answer is supplied by the figures for land possessed and in use according to groups. The peasants in the section taken by us ( households) have a total of , dess. of purchased land and , dess. of rented land, of which , dess. are non-allotment land rented by , households; , dess. of the allotment land rented from other village communities are held by , households, and , dess. of the allotment land rented in their own village communities are held by , households. The distribution of this enormous area of land, constituting more than / of the peasants\u2019 total area under crops, is as follows (see Table on p. ).\n\nDistribution of land area by household grouping.\nWe see here an enormous concentration of purchased and rented land. More than / of the total purchased land is in the hands of .% of the households, the very richest. Of all the rented land, .% is concentrated in the hands of peasant capitalists, and .% is in the hands of the top group of the peasantry. A comparison of the figures on the renting and the leasing-out of allotment land clearly reveals the passage of the land into the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. Here, too, the conversion of the land into a commodity leads to the cheapening of the wholesale purchase price of land (and, consequently, to profiteering in land). If we determine the price of one dessiatine of rented non-allotment land we get the following figures, counting from the bottom group to the top: .; .; .; .; .; .; . rubles. To show what mistakes the Narodniks fall into by thus ignoring the concentration of rented land, let us quote by way of example the arguments of Mr. Karyshev in the well-known symposium The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices on Certain Aspects of the Russian National Economy (St. Petersburg, ). When grain prices fall, with an improvement of the harvest, and renting prices rise, the entrepreneur renters, concludes Mr. Karyshev, have to reduce demand and hence the renting prices had been raised by the representatives of consumers\u2019 economy (I, ). The conclusion is absolutely arbitrary: it is quite possible that the peasant bourgeoisie raise renting prices in spite of a drop in grain prices, for an improvement in the harvest may compensate for the drop in prices. It is quite possible that the well-to-do peasants raise renting prices even when there is no such compensation, reducing the cost of production of grain by introducing machinery. We know that the employment of machines in agriculture is growing and that these machines are concentrated in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. Instead of studying the differentiation of the peasantry, Mr. Karyshev introduces arbitrary and incorrect premises about an average peasantry. That is why all the conclusions and deductions similarly arrived at by him in the publication quoted are of no value whatever.\n\nHaving ascertained that diverse elements exist among the peasantry, we can now easily get clarity on the question of the home market. If the well-to-do peasants control about / of the total agricultural production, it is obvious that they must account for an incomparably larger share of the grain on sale. They produce grain for sale, whereas the badly-off peasants have to buy additional grain and sell their labour-power. Here are the data:[]\n\nHired labourers and working males engaged in agricultural industries.\nWe suggest that the reader compare the arguments of our Narodniks with these data regarding the process of the formation of the home market. . . . \u201cIf the muzhik is prosperous, the factory flourishes, and vice versa\u201d (V. V., Progressive Trends, p. ). Mr. V. V. is evidently not in the least interested in the social form of the wealth which the \u201cfactory\u201d needs and which is created only by the conversion of the product and the means of production, on the one hand, and of labour-power, on the other, into a commodity. Mr. N.\u2013on, when speaking of the sale of grain, consoles himself with the thought that this grain is produced by the \u201cmuzhik farmer\u201d (Sketches, p. ), that by transporting this grain \u201cthe railways live at the expense of the muzhik\u201d (p. ). Really, are not these \u201ccommunity-member\u201d capitalists \u201cmuzhiks\u201d? \u201cSome day we shall have occasion to point out,\u201d wrote Mr. N.\u2013on in , and reprinted it in , \u201cthat in the localities where communal land tenure prevails, agriculture based on capitalist principles is almost completely absent (sic!!) and that it is possible only where communal ties have either been entirely broken or are breaking down\u201d (p. ). Mr. N.\u2013on has never had this \u201coccasion,\u201d nor could he have had, for the facts point precisely to the development of capitalist agriculture among \u201ccommunity members\u201d[] and to the complete adaptation of the notorious \u201ccommunal ties\u201d to the farms of big crop growers that employ labourers.\n\nThe relationship between the peasant groups proves to be absolutely analogous in Nikolayevsk Uyezd (cited statistical returns, p.  and foll.; we leave out those living away from home and the landless). For example, .%, the rich households (having  and more draught animals), comprising .% of the population, concentrate in their hands .% of the total livestock and .% of the rented land, whereas %, the poor households (horseless and one-horse), comprising .% of the population, have only .% of the livestock and % of the rented land. Unfortunately, the tables for Nikolayevsk Uyezd, we repeat, are too scanty. To finish with Samara Gubernia, let us quote the following highly instructive description of the position of the peasantry from the Combined Returns for Samara Gubernia.\n\n\u201c...The natural increase in the population, augmented by the Immigration of land-poor peasants from the western gubernias, in connection with the appearance in the sphere of agricultural production of money-grubbing speculators in land, has with every passing year complicated the forms of the renting of land, raised its worth and converted the land into a commodity which has so quickly and immensely enriched some and ruined many others. To illustrate the latter point, let us indicate the area cultivated by some of the southern merchant- and peasant-owned farms, where the tillage of , to , dessiatines is no rarity, while some practise the cultivation of -- thousand dessiatines of land, renting several tens of thousands of state-owned land.\n\n\u201cThe existence and the growth of the agricultural (rural) proletariat in Samara Gubernia are to a considerable extent the product of recent times, with their increasing production of grain for sale, rise in renting prices, ploughing up of virgin and pasture land, clearing of forests, and so forth. The landless households throughout the gubernia number , in all, whereas the non-farming ones number , (of those households that have allotments), while the horseless and one-horse households together number , families, with a total of , persons of both sexes, counting five and a fraction persons per family. We take the liberty of counting these, too, as proletarians, although legally they have a share of communal land; actually, these are day labourers, ploughmen, shepherds, reapers and similar workers on big farms who cultivate / to  dessiatine of their own allotments so as to feed their families who remain at home\u201d (pp. -).\n\nThus, the investigators regard as proletarians not only the horseless peasants, but also those who have one horse. We note this important conclusion, which fully coincides with that of Mr. Postnikov (and with the data in the classified tables) and points to the real social-economic significance of the bottom group of the peasantry.\n\nIII. Zemstvo Statistics For Saratov Gubernia\nWe now pass to the central black-earth belt, to Saratov Gubernia. We take Kamyshin Uyezd, the only one for which a fairly complete classification of the peasants according to draught animals held is available.[]\nHere are the data for the whole uyezd (, households, , persons of both sexes. Area under crops, , dessiatines, i.e., . dessiatines per \u201caverage\u201d household):\n\nClassification of peasants according to draught animals.\nThus, here again we see the concentration of land under crops in the hands of the big crop growers: the well-to-do peasantry, constituting only a fifth of the households (and about a third of the population),[] hold more than half the total area under crops (.%), the size of this area clearly indicating the commercial character of the farming: an aver age of . dess. per household. The well-to-do peasantry have also a considerable number of animals per household: . head (in terms of cattle, i.e., counting  head of small domestic animals for one of cattle), and of the total number of peasants\u2019 cattle in the uyezd, nearly / (%) is concentrated in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. At the opposite pole in the countryside, we find the opposite state of affairs; the complete dispossession of the bottom group, the rural proletariat, who in our example comprise a little less than / of the households (nearly / of the population), but who have only / of the total area under crops, and even less (.%) of the total number of animals. These are mainly allotment-holding farm labourers, day labourers and industrial workers.\n\nSide by side with the concentration of crop areas and with the enhancement of the commercial character of agriculture there takes place its transformation into capitalist agriculture. We see the already familiar phenomenon: the sale of labour-power in the bottom groups and its purchase in the top ones.\n\nPercent of peasants employing male wage-workers.\nHere an important explanation is needed. P. N. Skvortsov has quite rightly noted in one of his articles that Zemstvo statistics attach far too \u201cwide\u201d a meaning to the term \u201cindustry\u201d (or \u201cemployments\u201d). In fact, all sorts of occupations engaged in by the peasants outside their allotments are assigned to the category of \u201cindustries\u201d; factory owners and workers, owners of flour mills and of melon fields, day labourers, regular farm labourers; buyers-up, traders and unskilled labourers; lumber-dealers and lumbermen; building contractors and building workers; members of the liberal professions, clerks, beggars, etc., all these are \u201cindustrialists\u201d! This barbarous misuse of words is a survival of the traditional\u2014and we have the right even to say: official\u2014view that the \u201callotment\u201d is the \u201creal,\u201d \u201cnatural\u201d occupation of the muzhik, while all other occupations are assigned indiscriminately to \u201coutside\u201d industries. Under serfdom this use of the word had its raison d\u2019 etre, but now it is a glaring anachronism. Such terminology is retained partly because it harmonises wonderfully with the fiction about an \u201caverage\u201d peasantry and rules right out the possibility of studying the differentiation of the peasantry (particularly in those places where peasant \u201coutside\u201d occupations are numerous and varied. Let us remind the reader that Kamyshin Uyezd is a noted centre of the sarpinka industry[]). The processing[] of household returns on peasant farming will be unsatisfactory so long as peasant \u201cindustries\u201d are not classified according to their economic types, so long as among the \u201cindustrialists\u201d employers are not separated from wage-workers. This is the minimum number of economic types without discriminating between which economic statistics cannot be regarded as satisfactory. A more detailed classification is, of course, desirable; for example; proprietors employing wage-workers\u2014proprietors not employing wage-workers\u2014traders, buyers-up, shopkeepers, etc., artisans, meaning industrialists who work for customers, etc.\n\nComing back to our table, let us observe that after all we had some right to consider \u201cindustries\u201d as being the sale of labour-power, for it is usually wage-workers who predominate among peasant \u201cindustrialists.\u201d If it were possible to single the wage-workers out of the latter, we would, of course, obtain an incomparably smaller percentage of \u201cindustrialists\u201d in the top groups.\n\nAs to the data regarding wage-workers, we must note here the absolutely mistaken character of Mr. Kharizomenov\u2019s opinion that the \u201cshort-term hire[of workers] for reaping, mowing and day labouring, which is too widespread a phenomenon, cannot serve as a characteristic criterion of the strength or weakness of a farm\u201d (p.  of \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Combined Returns). Theoretical considerations, the example of Western Europe, and the facts of Russia (dealt with below) compel us, on the contrary, to regard the hiring of day labourers as a very characteristic feature of the rural bourgeoisie.\n\nLastly, as regards rented land, the data show, here too, the same concentration of it in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. Let us note that the combined tables of the Saratov statisticians do not show the number of peasants who rent land and lease it out, but only the total land rented and leased out[]; we have, therefore, to determine the amount of land rented and leased per existing, and not per renting household.\n\nTotal land in use.\nThus we see, here too, that the wealthier the peasants the more they rent land, despite the fact that they are better provided with allotment land. Here too we see that the well-to-do are ousting the middle peasantry, and that the role of allotment land in peasant farming tends to diminish at both poles of the countryside.\n\nLet us examine in greater detail these data on land renting. With them are connected the very interesting and important investigations and arguments of Mr. Karyshev (quoted Results) and Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s \u201ccorrections\u201d to them.\n\nMr. Karyshev devotes a special chapter (III) to \u201cthe dependence of land renting on the prosperity of the lessees.\u201d The general conclusion he arrives at is that, \u201cother things being equal, the struggle for rentable land tends to go in favour of the better-off\u201d (p. ). \u201cThe relatively more prosperous households . . . push the less prosperous ones into the background\u201d (p. ). We see, consequently, that the conclusion drawn from a general review of Zemstvo statistical data is the same as that to which we are led by the data we are studying. Moreover, a study of the dependence of the amount of rented land on the size of the allotment led Mr. Karyshev to the conclusion that classification according to allotment \u201cobscures the meaning of the phenomenon that interests us\u201d (p. ): \u201cland renting . . . is more resorted to by a) the categories that are worse provided with land, but by b) the groups within them that are better provided. Evidently, we have here two diametrically opposed influences, the confusion of which prevents the understanding of either\u201d (ibid.). This conclusion follows naturally if we consistently adhere to the viewpoint that distinguishes the peasant groups according to economic strength; we have seen everywhere in our data that the well-to-do peasants grab rentable land, despite the fact that they are better provided with allotment land. It is clear that the degree of prosperity of the household is the determining factor in the renting of land, and that this factor merely undergoes a change but does not cease to be determining, with the change in the conditions of land allotment and renting. But, although Mr. Karyshev investigated the influence of \u201cprosperity,\u201d he did not adhere consistently to the viewpoint mentioned, and therefore characterised the phenomenon inaccurately, speaking of the direct connection between the degree to which the lessee is supplied with land and the renting of land. This is one point. Another point is that the one-sidedness of Mr. Karyshev\u2019s investigation prevented him from appraising the full significance of the way rentable land is grabbed by the rich peasants. In his study of \u201cnon-allotment renting\u201d, he limits himself to summarising the Zemstvo statistics on land renting, without taking account of the lessees\u2019 own farms. Naturally, with such a method of study, a more formal one, the problem of the relation between land renting and the \u201cprosperity,\u201d of the commercial character of land renting could not be solved. Mr. Karyshev, for example, was in possession of the same data on Kamyshin Uyezd as we are, but he limited himself to reproducing absolute figures only of land renting (see Appendix No. , p. XXXVI) and to calculating the average amount of rented land per allotment holding household (text, p. ). The concentration of land renting in the hands of the well-to-do peasants, its industrial character, its connection with land leasing by the bottom group of the peasantry, were all overlooked. Thus, Mr. Karyshev could not but see that the Zemstvo statistics refute the Narodnik notion of land renting and show that the poor are ousted by the well-to-do peasants; but he gave an inaccurate description of this phenomenon, did not study it from all sides and came into conflict with the data, repeating the old song about the \u201clabour principle,\u201d etc. But even the mere statement of the fact of economic discord and conflict among the peasantry seemed heresy to the Narodniks, and they proceeded to \u201ccorrect\u201d Mr. Karyshev in their own way. Here is how Mr. N.\u2013on does it, \u201cusing,\u201d as he says (p. , note), Mr. N. Kablukov\u2019s arguments against Mr. Karyshev. In \u00a7 IX of his Sketches, Mr. N.\u2013on discusses land renting and the various forms it assumes. \u201cWhen a peasant,\u201d he says, \u201chas sufficient land to enable him to obtain his livelihood by tilling his own, he does not rent any land\u201d (). Thus, Mr. N.\u2013on flatly denies the existence of entrepreneur activity in peasant land renting and the grabbing of rentable land by rich peasants engaged in commercial crop growing. His proof? Absolutely none: the theory of \u201cpeople\u2019s production\u201d is not proved, but laid down as law. In answer to Mr. Karyshev, Mr. N.\u2013on quotes a table from the Zemstvo abstract for Khvalynsk Uyezd showing that \u201cthe number of draught animals being equal, the smaller the allotment the more must this deficiency be compensated by renting\u201d (),[] and again, \u201cif the peasants are placed in absolutely identical conditions as regards the possession of animals, and if they have sufficient workers in their households, then the smaller the allotment they have, the more the land they rent\u201d (). The reader will see that such \u201cconclusions\u201d are merely a quibble at Mr. Karyshev\u2019s inaccurate formulation, that Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s empty trifles simply obscure the issue of the connection between land renting and prosperity. Is it not self-evident that where an equal number of draught animals is possessed, the less land a household has, the more it rents? That goes without saying, for it is the very prosperity whose differences are under discussion that is taken as equal. Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s assertion that peasants with sufficient land do not rent land is not in any way proved by this, and his tables merely show that he does not understand the figures he quotes: by comparing the peasants as to amount of allotment land held, he brings out the more strikingly the role of \u201cprosperity\u201d and the grabbing of rentable land in connection with the leasing of land by the poor (leasing it to these same well-to-do peasants, of course.)[] Let the reader recall the data we have quoted on the distribution of rented land in Kamyshin Uyezd; imagine that we have singled out the peasants with \u201can equal number of draught animals\u201d and, dividing them into categories according to allotment and into subdivisions according to the number of persons working, we declare that the less land a peasant has, the more he rents, etc. Does such a method result in the disappearance of the group of well-to-do peasants? Yet Mr. N.\u2013on, with his empty phrases, has succeeded in bringing about its disappearance and has been enabled to repeat the old prejudices of Narodism.\n\nMr. N.\u2013on\u2019s absolutely useless method of computing the land rented by peasants per household according to groups with , , , etc., persons working is repeated by Mr. L. Maress in the book The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices, etc. (I, ). Here is a little example of the \u201caverages\u201d boldly employed by Mr. Maress (as by the other contributors to this book, written from a biased Narodnik point of view). In Melitopol Uyezd, he argues, the amount of rented land per renting household is . dess. in households having no working males, . dess. in households having one working male, . in households having two, and . in households having three (p. ). And the conclusion is that there is an \u201capproximately equal per-capita distribution of rented land\u201d!! Mr. Maress did not think it necessary to examine the actual distribution of rented land according to groups of households of different economic strength, although he was in a position to learn this both from Mr. V. Postnikov\u2019s book and from the Zemstvo abstracts. The \u201caverage\u201d figure of . dess. of rented land per renting household in the group of households having one working male was obtained by adding together such figures as  dess. in the group of households cultivating  to  dess. and with  to  draught animals, and  dess. in the group of households cultivating over  dess. of land and with  and more draught animals. (See Returns for Melitopol Uyezd, p. D.-.) It is not surprising that by adding together the rich and the poor and dividing the total by the number of items added, one can obtain \u201cequal distribution\u201d wherever desired!\n\nActually, however, in Melitopol Uyezd % of the households, the rich ones (those with  dess. and more under crops), comprising .% of the peasant population, account\u2014despite the fact that they are best provided with allotment and purchased land\u2014for .% of the total rented arable (Returns for Melitopol Uyezd, p. B. -). On the other hand, % of the households, the poor ones (those with up to  dess. under crops), comprising . % of the peasant population, account\u2014despite the fact that they are worst provided with allotment and purchased land\u2014for .% of the total rented arable. As can be seen, this closely resembles \u201cequal per-capita distribution\u201d!\n\nMr. Maress bases all his calculations of peasant land-renting on the \u201cassumption\u201d that \u201cthe renting households are mainly in the two groups worst provided\u201d (provided with allotment land); that \u201camong the renting population there is equal per capita (sic!) distribution of rented land\u201d; and that \u201cthe renting of land enables the peasants to pass from the groups worst provided to those best provided\u201d (-). We have already shown that all these \u201cassumptions\u201d of Mr. Maress directly contradict the facts. Actually, the very contrary is the case, as Mr. Maress could not but have noted, had he\u2014in dealing with inequalities in economic life (p. )\u2014taken the data for the classification of households according to economic indices (instead of according to allotment tenure), and not limited himself to the unfounded \u201cassumption\u201d of Narodnik prejudices.\n\nLet us now compare Kamyshin Uyezd with other uyezds in Saratov Gubernia. The ratios between the peasant groups are everywhere the same, as is shown by the following data for the four uyezds (Volsk, Kuznetsk, Balashov and Serdobsk) in which, as we have said, the middle and the well-to-do peasants are combined:\n\nLand use by draught animals, Saratov Gubernia\nHence, we see everywhere the ousting of the poor by the prosperous peasants. But in Kamyshin Uyezd the well-to-do peasantry are more numerous and richer than in the other uyezds. Thus, in five uyezds of the gubernia (including the Kamyshin Uyezd) the households are distributed according to draught animals held as follows: with no draught animals\u2014.%; with  animal\u2014.%; with \u2014%; with \u2014.%; and with  and more\u2014.%, whereas in Kamyshin Uyezd, as we have seen, the well-to-do group is larger, and the badly-off group somewhat smaller. Further, if we combine the middle and well-to-do peasantry, i.e., if we take the households with  draught animals and more, we get the following data for the respective uyezds:\n\nLand use by draught animals, five uyezds.\nThis means that in Kamyshin Uyezd the prosperous peasants are richer. This uyezd is one of those with the greatest abundance of land: . dess. of allotment land per registered person,[] male, as against . dess. for the gubernia. Hence, the land-abundance of the \u201cpeasantry\u201d merely means the greater numbers and greater wealth of the peasant bourgeoisie.\n\nIn concluding this review of the data for Saratov Gubernia, we consider it necessary to deal with the classification of the peasant households. As the reader has probably observed, we reject a limine[] any classification according to allotment and exclusively employ classification according to economic strength (draught animals, area under crops). The reasons for adopting this system must be given. Classification according to allotment is far more widespread in our Zemstvo statistics, and in its defence the two following, at first sight very convincing, arguments are usually advanced.[] It is said, firstly, that to study the life of the agricultural peasants it is natural and necessary to classify them according to land. This argument ignores a fundamental feature of Russian life, namely, the unfree character of allotment-land tenure, in that by force of law it bears an equalitarian character, and that the purchase and sale of allotment land is hindered in the extreme. The whole process of the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry is one of real life evading these legal bounds. In classifying the peasants according to allotment, we lump together the poor peasant who leases out land and the rich peasant who rents or buys land; the poor peasant who abandons the land and the rich peasant who \u201cgathers\u201d land; the poor peasant who runs his most wretched farm with an insignificant number of animals and the rich peasant who owns many animals, fertilises his soil, introduces improvements., etc., etc. In other words, we lump together the rural proletarian and the members of the rural bourgeoisie. The \u201caverages\u201d thus obtained obscure the differentiation, and are therefore purely fictitious.[] The combined tables of the Saratov statisticians described above enable us to demonstrate clearly the uselessness of classification according to allotment. Take, for example, the category of non-allotment peasants in Kamyshin Uyezd (see Combined Returns, p.  and foll., the Returns for Kamyshin Uyezd, Vol. XI, p.  and foll.). The compiler of the Combined Returns, in describing this category, says that the area under crops is \u201cvery negligible\u201d (\u201cIntroduction\u201d, p. ), i.e., he assigns it to the category of the poor. Let us take the tables. The \u201caverage\u201d area under crops in this category is . dess. per household. But see how this \u201caverage\u201d was reached: by adding together the big crop growers ( dess. per household in the group with  and more draught animals; the households in this group constitute about / of the whole category, but they possess about half of this category\u2019s area under crops) and the poor, the horseless peasants, with . dess. per household! Take the households employing farm labourers. There are very few of them in this category\u2014 in all, or .%. But of these  there are  in the top group, in which the area cultivated is  dess. per household; and in this group the households employing farm labourers constitute .%. Clearly, we obscure the differentiation of the peasantry, depict the propertyless peasants in a better light than they actually are (by adding the rich to them and striking averages), while, on the contrary, we depict the well-to-do peasants as being of lesser strength, because the category of peasants with large allotments includes, in addition to the majority, the well-off, also the badly-off (it is a known fact that even the large-allotment village communities always include indigent peasants). We are now clear, too, as to the incorrectness of the second argument in defence of classification according to allotment. It is argued that by such classification the indices of economic strength (number of animals, area under crops, etc.) always show a regular increase according to the increase in the size of the allotment. That is an undoubted fact, for the allotment is one of the major factors of well-being. Where, consequently, the peasants are large-allotment holders there are always more members of the peasant bourgeoisie and, as a result, the \u201caverage\u201d allotment figures for the whole category are raised. All this, however, gives no grounds whatever for inferring that a method combining the rural bourgeoisie with the rural proletariat is correct.\n\nWe conclude: in systematising peasant household statistics one should not limit oneself to classification according to allotment. Economic statistics must necessarily take the scale and type of farm as the basis of classification. The indices for distinguishing these types should be taken in conformity with local conditions and forms of agriculture, while in dealing with extensive grain farming, one can limit oneself to classifying according to area under crops (or to the number of draught animals); under other conditions one must take account of the area under industrial crops, the technical processing of agricultural produce, the cultivation of root crops or of fodder grasses, dairy farming, vegetable growing, etc. When the peasantry combine agricultural and industrial occupations on a large scale, a combination of the two systems of classification is necessary, i.e., of classification according to the scale and type of agriculture, and of classification according to the scale and type of \u201cindustries.\u201d The methods of summarising peasant household returns are not such a narrowly specific and second-rate problem as one might imagine at first sight. On the contrary, it will be no exaggeration to say that at the present time it is the basic problem of Zemstvo statistics. The completeness of household returns and the technique of collecting them[] have reached a high degree of perfection, but owing to unsatisfactory summarising, a vast amount of most valuable information is simply lost, and the investigator has at his disposal merely \u201caverage\u201d figures (for village communities, volosts, categories of peasants, size of allotment, etc.). But these \u201caverages,\u201d as we have seen already, and shall see later, are often absolutely fictitious.\n\n\nIV. Zemstvo Statistics For Perm Gubernia\nIn our review of Zemstvo statistics let us now turn to a gubernia where conditions are totally different: Perm Gubernia. Let us take Krasnoufimsk Uyezd, for which we have a household classification made according to scale of farming.[] Here are the general data regarding the agricultural part of the uyezd (, households, , persons of both sexes).\n\nHousehold classification according to scale of farming, Krasnoufimsk Uyzed.\nHence, here too, notwithstanding the considerably smaller areas under crops, we find the same ratios between the groups, the same concentration of crop areas and animals in the hands of a small group of well-to-do peasants. The ratio between the land held and the land in actual economic use is the same as in the gubernias with which we are already familiar.[]\n\nPercentages of total land by householders.\nThe same grabbing of rentable land by the well-to-do peasants, those already best provided; the same transfer of allotment land (by leasing) from the poor to the affluent peasantry; the same diminution of the role of allotment land, proceeding in two different directions, at both poles of the countryside. To enable the reader to get a more concrete picture of these processes, we give the data on land renting in greater detail:\n\nData on land in greater detail.\nIn the top groups of peasants (who, as we know, concentrate in their hands most of the rented land), land renting is consequently of an obviously industrial, entrepreneur character, despite the widespread view to the contrary of the Narodnik economists.\n\nLet us pass to the data on hired labour, which are particularly valuable as regards this uyezd owing to their completeness (specifically, data have been added on the hiring of day labourers):\n\nFarms hiring labourers.\nWe see here a clear refutation of the view of the Saratov statisticians that the hiring of day labourers is not a characteristic index of a farm\u2019s strength or weakness. On the contrary, it is a supremely characteristic index of the peasant bourgeoisie. In all forms of hiring by the day we observe that the percentage of peasants who hire labourers increases together with the increase in economic strength, despite the fact that the most affluent peasants are best provided with workers in their families. Here, too, family co-operation is the basis of capitalist co-operation. Further, we see that the number of farms hiring day labourers is  / times (average for the uyezd) the number hiring seasonal workers\u2014we take the hiring of day labourers for reaping; unfortunately, the statisticians did not give the total number of farms hiring day labourers, although this information was available. In the three top groups, of , households , employ farm labourers, while , households, i.e., the majority of the peasants in the well-to-do group, hire day labourers for reaping. Of course, the hiring of day labourers is by no means specific to Perm Gubernia, and if we have seen above that in the well-to-do peasant groups from  to  and  tenths of the total number of proprietors employ farm labourers, the direct conclusion is the following. The majority of the well-to-do peasant households employ hired labour in one form or another. The formation of a body of regular farm labourers and day labourers is an essential condition for the existence of the well-to-do peasantry. Lastly, it is extremely interesting to note that the ratio between the number of farms hiring day labourers and the number employing regular farm labourers diminishes from the bottom peasant groups to the top. In the bottom groups the number of farms hiring day labourers always exceeds, many times over, the number employing regular farm labourers. In the top groups, on the contrary, the number of farms employing regular farm labourers is sometimes even larger than the number hiring day labourers. This fact clearly points to the formation in the top groups of the peasantry of farms employing labourers, farms based on the regular employment of wage-labour; wage-labour is more evenly distributed over the seasons of the year, and it becomes possible to dispense with the more costly and more troublesome hiring of day labourers. Let us quote, incidentally, the returns on hired labour for Elabuga Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia (the well-to-do peasants are here merged with the middle peasants).\n\nHired labourers by level of horse ownership.\nAssuming that every day labourer works one month ( days), the number of day labourers will be three times the number of seasonal workers. Let us note in passing that in Vyatka Gubernia, too, we find the already familiar ratios between the groups as regards both the hiring of workers and the renting and leasing of land.\n\nVery interesting are the household data on the use of manure, cited by the Perm statisticians. Here is the result of an analysis of these data:\n\nUse of manure.\nThus, here too, we see a profound difference in the systems and methods of farming employed by the poor and the affluent peasants. And this difference must exist everywhere, since the well-to-do peasants everywhere concentrate in their hands the greater part of the peasant-owned animals, and have more opportunities for expending-their labour on farm improvements. Therefore, if we learn, for example, that the post-Reform \u201cpeasantry\u201d have at one and the same time created a group of horseless and cattleless households and \u201craised agricultural efficiency\u201d by adopting the practice of manuring the soil (described in detail by Mr. V. V. in his Progressive Trends in Peasant Farming, pp. - and foll.), this quite clearly shows us that the \u201cprogressive trends\u201d simply indicate the progress of the rural bourgeoisie. This is seen even more distinctly in the distribution of improved agricultural implements, data regarding which are also available in the Perm statistics. These data, however, have been collected not for the whole of the agricultural part of the uyezd, but only for its rd, th and th districts, comprising , households out of ,. The following improved implements are registered: winnowers ,, seed-sorters , threshers , totalling ,. They are distributed among the groups as follows:\n\nData on improved implements.\nOne more illustration of Mr. V. V.\u2019s \u201cNarodnik\u201d thesis that improved implements are used by \u201call\u201d peasants!\n\nThe data on \u201cindustries\u201d enable us this time to single out two main types of \u201cindustries,\u201d indicating ) the transformation of the peasantry into a rural bourgeoisie (ownership of commercial and industrial establishment), and ) the transformation of the peasantry into a rural proletariat (sale of labour-power, the so-called \u201cagricultural industries\u201d}. The following table shows the distribution by groups of these diametrically opposite types of \u201cindustrialists\u201d[]:\n\nCommercial and industrial establishments.\nA comparison of these data with those showing the distribution of the area under crops and the hiring of workers once again shows that the differentiation of the peasantry creates a home market for capitalism.\n\nWe see also how profoundly the facts are distorted when the most varied types of occupations are lumped together under the heading of \u201cindustries\u201d or \u201cemployments,\u201d when the \u201ccombination of agriculture with industries\u201d is depicted (as, for example, by Messrs. V. V. and N.\u2013on) as something uniform, identical in nature and precluding capitalism.\n\nLet us point in conclusion to the similarity of the data for Ekaterinburg Uyezd. If from the , households in the uyezd we subtract the landless (, households), those having only meadow land (, households), and those neglecting their allotments entirely (, households), we get for the remaining , households the following data; the , households that cultivate no land or cultivate little (up to  dess.) have an aggregate area under crops of , dess. out of , dess., i.e., less than / . On the other hand, , well-to-do households (with over  dess. under crops) have , dess. under crops, and , dess. of rented land out of a total of , dess. (including , dess. out of , dess. of rented peasant land). The distribution of the two opposite types of \u201cindustries\u201d and also of the households employing farm labourers in Ekaterinburg Uyezd is shown to be quite similar to the distribution of these indices of differentiation for Krasnoufimsk Uyezd.\n\nV. Zemstvo Statistics For Orel Gubernia\nWe have at our disposal two volumes of statistics, for the Yelets and Trubchevsk uyezds of this gubernia, which classify the peasant households according to the number of draught horses owned.[]\n\nCombining the two uyezds, we give the following joint data by groups.\n\nPeasant households according to number of draught horses owned.\nFrom this we see that the general relations between the groups are the same as those we have seen earlier (the concentration of purchased and rented land in the hands of the well to-do, the transfer of the land to them from the poor peasants, etc.). Quite similar, too, are the relations between the groups as regards hired labour, \u201cindustries,\u201d and \u201cprogressive trends\u201d in farming.\n\nHorse ownership and improved implements.\nAnd so, in Orel Gubernia also we see the differentiation of the peasantry into two directly opposite types: on the one hand, into a rural proletariat (abandonment of land and sale of labour-power), and, on the other, into a peasant bourgeoisie (purchase of land, renting on a considerable scale, especially of allotment land, improved methods of farming, hiring of regular farm labourers and day labourers, here omitted, and the combining of commercial and industrial enterprises with agriculture. The scale of farming by the peasants here, however, is generally much smaller than in the above-quoted cases; there are far fewer big crop growers, and the differentiation of the peasantry, to judge by these two uyezds, therefore seems weaker. We say \u201cseems\u201d on the following grounds: firstly, though we observe here that the \u201cpeasantry\u201d turn more rapidly into a rural proletariat and produce hardly perceptible groups of rural bourgeois, we have, on the other hand, already seen examples of the reverse, where this latter pole of the countryside becomes particularly perceptible. Secondly, here the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry (we confine ourselves in this chapter to the agricultural peasantry) is obscured by the \u201cindustries,\u201d the development of which is particularly extensive (% of the families). And the \u201cindustrialists\u201d here too include, besides a majority of wage-workers, a minority of merchants, buyers-up, entrepreneurs, proprietors, etc. Thirdly, here the differentiation of the peasantry is obscured because of the absence of data regarding the aspects of local agriculture that are most closely connected with the market. Commercial, market cultivation is not developed here to expand the crop areas to produce grain for sale but for the production of hemp. The largest number of commercial operations are bound up with this crop but the data of the tables given in the volume do not single out this particular aspect of agriculture among the various groups. \u201cHemp growing is the main source of the peasants\u2019 income\u201d (that is, money income. Returns for Trubchevsk Uyezd, p.  of descriptions of villages, and many others), \u201cthe peasants devote their attention mainly to the cultivation of hemp. . . . All the manure . . . is used on the hemp fields\u201d (ibid., ), everywhere loans are contracted \u201con security of hemp,\u201d and debts are paid with hemp (ibid., passim). For the manuring of their hemp fields the well-to-do peasants buy manure from the poor (Returns for Orel Uyezd, Vol. VIII, Orel, , pp. -), hemp fields are leased out and rented in home and outside village communities (ibid., ), and the processing of the hemp is done by part of the \u201cindustrial establishments\u201d of whose concentration we have spoken. It is clear how incomplete is that picture of differentiation which gives no information about the main commercial product of local agriculture.[]\n\nVI. Zemstvo Statistics For Voronezh Gubernia\nThe returns for Voronezh Gubernia are distinguished for their exceptionally complete information and abundance of classifications. In addition to the usual classification according to allotment, we have for several uyezds a classification according to draught animals, to persons working (working strength of family), to industries (not engaged in industries; engaged in industries: a\u2014agricultural, b\u2014mixed and c\u2014commercial and industrial), to farm labourers (farms with members employed as farm labourers;\u2014with no farm labourers and with no members employed as such;\u2014households employing farm labourers). The last classification is given for the largest number of uyezds, and at first glance one might think that it is the most suitable for studying the differentiation of the peasantry. Actually, however, this is not the case: the group of farms providing farm labourers does not by any means embrace the whole of the rural proletariat, for it does not include farms providing day labourers, unskilled labourers, factory workers, builders\u2019 labourers, navvies, domestic servants, etc. Farm labourers constitute only a part of the wage-workers provided by the \u201cpeasantry.\u201d The group of farms that employ farm labourers is also very incomplete, for it does not include farms that hire day labourers. The neutral group (which neither provides nor employs farm labourers) lumps together in each uyezd tens of thousands of families, combining thousands of peasants who own no horses with thousands who own many, peasants who rent land and peasants who lease land, cultivators and non-cultivators, thousands of wage-workers and a minority of employers, etc. General \u201caverages\u201d for the entire neutral group are obtained, for example, by adding together landless households or those possessing  to  dess. per household (of allotment and purchased land in all) and households possessing ,  and more dessiatines of allotment land and purchasing additionally tens and hundreds of dessiatines of land (Returns for Bobrov Uyezd, p. , Col. No. ; for Novokhopersk Uyezd, p. )\u2014by adding together households with . to . animals per family and those with  to  animals (ibid.). Naturally, one cannot depict the differentiation of the peasantry with the aid of such \u201caverages,\u201d and so we have to take the classification according to draught animals as the one most closely approximating classification according to scale of farming. We have at our disposal four volumes of returns with this classification (for Zemlyansk, Zadonsk, Nizhnedevitsk and Korotoyak uyezds), and from these we must choose Zadonsk Uyezd, because no separate returns are given for the others on the purchase and leasing of land according to groups. Below we shall give combined data for all these four uyezds and the reader will see that the conclusions they yield are the same. Here are general data for the groups in Zadonsk Uyezd (, households, , persons of both sexes, , dess. of allotment land, , dess. of purchased land, , dess. of rented, and , dess. of land leased out).\n\nLand use by horse ownership.\nThe relations between the groups are similar here to those in the gubernias and uyezds already mentioned (concentration of purchased and of rented land, the transfer of allotment land from the poor peasants, who lease out land, to the renting and affluent peasants, etc.); but here the significance of the affluent peasants is very much smaller. The extremely negligible scale of peasant farming even raises the question, and naturally so, of whether the local peasants do not belong to the \u201cindustrialists\u201d rather than to the tillers of the soil. Here are data on the \u201cindustries,\u201d first of all on their distribution according to groups:\n\nData on \u2019industries\u2019 by horse ownership.\nThe distribution of improved implements and of the two opposite types of \u201cindustries\u201d (the sale of labour-power and commercial and industrial enterprise) is the same as in the data examined above. The enormous percentage of households engaging in \u201cindustries,\u201d the preponderance of grain-purchasing over grain-selling farms, the preponderance of money income from \u201cindustries\u201d over money income from agriculture[]\u2014all this gives us grounds for regarding this uyezd as \u201cindustrial\u201d rather than agricultural. Let us, however, see what sort of industries these are. The Evaluation Returns on Peasant Landownership in Zemlyansk, Zadonsk, Korotoyak and Nizhnedevitsk Uyezds (Voronezh,) contains a list of all the trades of the \u201cindustrialists,\u201d working locally and away from home ( trades in all), classified in groups according to allotment, and indicating the size of earnings in each trade. This list shows that the overwhelming majority of the peasant \u201cindustries\u201d consist of work for hire. Of , \u201cindustrialists\u201d in Zadonsk Uyezd, , are farm labourers, carters, shepherds and unskilled labourers, , are builders\u2019 labourers,  are town, factory and other workers,  are engaged in private service,  are beggars, etc. In other words, the overwhelming majority of the \u201cindustrialists\u201d are members of the rural proletariat, allotment-holding wage-workers, who sell their labour-power to rural and industrial employers.[] Thus, if we take the ratio between the different groups of the peasantry in a given gubernia or a given uyezd, we find everywhere the typical features of differentiation, both in the land-abundant steppe gubernias with their relatively huge peasant crop areas, and in the most land-poor localities with their miniature peasant \u201cfarms\u201d; despite the most profound difference in agrarian and agricultural conditions, the ratio between the top group of the peasantry and the bottom is everywhere the same. If, however, we compare the different localities, in some we see with particular clarity the formation of rural entrepreneurs from among the peasants and in others we see the formation of a rural proletariat. It goes without saying that in Russia, as in every other capitalist country, the latter aspect of the process of differentiation embraces an incomparably larger number of small cultivators (and very likely a larger number of localities) than the former.\n\n\nVII. Zemstvo Statistics For Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia\nFor three uyezds of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia\u2014the Knyaginin, Makaryev and Vasil uyezds\u2014the Zemstvo house-to-house census returns have been reduced to one table, which divides the peasant farms (only allotment-holding and only of peasants living in their own villages) into five groups according to draught animals held (Material for the Evaluation of the Lands of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia. Economic Section. Vols. IV, IX and XII, Nizhni-Novgorod, , , ).\n\nCombining these three uyezds, we get the following data on the groups of households (in the three uyezds mentioned the data cover , households and , persons of both sexes. Allotment land\u2014, dess., purchased\u2014, dess., rented\u2014, dess., counting all kinds of rented land, allotment and non-allotment, arable and meadow land; land leased out\u2014, dess.):\n\nLand use by horse ownership.\nHere too, consequently, we see that the well-to-do peasants, despite their better provision with allotment land (the percentage of allotment land in the top groups is larger than the percentage these groups constitute in the population), concentrate in their hands the purchased land (the well-to-do households, .% of the total, have .% of the purchased land, whereas the poor peasants, / of the households, have less than a quarter), as well as concentrate the rented land, and \u201cgather\u201d the allotment land leased by the poor. As a result of all this the actual distribution of the land in use by the \u201cpeasantry\u201d is quite unlike the distribution of the allotment land. The horseless peasants have actually less land at their disposal than the allotment guaranteed them by law. The one-horse and two-horse peasants increase their holdings by only  to % (from . dess. to . dess., and from . dess. to . dess.), whereas the well to-do peasants increase their holdings one and a half times to double. While the differences in the allotment land of the groups are negligible, the differences in the actual scale of cultivation are enormous, as can be seen from the above quoted data on animals and from the following data on area under crops:\n\nArea under crops and horse ownership.\ntablishments[]\n\nWhen assessed by the area under crops the differences between the groups are seen to be even greater than when assessed by the amount of land actually held and in use, to say nothing of the differences in the size of the allotments.[] This shows again and again the utter uselessness of classification by allotment holding, the \u201cequality\u201d of which has now become a legal fiction. The other columns of the table show how the \u201ccombination of agriculture with industry\u201d is taking place among the peasantry: the well-to-do peasants combine commercial and capitalist agriculture (the high percentage of households employing farm labourers) with commercial and industrial undertakings, whereas the poor combine the sale of their labour-power (\u201coutside employments\u201d} with crop growing on an insignificant scale, that is, are converted into allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers. Let us observe that the absence of a proportionate diminution in the percentage of the households with outside employments is explained by the extreme variety of these \u201cemployments\u201d and \u201cindustries\u201d of the Nizhni-Novgorod peasantry: besides agricultural workers, unskilled labourers, building and shipbuilding workers, etc., the industrialists here include a relatively very large number of \u201chandicraftsmen,\u201d owners of industrial workshops, merchants, buyers-up, etc. Obviously, the lumping together of \u201cindustrialists\u201d of such diverse types distorts the data on \u201chouseholds with outside earnings.\u201d[]\n\nOn the question of the differences in cultivation by the various groups of peasants, let us observe that in the Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, \u201cmanuring the land . . . is one of the chief conditions determining the degree of productivity\u201d of the ploughlands (p.  of the Returns for Knyaginin Uyezd). The average rye yield grows in proportion to the increase in the amount of manure used: with  to  cart-loads of manure per  dess. of allotment land, the rye crop amounts to . meras[] per dess.; with , cart-loads and more, to . meras (ibid., p. ). Clearly, therefore, the difference between the groups in the scale of their agricultural production should be still greater than the difference in area under crops, and the Nizhni-Novgorod statisticians made a big mistake in studying the produce of the peasant fields in general, and not of the fields of the poor and the well-to-do peasantry separately.\n\nVIII. Review Of Zemstvo Statistics For Other Gubernias\nAs the reader will have observed, in studying the process of the differentiation of the peasantry we use exclusively Zemstvo house-to-house census statistics, if they cover more or less extensive areas, if they give sufficiently detailed information on the most important indices of differentiation, and if (which is particularly important) they have been processed in such a way as to make it possible to single out the various groups of peasants according to their economic strength. The data given above, relating to seven gubernias, exhaust the Zemstvo statistical material that answers these conditions and that we have been able to use. For the sake of completeness, let us now point briefly to the remaining, less complete, data of a similar kind (i.e., based on house-to-house censuses).\n\nFor Demyansk Uyezd of Novgorod Gubernia we have a table on peasant farms grouped according to the number of horses (Material for Evaluating the Farmlands of Novgorod Gubernia, Demyansk Uyezd, Novgorod, ). There is no information here on land renting and leasing (in dessiatines), but the data given reveal the complete similarity of the relations between the well-to-do and the indigent peasants in this gubernia, as compared with the other gubernias. Here too, for example, as we proceed from the bottom group to the top (from the horseless households to those with  and more horses), there is an increase in the percentage of farms with purchased and rented land, despite the fact that those with many horses have an amount of allotment land above the average. Households with  or more horses, .% of the total number of households and . % of the population, possess .% of all allotment land, .% of the purchased land, .% of the rented land (to judge from the area under rye and oats on rented land), and .% of the total \u201cindustrial buildings.\u201d On the other hand . %, the horseless and one-horse households, constituting .% of the population, have only .% of the allotment land, .% of the purchased land, .% of the rented land (in the sense indicated above), and .% of the \u201cindustrial buildings.\u201d In other words, here too the well-to-do peasants \u201cgather\u201d the land and combine commercial and industrial \u201ctrades\u201d with agriculture, while the poor abandon the land and turn into wage-workers (the percentage of \u201cpersons engaged in industries\u201d diminishes as we pass from the bottom group to the top\u2014from . % among the horseless peasants to .% among those having  and more horses). The incompleteness of these data compels us to omit them from the following summary of the material on the differentiation of the peasantry.\n\nFor the same reason we omit the data on part of Kozelets Uyezd, Chernigov Gubernia (Material for Evaluating Farmlands, Compiled by the Chernigov Statistical Department of the Gubernia Zemstvo Board, Vol. V, Chernigov, ; the data on the number of draught animals are classified for , households of the black-earth district of the uyezd). The relationships between the groups are the same here too: .% of the households, with no draught animals and constituting .% of the population, have % of their own and allotment land and % of the rented land, but account for % of the total land let out on lease by these , households. On the other hand, .% of the households, with  and more draught animals and constituting . % of the population, have .% of their own and allotment land and .% of the rented land, and account for only % of the land let out on lease. Unfortunately, the other households (owning  to  draught animals) are not subdivided into smaller groups.\n\nIn Material for an Investigation of the Land-Usage and Domestic Life of the Rural Population of Irkutsk and Yenisei Gubernias there is a very interesting table (classification according to number of draught horses) of peasant and settler farms in four regions of Yenisei Gubernia (Vol. III, Irkutsk,, p. and foll.). It is very interesting to observe that the relationship between the well-to-do Siberian and the settler (and in this relationship the most ardent Narodnik would hardly dare to seek the famous community principle!) is essentially the same as that between our well-to-do village community members and their horseless and one-horse \u201cbrethren.\u201d By combining the settlers and the peasant old-timers (such a combination is necessary because the former serve as labour-power for the latter), we get the familiar features of the top and bottom groups. Of the households, .%,the bottom groups (those with no horses, and with  or ), constituting % of the population, have only .% of the total arable and .% of the total animals, whereas .% of the households, those with  and more horses, constituting .% of the population, have % of the arable and .% of the total cattle. The latter groups ( to , and more horses), cultivating  to  dess. per household, resort extensively to wage-labour ( to  % of the farms employ wage-workers), whereas the bottom three groups, cultivating \u2014.\u2014\u2014 dess. per household provide workers (\u2014\u2014% of the farms). The data on the renting and leasing out of land are the only exception we have met to the rule (of the concentration of rented land in the hands of the well-to-do), and this is the sort of exception that proves the rule. The point is that in Siberia there are none of the conditions that created this rule, there is no compulsory and \u201cequalitarian\u201d allotment of land, there is no established private property in land. The well-to-do peasant neither purchases nor rents land, but appropriates it (at least that has been the case till now); the leasing out and the renting of land are rather of the character of neighbourly exchange, and that is why the group data on the renting and the leasing of land display no consistency.[]\nFor three uyezds of Poltava Gubernia we can determine approximately the way the area under crops is distributed (knowing the number of farms with different areas under crops\u2014indicated in the statistical reports as \u201cfrom\u2014to\u201d so many dessiatines\u2014and multiplying the number of households in each division by the average area under crops within the limits indicated). We get the following data for , households (villagers, excluding non-peasants) with , dess. under crops: , households (.%) cultivate no land or only up to  dess. per household, to a total of , dess. under crops (.%); , households (%) cultivate over  dess. per household and have , dess. under crops (.%). (See Economic Statistical Returns for Poltava Gubernia, Konstantinograd, Khorol and Piryatin uyezds.)[] The distribution of area under crops is very much the same as what we have seen in the case of Taurida Gubernia, despite the basically smaller areas under crops. Naturally, such an uneven distribution is possible only where the purchased and rented land is concentrated in the hands of a minority. We have no complete data on this, since the statistics do not classify households according to economic strength and must therefore confine ourselves to the following data on Konstantinograd Uyezd. In the chapter of farming by the rural social-estates (Chapter II, \u00a7 , \u201cAgriculture\u201d} the compiler of the abstract states: \u201cIn general, if rented plots are divided into three categories: area per lessee of ) up to  dess., ) from  to  dess. and ) over  dess., the data for each will be as follows:[]\n\nRented plots.\nFor Kaluga Gubernia we have only the following very fragmentary and incomplete data on grain-sowing by , households (about / of the total number of peasant households in the gubernia[]).\n\nGroups of households according to area under crops.\nThat is to say, .% of the households, constituting .% of the population, possess .% of the draught horses, .% of the area under crops and .% of the gross income from crops. Clearly, these figures also point to the concentration of purchased and rented land in the hands of the well-to-do peasantry.\n\nFor Tver Gubernia, despite the wealth of information in the statistical returns the house-to-house censuses have been very inadequately processed; there is no classification of households according to economic strength. This defect is used by Mr. Vikhlyayev in the Statistical Returns for Tver Gubernia (Vol. XIII, Part , Peasant Farming, Tver, ) to deny \u201cdifferentiation\u201d among the peasantry, to detect a drive towards \u201cgreater equality,\u201d and to sing hymns in praise of \u201cpeople\u2019s production\u201d (p. ) and \u201cnatural economy.\u201d Mr. Vikhlyayev enters into the most hazardous and unfounded arguments on stratification,\u201d not only without citing any precise data on the peasant groups, but without even having made clear for himself the elementary truth that differentiation is taking place within the village community, and that therefore to talk about \u201cstratification\u201d and to classify exclusively according to village communities or to volosts is simply ridiculous.[]\nIX. Summary Of The Above Zemstvo Statistics On The Differentiation Of The Peasantry\nIn order to compare and combine the above-quoted data on the differentiation of the peasantry, we obviously cannot take absolute figures and put them into groups: for that we should require complete data for the whole group of districts and identical methods of classification. We can only compare and juxtapose the relation of the top to the bottom groups (as regards possession of land, animals, implements, etc.). The relationship expressed, for example, in the fact that % of the households have % of the area under crops, does away with the difference in the absolute figures and is therefore suitable for comparison with every similar relationship in any locality. But to make such a comparison we must single out in the other locality % of the households, too, neither more nor less. But the sizes of the groups in the different uyezds and gubernias are not equal. And so, we have to split up these groups so as to take in each locality an equal percentage of households. Let us agree to take % of the households for the well-to-do peasants and % for the poor, i.e., let us form out of the top groups one of % of the households, and out of the bottom groups one of %. Let us illustrate this method by an example. Suppose we have five groups of the following proportions, from the bottom to the top: %, %, %, % and % of the households (S = %). To form a bottom group, we take the first group and / of the second group ( + (x) /  = %), and to form a top group we take the last group and / of the penultimate group ( + (x) /  = %), the percentages for area under crops, animals, implements, etc., being determined, of course, in the same way. That is to say, if the percentages for area under crops corresponding to the above-stated percentages of the households are as follows: %, %, %, % and % (S = %), then our top group, % of the households, will account for ( + (x) /  = %) of the area under crops, while our bottom group, % of the households, will account for ( + (x) /  = %) of the area under crops. Obviously, in splitting up the groups in this manner, we do not change by one iota the actual relationship between the bottom and top strata of the peasantry.[] This splitting up is necessary, firstly, because in this way, instead of \u2014\u2014\u2014 different groups, we get three large groups with clearly defined indices[]; secondly, because only in this way are data on the differentiation of the peasantry in the most varied localities under the most varied conditions comparable.\n\nPages - of the Statistical Returns of Poltava Gubernia.\nTo judge the interrelation between the groups we take the following data, the most important on the question of differentiation: ) number of households; ) number of persons of both sexes of the peasant population; ) amount of allotment land; ) purchased land; ) rented land; ) land leased out; ) total land owned or in use by the group (allotment + purchased + rented - land leased out); ) area under crops; ) number of draught animals; ) total number of animals; ) number of households employing farm labourers; ) number of households with employments (singling out as far as possible those forms of \u201cemployment\u201d among which work for hire, sale of labour-power predominates); ) commercial and industrial establishments and ) improved agricultural implements. The items given in italics (\u201cleasing of land\u201d and \u201cemployments\u201d} are of negative significance, since they indicate the decline of the farm, the ruin of the peasant and his conversion into a worker. All the other data are of positive significance, since they indicate the expansion of the farm and the conversion of the peasant into a rural entrepreneur.\n\nOn all these points we compute for each group of farms the percentages of the total for the uyezd or for several uyezds of one gubernia, and then ascertain (by the method we have described) what percentage of the land, area under crops, animals, etc., falls to the % of the households of the top groups and to the % of the households of the bottom groups.[]\n\nWe give a table drawn up in this manner covering the data for  uyezds in  gubernias, with a total of , peasant farms and a population of ,, persons of both sexes.\n\nTable A. Table A (cont.).\nTable B. Table B (cont.).\nNotes to tables A and B\n\n. For Taurida Gubernia the returns for land leased out concern only two uyezds: Berdyansk and Dnieper.\n\n. For the same gubernia the category of improved implements includes mowers and reapers.\n\n. For the two uyezds of Samara Gubernia instead of the percentage of land leased out the percentage of allotment-leasing non-farming households has been taken.\n\n. For Orel Gubernia the amount of land leased out (and consequently of the total land in use) has been determined approximately. The same applies to the four uyezds of Voronezh Gubernia.\n\n. For Orel Gubernia the returns for improved implements exist for only Yelets Uyezd.\n\n. For Voronezh Gubernia, instead of the number of households with employments we have taken (for three uyezds: Zadonsk, Korotoyak and Nizhnedevitsk) the number of households providing farm labourers.\n\n. For Voronezh Gubernia returns for improved implements exist for only two uyezds: Zemlyansk and Zadonsk.\n\n. For Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, instead of households engaged in \u201cindustries\u201d in general, we have taken the households engaging in outside employments.\n\n. For some of the uyezds, instead of the number of commercial and industrial establishments, we have had to take the number of households with commercial and industrial establishments.\n\n. Where the statistical returns give several columns of \u201cemployments\u201d we have tried to single out those \u201cemployments\u201d which most exactly indicate work for hire, the sale of labour-power.\n\n. All rented land, as far as possible, has been taken\u2014allotment and non-allotment, arable and meadow land.\n\n. We would remind the reader that for Novouzensk Uyezd farm-stead peasants and Germans are excluded, for Krasnoufimsk Uyezd only the agricultural part of the uyezd has been taken for Ekaterinburg Uyezd landless peasants and those possessing a share in meadow land alone are excluded, for Trubchevsk Uyezd suburban village communities are excluded, for Knyaginin Uyezd the industrial village of Bolshoye Murashkino is excluded, etc. These exclusions are partly ours, and are partly due to the nature of the material. Obviously, therefore, the differentiation of the peasantry must actually be more pronounced than appears in our table and chart.\n\nTo illustrate this combined table and to show clearly the complete similarity, of the relationship of the top to the bottom peasant groups in the most varied localities, we have drawn the following chart on which are plotted the percentages in the table. To the right of the column indicating the percentages of total households, runs a curve showing the positive indices of economic strength (enlargement of holding, increase in the number of animals, etc.), while to the left runs a curve showing the negative indices of economic strength (leasing out of land, sale of labour-power; these columns are shaded). The distance from the top horizontal line of the chart to each continuous curve shows the share of the well-to-do groups in the sum-total of peasant farming, while the distance from the bottom horizontal line to each broken curve shows the share of the poor groups in that sum total. Lastly, to give a clear picture of the general character of the combined data, we have plotted an \u201caverage\u201d curve (arrived at by calculating arithmetical averages from the percentages indicated in the chart. To distinguish it from the others, this \u201caverage\u201d curve is in red). This \u201caverage\u201d curve indicates, so to speak, the typical differentiation of the Russian peasantry today.\n\nNow, in order to sum up the data on differentiation given above (\u00a7\u00a7 I-VII), let us examine this chart column by column.\n\nThe first column to the right of the one indicating the percentages of households shows the proportion of the population belonging to the top and the bottom groups. We see that everywhere the size of the families of the well-to-do peasantry is above the average and that of the poor below the average. We have already spoken of the significance of this fact. Let us add that it would be wrong to take as the unit for all comparisons the individual (as the Narodniks are fond of doing) and not the household, the family. While the expenditure of the well-to-do family grows because of the larger size of the family, the mass of expenditure, on the other hand, in the large-family household diminishes (on buildings, domestic effects, household needs, etc., etc. The economic advantages of large families are particularly stressed by Engelhardt in his Letters From the Countryside,[] and by Trirogov in his book, The Village Community and the Poll Tax, St. Petersburg, ). Therefore, to take the individual as the unit for comparisons, and to take no account of this diminution, means artificially and falsely to identify the condition of the \u201cindividual\u201d in the large and in the small families. Incidentally, the chart clearly shows that the well-to-do group of peasants concentrate in their hands a far larger share of agricultural production than would follow from a calculation per head of population.\n\nThe next column refers to allotment land. In its distribution we see the greatest degree of equality, as should be the case by virtue of the legal status of allotment land. But even here the process of the poor being ousted by the well-to-do peasants is beginning: everywhere we find that the top groups hold a somewhat larger share of the allotment land than the share they represent in the population, while the bottom groups hold a somewhat smaller one. The \u201cvillage community\u201d tends to serve the interests of the peasant bourgeoisie. Compared, however, with the actual land tenure the inequality in the distribution of allotment land is still quite insignificant. The distribution of allotment land does not (as is clearly evident from the chart) give any idea of the actual distribution of land and farm property.[]\n\nThen comes the column for purchased land. In all cases this land is concentrated in the hands of the well-to-do: one fifth of the households have about  or  tenths of all peasant owned purchased land, whereas the poor peasants, constituting half the households, account for a maximum of %! One can judge, therefore, the significance of the \u201cNarodnik\u201d fuss about enabling the \u201cpeasantry\u201d to buy as much land as possible and as cheaply as possible.\n\nThe next column is that for rented land. Here too we see everywhere the concentration of the land in the hands of the well-to-do (one-fifth of the households account for  to  tenths of the total rented land) who, moreover, rent land at cheaper rates, as we have seen above. This grabbing of rentable land by the peasant bourgeoisie clearly demonstrates that \u201cpeasant renting\u201d carries an industrial character (the purchase of land for the purpose of selling the product.)[] In saying this, however, we do not at all deny the fact of land renting being due to want. On the contrary, the chart shows the entirely different character of renting by the poor, who cling to the land (half the households account for  to  tenths of the total rented land). There are peasants and peasants.\n\nThe contradictory significance of land renting in \u201cpeasant farming\u201d stands out particularly vividly when we compare the column on land renting with that on the leasing out of land (first column to the left, i.e., among the negative indices). Here we see the very opposite: the principal lessors of land are the bottom groups (half the households account for  to  tenths of the land leased), who strive to get rid of their allotments, which pass (despite legal prohibitions and restrictions) into the hands of employer farmers. Thus, when we are told that the \u201cpeasantry\u201d rent land and that the \u201cpeasantry\u201d lease out their land, we know that the first applies mainly to the peasant bourgeoisie and the second to the peasant proletariat.\n\nThe relation of purchased, rented and leased land to the allotment determines also the actual land held by the groups (th column to the right). In all cases we see that the actual distribution of the total land at the disposal of the peasants has nothing in common with the \u201cequality\u201d of the allotments. Of the households % account for % to % of the total land, while % account for % to %. In the distribution of area under crops (next column) the ousting of the bottom group by the top stands out in still greater relief, probably because the poor peasantry are often unable to make economic use of their land and abandon it. Both columns (total land held and area under crops) show that the purchase and the renting of land lead to a diminution of the share of the bottom groups in the general system of economy, i.e., to their being ousted by the well-to-do minority. The latter now play a dominant role in the peasant economy, concentrating in their hands almost as much of the area under crops as do all the rest of the peasants put together.\n\nThe next two columns show the distribution of draught and other animals among the peasantry. The percentages of animals differ very slightly from those of area under crops; nor could it be otherwise, for the number of draught animals (and also of other animals) determines the area under crops, and in its turn is determined by it.\n\nThe next column shows the share of the various groups of the peasantry in the total number of commercial and industrial establishments. One-fifth of the households (the well-to-do group) concentrate in their hands about half of these establishments, while half the households, the poor, account for about /,[] that is to say, the \u201cindustries\u201d that express the conversion of the peasantry into a bourgeoisie are concentrated mainly in the hands of the most affluent cultivators. The well-to-do peasants, consequently, invest capital in agriculture (purchase and renting of land, hire of workers, improvement of implements, etc.), industrial establishments, commerce, and usury: merchant\u2019s and entrepreneur capital are closely connected, and surrounding conditions determine which of these forms of capital becomes predominant.\n\nThe data on households with \u201cemployments\u201d (the first column to the left, among the negative indices) also characterise the \u201cindustries,\u201d which are, however, of opposite significance, and mark the conversion of the peasant into a proletarian. These \u201cindustries\u201d are concentrated in the hands of the poor (they constitute % of the households and account for % to % of the total households with employments), whereas the part played in them by the well-to-do groups is insignificant (it must not be forgotten that we have not been able to draw an exact line of demarcation between masters and workers in this category of \u201cindustrialists\u201d either). One has only to compare the data on \u201cemployments\u201d with the data on \u201ccommercial and industrial establishments\u201d to see how utterly opposite are these two types of \u201cindustries,\u201d and to realise what incredible confusion is created by the customary lumping together of these types.\n\nHouseholds employing farm labourers are in all cases concentrated in the group of well-to-do peasants (% of the households account for  to  tenths of the total number of farms employing labourers), who (despite their having larger families) cannot exist without a class of agricultural labourers to \u201csupplement\u201d them. Here we have a striking confirmation of the proposition expressed above: that to compare the number of farms employing labourers with the total number of peasant \u201cfarms\u201d (including the \u201cfarms\u201d of the agricultural labourers) is absurd. It is much more correct to compare the number of farms employing labourers with one-fifth of the peasant households, for the well-to-do minority account for about / , or even / , of the total of such farms. The entrepreneur hiring of labourers from among the peasantry far exceeds hiring from necessity, that is, because of a shortage of workers in the family: the poor and small-family peasants, constituting % of the households, account for only about / of the total number of farms employing labourers (here too, incidentally, shopkeepers, industrialists, etc., who do not hire workers on account of necessity, are included among the poor).\n\nThe last column, showing the distribution of improved implements, we could have headed \u201cprogressive trends in peasant farming,\u201d following the example of Mr. V. V. The \u201cfairest\u201d distribution of these implements is that in Novouzensk Uyezd, Samara Gubernia, where the well-to-do households, constituting one-fifth of the total, have only  out of  implements, whereas the poor, constituting half the households, have as many as three out of a hundred.\n\nLet us now compare the degree of peasant differentiation in the different localities. In the chart two types of localities stand out very clear]y in this regard: in Taurida, Samara, Saratov and Perm gubernias the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry is markedly more intense than in Orel, Voronezh and Nizhni-Novgorod gubernias. The curves of the first four gubernias in the run below the red average line, while those of the last three gubernias run above the average, i.e., show a smaller concentration of farming in the hands of the well-to-do minority. The localities of the first type are the most land-abundant and strictly agricultural (in Perm Gubernia the agricultural parts of the uyezds have been singled out), with extensive farming. With farming of this character the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry is easily noted and therefore clearly visible. Conversely, in the localities of the second type we see, on the one hand, a development of commercial agriculture such as is not noted in our data; for example, the sowing of hemp in Orel Gubernia. On the other hand, we see the tremendous significance of \u201cindustries,\u201d both in the sense of work for hire (Zadonsk Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia) and in the sense of non-agricultural occupations (Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia). The significance of both these circumstances for the question of the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry is enormous. Of the former (the different forms of commercial agriculture and agricultural progress in the different localities) we have already spoken. The significance of the latter (the role of the \u201cindustries\u201d} is no less obvious. If in a given locality the bulk of the peasants are allotment-holding farm labourers, day labourers or wage-workers in industries, the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry will, of course, be marked very feebly.[] But to get a proper idea of the matter, these typical representatives of the rural proletariat must be compared with typical representatives of the peasant bourgeoisie. The allotment-holding Voronezh day labourer who goes south in search of odd jobs must be compared with the Taurida peasant who cultivates huge tracts of land. The Kaluga, Nizhni-Novgorod and Yaroslavl carpenter must be compared with the Yaroslavl or Moscow vegetable grower or peasant who keeps cows to sell the milk, etc. Similarly, if the bulk of the peasants in a locality are engaged in the manufacturing industries, their allotments providing them with only a small part of their means of livelihood, the data on the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry must be supplemented with data on the differentiation of those who engage in industries. In Chapter  we shall deal with this latter question; at the moment we are concerned only with the differentiation of the typically agricultural peasantry.\nX. Summary Of Zemstvo Statistics And Army-Horse Census Returns[]\nWe have shown that the relation of the top to the bottom group of the peasantry bears the very features that characterise the relation of the rural bourgeoisie to the rural proletariat; that these relationships are remarkably similar in the most varied localities with the most varied conditions; that even their numerical expression (i.e., percentages of the groups in the total area under crops, number of animals, etc.) fluctuates within limits that, comparatively speaking, are very small. The question naturally arises: how far can these data on the relationships between the groups in the different localities be utilised for forming an idea of the groups into which the entire Russian peasantry is divided? In other words, what returns can enable us to judge the composition of, and the interrelation between, the top and the bottom groups of the entire Russian peasantry?\n\nThere are very few of these returns, for no agricultural censuses are taken in Russia that register all the crop raising farms in the country. The only material by which we can judge into which economic groups our peasantry is divided is the combined Zemstvo statistics and the army horse census. returns showing the distribution of draught animals (or horses) among the peasant households. Meagre as this material is, one can nevertheless draw from it conclusions (certainly very general, approximate, aggregate) that are not without interest, particularly since the ratio of peasants with many horses to those with few has already been analysed and found to be remarkably similar in the most varied localities.\n\nAccording to the data in Mr. Blagoveshchensky\u2019s Combined Zemstvo House-to-House Census Economic Returns (Vol. I, Peasant Farming, Moscow, ),[] the Zemstvo censuses covered  uyezds in  gubernias, having ,, peasant households and a population of ,, persons of both sexes. But the data on the distribution of households according to draught animals are not everywhere of the same kind. Thus, in three gubernias we have to omit  uyezds[] where the households are classified not in four, but in only three groups. For the remaining  uyezds in  gubernias we get the following combined figures covering nearly  / million households with a population of  million:\n\nDraught animals.\nasessed[]\n\nThese data cover slightly less than one-fourth of the total peasant households in European Russia (the Combined Statistical Material on the Economic Position of the Rural Population in European Russia, published by the Chancellery of the Committee of Ministers, St. Petersburg, , considers that in the  gubernias of European Russia there are ,, households in the volosts, including ,, peasant households). For the whole of Russia we have data on the distribution of horses among the peasants in Statistics of the Russian Empire. XX. Army-Horse Census of  (St. Petersburg, ), and Statistics of the Russian Empire. XXXI. Army-Horse Census of  (St. Petersburg, ). The first publication contains an analysis of the data collected in  for  gubernias (including the  gubernias in the Kingdom of Poland), and the second for  gubernias in European Russia, plus the Caucasus, the Kalmyk Steppe and the Don Military Region.\n\nSingling out  gubernias in European Russia (the returns for Don Region are not complete) and combining the data for  and , we get the following picture of the distribution of the total number of horses belonging to the peasants in village communities.\n\nDistribution of total number of horses.\nThus, all over Russia the distribution of draught horses among the peasantry is very close to the \u201caverage\u201d degree of differentiation we have depicted in our chart. Actually, the disintegration is even somewhat deeper: in the hands of  per cent of the households (. million out of . million) are concentrated  / million horses out of  million, i.e., .% of the total number. A vast mass of . million households has none at all, while . million one-horse households have only .% of the total number of horses.[]\n\nChart Illusrating Tables A and B.\nTaking as our basis the above-established regularities in the relationship between the groups, we can now ascertain the real significance of these data. If a fifth of the households possesses a half of the total number of horses, one may unerringly conclude that no less (and probably more) than half the total peasant agricultural production is in their hands. Such a concentration of production is possible only where this well-to-do peasantry concentrates in its hands the major part of the purchased lands and of peasant-rented land, both non-allotment and allotment. It is this well-to-do minority who mainly do the buying and renting of land, despite the fact that in all probability they are best supplied with allotment land. While the \u201caverage\u201d Russian peasant in the very best of times barely makes ends meet (and it is doubtful whether he does), the well-to-do minority, whose circumstances are considerably above the average, not only cover all their expenditure by independent farming, but also obtain a surplus. And this means that they are commodity producers, that they grow agricultural produce for sale. More, they turn into a rural bourgeoisie, combining with relatively large-scale crop farms commercial and industrial enterprises,\u2014we have seen that it is precisely \u201cindustries\u201d of this kind that are most typical of the Russian \u201centerprising\u201d muzhik. Despite the fact that their families are the largest, that they have the largest number of family workers (these features have always been characteristic of the well-to-do peasantry, and the / of the households should account for a large share of the population, approximately / ), the well-to-do minority employ permanent farm labourers and day labourers on the biggest scale. Of the total number of Russian peasant farms that resort to the hiring of labourers, a considerable majority should be those of this well-to-do minority. We are justified in drawing this conclusion both on the basis of the preceding analysis and from a comparison between the proportion of the population represented by this group and the share it has of the total number of draught animals, and hence of the cultivated area, of farming in general. Lastly, only this well-to-do minority can take a steady part in the \u201cprogressive trends in peasant farming.\u201d[] Such should be the relation between this minority and the rest of the peasantry; but it goes without saying that this relation assumes different forms and manifests itself in other ways depending on differences in agrarian conditions, systems of farming and forms of commercial agriculture.[] The main trends of peasant differentiation are one thing; the forms it assumes, depending on the different local conditions, are another.\n\nThe position of the horseless and one-horse peasants is the very opposite. We have seen above that the Zemstvo statisticians put even the latter (to say nothing of the former) in the category of the rural proletariat. Thus, we hardly exaggerate in our approximate calculation, which places in the category of the rural proletariat all the horseless and up to / of the one-horse peasants (about half the total households). These peasants, who are worst provided with allotment land, often lease out their allotments because of lack of implements, seed, etc. Of the total peasant-rented and purchased land theirs are but miserable scraps. Their farms will never yield enough for subsistence, and their main source of livelihood is \u201cindustries\u201d or \u201cemployments,\u201d i.e., the sale of their labour-power. These are a class of wage-workers with allotments, permanent farm labourers, day labourers, unskilled labourers, building workers, etc., etc.\n\nNotes\n[]  uyezds in Saratov Gubernia,  in Samara Gubernia, and  in Bessarabia Gubernia.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] To horses are added oxen, calculated at a pair for one horse.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The way the distribution of horses among the peasantry has been changing latterly can be judged from the following data of the army horse census of - (Statistics of the Russian Empire, XXXVII). In  gubernias of European Russia there were in -: ,, peasant households; of these, horseless were ,,, or .%; one-horse\u2014.%; -horse\u2014.%; -horse\u2014.%; -horse and over\u2014.%. The horses owned by the peasants numbered ,, of which .% belonged to the one-horse peasants, .% to the -horse; .% to the -horse and .% to those with many horses. Thus, .% of the peasants, the well-to-do, owned .% of the total number of horses.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It is quite possible, for example, that in dairy-farming districts it would be much more correct to classify according to the number of cows held and not according to the number of horses. Where market gardening prevails, neither index can be satisfactory, etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Army-horse censuses\u2014a register of the number of horses fit for army service in case of mobilisation, was, as a rule, taken in tsarist Russia every six years. The first census was taken in  in  gubernias in the west of Russia. The second census was taken in  and covered the whole of European Russia, the results being published in  under the title Horse Census of . In  a census was taken in  gubernias, and in  in the remaining  gubernias and in the Caucasus. The examination of the data gathered was undertaken by the Central Statistical Committee, which published them in the abstracts: Statistics of the Russian Empire. XX. Army-Horse Census of  (St. Petersburg, ) and Statistics of the Russian Empire. XXXI. Army-Horse Census of  (St. Petersburg ). The next census was taken in the years - and covered  gubernias of European Russia, the results being published under the title Statistics of the Russian Empire. XXXVII. Army-Horse Census of  and  (St. Petersburg, ). Data of the army-horse census for the years -, covering  gubernias of European Russia, one Caucasian gubernia and the Kalmyk steppe of the Astrakhan Gubernia made up Vol. LV of the Statistics of the Russian Empire (St. Petersburg, ).\n\nThe army-horse censuses were investigations that covered all the peasant farms. In his book, Lenin utilised the census material when examining the process of the differentiation of the peasantry.\n\n[] Lenin made a detailed analysis of the material contained in Blagoveshchensky\u2019s compilation in a special notebook and in the remarks he wrote in the margins. These have been published in Lenin Miscellany XXXIII, pp. -.\n\n[] Lenin refers here to the title of the previously mentioned essay by the Liberal Narodnik, Vorontsov (V. V.), that appeared in .\n\nXI. A Comparison of the Army-Horse Censuses of - and -\nThe army-horse censuses of  and - enable us now to compare the latest data with those quoted above.\n\nBy combining the  southern gubernias () with  of the rest (-), we get the following data for  gubernias of European Russia:\n\nArmy-horse census of -.\nFor - we cited data for  gubernias. Of these, the latest data are lacking only for one, namely, Archangel Gubernia. Subtracting the figures for this gubernia from those given above, we get for the same  gubernias in - the following picture:\n\nArmy-horse census of -.\nA comparison of - and - reveals the growing expropriation of the peasantry. The number of households increased by nearly  million. The number of horses diminished, although very slightly. The number of horseless households increased with particular rapidity, and their percentage rose from . to .. Instead of . million poor peasants (horseless and one-horse), we now have . million. The entire increase in the number of households has gone to enlarging the number of poor ones. The percentage of households rich in horses diminished. Instead of . million households with many horses, we have only  million. The number of middle and well-to-do households combined (with  and more horses) remained almost stationary (,, in - and ,, in  ).\n\nThus the conclusions to be drawn from these data are as follows.\n\nThe increasing poverty and expropriation of the peasantry is beyond doubt.\n\nAs for the relation of the top group of the peasantry to the bottom one, this remained almost unchanged. If, in the manner described above, we constitute the bottom groups of % of the households and the top groups of % of the households, we shall get the following: in - the poor, % of the households, had .% of the horses. The rich, % of the households, had .%. In - the poor, % of the households, also had .% of the total peasant-owned horses, while the rich, % of the households, had .% of the total number of horses. Consequently, the relationship between the groups remained almost unchanged.\n\nLastly, the peasantry as a whole became poorer in horses. Both the number and the percentage of the many-horse households decreased. On the one hand, this evidently marks the decline of peasant farming generally in European Russia. On the other hand, one must not forget that the number of horses employed in agriculture in Russia is abnormally high for the area cultivated. It could not be other wise in a small-peasant country. The drop in the number of horses consequently represents to a certain degree \u201cthe restoration of the normal proportion between the number of draught animals and the amount of arable\u201d among the peasant bourgeoisie (see Mr. V. V.\u2019s arguments on this point above, in Chapter II, \u00a7 ).\n\nIt will be appropriate here to touch on the arguments on this question in the latest works of Mr. Vikhlyayev (\u201cSketches of Russian Agricultural Reality,\u201d St. Petersburg, published by the magazine Khozyain[Farmer]) and of Mr. Chernenkov (A Characterisation of Peasant Farming, Part I, Moscow, ). They were so carried away by the diversity of the figures on the distribution of horses among the peasantry that they turned economic analysis into a statistical exercise. Instead of studying the types of peasant farm (day labourer, middle peasant, entrepreneur), they make a study, like amateurs, of endless columns of figures, just as though they have set out to astonish the world by their arithmetical zeal.\n\nOnly thanks to such play with figures was Mr. Chernenkov able to fling the objection at me that I am \u201cprejudiced\u201d in interpreting \u201cdifferentiation\u201d as a new (and not old) and for some reason completely capitalist phenomenon. Mr. Chernenkov was, of course, free to think that I was drawing conclusions from statistics and forgetting economics!\u2014that I was proving something from a mere change in the number and the distribution of horses! To view intelligently the differentiation of the peasantry, one must take the picture as a whole: the renting of land, the purchase of land, machines, outside employments, the growth of commercial agriculture, and wage-labour. Or maybe Mr. Chernenkov considers these also are neither \u201cnew\u201d nor \u201ccapitalist\u201d phenomena?\n\nXII. Zemstvo Statistics On Peasant Budgets\nTo finish with the problem of the differentiation of the peasantry, let us examine it from yet another aspect\u2014that of the highly specific data of peasant budgets. We shall thus see clearly how profound is the difference between the types of peasantry under discussion.\n\nIn the appendix to Evaluation Returns on Peasant Landownership in Zemlyansk, Zadonsk, Korotoyak and Nizhnedevitsk Uyezds (Voronezh, ) there are \u201cstatistics on the composition and budgets of typical farms,\u201d which are distinguished for their extraordinary completeness.[] Of the  budgets we leave out one, as being quite incomplete (budget No.  for Korotoyak Uyezd), and divide the rest into six groups according to draught animals, as follows: a\u2014with no hoses; b\u2014with  horse; c\u2014with  horses; d\u2014with  horses; e\u2014with  horses and f\u2014with  horses and more (we shall designate the groups only by these letters a to f). True, classification along these lines is not quite suitable for this locality (in view of the enormous significance of \u201cindustries\u201d in the economy of both the bottom groups and the top), but we have to take it for the sake of comparing the budget data with the above-examined house-to-house census data. Such a comparison can only be made by dividing the \u201cpeasantry\u201d into groups, whereas general and all-round \u201caverages\u201d are purely fictitious, as we have seen and shall see further on.[] Let us note here, incidentally, the interesting phenomenon that \u201caverage\u201d budget figures nearly always characterise the farm of above average type, i.e., they picture the facts in a better light than they actually are.[] This happens, probably, because the very term \u201cbudget\u201d presupposes a farm that is balanced to at least a minimum degree, a kind that is not easily found among the poor. To illustrate this let us compare the budget and other data of the households, classified according to draught animals held.\n\nNumber of budgets.\nThis makes it clear that the budget figures can only be used by striking the average for each separate group of peasants. This is what we have done with the data mentioned. We give them under three headings: (A) general budget results; (B) characterisation of crop farming; and (C) characterisation of the standard of living.\n\n(A) The general data regarding the magnitude of expenditure and income are as follows:\n\nMagnitude of expenditure and income.\nThus, the sizes of the budgets of the different groups vary enormously; even if we leave aside the extreme groups, the budget in e is over five times that in b, whereas the size of the family in e is less than three times that in b.\n\nLet us examine the distribution of expenditures[]:\n\nAverage expenditure per farm.\nIt is sufficient to glance at the farm expenditure as compared with the total expenditure for each group to see that here we have both proletarians and proprietors: in group a the farm expenditure is only % of the total expenditure, whereas in group f it is %. The differences in the absolute figures of farm expenditure go without saying. Such expenditure is negligible in the case not only of the horseless but also of the one-horse peasant, and the one-horse \u201cpeasant\u201d is much closer to the ordinary type (in capitalist countries) of allotment-holding farm labourer and day labourer. Let us also note the very considerable differences in the percentage of expenditure on food (a\u2019s nearly double f \u2019s); as we know, a big percentage is evidence of a low standard of living and is what most sharply differentiates the budget of the proprietor from that of the worker.\n\nNow let us take the items of income []:\n\nAverage income per farm.\nexpenditure[]\n\nThus, income from \u201cindustries\u201d exceeds the gross income from agriculture in the two extreme groups: the proletarian horseless peasant, and the rural entrepreneur. The \u201cpersonal industries\u201d of the bottom peasant groups consist, of course, mainly of work for hire, while income from the leasing of land is an important item in the \u201cmiscellaneous incomes.\u201d The group of \u201cindependent farmers\u201d even includes those whose income from the leasing of land is slightly less, and sometimes even more, than the gross income from agriculture. For example, in the case of one horseless peasant, the gross income from agriculture is . rubles, and from the leasing of land  rubles; in the case of another, the income from agriculture is . rubles and from the leasing of land  rubles. It must not be forgotten, furthermore, that the income from the leasing of land and from farm labouring goes entirely to cover the personal needs of the \u201cpeasant,\u201d while from the gross agricultural income we must deduct expenditure on the conduct of the farm. After making this deduction, we shall find that the net income of the horseless peasant from agriculture is . rubles, and from \u201cindustries\u201d . rubles, and in the case of the one-horse peasant, . and . rubles. The mere juxtaposition of these figures shows that we have before us types of agricultural labourers with allotments which cover part of the subsistence expenditure (and because of this reduce wages). To confuse such types of peasants with proprietors (agriculturists and industrialists) means blatantly to disregard all the requirements of scientific research.\n\nAt the other pole of the countryside we see just such proprietors as combine with independent crop farming commercial and industrial operations which yield an income that is considerable (under the given standard of living) and amounts to several hundred rubles. The utter indefiniteness of the heading \u201cpersonal industries\u201d conceals the differences between the bottom and the top groups in this respect, but the very size of the incomes from these \u201cpersonal industries\u201d reveals the extent of this difference (let us remind the reader that in the Voronezh statistics the category \u201cpersonal industries\u201d may include begging, agricultural labouring, service as steward, manager, etc., etc.).\n\nAs regards the size of net income, the horseless and one-horse peasants again stand out very sharply, with their most miserable \u201cbalances\u201d ( to  rubles) and even deficits on the money side. The resources of these peasants are no larger, if not smaller, than those of wage-workers. Only beginning with the -horse peasants do we see at least some net incomes and balances of a few dozen rubles (without which there cannot be the slightest question of proper farming). Among the well-to-do peasantry net incomes reach sums ( to  rubles) that raise them well above the general level of the Russian working class.[]\nNaturally, the combining of workers and employers in one category and the striking of an \u201caverage\u201d budget provide a picture of \u201cmoderate sufficiency\u201d and of a \u201cmoderate\u201d net income: income  rubles, expenditure  rubles, balance  rubles, including  rubles in cash. But that sort of average is absolutely fictitious. It simply conceals the utter poverty of the mass of peasants in the bottom groups (a and b, i.e.,  budgets out of ), who with their trivial incomes ( to  rubles per family gross income) are unable to make ends meet and live mainly by regular farm labouring and day labouring.\n\nAn exact calculation of income and expenditure in cash and kind enables us to determine the relation of the differentiation of the peasantry to the market, for which only cash income and expenditure are important. The proportion of the cash part of the budget to the total budget in the various groups is as follows:\n\nPercentage of cash part.\nWe see, consequently, that the percentage of the cash income and expenditure increases (expenditure with particular regularity) from the middle groups to the extreme ones. The farming is of the most sharply expressed commercial character in the case of the peasant with no horses and of the one with many. This means that both live mainly by selling commodities, except that in the one instance the commodity is labour-power, while in the other it is goods produced for sale, with (as we shall see) a considerable employment of wage-labour, i.e., a product that assumes the form of capital. In other words, these budgets also show that the differentiation of the peasantry creates a home market for capitalism by converting the peasant into a farm labourer, on the one hand, and into a small-commodity producer, a petty bourgeois, on the other.\n\nAnother, and no less important, deduction from these data, is that in all the peasant groups farming has to a very large extent become commercial, has become dependent upon the market: in no case does the cash part of income or expenditure fall below %. And this percentage must be regarded as a high one, for we are discussing the gross incomes of small agriculturists, in which even the maintenance of cattle is included, i.e., straw, bran, etc.[] Evidently, even the peasantry in the central black-earth belt (where money economy is, on the whole, more feebly developed than in the industrial belt, or in the outlying steppe regions) cannot exist at all without buying and selling and are already completely dependent on the market, on the power of money. It is needless to say how tremendously important this fact is, and how grave the error our Narodniks commit when they try to hush it up,[] being carried away by their sympathies for the natural economy which has passed out of existence never to return. In modern society it is impossible to exist without selling, and anything that retards the development of commodity production merely results in a worsening of the conditions of the producers. \u201cThe disadvantages of the capitalist mode of production,\u201d says Marx, speaking of the peasant, \u201c. . . coincide here therefore with the disadvantages occasioned by the imperfect development of the capitalist mode of production. The peasant turns merchant and industrialist without the conditions enabling him to produce his products as commodities\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , . Russ. trans., p. ).[]\n\nLet us observe that the budget data utterly refute the view, still fairly widespread, that taxes play an important part in the development of commodity production. Undoubtedly, quit-rents and taxes were at one time an important factor in the development of exchange, but at the present time commodity economy has become firmly established, and the indicated importance of taxes is becoming altogether secondary. A comparison of the expenditure on taxes and duties with the peasants\u2019 total cash expenditure shows a ratio of .% (for the respective groups it is: a\u2014.%; b\u2014.%; c\u2014.%; d\u2014.%; e\u2014.% and f\u2014.%). Hence, the maximum expenditure on taxes is one third of the remaining cash expenditure unavoidably incurred by the peasant under the present conditions of social economy. If, however, we do not take the role of taxes in the development of exchange, but take them relative to the income, we shall see that it is an excessively high one. How heavily the traditions of the pre-Reform epoch weigh down upon the peasant of today is seen most strikingly in the existence of taxes which absorb one-seventh of the gross expenditure of the small farmer, or even of the allotment-holding farm labourer. Moreover, the distribution of taxes within the village community is astonishingly uneven: the better off the peasant, the smaller the part of his total expenditure that goes in taxes. The horseless peasant pays in proportion to his income nearly three times as much as the peasant owning many horses (see above, table on distribution of expenditure). We speak of the distribution of taxes within the village community, because if we calculate the amount of taxes and duties per dessiatine of allotment land, it will be found to be nearly uniform. After all that has been stated, this unevenness should not astonish us; it is inevitable in our village community, so long as the village community retains its compulsory, feudal character. As we know, the peasants share all taxes according to land held: share of taxes and share of land merge in their minds in the one concept \u201csoul,\u201d or person.[] As we have seen, however, the differentiation of the peasantry leads to a diminution of the role of allotment land at both poles of the contemporary countryside. Naturally, under such conditions the distribution of taxes according to allotment land held (which is inseparably connected with the compulsory nature of the village community) leads to the shifting of the tax burden from the well-to-do peasants to the poor. The village community (i.e., collective responsibility[] with no right to refuse land) becomes more and more harmful to the peasant poor.[]\n\n(B) Passing to the characterisation of peasant farming, let us start by citing general data on the farms:\n\nGeneral data on peasant farming.\nFrom this table it is evident that the relationship existing between the groups in regard to the leasing out and the renting of land, size of families and area under crops, hiring of farm labourers, etc., is identical with that shown by the budget data and the above-examined mass data. But that is not all: the absolute figures on the economy of each group also prove to be very close to the data for whole uyezds. Here is a comparison of the budget and above examined data:\n\nBudgets with no and one horse.\nhousehold[]\n\nThus, the position of the horseless and one-horse peasants in all the localities indicated is almost identical, so that the budget data may be regarded as sufficiently typical.\n\nWe cite data on the property and implements of the peasant farms in the different groups.\n\nPer farm value.\nThis table graphically illustrates the difference in the extent to which the various groups are provided with implements and livestock, a point we mentioned above on the basis of the mass data. We see here the completely different degree to which the various groups hold property, this difference being such that even the horses of the poor peasant are very different from those of the affluent peasant.[] The horse of the one-horse peasant is a veritable \u201cliving fraction\u201d\u2014not a \u201cquarter of a horse,\u201d to be sure, but fully \u201ctwenty-seven fifty-seconds\u201d of a horse![] []\n\nLet us take further the data regarding the items of farm expenditure.[]\n\nComposition of farm expenditure.\nThese data are very eloquent. They strikingly reveal to us how utterly wretched is the \u201cfarm\u201d not only of the horseless but also of the one-horse peasant; and how utterly wrong is the customary method of lumping such peasants with the few but powerful peasants who spend hundreds of rubles on their farms, are in a position to improve their implements, hire \u201cworking folk,\u201d and \u201cbuy in\u201d land on a large scale, renting to the amount of ,  and  rubles a year.[] Let us note, by the way, that the relatively high expenditure of the horseless peasant on \u201clabourers and job-work\u201d is very likely to be explained by the fact that the statisticians have placed under this heading two entirely different things: the hiring of a worker who has to work with his employer\u2019s implements, i.e., the hiring of a farm labourer or day labourer; and the hiring of a neighbouring peasant who has with his own implements to cultivate the hirer\u2019s land. These types of \u201chire,\u201d diametrically opposite in significance, must be strictly distinguished from one another, as is done, for example, by V. Orlov (see Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VI, Pt. ).\n\nA page from V. I. Lenin\u2019s copy-book.\nLet us now examine the data on income from agriculture. Unfortunately, in the Returns these data are far too inadequately analysed (partly, maybe, because of their paucity). For example, the question of yield is not examined: there is no information on the sale of each particular kind of produce and on the conditions of sale. Let us therefore confine ourselves to the following brief table:\n\nIncome from agriculture.\nWhat immediately strikes one in this table is the glaring exception: the huge drop in the percentage of cash income from agriculture in the top group, despite the fact that it cultivates the biggest area. Farming on the biggest scale is thus apparently in the greatest degree natural economy. It will be extremely interesting to make a closer examination of this seeming exception, which throws light on the highly important question of the connection between agriculture and \u201cindustries\u201d of an entrepreneur character. As we have already seen, the significance of industries of this type is particularly great in the budgets of the peasants owning many horses. Judging from the data under examination, especially typical of the peasant bourgeoisie in this locality is the tendency to combine agriculture with commercial and industrial enterprises.[] It is not difficult to see, firstly, that it is wrong to compare farmers of this type with cultivators pure and simple, and, secondly, that agriculture under such circumstances very often only seems to be natural economy. When agriculture is combined with the technical processing of agricultural produce (flour milling, oil-pressing, potato-starch manufacture, distilling, etc.), the money income from such farming may be assigned to income from the industrial establishments and not from agriculture. Actually, indeed, the agriculture in this case will be commercial, not natural, economy. The same thing has to be said of the farm in which a mass of agricultural produce is consumed in kind on the maintenance of farm labourers and of horses employed on some industrial enterprise (for example, mail-carrying). And it is precisely this type of farm that we have among the top group (budget No.  in Korotoyak Uyezd. Family of  persons,  working members,  farm labourers,  horses; income from agriculture\u2014, rubles, nearly all in kind, and from industrial enterprises\u2014, rubles. And such a \u201cnatural-economy peasant farm\u201d is combined with the horseless and one-horse farms for the purpose of striking a general \u201caverage\u201d}. This example shows us once again how important it is to combine classification according to scale and type of agricultural activity with classification according to scale and type of \u201cindustrial\u201d activity.\n\n(C) Let us now examine the data on the peasants\u2019 standard of living. Expenditure on food in kind is given incompletely in the Returns. We single out the most important items: agricultural produce and meat.[]\n\nPer head of both sexes.\nThis table shows that we were right in combining the horseless and one-horse peasants and contrasting them to the rest. The distinguishing feature of the groups of peasants mentioned is insufficiency of food and its inferior quality (potatoes). The food of the one-horse peasant is in some respects even worse than that of the horseless peasant. The general \u201caverage\u201d even on this question is entirely fictitious, the insufficient nourishment of the mass of the peasants being obscured by the satisfactory nourishment of the well-off peasantry, who consume almost one and a half times as much agricultural produce and three times as much meat[] as do the poor peasants.\n\nFor the purpose of comparing the remaining data on the peasants\u2019 food, all produce must be taken at its value\u2014in rubles:\n\nPer head (rubles).\nproduce[]\n\nproduce[]\n\nThus, the general data on the peasants\u2019 food confirm what has been said above. Three groups stand out clearly: the bottom group (horseless and one-horse), the middle group (two and three-horse), and the top group, whose food is nearly twice as good as that of the bottom one. The general \u201caverage\u201d wipes out both extreme groups. Cash expenditure on food is highest, both absolutely and relatively, in the two extreme groups\u2014among the rural proletarians and the rural bourgeoisie. The former buy more, although they consume less, than the middle peasants; they buy the most essential agricultural produce, that of which they suffer a shortage. The latter buy more because they consume more, increasing particularly their consumption of non-agricultural produce. A comparison of these two extreme groups shows us clearly how a home market is created in a capitalist country for articles of personal consumption.[]\n\nThe remaining items of expenditure on personal consumption are as follows:\n\nPer head, both sexes (rubles).\nIt is not always correct to calculate this expenditure per head of both sexes, because the cost of fuel, lighting, household effects, etc., for example, is not proportionate to the number of members of the family.\n\nThese data also show the division of the peasantry (according to standard of living) into three different groups. Moreover, the following interesting peculiarity comes to light: the cash part of the expenditure on all personal consumption is highest in the bottom groups (in group a about half the expenditure is in money), whereas in the top groups the cash expenditure does not increase, amounting to only about a third. How can this be reconciled with the above noted fact that, in general, the percentage of money expenditure increases in both extreme groups? Obviously in the top groups the cash expenditure is incurred mainly on productive consumption (expenditure on the farm), whereas in the bottom groups it is on personal consumption. Here are the exact data on this:\n\nCash expenditure per farm.\nConsequently, the transformation of the peasantry into a rural proletariat creates a market mainly for articles of consumption, whereas its transformation into a rural bourgeoisie creates a market mainly for means of production. In other words, among the bottom groups of the \u201cpeasantry\u201d we observe the transformation of labour-power into a commodity, and in the top ones the transformation of means of production into capital. Both these transformations result in precisely that process of the creation of a home market which theory has established for capitalist countries in general. That is why F. Engels, writing on the famine of , said that it signified the creation of a home market for capitalism[]\u2014a proposition that is unintelligible to the Narodniks, who regard the ruin of the peasantry merely as the decay of \u201cpeople\u2019s production,\u201d and not as the transformation of patriarchal into capitalist economy.\n\nMr. N.\u2013on has written a whole book on the home market, without noticing the process of the creation of a home market by the differentiation of the peasantry. In his article \u201cHow Are We to Explain the Increase in Our State Revenues?\u201d (Novoye Slovo[New Word], , No. , February) he deals with this question in the following argument: the tables of the income of the American worker show that the lower the income, the larger is the relative expenditure on food. Consequently, with a decline in food consumption there is a still greater decline in the consumption of other products. And in Russia there is a decline in the consumption of bread and vodka; hence there is also a decline in the consumption of other products, from which it follows that the greater consumption of the well-to-do \u201cstratum\u201d (p. ) of the peasantry is more than balanced by the diminution of the consumption of the masses.\u2014This argument contains three errors: firstly, by substituting the worker for the peasant, Mr. N.\u2013on skips over the question; the point at issue is the process of the creation of workers and employers. Secondly, by substituting the worker for the peasant, Mr. N.\u2013on reduces all consumption to personal consumption and forgets about productive consumption, about the market for means of production. Thirdly, Mr. N.\u2013on forgets that the process of the differentiation of the peasantry is at the same time one of the displacement of natural by commodity economy, that, consequently, the market cannot be created by increasing consumption, but by transforming consumption in kind (even if more abundant) into cash or paying consumption (even if less abundant). We have just seen that the horseless peasants consume less, but buy more articles of personal consumption than the middle peasantry. They become poorer, but at the same time receive and spend more money,\u2014and both these sides of the process are necessary for capitalism.[]\n\nIn conclusion, let us make use of the budget figures to compare the standard of living of the peasants and the rural workers. Calculating the extent of personal consumption, not per head, but per adult working person (according to the rates of the Nizhni-Novgorod statisticians in the above mentioned compilation), we get the following table:\n\nProduce consumed per adult Working person.\nTo compare the data on the standard of living of rural workers with this, we may take, firstly, average prices of labour. For  years (-) the average pay of a farm labourer hired by the year in Voronezh Gubernia was  rubles, and including keep,  rubles,[] so that keep cost  rubles. The amount of personal consumption by allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers (horseless and one-horse peasants) is below this level. The total cost of a family\u2019s keep amounts to only  rubles in the case of the horseless \u201cpeasant\u201d (in a family of ) and  rubles in the case of the one-horse \u201cpeasant\u201d (in a family of ), i.e., less than the cost of a farm labourer\u2019s keep. (We have omitted from the budgets of the horseless and one-horse peasants farm expenditure and also taxes and duties, for in this locality the allotment is leased at not less than the amount of the taxes.) As was to be expected, the position of the labourer who is tied to his allotment is worse than that of the labourer who is free from such tie (we say nothing of the tremendous degree to which the tying of people down to allotments develops relations of bondage and personal dependence). The cash expenditure of the farm labourer is far higher than the cash expenditure on personal consumption of the one-horse and horseless peasant. Consequently, the tying of people down to allotments retards the growth of the home market.\n\nSecondly, we can make use of Zemstvo statistics on consumption by farm labourers. Let us take from the Statistical Returns for Orel Gubernia the data on Karachev Uyezd (Vol. V, Pt. , ), which are based on information concerning  cases of agricultural wage-labour.[] Converting the monthly ration into one for a year, we get the following:\n\nKeep of a farm labourer in Orel Gubernia and of a 'peasant' in Voronezh Gubernia.\nrye[]\n\nConsequently, the standard of living of the one-horse and horseless peasants is not higher than that of farm labourers, and if anything rather approximates to the minimum standard of living of the latter.\n\nThe general conclusion from our review of the data on the bottom group of the peasantry is, accordingly, the following: both in its relation to the other groups, which are ousting the bottom section of the peasantry from agriculture, in its scale of farming, which covers only part of the expenditure on maintaining the family, in its source of livelihood (sale of labour-power), and, lastly, in its standard of living, this group should be assigned to the allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers.[]\n\nIn thus concluding our exposition of the Zemstvo statistics on peasant budgets, we cannot but stop to examine the methods of treating the budget data employed by Mr. Shcherbina, the compiler of Evaluation Returns and author of the article on peasant budgets in the well-known book The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices, etc. (Vol. II).[] Mr. Shcherbina states on some point in the Returns that he is using the theory \u201cof the well-known political economist K. Marx\u201d (p. ); as a matter of fact, he positively distorts this theory, confusing the difference between constant and variable capital with the difference between fixed and circulating capital (ibid.), and quite senselessly applying these terms and categories of developed capitalism to peasant farming (passim), etc. The whole of Mr. Shcherbina\u2019s treatment of the budget figures is nothing but a gross and incredible abuse of \u201caverage magnitudes.\u201d All the evaluation returns concern the \u201caverage\u201d peasant. The income from the land computed for the  uyezds is divided by the number of farms (recall that for the horseless peasant this income is about  rubles per family, and for the rich peasant about  rubles). The \u201cmagnitude of constant capital\u201d (sic!!?) \u201cper farm\u201d (p. ), i.e., the value of the whole property, is determined; the \u201caverage\u201d value of implements, the average value of commercial and industrial establishments (sic!) is determined as  rubles per farm. Mr. Shcherbina ignores the detail that these establishments are the private property of the well-to-do minority, and divides them among all \u201cequally\u201d! The \u201caverage\u201d expenditure on the renting of land (p. ) is determined; as we have seen, it amounts to  rubles in the case of the one-horse peasant and to  to  rubles in the case of the rich peasant. All this is added together and divided by the number of farms. Even the \u201caverage\u201d expenditure on \u201crepair of capitals\u201d is determined (ibid.). The Lord alone knows what that means! If it means replenishment and repair of implements and livestock, here are the figures we have already cited: with the horseless peasant this expenditure equals  (eight) kopeks per farm, and with the rich peasant  rubles. Is it not evident that if we add such \u201cpeasant farms\u201d together and divide by the number of items added, we shall get the \u201claw of average requirements\u201d discovered by Mr. Shcherbina in the returns for Ostrogozhsk Uyezd (Vol. II, Pt. , ) and so brilliantly applied subsequently? And from such a \u201claw\u201d it will not be difficult to draw the conclusion that \u201cthe peasant satisfies not his minimum requirements, but their average level\u201d (p.  and many others), that peasant farming is a special \u201ctype of development\u201d (p. ), etc., etc. This ingenuous device of \u201cequalising\u201d the rural proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie is reinforced by the already familiar classification according to allotment. Had we applied it, for example, to the budget data, we would have combined in one group such peasants, for example (in the category of those having large allotments, with  to  dess. per family), as: one who leases half his allotment (of . dess.) sows . dess., lives mainly by means of \u201cpersonal industries\u201d (how surprisingly well this sounds!) and secures an income of  rubles for  persons of both sexes (budget No.  in Korotoyak Uyezd); and another who rents an additional . dess., sows . dess., employs farm labourers and has an income of , rubles for  persons of both sexes (budget No.  in Zadonsk Uyezd). Is it not clear that we shall get a special \u201ctype of development\u201d if we add the farms of farm labourers and day labourers to those of peasants employing workers, and divide the total by the number of items added? One has only to make regular and exclusive use of \u201caverage\u201d data on peasant farming, and all \u201cfalse ideas\u201d about the differentiation of the peasantry will be eliminated once and for all. That is exactly what Mr. Shcherbina does by adopting this method en grand[] in his article in the book The Influence of Harvests, etc. Here a huge effort is made to calculate the budgets of the whole of the Russian peasantry\u2014and all by means of the very same, tried and tested, \u201caverages.\u201d The future historian of Russian economic literature will note with astonishment that the prejudices of Narodism caused the most elementary requirements of economic statistics to be forgotten, namely, that a strict distinction be drawn between employers and wage-workers, regardless of the form of land tenure that unites them, and regardless of the multiplicity and variety of the intermediary types between them.\n\nNotes\n[] A big defect of these data is, firstly, lack of classification according to different indices; secondly, lack of text giving that information about the farms selected which could not be included in the tables (that sort of text is supplied, for example, to the data on the budgets for Ostrogozhsk Uyezd). Thirdly, extremely inadequate treatment of data on all non-agricultural occupations and all sorts of \u201cemployments\u201d (all \u201cindustries\u201d are given only  columns, whereas the description of clothing and footwear alone takes up  columns!).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cAverages\u201d of exclusively this kind are used, for example, by Mr. Shcherbina both in the publications of the Voronezh Zemstvo and in his article on peasant budgets in the book The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices, etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] This applies, for example, to the budget data for Moscow Gubernia (Returns, Vols. VI and VII), Vladimir Gubernia (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia), Ostrogozhsk Uyezd of Voronezh Gubernia (Returns, Vol. II, Part ), and particularly to the budgets cited in the Transactions of the Commission of Inquiry into Handicraft Industry[] (of Vyatka, Kherson, Nizhni-Novgorod, Perm and other gubernias). The budgets given by Messrs. Karpov and Manokhin in the Transactions and also by Mr. P. Semyonov (in Material for a Study of the Village Community, St. Petersburg, ) and by Mr. Osadchy (Shcherbani Volost, Elisavetgrad Uyezd, Kherson Gubernia) compare favourably with the others in that they describe the various groups of peasants.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The Returns separate all \u201cexpenditure on personal and farm needs other than food\u201d from expenditure on the maintenance of animals, and under the first heading, expenditures on lighting and on rent, for example, are put side by side. This is obviously wrong. We have separated personal from farm (\u201cproductive\u201d) consumption, and under the latter heading we have included expenditure on tar, rope, horse-shoeing, building repairs, implements, harness; on labourers and job workers, on herdsman, on the renting of land, and on the maintenance of animals and poultry.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The item \u201cbalances from previous years\u201d consists of grain (in kind) and cash; here the total figures are given, as we are dealing with gross expenditure and income, in cash and kind.\n\nThe four columns relating to \u201cindustries\u201d are copied from the Returns, which give no other information about the \u201cindustries.\u201d Let us observe that in group e, carting should obviously be put under the heading of industrial establishments; it furnishes two members of this group with  rubles income each, and one of them employs a farm labourer.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] An apparent exception is provided by category e with its big deficit ( rubles), which, however, is covered by a loan. This is explained by the fact that in three of the households (out of the  in this category) they celebrated weddings that cost  rubles. (The total deficit of these  households amounted to  rubles  kopeks.) As a result, this group\u2019s expenditure on personal consumption, other than food, rose to the very high figure of  rubles  kopeks per person of both sexes, whereas in no other group, not excepting the rich group (f), does this expenditure amount to even  rubles. Consequently, this deficit is quite opposite in character to that of the poor peasants. It is a deficit resulting not from inability to satisfy minimum requirements, but from increased requirements out of proportion to the income of the given year.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Expenditure on the maintenance of cattle is almost entirely in kind: of a total expenditure of ,. rubles on this item by the  households, only ,. rubles were spent in cash, and of this sum ,. rubles were spent by one farmer-entrepreneur who kept  horses, evidently for industrial use.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] This error was particularly often met with in the debates (of ) on the significance of low grain prices.[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] V.

I hope to analyse these data for the press in the near future. (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] If these budget standards of the value of buildings, implements and animals to be found in the various groups of peasants were applied to the summary data for  gubernias of European Russia that were cited above, it would be seen that one-fifth of the peasant households owns a considerably larger quantity of means of production than all the rest of the peasantry.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Expenditure on the maintenance of livestock is mostly in kind, the rest of the farm expenditure is mostly in money.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] How dear to the heart of such an \u201centerprising muzhik\u201d must be Mr. Karyshev\u2019s \u201ctheory of rent\u201d which advocates long leases, lower rents, compensation for improvements, etc. That is just what he needs.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Of the  horseless peasants not one obtains any income from industrial establishments and undertakings; of the  with one horse each, one does; of the  with two horses two do; of the  with three horses three do; of the  with four horses two do; of the  owning more than  horses four do.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Under this head we combine the following items in the Returns: beef, mutton, pork and lard. Where other cereals are calculated in terms of rye it is according to the standards in Yanson\u2019s Comparative Statistics adopted by the Nizhni-Novgorod statisticians (see Material for Gorbatov Uyezd. Basis of calculation: percentage of absorbable protein).[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The extent to which the meat consumption of the village peasants is smaller than that of town dwellers is seen from even the following fragmentary data. In Moscow in , cattle weighing about  million poods and of a total value of ,, rubles  kopeks were slaughtered in the city abattoirs (Moskovsktve Vedormosti[Moscow Recorder], , No. ). This works out per head, both sexes, at about  poods or nearly  rubles per annum. (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Beef, pork, lard, mutton, butter, dairy produce, poultry and eggs.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Salt, salted and fresh fish, herrings, vodka, beer, tea and sugar.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Of the money expenditure on agricultural produce first place goes to the purchase of rye, mainly by the poor, then the purchase of vegetables Expenditure on vegetables is valued at  kopeks per head of both sexes (ranging from  kopeks in group b to  ruble  kopeks in group e), including  kopeks in money. This interesting fact shows us that even among the rural population, not to speak or the urban, a market is created for the produce of one of the forms of commercial agriculture, namely, market gardening. Expenditure on vegetable oil is / in kind; that is to say, in this sphere domestic production and primitive handicraft still prevail.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] This fact, which at first sight seems a paradox, is actually fully in keeping with the fundamental contradictions of capitalism, which are met with at every step in real life. That is why close observers of rural life have been able to note this fact quite independently of theory. \u201cFor the development of his activities,\u201d says Engelhardt about the kulak, the huckster, etc, \u201cit is important that the peasants should be poor . . . that the peasants should receive much money\u201d (Letters from the Countryside, p. ). Engelhardt\u2019 s sympathy for a substantial (sic !!) agricultural life\u201d (ibid.) did not prevent him at times from disclosing the most profound contradictions within the celebrated village community.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Agricultural and Statistical Information Obtained from Farmers.

We do not take the data in the above-mentioned work of S. A. Korolenko (see the juxtaposition of those data in Mr. Maress\u2019s article in The Influence of Harvests, etc., I, ), for even the author himself admits that Messrs. the landowners from whom these data were obtained sometimes \u201cwere carried away\u201d... .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Computed in the manner stated above.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The Narodniks will probably draw from our comparison between the standard of living of farm labourers and that of the bottom group of the peasantry, the conclusion that we \u201cstand for\u201d dispossessing the peasantry of the land, etc. Such a conclusion will be a wrong one. All that follows from what has been said is that we \u201cstand for\u201d abolishing all restrictions on the peasants\u2019 right freely to dispose of their land, to give up their allotments, and to leave the village community. Only the peasant himself can be the judge of whether it is more advantageous to be a farm labourer with an allotment or without one. Hence such restrictions can on no account and in no way be justified.

Conclusions From Chapter II\nLet us sum up the main points that follow from the data examined above:\n\n) The social-economic situation in which the contemporary Russian peasantry find themselves is that of commodity economy. Even in the central agricultural belt (which is most backward in this respect as compared with the south eastern border regions or the industrial gubernias), the peasant is completely subordinated to the market, on which he is dependent as regards both his personal consumption and his farming, not to mention the payment of taxes.\n\n) The system of social-economic relations existing among the peasantry (agricultural and village-community) shows us the presence of all those contradictions which are inherent in every commodity economy and every order of capitalism: competition, the struggle for economic independence, the grabbing of land (purchasable and rentable), the concentration of production in the hands of a minority, the forcing of the majority into the ranks of the proletariat, their exploitation by a minority through the medium of merchant\u2019s capital and the hiring of farm labourers. There is not a single economic phenomenon among the peasantry that does not bear this contradictory form, one specifically peculiar to the capitalist system, i.e., that does not express a struggle and antagonism of interests, that does not imply advantage for some and disadvantage for others. It is the case with the renting of land, the purchase of land, and with \u201cindustries\u201d in their diametrically opposite types; it is also the case with the technical progress of farming.\n\nWe attach cardinal importance to this conclusion not only as regards capitalism in Russia, but also as regards the significance of the Narodnik doctrine in general. It is these contradictions that show us clearly and irrefutably that the system of economic relations in the \u201ccommunity\u201d village does not at all constitute a special economic form (\u201cpeople\u2019s production,\u201d etc.), but is an ordinary petty-bourgeois one. Despite the theories that have prevailed here during the past half-century, the Russian community peasantry are not antagonists of capitalism, but, on the contrary, are its deepest and most durable foundation. The deepest\u2014because it is here, remote from all \u201cartificial\u201d influences, and in spite of the institutions which restrict the development of capitalism, that we see the constant formation of the elements of capitalism within the \u201ccommunity\u201d itself. The most durable\u2014because agriculture in general, and the peasantry in particular, are weighed down most heavily by the traditions of the distant past, the traditions of patriarchal life, as a consequence of which the transformative effects of capitalism (the development of the productive forces, the changing of all social relations, etc.) manifest themselves here most slowly and gradually.[]\n\n) The sum-total of all the economic contradictions among the peasantry constitutes what we call the differentiation of the peasantry. The peasants themselves very aptly and strikingly characterise this process with the term \u201cdepeasantising.\u201d[] This process signifies the utter dissolution of the old, patriarchal peasantry and the creation of new types of rural inhabitants.\n\nBefore we proceed to describe these types, let us note the following. Reference to this process was made in our literature long ago and has been repeated very often. For example, in his day Mr. Vasilchikov, who made use of the works of the Valuyev Commission,[] noted the formation of a \u201crural proletariat\u201d in Russia and the \u201cdifferentiation of the peasant social estate\u201d (Landownership and Agriculture, st ed., Vol. I, Chapter IX). This fact was also mentioned by V. Orlov (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. IV, Pt. , p. ) and by many others. But all these references were very fragmentary. No attempt was ever made to study this phenomenon systematically, and that is why we lack, to this day, adequate information about this phenomenon notwithstanding the wealth of data provided by the Zemstvo house-to-house censuses. Connected with this is the fact that the majority of the writers who have dealt with this problem regard the break-up of the peasantry simply as the emergence of property inequality, as simple \u201cdifferentiation,\u201d to use the favourite term of the Narodniks in general and of Mr. Karyshev in particular (see his book on Rentings and his articles in Russkoye Bogatstvo). Undoubtedly, the emergence of property inequality is the starting-point of the whole process, but the process is not at all confined to property \u201cdifferentiation.\u201d The old peasantry is not only \u201cdifferentiating,\u201d it is being completely dissolved, it is ceasing to exist, it is being ousted by absolutely new types of rural inhabitants\u2014types that are the basis of a society in which commodity economy and capitalist production prevail. These types are the rural bourgeoisie (chiefly petty bourgeoisie) and the rural proletariat\u2014a class of commodity producers in agriculture and a class of agricultural wage-workers.\n\nIt is extremely instructive that the purely theoretical analysis of the process of the formation of agricultural capitalism points to the differentiation of the small producers as an important factor in this process. We have in mind one of the most interesting chapters in Vol. III of Capital, namely Chapter , \u201cGenesis of Capitalist Ground-Rent.\u201d As the starting-point of this genesis Marx takes labour-rent (Arbeitsrente)[] \u2014\u201c. . . where the direct producer, using instruments of labour (plough, cattle, etc.) which actually or legally belong to him, cultivates soil actually owned by him during part of the week, and works during the remaining days upon the estate of the feudal lord without any compensation from the feudal lord. . .\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , . Russ. trans., ). The next form of rent is rent in kind (Produktenrente), when the direct producer produces the entire product on land which he himself exploits, and gives up to the landowner the whole of the surplus product in kind. The producer here becomes more independent and is enabled to acquire by his labour a certain surplus over and above the amount of produce that satisfies his indispensable needs. \u201cSimilarly, this form\u201d of rent \u201cwill give rise to greater differences in the economic position of the individual direct producers. At least the possibility for such a differentiation exists, and the possibility for the direct producer to have in turn acquired the means to exploit other labourers directly\u201d (S. . Russ. trans., .)[] And so, while natural economy still prevails, at the very first expansion of the independence of the dependent peasants, there already appear the germs of their differentiation. But these germs can develop only under the next form of rent, money rent, which represents a mere change in the form of rent in kind. The direct producer gives up to the landowner not produce, but the price of this produce.[] The basis of this type of rent remains the same: the direct producer is as hitherto the traditional possessor of the land, but \u201cthe basis of this type of rent . . . is approaching its dissolution\u201d (). Money rent \u201cpresupposes a considerable development of commerce, of urban industry, of commodity production in general, and thereby of money circulation\u201d ().[] The traditional, common-law relationship between the dependent peasant and the landowner is transformed here into a purely cash, contract-based relationship. This leads, on the one hand, to the expropriation of the old peasantry, and, on the other, to the peasant buying out his land and his liberty. The transformation of rent in kind into money rent is furthermore not only inevitably accompanied, but even anticipated, by the formation of a class of propertyless day labourers, who hire themselves out for money. During their genesis, when this new class appears but sporadically, the custom necessarily develops among the more prosperous peasants subject to rent payments (rentepflichtigen) of exploiting agricultural wage-labourers for their own account. . . . In this way, they gradually acquire the possibility of accumulating a certain amount of wealth and themselves becoming transformed into future capitalists. The old self-employed possessors of land themselves thus give rise to a nursery school for capitalist tenants, whose development is conditioned by the general development of capitalist production beyond the bounds of the countryside\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , . Russ. trans., \u2013).[]\n\n) The differentiation of the peasantry, which develops the latter\u2019s extreme groups at the expense of the middle \u201cpeasantry,\u201d creates two new types of rural inhabitants. The feature common to both types is the commodity, money character of their economy. The first new type is the rural bourgeoisie or the well-to-do peasantry. These include the independent farmers who carry on commercial agriculture in all its varied forms (the principal ones of which we shall describe in Chapter), then come the owners of commercial and industrial establishments, the proprietors of commercial enterprises, etc. The combining of commercial agriculture with commercial and industrial enterprises is the type of \u201ccombination of agriculture with industries\u201d that is specifically peculiar to this peasantry. From among these well-to-do peasants a class of capitalist farmers is created, since the renting of land for the sale of grain plays (in the agricultural belt) an enormous part in their farms, often a more important part than the allotment. The size of the farm, in the majority of cases, requires a labour force larger than that available in the family, for which reason the formation of a body of farm labourers, and still more of day labourers, is a necessary condition for the existence of the well-to-do peasantry.[] The spare cash obtained by these peasants in the shape of net income is either directed towards commercial operations and usury, which are so excessively developed in our rural districts, or, under favourable conditions, is invested in the purchase of land, farm improvements, etc. In a word, these are small agrarians. Numerically, the peasant bourgeoisie constitute a small minority of the peasantry, probably not more than one-fifth of the total number of households (which is approximately three-tenths of the population), although, of course, the proportion fluctuates considerably according to district. But as to their weight in the sum-total of peasant farming, in the total, quantity of means of production belonging to the peasantry, in the total amount of produce raised by the peasantry, the peasant bourgeoisie are undoubtedly predominant. They are the masters of the contemporary countryside.\n\n) The other new type is the rural proletariat, the class of allotment-holding wage-workers. This covers the poor peasants, including those that are completely landless; but the most typical representative of the Russian rural proletariat is the allotment-holding farm labourer, day labourer, unskilled labourer, building worker or other allotment holding worker. Insignificant farming on a patch of land, with the farm in a state of utter ruin (particularly evidenced by the leasing out of land), inability to exist without the sale of labour-power (= \u201cindustries\u201d of the indigent peasants), an extremely low standard of living (probably lower even than that of the worker without an allotment)\u2014such are the distinguishing features of this type.[] One must assign not less than half the total peasant households (which is approximately / of the population) to membership of the rural proletariat, i.e., all the horseless and a large part of the one-horse peasants (this, of course, is only a wholesale, approximate calculation, one subject to more or less considerable modifications in the different areas, according to local conditions). The grounds which compel us to believe that such a considerable proportion of the peasantry already belong to the rural proletariat have been advanced above.[] It should be added that our literature frequently contains too stereotyped an understanding of the theoretical proposition that capitalism requires the free, landless worker. This proposition is quite correct as indicating the main trend, but capitalism penetrates into agriculture particularly slowly and in extremely varied forms. The allotment of land to the rural worker is very often to the interests of the rural employers themselves, and that is why the allotment-holding rural worker is a type to be found in all capitalist countries. The type assumes different forms in different countries: the English cottager is not the same as the small-holding peasant of France or the Rhine provinces, and the latter again is not the same as the Knecht in Prussia. Each of these bears traces of a specific agrarian system, of a specific history of agrarian relations\u2014but this does not prevent the economist from classing them all as one type of agricultural proletarian. The juridical basis of his right to his plot of land is absolutely immaterial to such a classification. Whether the land is his full property (as a small-holding peasant), or whether he is only allowed the use of it by the landlord or the Rittergutsbesitzer,[] or, finally, whether he possesses it as a member of a Great Russian peasant community\u2014makes no difference at all.[] In assigning the indigent peasants to the rural proletariat we are saying nothing new. This term has already been used repeatedly by many writers, and only the Narodnik economists persist in speaking of the peasantry in general, as of something anti-capitalist, and close their eyes to the fact that the mass of the \u201cpeasantry\u201d have already taken a quite definite place in the general system of capitalist production, namely, as agricultural and industrial wage-workers. In our country, people are very fond of singing the praises of our agrarian system, which retains the village community and the peasantry, etc., and of contrasting this to the Ostsee system, with its capitalist organisation of agriculture. It will not be without interest, therefore, to see what types of the agricultural population in the Ostsee region[] are sometimes assigned to the class of farm labourers and day labourers. The peasants in the Ostsee gubernias are divided into those with large plots ( to  dess. in separate lots), cottagers (with plots of  to  dess.) and landless peasants. As Mr. S. Korolenko quite rightly remarks, the cottager \u201cmost closely approximates to the general type of Russian peasant of the central gubernias\u201d (Hired Labour, p. ); he is everlastingly compelled to divide his time between seeking employment and cultivating his plot of land. But what is particularly interesting to us is the economic position of the farm labourers. The fact is that the landlords themselves find it advantageous to allot them land on account of wages. Here are some examples of the holdings of Ostsee farm labourers: )  dess. of land (we have converted Loftstelle into dessiatines:  Loftstelle = / dess.); the husband works  days and the wife  days a year at a wage of  kopeks per day; )  / dess. of land; \u201cthe farm labourer keeps  horse,  cows,  sheep and  pigs\u201d (pp. , ); the farm labourer works alternate weeks and the wife works  days; )  dess. of land (Bauska Uyezd, Courland Gubernia), \u201cthe farm labourer keeps  horse,  cows,  sheep and several pigs\u201d (p. ), he works  days a week and his wife  days a year; ) in Hasenpoth Uyezd, Courland Gubernia\u2014 dess. of land, \u201cin all cases the farm labourers get their flour milled gratis and free medical aid and medicine, and their children attend school\u201d (p. ), etc. We draw the reader\u2019s attention to the size of the holdings and the scale of the farming of these farm labourers, i.e., to the very conditions that, in the opinion of the Narodniks, set our peasants apart from the general European agrarian system, which corresponds to capitalist production. We combine all the examples given in the publication quoted:  farm labourers own . dess. of land, that is, an average of . dess. per labourer. The farm labourers here include peasants who work the lesser part of the year for the landlord (the husband half the year, and the wife  to  days) and also one-horse peasants who own  and even  cows each. The question arises: what constitutes the notorious difference between our \u201ccommunity peasant\u201d and the Ostsee farm labourer of this type? In the Ostsee region they call things by their proper names, whereas in Russia one-horse farm labourers are combined with wealthy peasants, \u201caverages\u201d are struck, and sentimental talk is indulged in about the \u201ccommunity spirit,\u201d the \u201clabour principle,\u201d \u201cpeople\u2019s production\u201d and the \u201ccombination of agriculture with industries\u201d... .\n\n) The intermediary link between these post-Reform types of \u201cpeasantry\u201d is the middle peasantry. It is distinguished by the least development of commodity production. The independent agricultural labour of this category of peasant covers his maintenance in perhaps only the best years and under particularly favourable conditions, and that is why his position is an extremely precarious one. In the majority of cases the middle peasant cannot make ends meet without resorting to loans, to be repaid by labour-service, etc., without seeking \u201csubsidiary\u201d employment on the side, which also consists partly in the sale of labour power, etc. Every crop failure flings masses of the middle peasants into the ranks of the proletariat. In its social relations this group fluctuates between the top group, towards which it gravitates but which only a small minority of lucky ones succeed in entering, and the bottom group, into which it is pushed by the whole course of social evolution. We have seen that the peasant bourgeoisie oust not only the bottom group, but also the middle group, of the peasantry. Thus a process specifically characteristic of capitalist economy takes place, the middle members are swept away and the extremes are reinforced\u2014the process of \u201cdepeasantising.\u201d\n\n) The differentiation of the peasantry creates a home market for capitalism. In the bottom group, this formation of a market takes place on account of articles of consumption (the market of personal consumption). The rural proletarian, by comparison with the middle peasantry, consumes less, and, moreover, consumes food of worse quality (potatoes instead of bread, etc.), but buys more. The formation and development of a peasant bourgeoisie creates a market in twofold fashion: firstly and mainly on account of means of production (the market of productive consumption), since the well-to-do peasant strives to convert into capital those means of production which he \u201cgathers\u201d from both landlords \u201cin straitened circumstances\u201d and peasants in the grip of ruin. Secondly, a market is also created here on account of personal consumption, due to the expansion of the requirements of the more affluent peasants.[]\n) On the question of whether the differentiation of the peasantry is progressing, and if so at what rate, we have no precise statistics that can be compared with the data in the combined tables (\u00a7\u00a7 I-VI). This is not surprising, for till now (as we have already remarked) no attempt whatever has been made to study even the statics of the differentiation of the peasantry systematically and to indicate the forms in which this process is taking place.[] But all the general data on the economy of our rural districts indicate an uninterrupted and rapidly increasing differentiation: on the one hand, the \u201cpeasants\u201d are abandoning and leasing out their land, the number of horseless peasants is growing, the \u201cpeasants\u201d are fleeing to the towns, etc.; on the other hand, the \u201cprogressive trends in peasant farming\u201d are also taking their course, the \u201cpeasants\u201d are buying land, improving their farms, introducing iron ploughs, developing grass cultivation, dairy farming, etc. We now know which \u201cpeasants\u201d are taking part in these two diametrically opposite sides of the process.\n\nFurthermore, the development of the migration movement is giving a tremendous impetus to the differentiation of the peasantry, and especially of the agricultural peasantry. It is well known that the migration of peasants is mainly from the agricultural gubernias (migration from the industrial gubernias is quite negligible), and precisely from the densely populated central gubernias, where there is the greatest development of labour-service (which retards the differentiation of the peasantry). That is the first point. The second point is that it is mainly the peasants in medium circumstances who are leaving the areas of emigration and mainly the extreme groups who are remaining at home. Thus, migration is accelerating the differentiation of the peasantry in the areas of emigration and is carrying the elements of differentiation to the new places (the agricultural wage-labour of settlers in Siberia in the first period of their new life.[] This connection between migration and the differentiation of the peasantry is fully proved by I. Hourwich in his superb research work, Peasant Migration to Siberia (Moscow, ). We strongly recommend to the reader this book which our Narodnik press has strenuously tried to hush up.[]\n\n) A tremendous part, as is known, is played in our rural districts by merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital. We consider it superfluous to cite numerous facts and indicate sources relating to this phenomenon: the facts are well known and do not directly concern our theme. The only question of interest to us is the following: What relation has merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital in our countryside to the differentiation of the peasantry? Is there any connection between the relations among the various groups of peasants described above and the relations between peasant creditors and peasant debtors? Is usury a factor and a motive force of differentiation, or does it retard this differentiation?\n\nLet us first indicate how theory presents this question. In the analysis of capitalist production given by the author of Capital very great significance was attached, as we know, to merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital. The main points of Marx\u2019s views on this subject are the following: ) merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital, on the one hand, and industrial capital[i.e., capital invested in production, whether agricultural or industrial, on the other, represent a single type of economic phenomenon, which is covered by the general formula: the buying of commodities in order to sell at a profit (Das Kapital, I, . Abschnitt, Chapter IV, especially pp. - of the second German edition[]). ) Merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital always historically precede the formation of industrial capital and are logically the necessary premise of its formation (Das Kapital, III, , S. -; Russ. trans., pp. -; III, , -, ; Russ. trans., pp. -, )[]; but in themselves neither merchant\u2019s capital nor usurer\u2019s capital represents a sufficient premise for the rise of industrial capital (i.e., capitalist production); they do not always break up the old mode of production and replace it by the capitalist mode of production; the formation of the latter \u201cdepends entirely upon the stage of historical development and the attendant circumstances\u201d (ibid., , ; Russ. trans., p. ).[] \u201cTo what extent they\u201d (commercial and merchant\u2019s capital) \u201cbring about a dissolution of the old mode of production depends on their solidity and internal structure. And whither this process of dissolution will lead, in other words, what new mode of production will replace the old, does not depend on commerce, but on the character of the old mode of production itself\u201d (ibid., III, , ; Russ. trans., ).[] ) The independent development of merchant\u2019s capital is inversely proportional to the degree of development of capitalist production (ibid., S. ; Russ. trans., )[]; the greater the development of merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital, the smaller the development of industrial capital (= capitalist production), and vice versa.\n\nConsequently, as applied to Russia, the question to be answered is: Is merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital being linked up with industrial capital? Are commerce and usury, in disintegrating the old mode of production, leading to its replacement by the capitalist mode of production, or by some other system?[] These are questions of fact, questions that must be answered in regard to all aspects of the national economy of Russia. As regards peasant cultivation the data reviewed above contain the reply, and an affirmative reply, to this question. The ordinary Narodnik view that the \u201ckulak\u201d and the \u201centerprising muzhik\u201d are not two forms of one and the same economic phenomenon, but totally unconnected and opposite types of phenomena, is absolutely without foundation. It is one of those Narodnik prejudices which no one has ever even attempted to prove by an analysis of precise economic data. The data indicate the contrary. Whether the peasant hires workers for the purpose of expanding production, whether he trades in land (recall the data quoted above on the large scale of land renting among the rich) or in groceries, or whether he trades in hemp, hay, cattle, etc., or money (usurer), he represents a single economic type, and his operations amount, at bottom, to one and the same economic relation. Furthermore, that in the Russian community village the role of capital is not confined to bondage and usury, that capital is also invested in production, is apparent from the fact that the well-to-do peasant puts his money into the improvement of his farm, into the purchase and renting of land, the acquisition of improved implements, the hiring of workers, etc., and not only into trading establishments and undertakings (see above). If capital in our countryside were incapable of creating anything but bondage and usury, we could not, from the data on production, establish the differentiation of the peasantry, the formation of a rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat; the whole of the peasantry would represent a fairly even type of poverty-stricken cultivators, among whom only usurers would stand out, and they only to the extent of money owned and not to the extent and organisation of agricultural production. Finally, from the above-examined data follows the important proposition that the independent development of merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital in our countryside retards the differentiation of the peasantry. The further the development of commerce proceeds, bringing the country closer to the town, eliminating the primitive village markets and undermining the monopoly of the village shopkeeper, and the more there develop forms of credit that accord with European standards, displacing the village usurer, the further and deeper must the differentiation of the peasantry proceed. The capital of the well-to-do peasants, forced out of petty trade and usury, will flow more abundantly into production, whither it is already beginning to flow.\n\n) Another important phenomenon in the economy of our countryside that retards the differentiation of the peasantry is the survivals of corv\u00e9e economy, i.e., labour-service. Labour-service is based on the payment of labour in kind, hence, on a poor development of commodity economy. Labour-service presupposes and requires the middle peasant, one who is not very affluent (otherwise he would not agree to the bondage of labour-service) but is also not a proletarian (to undertake labour-service one must have one\u2019s own implements, one must be at least in some measure a \u201csound\u201d peasant).\n\nWhen we said above that the peasant bourgeoisie are the masters of the contemporary countryside, we disregarded the factors retarding differentiation: bondage, usury, labour-service, etc. Actually, the real masters of the contemporary countryside are often enough not the representatives of the peasant bourgeoisie, but the village usurers and the neighbouring landowners. It is, however, quite legitimate to disregard them, for otherwise it is impossible to study the internal system of economic relationships among the peasantry. It is interesting to note that the Narodnik also employs this procedure, only he stops half-way and does not carry his reasoning to its logical conclusion. Speaking of the burden of taxes, etc., in The Destiny of Capitalism, Mr. V. V. observes that due to these reasons \u201cthe conditions for a natural (sic!) life no longer exist\u201d () for the village community, for the \u201cmir\u201d. Excellent! But the whole question is precisely: what are these \u201cnatural conditions\u201d that do not yet exist in our countryside? To obtain a reply to this question one must study the system of economic relationships within the village community, lifting away, if one may so express it, the survivals of pre-Reform times which obscure these \u201cnatural conditions\u201d of life in our countryside. Had Mr. V. V. done this, he would have seen that this system of village relationships reveals the absolute differentiation of the peasantry, that the more completely bondage, usury, labour-service, etc., are forced out, the more profoundly will the differentiation of the peasantry proceed.[] Above we have shown, on the basis of Zemstvo statistics, that this differentiation is already an accomplished fact, that the peasantry have completely split up into opposite groups.\n\nNotes\n[] Cf. Das Kapital, I, S. .[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Agricultural Survey of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia for .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In the Russian translation (p.  and foll.) this term is given as \u201ctrudovaya renta\u201d (\u201ctrudovaya\u201d is the adjectival form of \u201ctrud\u201d\u2014labour. \u2014Ed.). We think that our translation (\u201cotrabotochnaya renta\u201d\u2014from \u201cotrabotat,\u201d to work off, to pay off by labour. \u2014Ed.) is more correct, for the Russian language contains the specific term \u201cotrabotki\u201d (labour-service) which means precisely the work of the dependent peasant for the landowner.[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] A strict distinction must be drawn between money rent and capitalist ground-rent the latter presupposes the existences in agriculture of capitalists and wage-workers; the former the existence of dependent peasants. Capitalist rent is that part of surplus-value which remains after the deduction of the employer\u2019s profit, whereas money rent is the price of the entire surplus product paid by the peasant to the landowner. An example of money rent in Russia is the quit-rent paid by the peasant to the landlord. Undoubtedly, the taxes which our peasants now have to pay represent, in part, money rent. Sometimes peasant renting of land also approximates to the paying of money rent; that is when the high rent the peasant has to pay for the land leaves him no more than a meagre wage.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us note that the employment of wage-labour is not an essential feature of the concept \u201cpetty bourgeoisie.\u201d This concept covers all independent production for the market, where the social system of economy contains the contradictions described by us above (Sec. ), particularly where the mass of producers are transformed into wage-workers.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] To prove that it is correct to assign the indigent peasants to the class of allotment-holding wage-workers, one must show not only how, and what sort of, peasants sell labour-power, but also how and what sort of, employers buy labour-power. This will be shown in subsequent chapters.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Prof. Conrad considers the criterion for the real peasant in Germany to be ownership of a pair of draught animals (Gespann bauernguter), see Landownership and Agriculture (Moscow,  pp. -). For Russia the criterion should rather be put higher. In defining the concept \u201cpeasant,\u201d what Conrad takes is the percentage of persons or households engaged in \u201chired labour\u201d or \u201csubsidiary industries\u201d generally (ibid.),\u2014Prof Stebut, who cannot be denied authority on questions of fact, wrote in : \u201cSince the fall of serfdom, the peasant with his small economic unit, engaged exclusively in growing grain, that is to say, principally in the central black-earth belt of Russia, has in the majority of cases become an artisan, a farm labourer or a day labourer, for whom agriculture is only a subsidiary occupation\u201d (\u201cArticles on Russian Agriculture, Its Defects and the Measures for Its Improvement,\u201d Moscow, , p. ) Evidently the artisans here also include wage-workers in industry (building, etc.) However incorrect this use of terms, it is very widespread in our literature, even in specifically economic literature.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Lord of the manor.\u2014Ed.\n\n[] Let us quote examples of the various European forms of wage-labour in agriculture from the Handw\\\"ort der Staatswiss. (Land ownership and Agriculture, Moscow, ). \u201cThe peasants\u2019 holding,\u201d says J. Conrad, \u201cmust be distinguished from the parcel, from the patch of the \u2018 landless peasant\u2019 or the \u2018 market gardener,\u2019 the owner of which is obliged to seek additionally outside occupation and employment\u201d (pp. -). \u201cIn France, according to the  census,  million persons, i.e., somewhat less than half the population, obtained their livelihood in agriculture about  million owners of land,  million tenant farmers and half-croppers,  million day labourers and owners of small plots, or tenants obtaining their livelihood mainly by wage-labour. . . . It is assumed that at least % of the agricultural labourers in France have their own land\u201d (p. , Goltz). In Germany, the rural workers include the following categories who possess land: ) cottars, cottagers, gardeners[something like our gift-land peasants]; ) contract day labourers; they possess land, and hire themselves out for a definite part of the year[cf. our \u201cthree-dayers\u201d]. [] \u201cContract day labourers constitute the bulk of the agricultural labourers in those parts of Germany where big landed property predominates\u201d (p. ); ) agricultural labourers who do their farming on rented land (p. ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Only this fact that a home market is created by the differentiation of the peasantry can explain, for example, the enormous growth of the home market for cotton goods, the manufacture of which has grown so rapidly in the post-Reform period along with the wholesale ruin of the peasantry. Mr. N.\u2013on, who illustrates his theories about the home market with this very example of our textile industry, was totally unable to explain the existence of this contradictory phenomenon.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The sole exception is I. Hourwich\u2019s splendid work The Economics of the Russian Village, New York, . Russ. trans. <<[Transcriber\u2019s Note : Here the title is given in Russian characters.\u2014 ]>> Moscow, . One must marvel at the skill with which Mr. Hourwich processed the Zemstvo statistical returns, which furnish no combined tables of groups of peasants according to economic strength.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Restriction of migration thus has an enormously retarding effect upon the differentiation of the peasantry.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See also Mr. Preemak\u2019s Material in Figures for a Study of Migration to Siberia. (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr V. V. touched upon this question on the very first page of The Destiny of Capitalism, but neither in this nor in any other of his works did he attempt to examine the facts about the relation between merchant\u2019s and industrial capital in Russia. Mr. N.\u2013on, although claiming to be a faithful follower of Marx\u2019s theory, preferred, however, to replace the precise and clear category \u201cmerchant\u2019s capital\u201d by the vague and diffuse term of his own coinage\u2014\u201dcapitalisation\u201d or \u201cthe capitalisation of income\u201d; and under cover of this hazy term successfully evaded, positively evaded, this question. The predecessor of capitalist production in Russia, according to him, is not merchant\u2019s capital, but . . . \u201cpeople\u2019s production.\u201d[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Incidentally. In speaking of Mr. V. V.\u2019s The Destiny of Capitalism, and particularly of Chapter VI, from which the annotation is taken, one cannot but indicate that it contains very good and quite fair pages. These are the pages where the author does not deal with the \u201cdestiny of capitalism\u201d and not even with capitalism at all, but with the methods of exacting taxes. It is characteristic that Mr. V. V. does not notice the inseparable connection between these methods and the survivals of corv\u00e9e economy, which latter (as we shall see below) he is capable of idealising!\u2014Lenin\n\n Chapter IV. The Growth of Commercial Agriculture\nHaving examined the internal economic structure of peasant and landlord economy, we must now take up the question of the changes in agricultural production and ask: do these changes express a growth of capitalism and of the home market?\n\nI. General Data on Agricultural Production in Post-Reform Russia and on The Types of Commercial Agriculture\nLet us glance first of all at the general statistics on grain production in European Russia. The considerable harvest fluctuations render the data for individual periods or for individual years quite useless.[] It is necessary to take different periods and the data for a whole number of years. We have at our disposal the following data: for the period of the s, the data for - (Military Statistical Abstract, IV, St. Petersburg, , data of gubernatorial reports). For the s, the returns of the Department of Agriculture for the entire decade (Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry, Vol. I, St. Petersburg, ). And lastly, for the s, we have data for the five years of - (Statistics of the Russian Empire, IV); this five-year period can represent the whole of the eighties, since the average harvest for the ten years, -, is even somewhat higher than for the five years - (see Agriculture and Forestry in Russia, published for the Chicago Exhibition, pp.  and ). Further, in order to judge of the trend of evolution in the s we take the data for the decade - (Productive Forces, I, ). Lastly, the data for  (Yearbook of Russia, ) are quite adequate for a judgement of the present time. The  harvest was only a little lower than the average for the five years -.\n\nLet us compare all these data.[]\n\nHarvest for fifty gubernias of European Russia.\nRussia[]\n\nWe see from this that until the s the post-Reform era is characterised by an undoubted increase in the production both of cereals and potatoes. The productivity of agricultural labour rises: firstly, the size of the net yield grows faster than that of the sown area (with occasional exceptions); secondly, we must bear in mind that the proportion of the population engaged in agricultural production steadily diminished during this period owing to the diversion of the population from agriculture to commerce and industry, and also owing to the migration of peasants beyond the bounds of European Russia.[] What is particularly noteworthy is the fact that it is commercial agriculture that is growing: there is an increase in the amount of grain gathered (after subtracting seed) per head of the population, while among this population there is an ever-growing division of social labour; there is an increase in the commercial and industrial population; the agricultural population splits up into rural entrepreneurs and a rural proletariat; there is an extension of specialisation in agriculture itself, so that the amount of grain produced for sale grows far more rapidly than the total amount of grain produced in the country. The capitalist character of the process is strikingly illustrated by the increased share of potatoes in the total agricultural production.[] The increase in the area under potatoes signifies, on the one hand, an improvement in agricultural technique (the introduction of root-crops) and increased technical processing of agricultural produce (distilling and the manufacture of potato starch). On the other hand, it is, from the viewpoint of the rural entrepreneur class, the production of relative surplus-value (cheapening of the cost of maintaining labour-power, deterioration of the people\u2019s nourishment). The data for the decade - show further that the crisis of -, which tremendously intensified the expropriation of the peasantry, led to a considerable reduction in the output of cereals and to a reduction in the yield of all crops; but the process of the displacement of cereals by potatoes continued with such force that the per-capita output of potatoes increased, not withstanding the reduced yield. Finally, the last five years (-) also show an increase in agricultural production, an increase in the productivity of agricultural labour and a worsening of the conditions of the working-class (increase in the part played by potatoes).\n\nAs we have noted above, the growth of commercial agriculture manifests itself in the specialisation of agriculture. Mass-scale and gross data on the production of all crops can give (and then not always) only the most general indications of this process, since the specific features of the different areas thereby disappear. Yet it is precisely the segregation of the different agricultural areas that is one of the most characteristic features of post-Reform agriculture in Russia. Thus, the Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry (Vol. I, St. Petersburg, ), quoted by us, enumerates the following agricultural areas: the flax area, \u201cthe region where stock farming predominates,\u201d and where, in particular, \u201cdairy farming is considerably developed\u201d; the region where grain crops predominate, particularly the three-field area and the area with the improved fallow or multi-field grass system (part of the steppe belt, which \u201cis characterised by the production of the most valuable, so-called elite grains, mainly intended for the foreign market\u201d); the beet area, and the area in which potatoes are cultivated for distilling purposes. \u201cThe economic areas indicated have arisen in European Russia comparatively recently, and with every passing year continue increasingly to develop and become more segregated\u201d (loc. cit., p. ).[] Our task should now be, consequently, to study this process of the specialisation of agriculture, and we should ascertain whether a growth of commercial agriculture is to be observed in its various forms, whether capitalist agriculture comes into existence in the process, and whether agricultural capitalism bears the features we indicated above in analysing the general data on peasant and landlord farming. It goes without saying that for our purposes it will be sufficient if we confine ourselves to describing the principal areas of commercial agriculture.\n\nBut before examining the data for the separate areas, let us note the following: the Narodnik economists, as we have seen, do all they can to evade the fact that the characteristic feature of the post-Reform period is the growth of commercial agriculture. Naturally, in doing so they also ignore the circumstance that the drop in grain prices is bound to stimulate the specialisation of agriculture and the drawing of agricultural produce into the sphere of exchange. Here is an instance. The authors of the well-known book The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices all proceed from the postulate that the price of grain is of no importance to natural economy, and they repeat this \u201ctruism\u201d endlessly. One of them, Mr. Kablukov, has observed, however, that under the general conditions of commodity production this postulate is substantially wrong. \u201cIt is possible, of course,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat the grain placed on the market has cost less to produce than that grown on the consumer\u2019s farm, in which case it would appear to be in the interest also of the consuming farm to change from cultivating cereals to other crops\u201d (or to other occupations, we would add), \u201cand, consequently, for it too the market price of grain assumes importance as soon as it fails to coincide with its cost of production\u201d (I, , note, author\u2019s italics). \u201cBut we cannot take that into account,\u201d he says peremptorily. Why is that? Because, it seems: ) a change-over to other crops is possible \u201conly where certain conditions exist.\u201d By means of this empty truism (everything on earth is possible only under certain conditions!) Mr. Kablukov calmly evades the fact that the post-Reform period in Russia has created, and continues to create, the very conditions that call for the specialisation of agriculture and the diversion of the population from agriculture. . . . ) Because \u201cin our climate it is impossible to find a crop equal to cereals in food value\u201d. The argument is highly original, expressing a mere evasion of the issue. What has the food value of other crops to do with the matter, if we are dealing with the sale of these other crops and the purchase of cheap grain? . . . ) Because \u201cgrain farms of the consuming type always have a rational basis for their existence.\u201d In other words, because Mr. Kablukov \u201cand colleagues\u201d regard natural economy as \u201crational.\u201d The argument, as you see, is irrefutable. . . .\n\nNotes\n[] If only for this reason, Mr. N.\u2013on is absolutely wrong in drawing the boldest conclusions from the returns for  years of one decade (-)!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For the period - we have taken the population of ; the increase is taken at .%. The difference between the data of the gubernatorial reports and those of the Department of Agriculture is, as we know, inconsiderable. The figures for  have been arrived at by converting poods into chetverts (about six bushels each.\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. N.\u2013on is quite wrong when he asserts that \u201cthere are no grounds whatever for assuming a decline in their number\u201d (the number of persons engaged in agricultural production), \u201cquite the contrary\u201d (Sketches, , note). See Chapter VIII, \u00a7 II.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The net per-capita potato crop increased between - and - in all areas of European Russia without exception. Between - and - the increase took place in  areas out of  (the Baltic, Western, Industrial, North-Western, Northern, Southern, Steppe, Lower- and Transvolga areas).\n\nCf. Agricultural Statistical Information Based on Material Obtained from Farmers, Vol. VII, St. Petersburg,  (published by Ministry of Agriculture).[] In , in the  gubernias of European Russia, the area under potatoes was , dess. in \u2014,, dess. and in \u2014,, dess, i.e., an increase during the  years of % . Taking the potato crop in  as , we get the following figures for the later years: \u2014; \u2014; \u2014; \u2014.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. also Agriculture and Forestry in Russia, pp. -; here a tobacco area is added. The maps drawn by Messrs. D. Semyonov and A. Fortunatov show the areas according to the particular crops predominating in them; for example the rye, oat and flax area, Pskov and Yaroslavl gubernias; the rye, oat and potato area, Grodno and Moscow gubernias, and so on.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In the first edition () of The Development of Capitalism in Russia the table was given as follows:\n\nTable from first edition (). Continuation of table on page .\n[] Lenin\u2019s notes on this publication and his preliminary calculations are published in Lenin Miscellany XXXIII, pp. -.\n\nII. The Commercial Grain-Farming Area\nThis area covers the outer region in the south and the east of European Russia, the steppe gubernias of Novorossia and the Transvolga. Agriculture is distinguished here for its extensive character and the enormous scale of the production of grain for sale. If we take the eight gubernias of Kherson, Bessarabia, Taurida, Don, Ekaterinoslav, Saratov, Samara and Orenburg, we shall find that in - the net crop of cereals (not including oats) for a population of ,, amounted to . million chetverts, i.e., more than one-fourth of the total net yield of the  gubernias of European Russia. The crop most commonly sown here is wheat\u2014the principal export grain.[] Agriculture develops here fastest of all (by comparison with the other areas of Russia), and these gubernias relegate the central black-earth gubernias, formerly in the lead, to the background:\n\nNet per-capita cereal crop.\nperiods[]\n\nThus there is a shifting of the principal centre of grain production: in the s and s the central black-earth gubernias were ahead of all the rest, but in the s they yielded priority to the steppe and Lower Volga gubernias: their production of grain began to diminish.\n\nThis interesting fact of the enormous growth of agricultural production in the area described is to be explained by the circumstance that in the post-Reform period the outer steppe regions have been colonies of the central, long-settled part of European Russia. The abundance of free land has attracted an enormous stream of settlers, who have quickly increased the area under crops.[] The extensive development of commercial crops was possible only because of the close economic ties of these colonies with central Russia, on the one hand, and the European grain importing countries, on the other. The development of industry in central Russia and the development of commercial farming in the outer regions are inseparably connected and create a market for each other. The industrial gubernias received grain from the South, selling there the products of their factories and supplying the colonies with labour, artisans (see Chapter V, \u00a7 III on the migration of small industrialists to the outer regions), and means of production (timber, building materials, tools, etc.). Only because of this social division of labour could the settlers in the steppe localities engage exclusively in agriculture and sell huge quantities of grain in the home and particularly in the foreign market. Only because of their close connection with the home and foreign markets could the economic development of these localities proceed so rapidly; and it was precisely capitalist development, for along with the growth of commercial farming there was an equally rapid process of the diversion of the population into industry, the process of the growth of towns and of the formation of new centres of large-scale industry (see below, Chapters VII and VIII).[]\nAs to the question of whether the growth of commercial farming in this area is bound up with technical progress in agriculture and with the creation of capitalist relations, that has been dealt with above. In Chapter II we saw how large the areas cultivated by peasants in these localities are and how sharply capitalist relations manifest themselves there even within the village community. In the preceding chapter we saw that in this area there has been a particularly rapid development in the use of machinery, that the capitalist farms in the outer regions attract hundreds of thousands and millions of wage-workers, with huge farms created on a scale unprecedented in agriculture, on which there is extensive co-operation of wage-workers, etc. We have little left now to add in completion of this picture.\n\nIn the outer steppe regions the privately-owned estates are not only distinguished occasionally for their enormous size, but are also the scene of farming on a very big scale. Above we made reference to crop areas of ,  and  thousand dessiatines in Samara Gubernia. In Taurida Gubernia, Falz-Fein owns , dess., Mordvinov , dess.; two individuals own , dess. each, \u201cand many proprietors have from , to , dessiatines\u201d (Shakhovskoi, ). An idea of the scale of farming can be obtained, for example, from the fact that in  there were , machines (of which , belonged to the peasantry) haymaking for Falz-Fein. In Kherson Gubernia there were . million dessiatines under cultivation in , of which . million dess. belonged to private owners; in five uyezds of the gubernia (without Odessa Uyezd) there were , medium-sized farms ( to , dess. of land),  big farms(, to , dess.) and  farms each of over , dess. According to data gathered in  on  farms, they employed , workers, i.e., an average of  workers per farm, of whom from  to  were annual labourers. In ,  more or less big farms in Elisavetgrad Uyezd employed , workers (an average of  per farm!), of whom .% were annual, .% seasonal, and .% day labourers.[] Here are data on the distribution of crop area among all the agricultural undertakings in the uyezd, both of private landowners and of peasants.[]\n\nApproximate area under crop.\nThus, a little over  per cent of the peasants (and if we count only those who cultivated,  per cent) concentrate in their hands more than a third of the total area under crops, for the tilling and harvesting of which masses of seasonal and day labourers are required.\n\nLastly, here are the data for Novouzensk Uyezd, Samara Gubernia. In Chapter II we took only Russian peasants farming community allotments; now we add Germans and farmstead peasants (those farming non-community holdings). Unfortunately no data are available for the farms of private landowners.[]\n\nFarm data.\nThere is no need, apparently, to comment on these data. We have had occasion to observe that the area described is the most typical of agricultural capitalism in Russia\u2014typical not in the agricultural sense, of course, but in the social-economic sense. These colonies, having developed with the greatest freedom, show us what relations could and should have developed in the rest of Russia, had not the numerous survivals of pre-Reform life retarded the development of capitalism. The forms, however, of agricultural capitalism, as will be seen from what follows, are extremely varied.\n\nNotes\n[] Except for Saratov Gubernia, with .% under wheat, in the rest of the gubernias mentioned we find .% to .% under wheat.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Sources given above. Areas of gubernias according to Historico-Statistical Survey. The \u201cLower Volga and Transvolga\u201d area is badly constituted, for to the steppe gubernias, with their enormous production of grain, have been added that of Astrakhan (lacking grain for its food requirements) and of Kazan and of Simbirsk, which should more appropriately be included in the central black-earth belt.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See Mr. V. Mikhailovsky\u2019s material (Novoye Slovo, [New Word ], June ) on the enormous increase in the population of the outer regions and on the migration to these parts, from  to , of hundreds of thousands of peasants from the interior gubernias. On the increase in the area under crops, see the above-mentioned work by V. Postnikov, the Zemstvo statistical returns for Samara Gubernia; Grigoryev\u2019s Peasant Migration from Ryazan Gubernia. On Ufa Gubernia, see Remezov\u2019s Sketches of the Life of Wild Bashkiria\u2014a vivid description of how the \u201ccolonisers\u201d felled timber for shipbuilding and transformed the fields \u201ccleared\u201d of \u201cwild\u201d Bashkirs into \u201cwheat factories.\u201d This is a sample of colonial policy that bears comparison with any of the Germans\u2019 exploits in a place like Africa.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. Marx, Das Kapital, III, , ,\u2014one of the basic features of the capitalist colony is abundance of free land easily accessible to settlers (the Russian translation of this passage, p., is quite wrong).[] Also see III, , . Russ. trans., p. ,\u2014the enormous grain surplus in the agricultural colonies is to be explained by the fact that their entire population is at first \u201calmost exclusively engaged in farming, and particularly in producing agricultural mass products,\u201d which are exchanged for industrial products \u201cThey [the colonial states] receive through the world market finished products . . . which they would have to produce themselves under other circumstances.\u201d[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Tezyakov, loc. cit.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Material for Evaluating the Lands of Kherson Gubernia, Vol. II, Kherson . The number of dessiatines cultivated by each group was determined by multiplying the average area under crops by the number of farms. The number of groups has been reduced.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Returns for Novouzensk Uyezd.\u2014All rented land, state, privately-owned and allotment, has been taken. Here is a list of the improved implements owned by the Russian farmstead peasants:  iron ploughs,  steam threshers,  horse-threshers,  mowers  horse-drawn rakes,  winnowers and  reaping machines. The number of employed workers did not include day labourers.\u2014Lenin\n\nIII. The Commercial Stock-Farming Area. General Data on the Development of Dairy Farming\nWe now pass to another very important area of agricultural capitalism in Russia, namely, the region in which not cereal, but livestock produce is of predominant significance. This region embraces, apart from the Baltic and the western gubernias, the northern, the industrial and parts of some of the central gubernias (Ryazan, Orel, Tula, and Nizhni Novgorod). Here animals are kept for dairy produce, and the whole character of agriculture is adapted to obtaining as large a quantity as possible of the more valuable market produce of this sort.[] \u201cBefore our very eyes a marked transition is taking place from stock farming for manure to stock farming for dairy produce; it has been particularly notice able during the past ten years\u201d (work quoted in previous footnote, ibid.). It is very difficult by the use of statistics to describe the various regions of Russia in this respect, because it is not the total number of horned cattle that is here important, but the number of dairy cattle and their quality. If we take the total number of animals per hundred inhabitants, we shall find that it is biggest in the outer steppe regions of Russia and smallest in the non-black-earth belt (Agriculture and Forestry, ); we shall find that as time goes on the number diminishes (Productive Forces, III, . Cf. Historico-Statistical Survey, I). Hence, we observe here what Roscher noted in his day, namely, that the number of animals per unit of the population is largest in districts of \u201cextensive livestock farming\u201d (W. Roscher, Nationaloekonomik des Ackerbaues. -te Aufl., Stuttg., , S. \u2013[]). We, however, are interested in intensive livestock farming, and in dairy farming in particular. We are compelled, therefore, to confine ourselves to the approximate computation made by the authors of the above-mentioned, Sketch, without claiming to make an exact estimate of the phenomenon; such a computation clearly illustrates the relative positions of the various regions of Russia as to degree of dairy-farm development. We quote this computation in extenso, supplementing it with some averages arrived at and data on the cheese-making industry in  according to \u201cfactory\u201d statistics.\n\nDairy-farming development.\nThis table clearly illustrates (though the data are very obsolete) the emergence of special dairy-farming areas, the development there of commercial farming (the sale of milk and milk-processing) and the increase in the productivity of dairy cattle.\n\nTo judge the development of dairy farming, we can only make use of data on butter production and cheese making. This industry arose in Russia at the very end of the th century (); cheese making on landlords\u2019 estates began to develop in the th century, but suffered a severe crisis in the s, which opened the period of cheese making by peasants and merchants.\n\nThe number of cheese-making establishments in the  gubernias of European Russia was as follows:[]\n\nCheese-making establishments.\nThus, in  years production increased more than ten-fold; only the dynamics of the phenomenon may be judged from these data, which are extremely incomplete. Let us quote some more detailed material. In Vologda Gubernia an improvement in dairy farming began, properly speaking, in , when the Yaroslavl-Vologda railway was opened; since then \u201cfarmers have begun to see to the improvement of their herds, to introduce grass cultivation, to acquire improved implements . . . and have tried to place dairy farming on a purely commercial basis\u201d (Statistical Sketch, ). In Yaroslavl Gubernia \u201cthe ground was prepared\u201d by the so-called \u201ccheese-making artels\u201d of the s, and \u201ccheese making continues to develop on the basis of private enterprise, merely retaining the title of \u2018artel\u2019\u201d (); cheese making \u201cartels\u201d figure\u2014may we add\u2014in the Directory of Factories and Works as establishments employing wage-workers. Instead of , rubles, the authors of the Sketch estimate the output of cheese and butter, according to official returns, at , rubles (computed from figures scattered throughout the book); correction of the figure brings the value of the output of fresh butter and cheese to ,, rubles, and if we add clarified butter and soft cheese, to ,, rubles, not counting either the Baltic or the western gubernias.\n\nFor the later period let us quote the following opinions from the above-cited publication of the Department of Agriculture Hired Labour, etc. Concerning the industrial gubernias in general we read: \u201cA complete revolution in the position of the farms in this area has been brought about by the development of dairy farming\u201d; it \u201cindirectly has also helped to bring about an improvement in agriculture\u201d; \u201cdairy farming in the area is developing with every year\u201d (). In Tver Gubernia \u201cthere is to be observed the tendency both among private landowners and peasants to improve the methods of maintaining cattle\u201d; the income from stock farming is estimated at  million rubles (). In Yaroslavl Gubernia \u201cdairy farming . . . is developing with every year. . . . Cheese and butter making have even begun to assume something of an industrial character . . . milk . . . is bought up from neighbours and even from peasants. One comes across cheese factories run by a whole company of owners\u201d (). \u201cThe general trend of private-landowner farming here,\u201d writes a correspondent from Danilov Uyezd, Yaroslavl Gubernia, \u201cis marked at the present time by the following: ) the transition from three-field to five- and seven-field crop rotation, with the sowing of herbage in the fields; ) the ploughing up of disused lands; ) the introduction of dairy farming, and as a consequence, the stricter selection of cattle and an improvement in their maintenance\u201d (). The same thing is said of Smolensk Gubernia, where the value of the output of cheese and butter amounted to , rubles in \u2014according to a report of the Governor (according to statistical returns, , rubles in ). The development of dairy farming is noted in the Kaluga, Kovno, Nizhni-Novgorod, Pskov, Esthland and Vologda gubernias. The value of the output of butter and cheese in the last-mentioned gubernia was estimated at , rubles according to statistics for , to , rubles according to the Governor\u2019s report, and to , rubles according to local returns for , which gave a total of  factories. \u201cThat is what the statistics say. Actually, however, there are far more factories, since, according to investigations by the Vologda Zemstvo Board, there are  factories in Vologda Uyezd alone.\u201d Production is developed in three uyezds, and has partly penetrated a fourth.[] One can judge from this how many times the above quoted figures need to be multiplied in order to approach the real situation. The plain view of an expert that at the present time the number of butter and cheese-making establishments \u201camounts to several thousand\u201d (Agriculture and Forestry in Russia, ), gives a truer picture of the facts than the allegedly exact figure of .\n\nThus the data leave not the slightest doubt about the enormous development of this special type of commercial farming. The growth of capitalism was accompanied here too by the transformation of routine technique. \u201cIn the sphere of cheese making,\u201d we read, for example, in Agriculture and Forestry, \u201cmore has been done in Russia during the last  years than perhaps in any other country\u201d (). Mr. Blazhin says the same thing in his article \u201cTechnical Progress in Dairy Farming\u201d (Productive Forces, III, -). The principal change is that the \u201cage-old\u201d method of leaving cream to settle has been replaced by the system of separating cream in centrifugal machines (separators).[] The machine has enabled the work to be carried on irrespective of atmospheric temperature, increased the butter yield from milk by %, improved the quality of the product, reduced the cost of butter production (the machine requires less labour, space, and ice, as well as fewer utensils), and has led to the concentration of production. Large peasant butteries have grown up, handling \u201cas much as  poods of milk a day, which was physically impossible . . . when the milk was left to settle\u201d (ibid.). Improvements are being made in the instruments of production (permanent boilers, screw presses, improved cellars), and production is being assisted by bacteriology, which is providing pure cultures of the type of lactic-acid bacilli needed for fermenting cream.\n\nThus, in the two areas of commercial farming we have described, the technical improvements called into being by the requirements of the market were effected primarily in those operations that were easiest to change and are particularly important for the market: reaping, threshing and winnowing in commercial grain farming, and the technical processing of animal produce in the area of commercial stock farming. As to the keeping of cattle, capital finds it more profitable for the time being to leave that to the small producer: let him \u201cdiligently\u201d and \u201cindustriously\u201d tend \u201chis\u201d cattle (and charm Mr. V. V. with his diligence\u2014see Progressive Trends, p. ), let him bear the brunt of the hardest and roughest work of tending the milk-yielding machine. Capital possesses the latest improvements and methods not only of separating the cream from the milk, but also of separating the \u201ccream\u201d from this \u201cdiligence\u201d, of separating the milk from the children of the peasant poor.\n\nNotes\n[] In other parts of Russia stock farming is of a different kind. For example, in the extreme South and South-East, the most extensive form of stock farming has become established, namely, cattle-fattening for beef. Further north, horned cattle are used as draught animals. Lastly, in the central black-earth belt cattle are used as \u201cmanure-making machines.\u201d V. Kovalevsky and I. Levitsky, Statistical Sketch of Dairy Farming in the Northern and Central Belts of European Russia (St. Petersburg, ). The authors of this work, like the majority of agricultural experts, display very little interest in the social-economic aspect of the matter or understanding of this aspect It is quite wrong, for example, to draw from the fact of farms becoming more profitable the direct conclusion that they ensure \u201cthe people\u2019s well-being and nutriment\u201d (p. ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] W. Roscher, Economics of Agriculture, th edition, Stuttgart , pp. -.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Data from Military Statistical Abstract and Mr. Orlov\u2019s Directory (st and rd eds.). Concerning these sources, see Chapter VII. Let us merely observe that the figures quoted minimise the actual rapidity of development, since the term \u201cfactory\u201d or \u201cworks\u201d was employed in a narrower sense in  than in ; and in  in a still narrower sense than in . The rd ed of the Directory contains information on the date of establishment of  factories; it appears that only  were established before ,  in the s,  in the s and  in . This speaks of a rapid increase in production. As for the latest List of Factories and Works (St. Petersburg, ), utter chaos reigns there: cheese making is registered for two or three gubernias and for the rest omitted altogether.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Nedelya [Week ], , No. . Dairy farming is so profitable that urban traders have rushed into the business and, incidentally, have introduced such methods as the settlement of accounts in goods. One local landowner, who has a large factory, organised an artel \u201cwith prompt cash payment for milk\u201d in order to release the peasants from bondage to buyers-up and to \u201ccapture new markets.\u201d A characteristic example, showing the real significance of artels and of the celebrated \u201corganisation of sales,\u201d namely, \u201cemancipation\u201d from merchant\u2019s capital through the development of industrial capital.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Until  there were hardly any separators in Russia. From  onward they spread so rapidly as to displace the old method utterly. In the s even butter-extractor separators appeared.\u2014Lenin\n\nIV. Continuation. The Economy of Landlord Farming in the Area Described\nWe have cited the evidence of agronomists and farmers to the effect that dairy farming on the landlord estates leads to the rationalisation of agriculture. Let us add here that the analysis of the Zemstvo statistics on this question made by Mr. Raspopin[] fully confirms this conclusion. We refer the reader to Mr. Raspopin\u2019s article for detailed data and give here only his main conclusion. \u201cThe interdependence of the condition of stock raising and dairy farming, on the one hand, and the number of dilapidated estates and the intensity of farming, on the other, is beyond question. The uyezds (of Moscow Gubernia) where dairy cattle raising, dairy farming, is most developed show the smallest percentage of dilapidated farms and the highest percentage of estates with highly developed field cultivation. Throughout Moscow Gubernia ploughland is being reduced and turned into meadow and pastureland, while grain rotations are yielding place to multi-field herbage rotations. Fodder grasses and dairy cattle, and not grain, are now predominant . . . not only on the farming estates in Moscow Gubernia but throughout the Moscow industrial district\u201d (loc. cit.).\n\nThe scale of butter production and cheese making is particularly important precisely because it testifies to a complete revolution in agriculture, which becomes entrepreneur farming and breaks with routine. Capitalism subordinates to itself one of the products of agriculture, and all other aspects of farming are fitted in with this principal product. The keeping of dairy cattle calls forth the cultivation of grasses, the change-over from the three-field system to multi-field systems, etc. The waste products of cheese making go to fatten cattle for the market. Not only milk processing, but the whole of agriculture becomes a commercial enterprise.[] The influence of cheese production and butter making is not confined to the farms on which they are carried on, since milk is often bought up from the surrounding peasants and landlords. By buying up the milk, capital subordinates to itself the small agriculturists too, particularly with the organisation of the so-called \u201camalgamated dairies,\u201d the spread of which was noted in the s (see Sketch by Messrs. Kovalevsky and Levitsky). These are establishments organised in big towns, or in their vicinity, which process very large quantities of milk brought in by rail. As soon as the milk arrives the cream is skimmed and sold fresh, while the skimmed milk is sold at a low price to poorer purchasers. To ensure that they get produce of a certain quality, these establishments sometimes conclude contracts with the suppliers, obliging them to adhere to certain rules in feeding their cows. One can easily see how great is the significance of large establishments of this kind: on the one hand they capture the public market (the sale of skimmed milk to the poorer town-dwellers), and on the other hand they enormously expand the market for the rural entrepreneurs. The latter are given a tremendous impetus to expand and improve commercial farming. Large-scale industry brings them into line, as it were, by demanding produce of a definite quality and forcing out of the market (or placing at the mercy of the usurers) the small producer who falls below the \u201cnormal\u201d standard. There should also operate in the same direction the grading of milk as to quality (fat content, for example), on which technicians are so busily engaged, inventing all sorts of lacto-densimeters, etc., and of which the experts are so heartily in favour (cf. Productive Forces, III,  and ). In this respect the role of the amalgamated dairies in the development of capitalism is quite analogous to that of elevators in commercial grain farming. By sorting grain as to quality the elevators turn it into a product that is not individual but generic (res fungibilis,[] as the lawyers say), i.e., for the first time they adapt it fully to exchange (cf. M. Sering\u2019s article on the grain trade in the United States of America in the symposium Landownership and Agriculture, p.  and foll.). Thus, the elevators give a powerful impetus to commodity-grain production and spur on its technical development by also introducing grading for quality. Such a system strikes a double blow at the small producer. Firstly, it sets up as a standard, legalises, the higher-quality grain of the big crop sowers and thereby greatly depreciates the inferior grain of the peasant poor. Secondly, by organising the grading and storing of grain on the lines of large-scale capitalist industry, it reduces the big sowers\u2019 expenses on this item and facilitates and simplifies the sale of grain for them, thereby placing the small producer, with his patriarchal and primitive methods of selling from the cart in the market, totally at the mercy of the kulaks and the usurers. Hence, the rapid development of elevator construction in recent years means as big a victory for capital and degradation of the small commodity-producer in the grain business as does the appearance and development of capitalist \u201camalgamated dairies.\u201d\n\nFrom the foregoing material it is clear that the development of commercial stock farming creates a home market,[] firstly, for means of production\u2014milk-processing equipment, premises, cattle sheds, improved agricultural implements required for the change-over from the routine three-field system to multi-field crop rotations, etc.; and secondly, for labour-power. Stock farming placed on an industrial footing requires a far larger number of workers than the old stock farming \u201cfor manure.\u201d The dairy farming area\u2014the industrial and north-western gubernias\u2014does really attract masses of agricultural labourers. Very many people go to seek agricultural work in the Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl and Vladimir gubernias; fewer, but nevertheless a considerable number, go to the Novgorod, Nizhni Novgorod and other non-black-earth gubernias. According to correspondents of the Department of Agriculture in the Moscow and other gubernias private-landowner farming is actually conducted in the main by labourers from other areas. This paradox\u2014 the migration of agricultural workers from the agricultural gubernias (they come mostly from the central black-earth gubernias and partly from the northern) to the industrial gubernias to do agricultural jobs in place of industrial workers who abandon the area en masse\u2014is an extremely characteristic phenomenon (see S. A. Korolenko on this point, loc. cit). It proves more convincingly than do any calculations or arguments that the standard of living and the conditions of the working people in the central black-earth gubernias, the least capitalist ones, are incomparably lower and worse than in the industrial gubernias, the most capitalist ones; it proves that in Russia, too, the following has become a universal fact, namely, the phenomenon characteristic of all capitalist countries, that the conditions of the workers in industry are better than those of the workers in agriculture (because in agriculture oppression by capitalism is supplemented by the oppression of pre-capitalist forms of exploitation). That explains the flight from agriculture to industry, whereas not only is there no flow from the industrial gubernias towards agriculture (for example, there is no migration from these gubernias at all), but there is even a tendency to look down upon the \u201craw\u201d rural workers, who are called \u201ccowherds\u201d (Yaroslavl Gubernia), \u201ccossacks\u201d (Vladimir Gubernia) and \u201cland labourers\u201d (Moscow Gubernia).\n\nIt is important also to note that cattle herding requires a larger number of workers in winter than in summer. For that reason, and also because of the development of agricultural processing trades, the demand for labour in the area described not only grows, but is more evenly distributed over the whole year and over a period of years. The most reliable material for judging this interesting fact is the data on wages, if taken for a number of years. We give these data, confining ourselves to the groups of Great-Russian and Little-Russian gubernias.[] We omit the western gubernias, owing to their specific social conditions and artificial congestion of population (the Jewish pale of settlement), and quote the Baltic gubernias only to illustrate the relations that arise where capitalism is most highly developed.[]\n\nPay.\nLet us examine this table, in which the three principal columns are printed in italics. The first column shows the proportion of summer to yearly pay. The lower this proportion is, and the nearer the summer pay approximates to half the yearly pay, the more evenly is the demand for labour spread over the entire year and the less the winter unemployment. The least favourably placed in this respect are the central black-earth gubernias\u2014the area where labour-service prevails and where capitalism is poorly developed.[] In the industrial gubernias, in the dairy-farming area the demand for labour is higher and winter unemployment is less. Over a period of years, too, the pay is most stable here, as may be seen from the second column, which shows the difference between the lowest and the highest pay in the harvest season. Lastly, the difference between the pay in the sowing season and the pay in the harvest season is also least in the non black-earth belt, i.e., the demand for workers is more evenly distributed over the spring and summer. In all respects mentioned the Baltic gubernias stand even higher than the non-black-earth gubernias, while the steppe gubernias, with their immigrant workers and with harvest fluctuations of the greatest intensity, are marked by the greatest instability of wages. Thus, the data on wages testify that agricultural capitalism in the area described not only creates a demand for wage-labour, but also distributes this demand more evenly over the whole year.\n\nLastly, reference must be made to one more type of dependence of the small agriculturist in the area described upon the big farmer. This is the replenishment of landlords\u2019 herds by the purchase of cattle from peasants. The landlords find it more profitable to buy cattle from peasants driven by need to sell \u201cat a loss\u201d than to breed cattle themselves\u2014just as our buyers-up in so-called handicraft industry often prefer to buy finished articles from the handicraftsmen at a ruinously cheap price rather than manufacture them in their own workshops. This fact, which testifies to the extreme degradation of the small producer, and to his being able to keep going in modern society only by endlessly reducing his requirements, is turned by Mr. V. V. into an argument in favour of small \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d production! . . . \u201cWe are entitled to draw the conclusion that our big farmers . . . do not display a sufficient degree of independence. . . . The peasant, however . . . reveals greater ability to effect real farming improvements\u201d (Progressive Trends, ). This lack of independence is expressed in the fact that \u201cour dairy farmers . . . buy up the peasants\u2019 (cows) at a price rarely amounting to half the cost of raising them\u2014usually at not more than a third, and often even a quarter of this cost\u201d (ibid., ). The merchant\u2019s capital of the stock farmers has made the small peasants completely dependent, it has turned them into its cowherds, who breed cattle for a mere song, and has turned their wives into its milkmaids.[] One would think that the conclusion to be drawn from this is that there is no sense in retarding the transformation of merchant\u2019s capital into industrial capital, no sense in supporting small production, which leads to forcing down the producer\u2019s standard of living below that of the farm labourer. But Mr. V. V. thinks otherwise. He is delighted with the \u201czeal\u201d (p. , loc. cit.) of the peasant in tending his cattle; he is delighted with the \u201cgood results from livestock farming\u201d obtained by the peasant woman who \u201cspends all her life with her cow and sheep\u201d (). What a blessing, to be sure! To \u201cspend all her life with her cow\u201d (the milk of which goes to the improved cream separator), and as a reward for this life, to receive \u201cone-fourth of the cost\u201d of tending this cow! Now really, how after that can one fail to declare in favour of \u201csmall people\u2019s production\u201d!\n\nNotes\n[] This problem also has been raised by Mr. Raspopin (perhaps for the first time in our literature) from the correct, theoretically sound point of view. At the very outset he observes that \u201cthe enhancement of the productivity of stock farming\u201d\u2014in particular, the development of dairy farming\u2014is proceeding in this country along capitalist lines and serves as one of the most important indices of the penetration of capital into agriculture.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Dr. Zhbankov says in his Sanitary Investigation of Factories and Works of Smolensk Gubernia (Smolensk, , Vol. I, p. ) that \u201cthe number of workers engaged in cheese making proper . . . is very inconsiderable. . . . There are far more auxiliary workers, needed both for cheese making and for agriculture; these are herdsmen, milkmaids, etc.; in all the [cheese] factories these workers outnumber the cheese makers proper, two, three and even four times over.\u201d Let us note in passing that according to Dr. Zhbankov\u2019s description, the conditions of labour here are very insanitary, and the working day is excessively long ( to  hours), etc. Thus, in the case of this area of commercial agriculture, too, the traditional notion of the idyllic occupation of the agriculturist is a false one.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The market for commercial stock farming is created chiefly by the growth of the industrial population, with which we shall deal in detail later on (Chapter VIII, \u00a7 II). As regards foreign trade, let us confine ourselves to the following remarks: cheese exports in the early part of the post-Reform period were much below imports; but in the s they almost equalled them (for the  years -, the annual average imports amounted to , poods, and exports to , poods; in the five years -, exports even exceeded imports). The exports of cow and ewe butter have always greatly exceeded imports; these exports are rapidly increasing: in - the average annual exports amounted to , poods and in - to , poods (Productive Forces, III, ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Group I (the area of capitalist grain farming) consists of  gubernias: Bessarabia, Kherson, Taurida, Ekaterinoslav, Don, Samara, Saratov and Orenburg. Group II (the area where capitalism is least developed) consists of  gubernias: Kazan, Simbirsk, Penza, Tambov Ryazan, Tula, Orel, Kursk, Voronezh, Kharkov, Poltava and Chernigov. Group III (the area of capitalist dairy farming and industrial capitalism) consists of  gubernias: Moscow, Tver, Kaluga, Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Nizhni-Novgorod, St. Petersburg, Novgorod and Pskov. The figures showing wages are average gubernia figures. Source: Department of Agriculture publication Hired Labour, etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] A similar conclusion is drawn by Mr. Rudnev: \u201cIn those localities where the work of labourers hired by the year is given a relatively high valuation the wages of the summer worker approximate more closely to half the yearly pay. Hence, on the contrary, in the western gubernias, and in nearly all the densely-populated central black-earth gubernias, the worker\u2019s labour in the summer is given a very low valuation\u201d (loc. cit., ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Here are two descriptions of the living standard and living conditions of the Russian peasant in general. M. Y. Saltykov, in Petty Things of Life, writes about the \u201centerprising muzhik\u201d as follows: \u201cThe muzhik needs everything, but what he needs most of all . . . is the ability to exhaust himself, not to stint his own labour. . . . The enterprising muzhik simply expires at it\u201d (work). \u201cHis wife and grown up children, too, all toil worse than galley-slaves.\u201d\n\nV. Veresayev, in a story entitled \u201cLizar\u201d Severny Kurier [Northern Courier ], , No. ), tells the story of a muzhik in the Pskov Gubernia named Lizar, who advocates the use of drops, etc., \u201cto prevent an increase.\u201d \u201cSubsequently,\u201d observes the author, \u201cI heard from many Zemstvo doctors, and particularly from midwives, that they frequently have similar requests from village husbands and wives.\u201d \u201cMoving in a certain direction, life has tried all roads and at last has reached a blind alley. There is no escape from it. And so a new solution of the problem is naturally arising and increasingly maturing.\u201d\n\nThe position of the peasant in capitalist society is indeed hopeless, and in Russia with its village communities, as in France with its smallholders, leads \u201cnaturally\u201d not to an unnatural . . . \u201csolution of the problem,\u201d of course, but to an unnatural means of postponing the doom of small economy. (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Res fungibilis\u2014replaceable thing\u2014an old juridical term. \u201cReplaceable things\u201d are those which in contracts are indicated by simple numerical quantity or measure (\u201cso many bushels of rye,\u201d \u201cso many bricks\u201d). They are distinguished from \u201cirreplaceable things\u201d\u2014things that are specifically indicated (\u201csuch and such a thing,\u201d \u201carticle number so and so\u201d).\n\nV. Continuation. The Differentiation of the Peasantry in the Dairy-Farming Area\nIn the literature dealing with the effect of dairy farming on the conditions of the peasantry, we constantly come up against contradictions: on the one hand reference is made to progress in farming, the enlargement of incomes, the improvement of agricultural technique and the acquisition of improved implements; on the other hand, we have statements about the deterioration of food, the creation of new types of bondage and the ruin of the peasants. After what was stated in Chapter II, we should not be surprised at these contradictions: we know that these opposite opinions relate to opposite groups of the peasantry. For a more precise judgement of the subject, let us take the data showing the classification of peasant households according to the number of cows per household.[]\n\nClassification of peasant households according to number of cows.\nThus, the distribution of cows among the peasants in the non-black-earth belt is found to be very similar to the distribution of draught animals among the peasants in the black-earth gubernias (see Chapter II). Moreover, the concentration of dairy cattle in the area described proves to be greater than the concentration of draught animals. This clearly points to the fact that it is with the local form of commercial farming that the differentiation of the peasantry is closely connected. The same connection is evidently indicated by the following data (unfortunately, not sufficiently complete). If we take the aggregate Zemstvo statistics (given by Mr. Blagoveshchensky; for  uyezds of  gubernias), we get an average of . cows per household. Hence, in the non-black-earth belt the peasantry evidently own more cows than in the black-earth belt, and in Petersburg Gubernia they are better off than in the non-black earth belt in general. On the other hand, in  uyezds of  gubernias the cattleless households constitute  %, while in the  uyezds we have taken, they amount to %, and in the  uyezds of Petersburg Gubernia .%. Hence, the differentiation of the peasantry (in the respect we are now examining) is most marked in Petersburg Gubernia, followed by the non-black-earth belt in general. By this indication, commercial farming is the principal factor in the differentiation of the peasantry.\n\nThe data show that about half the peasant households (those having no cows, or one cow) can take only a negative part in the benefits of dairy farming. The peasant with one cow will sell milk only out of need, to the detriment of his children\u2019s nourishment. On the other hand, about one-fifth of the households (those with  cows and more) concentrate in their hands probably more than half the total dairy farming since the quality of their cattle and the profitableness of their farms should be higher than in the case of the \u201caverage\u201d peasant.[] An interesting illustration of this conclusion is provided by the data on a locality where dairy farming and capitalism in general are highly developed. We refer to Petersburg Uyezd.[] Dairy farming is particularly widely developed in the summer residential part of the uyezd, inhabited mainly by Russians; here the most widely cultivated crops are: grasses (.% of the allotment arable, as against .% for the uyezd), oats (.% of the arable) and potatoes (.%). Agriculture is directly influenced by the St. Petersburg market, which needs oats, potatoes, hay, milk and horse traction (loc. cit., ). The families of the registered population are .% engaged \u201cin the milk industry.\u201d Of the total number of cows % provide milk for the market. The income from this industry amounts to , rubles ( rubles per family,  rubles per cow). The nearer the locality is to St. Petersburg, the higher is the quality of the cattle and the better the attention they receive. The milk is sold in two ways: ) to buyers-up on the spot and ) in St. Petersburg to \u201cdairy farms,\u201d etc. The latter type of marketing is much more profitable, but \u201cthe majority of the farms having one or two cows, and sometimes more, are not . . . able to deliver their milk to St. Petersburg direct\u201d\u2014they have no horses, it does not pay to cart small quantities, etc. The buyers-up of the milk include not only specialist merchants, but individuals with dairies of their own. The following data are for two volosts in the uyezd:\n\nDistribution of benefits of dairy farming.\nOne can judge from this how the benefits of dairy farming are distributed among all the peasants in the non-black earth belt, among whom, as we have seen, the concentration of dairy cattle is even greater than among these  families. It remains for us to add that .% of the peasant families in St. Petersburg Uyezd hire workers (most of whom, here, as everywhere in agriculture, are day labourers). \u201cBearing in mind that agricultural workers are hired almost exclusively by families having fully-operating farms\u201d (constituting only .% of the total number of families in the uyezd) \u201cthe conclusion must be that more than half of such farms do not manage without hired labour\u201d ().\n\nThus, at opposite ends of Russia, in the most varying localities, in St. Petersburg and, say, Taurida gubernias, the social and economic relations within the \u201cvillage community,\u201d prove to be absolutely identical. The \u201cmuzhik-cultivators\u201d (Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s term) in both places differentiate into a minority of rural entrepreneurs and a mass of rural proletarians. The specific feature of agriculture is that capitalism subjugates one aspect of rural economy in one district, and another aspect in another, which is why identical economic relations are manifested in the most varied forms of agronomy and everyday life.\n\nHaving established the fact that in the area described, too, the peasantry splits up into opposite classes, we shall easily achieve clarity about the contradictory opinions usually expressed as to the role of dairy farming. Quite naturally, the well-to-do peasantry receive an incentive to develop and improve their farming methods and as a result grass cultivation is widespread and becomes an essential part of commercial stock-farming. The development of grass cultivation is observed, for example, in Tver Gubernia; in Kashin Uyezd, the most progressive in that gubernia, as many as one-sixth of all peasant households plant clover (Returns, XIII, , p. ). It is interesting, moreover, to note that on the purchased lands a larger proportion of arable is occupied by herbage than on the allotments: the peasant bourgeoisie naturally prefer private ownership of land to communal tenure.[] In the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. II, ) we also find numerous references to the increase in grass cultivation, and again mainly on purchased and rented lands.[] In the same publication we find references to the spread of improved implements: iron ploughs, threshing machines, rollers, etc. Butter and cheese making, etc., are developing very considerably. In Novgorod Gubernia it was noted as far back as the beginning of the s that along with a general deterioration and diminution of peasant stock breeding, there was an improvement in certain individual localities where there was a profitable market for milk and where the milk-feeding of calves was an old-established industry (Bychkov: An Essay in the House-to-House Investigation of the Economic Position and Farming of the Peasants in Three Volosts of Novgorod Uyezd, Novgorod, ). The milk-feeding of calves, which is also a type of commercial livestock farming, is, generally speaking, a fairly widespread industry in the Novgorod and Tver gubernias and in other places not far from the big cities (see Hired Labour, etc., published by the Department of Agriculture). \u201cThis industry,\u201d says Mr. Bychkov, \u201cby its very nature, brings an income to the already well-provided peasants possessing considerable numbers of cows, since with one cow, and sometimes even with two of poor yield, the milk-feeding of calves is unthinkable\u201d (loc. cit., ).[]\n\nBut the most outstanding index of the economic successes of the peasant bourgeoisie in the area described is the hiring of labourers by peasants. The local landowners feel that they are being confronted by competitors, and in their communications to the Department of Agriculture they sometimes even attribute the shortage of workers to the fact that these are snatched up by the well-to-do peasants (Hired Labour, ). The hiring of labourers by peasants is noted in the Yaroslavl, Vladimir, St. Petersburg and Novgorod gubernias (loc. cit., passim ). A mass of such references is also scattered throughout the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia.\n\nThis progress of the well-to-do minority, however, is a heavy burden upon the mass of the poor peasants. In Koprin Volost, Rybinsk Uyezd, Yaroslavl Gubernia, for example, one finds the spread of cheese making\u2014on the initiative of \u201cV. I. Blandov, the well-known founder of cheese-making artels.\u201d[] \u201cWhen the poorer peasants, with only one cow each, deliver . . . their milk (to the cheese factory) they do so, of course, to the detriment of their own nourishment\u201d; whereas the well-to-do peasants improve their cattle (pp. -). Among the types of wage-labour undertaken, one finds employment away from home, at cheese-making establishments; from among the young peasants a body of skilled cheese makers is arising. In the Poshekhonye Uyezd \u201cthe number . . . of cheese and butter establishments is increasing from year to year,\u201d but \u201cthe benefits accruing to peasant farming from cheese and butter making hardly compensate for the disadvantages to peasant life resulting from our cheese and butter establishments.\u201d On the peasants\u2019 own admission they are often compelled to starve, for with the opening of a cheese or butter factory in some locality, the milk is sent there and the peasants usually drink diluted milk. The system of payment in kind is coming into vogue (pp., ,  and others), so that it is to be regretted that our \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d petty production is not covered by the law prohibiting payment in kind in \u201ccapitalist\u201d factories.[]\n\nThus, the opinions of people directly acquainted with the matter confirm our conclusion that the majority of the peasants play a purely negative part in the progress of local agriculture. The progress of commercial farming worsens the position of the bottom groups of peasants and forces them out of the ranks of the cultivators altogether. Be it noted that reference has been made in Narodnik literature to this contradiction between the progress of dairy farming and the deterioration of the peasants\u2019 nourishment (for the first time, I think, by Engelhardt). But it is precisely this example that enables one to see the narrowness of the Narodnik appraisal of the phenomena occurring among the peasantry and in agriculture. They note a contradiction in one form, in one locality, and do not realise that it is typical of the entire social and economic system, manifesting itself everywhere in different forms. They note the contradictory significance of one \u201cprofitable industry,\u201d and strongly urge the \u201cimplanting\u201d among the peasantry of all sorts of other \u201clocal industries.\u201d They note the contradictory significance of one form of agricultural progress and do not understand that machines, for example, have exactly the same political and economic significance in agriculture as in industry.\n\nNotes\n[] Zemstvo statistics taken from Mr. Blagoveshchensky\u2019s Combined Returns.[] About , households in these  uyezds are not classified according to the number of cows owned: the total is not , households, but ,. Mr. Blagoveshchensky cites similar data for two other uyezds in the black-earth gubernias, but these uyezds are evidently not typical. In  uyezds of Tver Gubernia (Statistical Returns, XIII, ) the percentage of allotment households owning no cows is not high (.), but .% of the households, having  and more cows, concentrate in their hands .% of the total number of cows. Horseless households constitute .%; households with  and more horses constitute only .% and they own only .% of the total number of horses. Let us note, in passing, that a smaller concentration of horses (as compared with that of cows) is also to be observed in other non-black-earth gubernias.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] These data regarding the opposite groups of peasants should be borne in mind when one meets sweeping statements like the following: \u201cAn annual income from dairy stock farming ranging from  to  rubles per household is, over the enormous area of the northern gubernias, not only a most considerable means of extending and improving stock farming, but has also had the effect of improving field cultivation and even of reducing migration in search of employment, by providing the population with work at home\u2014both in tending cattle and in bringing hitherto neglected land into a properly cultivated condition\u201d (Productive Forces, III, ). On the whole, migration is not decreasing, but increasing. In some localities, however, the decrease may be due either to the increase in the percentage of well to-do peasants, or to the development of \u201cwork at home,\u201d i.e., work for local rural entrepreneurs.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Material for Statistics on the Economy in St. Petersburg Gubernia, Vol. V, Pt. II, St. Petersburg, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] A substantial improvement in the maintenance of cattle is observed only where there has been a development in the production of milk for sale (pp. , ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Pp. , , , , , , ,  and others. Our pre-Reform system of taxation retards the progress of agriculture here too. \u201cOwing to the congestion of the farmsteads,\u201d writes a correspondent, \u201cgrass cultivation has been introduced all over the volost; the clover, however, is sold to cover tax arrears\u201d (). The taxes in this gubernia are sometimes to high that the peasant who leases his land has himself to pay a sum to the new holder of the allotment.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us note, by the way, that the variety of \u201cindustries\u201d of the local peasantry prompted Mr. Bychkov to distinguish two types of industrialists, according to the amount of earnings. It appeared that less than  rubles was earned by , persons (.% of the population); their earnings totalled , rubles, or an average of  rubles per person. Over  rubles was obtained by  (.% of the population): their earnings totalled , rubles, or an average of  rubles per person The first group consisted mainly of wage-workers of every kind, the second of traders, hay merchants, timber dealers, etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The \u201ccheese-making artels\u201d of Koprin Volost are mentioned in the Directory of Factories and Works, and the Blandovs are the largest firm in the cheese-making industry: in  they owned  factories in six gubernias.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Here is the characteristic view of Mr. Stary Maslodel [Old Butter Maker]. \u201cWhoever has seen and knows the countryside today and remembers what it was  or  years ago will be amazed at the difference. In the old villages all the houses were the same both outside and inside; today, however side by side with hovels stand fine houses, side by side with the indigent live the rich, side by side with the downtrodden and despised live those who feast and make merry. In former times one often came across villages in which there was not a single landless peasant; now in every village there are no less than five and sometimes a full dozen. And to tell the truth, butter making is much to blame for this transformation of the villages. In  years butter making has enriched many, has beautified their homes; many peasants who supplied milk during the period of development of the butter industry have become prosperous, acquired more cattle, and purchased land on a community or individual basis; but many more have fallen into poverty; landless peasants and beggars have appeared in the villages\u201d (Zhizn [Life ] , No.  quoted from Severny Krai [Northern Region ], , No ).

The Flax-Growing Area\nWe have described the first two areas of capitalist agriculture in fairly great detail because of their widespread character and of the typical nature of the relations observed there. In our further exposition we shall confine ourselves to briefer remarks on some highly important areas.\n\nFlax is the chief of the so-called \u201cindustrial crops.\u201d The very term indicates that we are dealing here with commercial farming. For example, in the \u201cflax\u201d gubernia of Pskov, flax has long been the peasants\u2019 \u201cfirst money,\u201d to use a local expression (Military Statistical Abstract, ). Flax growing is simply a means of making money. The post-Reform period is marked on the whole by an undoubted increase in commercial flax growing. Thus, at the end of the s, the output of flax in Russia was estimated at approximately  million poods of fibre (ibid., ); at the beginning of the s at  million poods of fibre (Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry, Vol. I, St. Petersburg, , p. ); at the present time, in the  gubernias of European Russia over  million poods of fibre are gathered.[] In the flax-growing area proper ( gubernias of the non-black-earth belt) the area under flax has changed in recent years as follows; \u2014, dess.; \u2014, dess.; \u2014, dess.; \u2014, dess., and \u2014, dess. For the whole of European Russia ( gubernias) the figure for  was ,, dess. under flax and for \u2014,, dess. (Vestnik Finansov, ibid., and , No. ), as against ,, dess. at the beginning of the s (Productive Forces, I, ). Similarly, general opinions expressed in publications also testify to the growth of commercial flax growing. Thus, regarding the first two decades after the Reform, the Historico-Statistical Survey states that \u201cthe region of flax cultivation for industrial purposes has been enlarged by several gubernias\u201d (loc. cit., ), which is due particularly to the extension of the railways. Concerning the Yuryev Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, Mr. V. Prugavin wrote at the beginning of the eighties: \u201cThe cultivation of flax . . . has become very widespread here during the past  to  years.\u201d \u201cSome large family households sell flax to the extent of  to  rubles and more per annum. . . . They buy\u201d (flax seed) \u201cin Rostov. . . . The peasants in these parts are very careful in selecting seed\u201d (The Village Community, Handicraft Industries and Agriculture of Yuryev Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, Moscow, , pp. -). The Zemstvo Statistical Returns for Tver Gubernia (Vol. XIII, Pt. ) notes that \u201cthe most important spring grain crops, barley and oats, are yielding place to potatoes and flax\u201d (p. ); in some uyezds flax occupies from / to / of the area under spring crops, for example, in Zubtsov, Kashin and other uyezds, \u201cin which flax growing has assumed the clearly expressed speculative character of an industry\u201d (p. ), developing particularly on rented virgin and disused land. Moreover, it is noted that in some gubernias, where free land is still available (virgin soil, wasteland, forest-cleared tracts), flax growing is particularly expanding, but in some of the old established flax-growing gubernias \u201cthe cultivation of flax is either on the old scale or is even yielding place, for example, to the newly-introduced cultivation of root-crops, vegetables, etc.\u201d (Vestnik Finansov, , No. , p. , and , No. ), i.e., to other types of commercial farming.\n\nAs for flax exports, during the first two decades after the Reform they increased with remarkable rapidity: from an average of . million poods in the years - to . million poods in the years - and to . million poods in the years -; but then exports seemed to become stationary, amounting in the years - to an average of . million poods.[] The development of commercial flax growing led, naturally, to exchange not only between agriculture and industry (sale of flax and purchase of manufactured goods), but between different types of commercial agriculture (sale of flax and purchase of grain) The following data concerning this interesting phenomenon clearly demonstrate that a home market for capitalism is created not only by the diversion of population from agriculture to industry, but also by the specialisation of commercial farming.[]\n\nRailway traffic to and from Pskov.\nHow does this growth of commercial flax growing affect the peasantry, who, as we know, are the principal flax producer?[] \u201cTravelling through Pskov Gubernia and observing its economic life, one cannot help noticing that side by side with occasional large and rich units, hamlets and villages, there are extremely poor units; these extremes are a characteristic feature of the economic life of the flax area.\u201d \u201cFlax growing has taken a speculative turn,\u201d and \u201cthe greater part\u201d of the income from flax \u201cis pocketed by buyers-up and by those who lease out land for flax growing\u201d (Strokin, -). The ruinous rents constitute real \u201cmoney rent\u201d (see above), and the mass of the peasants are in a state of \u201ccomplete and hopeless dependence\u201d (Strokin, ibid.) upon the buyers-up. The sway of merchant\u2019s capital was established in this locality long ago,[] and what distinguishes the post-Reform period is the enormous concentration of this capital, the undermining of the monopoly of the former small buyers-up and the formation of \u201cflax agencies\u201d which have captured the whole flax trade. The significance of flax growing, says Mr. Strokin about Pskov Gubernia, \u201cis expressed . . . in the concentration of capital in a few hands\u201d (p. ). Turning flax growing into a gamble, capital ruined vast numbers of small agriculturists, who worsened the quality of the flax, exhausted the land, were reduced to leasing out their allotments and finally swelled the ranks of \u201cmigratory\u201d workers. On the other hand, a slight minority of well-to-do peasants and traders were able\u2014and competition made it necessary\u2014to introduce technical improvements. Cout\u00e9 scutchers, both hand-worked (costing up to  rubles) and horse-operated (three times dearer), were introduced. In  there were only  such machines in Pskov Gubernia, in  there were , (, hand-worked and , horse- operated).[] \u201cToday,\u201d we read in the Historico-Statistical Survey, \u201cevery sound peasant family engaged in flax growing has a Cout\u00e9 hand-machine, which has actually come to be called the \u2018Pskov scutcher\u2019\u201d (loc. cit., -). What proportion this minority of \u201csound\u201d householders who acquire machines is to the rest of the peasantry, we have already seen in Chapter II. Instead of the primitive contrivances which cleaned the seeds very badly, the Pskov Zemstvo began to introduce improved seed-cleaners (trieurs ), and \u201cthe more prosperous peasant industrialists\u201d now find it profitable to buy these machines themselves and to hire them out to flax growers (Vestnik Finansov, , No. , p. ). The bigger buyers-up of flax establish drying rooms and presses and hire workers to sort and scutch the flax (see example given by Mr. V. Prugavin, loc. cit., ). Lastly, it should be added that the processing of flax-fibre requires quite a large number of workers: it is estimated that the cultivation of one dessiatine of flax requires  working days of agricultural work proper, and  days to extract the fibre from stalks (Historico-Statistical Survey, ). Thus, the development of flax growing leads, on the one hand, to the farmer being more fully occupied during the winter and, on the other, to the creation of a demand for wage-labour on the part of those landlords and well-to-do peasants who engage in flax growing (see the example in Chapter III, \u00a7 VI).\n\nThus, in the flax-growing area, too, the growth of commercial farming leads to the domination of capital and to the differentiation of the peasantry. A tremendous obstacle to the latter process is undoubtedly the ruinously high renting prices of land,[] the pressure of merchant\u2019s capital, the tying of the peasant to his allotment and the high payments for the allotted land. Hence, the wider the development of land purchase by the peasants,[] and of migration in search of employment,[] and the more widespread the use of improved implements and methods of cultivation, the more rapidly will merchant\u2019s capital be supplanted by industrial capital, and the more rapidly will a rural bourgeoisie be formed from among the peasantry, and the system of labour-service for the landlord replaced by the capitalist system.\n\nNotes\n[] The average for - was ,, poods, according to the figures of the Central Statistical Committee. See Vestnik Finansov, , No. , and , No. . Formerly the statistics for flax production were very inexact; that is why we have preferred to take approximate estimates based on comparisons of the most varied source made by experts. The amount of flax produced fluctuates considerably year by year. For that reason Mr. N.\u2013on, for example, who set out to draw the boldest conclusions about the \u201cdiminution\u201d of flax production and \u201cthe reduction of the area under flax\u201d (Sketches, p.  and foll.) from figures for some six years, slipped into the most curious errors (see P. B. Struve\u2019s examination of them in Critical Remarks, p.  and foll.). Let us add to what has been said in the text that according to the data cited by Mr. N.\u2013on, the maximum area under flax in the s was ,, dess. and the weight of gathered fibre ,, poods, whereas in - the area was ,,- ,, dess., and the weight of gathered fibre ,,-,, poods.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The figures are for the exports of flax, flax-combings and tow. See Historico-Statistical Survey, P. Struve, Critical Remarks and Vestnik Finansov, , No. , and , No. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See N. Strokin, Flax Growing in Pskov Gubernia, St. Petersburg, . The author borrowed these data from the Proceedings of the Commission on Taxation.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Of ,, dess. under flax, , dess. are in the non-black-earth belt, where only % belongs to private landowners. In the black-earth belt, of , dess. under flax .% belongs to private owners (Productive Forces, , ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The Military Statistical Abstract in its day pointed to the fact that the \u201cflax sown by the peasants very often really belongs to the bulinyas \u201d (local name for small buyers-up), \u201cwhile the peasant is merely a labourer on his field\u201d (). Cf. Historico-Statistical Survey, p, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Strokin, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] At the present time renting prices of flax land are falling due to the drop in the price of flax, but the area of land under flax, in the Pskov flax area in , for example, has not diminished (Vestnik Finansov, , No. )\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Pskov Gubernia is one of the foremost in Russia in the development of the purchase of land by peasants. According to the Combined Statistical Material on the Economic Position of the Rural Population (published by Chancellery of the Committee of Ministers), the lands purchased by peasants amount here to % of the total allotment arable, this is the maximum for all the  gubernias. It works out at an average of . dess. of purchased land per head of the male peasant population as of January , . In this respect only Novgorod and Taurida gubernias exceed Pskov Gubernia.\u2014Lenin\n\nVII. The Technical Processing of Agricultural Produce\nAbove we have already had occasion to note (Chapter I, \u00a7 I) that writers on agriculture, in classifying systems of farming according to the principal market product, assign the industrial or technical system of farming to a special category. The essence of this system is that the agricultural product, before going into consumption (personal or productive), undergoes technical processing. The establishments which effect this processing either constitute part of the very farms on which the raw material is produced or belong to special industrialists who buy up the raw material from the peasant farmers. From the standpoint of political economy the difference between these two types is unimportant. The growth of agricultural technical trades is extremely important as regards the development of capitalism. Firstly, this growth represents one of the forms of the development of commercial farming, and is, moreover, the form that shows most vividly the conversion of agriculture into a branch of industry of capitalist society. Secondly, the development of the technical processing of agricultural produce is usually connected intimately with technical progress in agriculture: on the one hand, the very production of the raw material for processing often necessitates agricultural improvement (the planting of root-crops, for example); on the other hand, the waste products of the processing are frequently utilised in agriculture, thus increasing its effectiveness and restoring, at least in some measure, the equilibrium, the interdependence, between agriculture and industry, the disturbance of which constitutes one of the most profound contradictions of capitalism.\n\nWe must accordingly now describe the development of technical agricultural trades in post-Reform Russia.\n\n) Distilling\nHere we regard distilling only from the point of view of agriculture. Accordingly, there is no need for us to dwell on the rapid concentration of distilling in large plants (partly due to excise requirements), on the rapid progress of factory technique, with the consequent cheapening of production, and the increase in excise duties which has outstripped this cheapening of production and because of its excessive amount has retarded the growth of consumption and production.\n\nHere are data for \u201cagricultural\u201d distilling in the whole of the Russian Empire[]:\nDistilling.\nThus, over / of the distilleries (accounting for over / of the total output) are directly connected with agriculture. Being large capitalist enterprises, these establishments lend the same character to all the landlord farms on which they are set up (the distilleries belong almost without exception to landlords, mainly to members of the nobility). The type of commercial farming under review is particularly developed in the central black-earth gubernias, in which are concentrated over / of the total number of distilleries in the Russian Empire ( in -, of which  were agricultural and mixed), producing over a quarter of the total output of spirits (,, vedros in -, of which ,, at agricultural and at mixed distilleries). Thus in the area where labour-service predominates, the commercial character of agriculture most frequently (as compared with other areas) manifests itself in the distilling of vodka from grain and potatoes. Distilling from potatoes has undergone a particularly rapid development since the Reform, as may be seen from the following data relating to the whole of the Russian Empire[]:\n\nMaterials used for distilling.\nThus, with a general twofold increase in the quantity of crops distilled, the quantity of potatoes used increased about -fold. This fact strikingly corroborates the proposition established above (\u00a7 I in this chapter) that the enormous increase in the potato area and crop signifies the growth of precisely commercial and capitalist farming, along with improvement of agricultural technique, with the replacement of the three-field system by multi-field crop rotation, etc.[] The area of the biggest development of distilling is also distinguished for the biggest (in the Russian gubernias, i.e., not counting the Baltic and the western gubernias) net per-capita harvest of potatoes. Thus in the northern black-earth gubernias the figures for -, - and - were ., . and . chetverts respectively, whereas for the whole of European Russia ( gubernias) the corresponding figures were ., . and . chetverts. As far back as the beginning of the s the Historico-Statistical Survey noted that \u201cthe region marked by the greatest expansion of potato cultivation covers all the gubernias of the central and northern parts of the black-earth belt, the Volga and Transvolga gubernias and the central non-black-earth gubernias\u201d (loc. cit., p. ).[]\n\nThe expansion of potato cultivation by landlords and well-to-do peasants means an increase in the demand for hired labour; the cultivation of a dessiatine of potatoes absorbs much more labour[] than the cultivation of a dessiatine of cereals and the use of machinery in, for example, the central black-earth area is still very slight. Thus, while the number of workers engaged in the distilling industry proper has decreased,[] the elimination of labour-service by the capitalist system of farming, with the cultivation of root-crops, has increased the demand for rural day labourers.\n\n) Beet-Sugar Production\nThe processing of sugar-beet is even more highly concentrated in big capitalist enterprises than distilling is, and is likewise an adjunct of the landlords\u2019 (mainly noblemen\u2019s) estates. The principal area of this industry is the south-western gubernias, and then the southern black-earth and central black-earth gubernias. The area under sugar-beet amounted in the s to about , dess.,[] in the s to about , dess.[]; in - to , dess.,[] in - to , dess.,[] in  to , dess., in  to , dess. (Torgovo-Promyshlennaya Gazeta, , No. ), in - to , dess. (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). Hence, in the period following the Reform the area cultivated has increased more than -fold. Incomparably more rapid has been the growth of the amount of sugar-beet harvested and processed: on an average the weight of sugar-beet processed in the Empire in the years - was . million berkovets[]; in -\u2014. million; in -\u2014. million; in -\u2014. million; and in - and -\u2014 million.[] The amount of processed sugar-beet has grown since the s more than -fold. Hence, there has been an enormous increase in the beet yield, i.e., in labour productivity, on the big estates organised on capitalist lines.[] The introduction of a root-plant like beet into the rotation is indissolubly linked with the transition to a more advanced system of cultivation, with improved tillage and cattle feed, etc. \u201cThe tillage of the soil for beetroot,\u201d we read in the Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. I), \u201cwhich, generally speaking, is rather complicated and difficult, has been brought to a high degree of perfection on many beet farms, especially in the south-western and Vistula gubernias. In different localities, various more or less improved implements and ploughs are used for tilling; in some cases even steam ploughing has been introduced\u201d (p. ).\n\nThis progress of large-scale capitalist farming gives rise to quite a considerable increase in the demand for agricultural wage-workers\u2014 regular and particularly day labourers\u2014the employment of female and child labour being particularly extensive (cf. Historico-Statistical Survey, II, ). Among the peasants of the neighbouring gubernias a special type of migration has arisen, known as migration \u201cto sugar\u201d (ibid., ). It is estimated that the complete cultivation of a morg (= / dess.)[] of beet land requires  working days (Hired Labour, ). The Combined Material on the Position of the Rural Population (published by Committee of Ministers) estimates that the cultivation of one dessiatine of beet land, when done by machine, requires , and when by hand , working days of males, not counting women and juveniles (pp. X-XI). Thus, the cultivation of the total beet area in Russia probably engages not less than , agricultural day labourers, men and women. But the increase in the number of dessiatines under beet is not enough to give a complete idea of the demand for hired labour, since some jobs are paid for at so much per berkovets. Here, for example, is what we read in Reports and Investigations of Handicraft Industry in Russia (published by Ministry of State Properties, Vol. II, St. Petersburg, , p. ).\n\n\u201cThe female population both of the town, and of the uyezd\u201d (the town of Krolevets, Chernigov Gubernia, is referred to) \u201cthink highly of work on the beet fields; in the autumn the cleaning of beets is paid at  kopeks per berkovets, and two women clean from six to ten berkovets a day, but some contract to work during the growing season as well, weeding and hoeing; in that case, for the full job, including digging and cleaning, they get  kopeks per berkovets of cleaned beets.\u201d The conditions of the workers on the beet plantations are extremely bad. For instance, the Vrachebnaya Khronika Kharkovskoi Gubernii[] (September , quoted in Russkiye Vedomosti, , No. ) cites \u201ca number of exceedingly deplorable facts about the conditions of those working on the red-beet plantations. Thus, the Zemstvo physician, Dr. Podolsky, of the village of Kotelva, Akhtyrka Uyezd, writes: \u2018In the autumn typhus usually breaks out among young people employed on the red-beet plantations of the well-to-do peasants. The sheds assigned for the workers\u2019 leisure and sleeping quarters are kept by such planters in a very filthy condition; by the time the job ends the straw used for sleeping is literally converted into dung, for it is never changed: this becomes a breeding ground of infection. Typhus has had to be diagnosed immediately in the case of four or five patients brought in from one and the same plantation.\u2019 In the opinion of this doctor, \u2018most of the syphilis cases come from the red-beet plantations.\u2019 Mr. Feinberg rightly asserts that \u2018work on the plantations, which is no less injurious to the workers themselves and to the surrounding population than work in the factories, has particularly disastrous consequences, because large numbers of women and juveniles are engaged in it, and because the workers here are without the most elementary protection from society and the State\u2019; in view of this, the author wholly supports the opinion expressed by Dr. Romanenko at the Seventh Congress of Doctors of Kharkov Gubernia that \u2018in issuing compulsory regulations, consideration must also be given to the conditions of the workers on the beet plantations. These workers lack the most essential things; they live for months under the open sky and eat from a common bowl.\u2019\u201d\n\nThus, the growth of beet cultivation has enormously increased the demand for rural workers, converting the neighbouring peasantry into a rural proletariat. The increase in the number of rural workers has been but slightly checked by the inconsiderable drop in the number of workers engaged in the beet-sugar industry proper.[]\n\n) Potato-Starch Production\nFrom branches of technical production conducted exclusively on landlord farms let us pass to such as are more or less within the reach of the peasantry. These include, primarily, the processing of potatoes (partly also wheat and other cereals) into starch and treacle. Starch production has developed with particular rapidity in the post-Reform period owing to the enormous growth of the textile industry, which raises a demand for starch. The area covered by this branch of production is mainly the non-black-earth, the industrial, and, partly, the northern black-earth gubernias. The Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. II) estimates that in the middle of the s, there were about  establishments with an output valued at about , rubles, while in  there were  establishments with an output valued at ,, rubles. In , according to the Directory of Factories and Works there were  establishments employing , workers, with an output valued at ,, rubles.[] \u201cIn the past  years,\u201d we read in the Historico-Statistical Survey, \u201cthe number of establishments engaged in starch production has increased  / times and the total output  / times; nevertheless, this productivity is far from covering the demand for starch\u201d (p. ), as evidenced by the increased starch imports from abroad. Analysing the data for each gubernia, the Historico-Statistical Survey reaches the conclusion that our production of potato starch (unlike that of wheat-starch) is of an agricultural character, being concentrated in the hands of peasants and landlords. \u201cShowing promise of extensive development\u201d in the future, \u201cit is even now furnishing our rural population with considerable advantages\u201d ().\n\nWe shall see in a moment who enjoys these advantages. But first let us note that two processes must be distinguished in the development of starch production: on the one hand, the appearance of new small factories and the growth of peasant production, and on the other, the concentration of production in large steam-powered factories. For instance, in  there were  steam-powered factories, with % of the total number of workers and % of the total output concentrated in them. Of these works only  were established before ,  in the s,  in the s, and  in  (Mr. Orlov\u2019s Directory ).\n\nTo acquaint ourselves with the economy of peasant starch production, let us turn to local investigations. In Moscow Gubernia, in -,  villages in  uyezds engaged in starch making.[] The number of establishments was estimated at , employing  workers and having an output valued at not less than , rubles. The industry spread mainly after the Reform; its technique gradually improved and larger establishments were formed requiring more fixed capital and showing a higher productivity of labour. Hand graters were replaced by improved ones, then horse power appeared, and finally the drum was introduced, considerably improving and cheapening production. Here are data we have compiled from a house-to-house census of \u201chandicraftsmen,\u201d according to size of establishment:\n\nPotato-starch production.\nestablishments[]\n\nThus we have here small capitalist establishments in which, as production expands, the employment of hired labour increases and the productivity of labour rises. These establishments bring the peasant bourgeoisie considerable profit, and also improve agricultural technique. But the situation of the workers in these workshops is very unsatisfactory, owing to the extremely insanitary working conditions and the long working day.[]\n\nThe peasants who own \u201cgrating\u201d establishments farm under very favourable conditions. The planting of potatoes (on allotment, and chiefly on rented land) yields a considerably larger income than the planting of rye or oats. To enlarge their business the workshop owners rent a considerable amount of allotment land from the poor peasants. For example, in the village of Tsybino (Bronnitsy Uyezd),  owners of starch workshops (out of  peasant families in the village) rent allotments from peasants who have left in search of employment, and also from horseless peasants, thus adding to their own  allotments  more, which they have rented; concentrated in their hands are a total of  allotments, i.e., .% of the total number of allotments in the village. \u201cExactly similar things,\u201d we read in the Returns, \u201care met with in other villages where the starch industry is more or less developed\u201d (loc. cit., ).[] The owners of the starch workshops have twice as much livestock as the other peasants: they average . horses and . cows per household, as against . horses and . cows among the local peasants in general. Of the  workshop owners (covered by the house-to-house census)  own purchased land,  rent non-allotment land and  rent allotment land. In short, these are typical representatives of the peasant bourgeoisie.\n\nExactly analogous relations are to be found in the starch making industry in the Yuryev Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia (V. Prugavin, loc. cit., p.  and foll.). Here, too, the workshop owners carry on production mainly with the aid of wage-labour (out of  workers in  workshops,  are hired); and here, too, the workshop owners are far above the mass of the peasantry as far as stock-breeding and agriculture are concerned; they use potato pulp as feed for their cattle. Even real capitalist farmers emerge from among the peasants. Mr. Prugavin describes the farm of a peasant who owns a starch works (valued at about , rubles) employing  wage-workers. This peasant grows potatoes on his own farm, which he has enlarged by renting land. The crop rotation is seven-field and includes clover. For the farm work he employs from  to  workers, hired from spring to autumn (\u201cfrom end to end\u201d). The pulp is used as cattle feed, and the owner intends to use the waste water for his fields.\n\nMr. V. Prugavin assures us that this works enjoys \u201cquite exceptional conditions.\u201d Of course, in any capitalist society the rural bourgeoisie will always constitute a very small minority of the rural population, and in this sense will, if you like, be an \u201cexception.\u201d But this term will not eliminate the fact that in the starch-making area, as in all the other commercial farming areas in Russia, a class of rural entrepreneurs is being formed, who are organising capitalist agriculture.[]\n\n) Vegetable-Oil Production\nThe extraction of oil from linseed, hemp, sunflower and other seeds is also frequently an agricultural industry. One can gauge the development of vegetable-oil production in the post-Reform period from the fact that in  the vegetable-oil output had an estimated value of ,, rubles, in  of ,, rubles, and in  of ,, rubles.[] In this branch of production, too, a double process of development is to be observed: on the one hand, small peasant (and sometimes also landlord) oil presses producing oil for sale are established in the villages. On the other hand, large steam-driven works develop, which concentrate production and oust the small establishments.[] Here we are interested solely in the agricultural processing of oil-bearing plants. \u201cThe owners of the hempseed oil presses,\u201d we read in the Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. II), \u201cbelong to the well-to-do members of the peasantry\u201d; they attach particular value to vegetable-oil production because it enables them to obtain excellent feed for their cattle (oil cake). Mr. Prugavin (loc. cit.), noting the \u201cextensive development of the production of linseed oil\u201d in the Yuryev Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, states that the peasants derive \u201cno little advantage\u201d from it (pp. -), that crop and stock raising is conducted on a far higher level by peasants who own oil presses than by the bulk of the peasantry and that some of the oil millers also resort to the hire of rural workers (loc. cit., tables, pp. - and -). The Perm handicraft census for - also showed that crop raising is conducted on a much higher level by handicraft oil millers than by the bulk of the peasants (larger areas under crops, far more animals, better harvests, etc.), and that this improvement in cultivation is accompanied by the hiring of rural workers.[] In the post-Reform period in Voronezh Gubernia, there has been a particular development of the commercial cultivation of sunflower seed, which is crushed for oil in local presses. The area under sunflowers in Russia in the s was estimated at about , dess. (Historico-Statistical Survey, I), and in the s at about , dess., of which / belonged to peasants. \u201cSince then, however, judging by certain data, the area under this plant has considerably increased, in some places by  per cent and even more\u201d (Productive Forces, I, ). \u201cIn the village of Alexeyevka alone\u201d (Biryuch Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia), we read in the Historico-Statistical Survey, Vol. II, \u201cthere are more than  oil presses, and Alexeyevka itself, solely owing to sunflowers, has prospered and grown from a wretched little hamlet into a rich town ship, with houses and shops roofed with sheet iron\u201d (p. ). How this wealth of the peasant bourgeoisie was reflected in the condition of the mass of the peasantry may be seen from the fact that in , in the village of Alexeyevka, out of , families registered (, persons of both sexes), , had no draught animals, , had no implements, , cultivated no land, and only  families did not engage in industries.[]\n\nIn general, it should be stated that peasant oil presses usually figure, in Zemstvo house-to-house censuses, among the \u201ccommercial and industrial establishments,\u201d of whose distribution and role we have already spoken in Chapter II.\n\n) Tobacco Growing\nIn conclusion, let us make some brief observations on the development of tobacco growing. The average crop in Russia for the years - was ,, poods from , dess.; for - it was ,, poods from , dess.; for the s, it was  million poods from , dess.[] The number of plantations in the same periods was estimated at ,, , and , respectively, which evidently indicates a very considerable increase in the number of small cultivators drawn into this type of commercial farming. Tobacco growing requires a considerable number of workers. Among the types of agricultural migration note is therefore made of migration to tobacco plantations (particularly to the outer gubernias in the South, where the cultivation of tobacco has recently expanded with exceptional rapidity). Reference has already been made in publications to the fact that the workers on the tobacco plantations lead a very hard life.[]\n\nIn the Survey of Tobacco Growing in Russia (Parts II and III, St. Petersburg, , published by order of the Department of Agriculture), there are very detailed and interesting data on tobacco growing as a branch of commercial farming. Mr. V. S. Shcherbachov, describing tobacco growing in Malorossia, gives wonderfully precise information on three uyezds of Poltava Gubernia (Priluki, Lokhvitsa and Romny). This information, gathered by the author and arranged by the Bureau of Statistics, Poltava Gubernia Zemstvo Board, covers , peasant farms in the three uyezds that grow tobacco; they have , dessiatines under tobacco and , dessiatines under cereals. The farms are distributed as follows:\n\nDistribution of tobacco-growing farms.\nWe see an enormous concentration of both the tobacco and the cereal area in the hands of the capitalist farms. Less than one-eighth of the farms (, out of ,) hold more than half the area under cereals (, dess. out of ,), with an average of nearly  dess. per farm. Almost half the area under tobacco (, dess. out of ,) belongs to these farms, the average per farm being over  dessiatine, whereas for all the other groups the area under tobacco does not exceed one- to two-tenths of a dessiatine per household.\n\nMr. Shcherbachov, in addition, gives data showing the same farms grouped according to area under tobacco:\n\nDistribution of tobacco-growing farms by area.\nFrom this it can be seen that the concentration of the tobacco area is considerably greater than that of the cereal area. The branch of specifically commercial agriculture in this locality is concentrated in the hands of capitalists to a greater extent than is agriculture in general. Out of , farms, , account for , dess. under tobacco out of , dess., or more than three-fifths. The biggest tobacco planters, numbering  (a little over one-tenth of all the planters), have , dess. under tobacco, or over one-third of the total area. This averages over  dessiatines under tobacco per farm. To judge of the sort of farm it must be, let us recall that tobacco cultivation requires at least two workers for a period of  to  summer months, depending on the grade of tobacco.\n\nThe owner of  dessiatines under tobacco must there fore have at least  workers; in other words, he must undoubtedly base his farm on wage-labour. Some grades of tobacco require not two but three seasonal workers per dessiatine, and day labourers in addition. In a word, we see quite clearly that the greater the degree to which agriculture becomes commercial, the more highly developed is its capitalist organisation.\n\nThe preponderance of small and tiny farms among the tobacco growers (, farms out of , have up to one-tenth of a dessiatine planted) does not in the least refute the fact of the capitalist organisation of this branch of commercial agriculture; for this mass of tiny farms accounts for an insignificant share of the output (,, i.e., nearly half the farms, have in all  dess. out of ,, or less than one-tenth). Nor do \u201caverage\u201d figures, to which people so often confine themselves, provide a picture of the real situation (the average per farm is a little over  dessiatine under tobacco).\n\nIn some uyezds the development of capitalist agriculture and the concentration of production are still more marked. In the Lokhvitsa Uyezd, for example,  farms out of , each have  dessiatines and more under cereals. Their owners have , dess. under cereals out of a total of ,, i.e., more than half. Each farmer has about  dess. under crops. Of the land under tobacco they have , dess. out of , dess. And if the farms are grouped according to area under tobacco, we have in this uyezd  farmers out of , with two and more dessiatines under tobacco. These  farmers have , dess. under tobacco out of ,, i.e., % and more than ten dessiatines under tobacco per farm. At the other extreme of the same Lokhvitsa Uyezd we have , farms (out of ,) having up to one-tenth of a dessiatine each under tobacco, and altogether  dessiatines out of ,, i.e., %.\n\nIt goes without saying that the capitalist organisation of production is accompanied here by a very considerable development of merchant\u2019s capital and by all sorts of exploitation outside the sphere of production. The small tobacco growers have no drying sheds, are unable to give their tobacco time to ferment and to sell it (in  to  weeks) as a finished product. They sell the unfinished product at half the price to buyers-up, who very often plant tobacco themselves on rented land. The buyers-up \u201csqueeze the small planters in every way\u201d (p.  of cited publication). Commercial agriculture is commercial capitalist production: this relation can be clearly traced (if only one is able to select the proper methods) in this branch of agriculture too.\n\nNotes\n[] The law of June , , laid down the following criteria of agricultural distilling: ) distilling season, from September  to June , when no field-work is done; ) proportion between the quantity of spirits distilled and the number of dessiatines of arable land on the estate. Plants carrying on partly agricultural and partly industrial distilling are called mixed distilleries (cf. Vestnik Finansov, , No. , and , No. ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Sources: Military Statistical Abstract, ; Productive Forces, IX, , and Vestnik Finansov, , No. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. Raspopin, loc. cit.,\u2014 Historico-Statistical Survey, loc. cit., p. . The by-products of distilling (wash) are often used (even by commercial and not only agricultural establishments) in commercial beef-cattle raising.\u2014Cf. Agricultural Statistical Information, Vol. VII, p.  and passim.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The great rapidity with which the use of potatoes for distilling has increased in the central agricultural gubernias can be seen from the following data. In six gubernias: Kursk, Orel, Tula, Ryazan, Tambov and Voronezh, during the period - to - an average of , poods of potatoes was distilled per annum; during - to -\u2014,, poods; during - to -, ,, poods. For the whole of European Russia the corresponding figures are: ,, poods, ,, poods and ,, poods. The number of distilleries using potatoes in the above gubernias averaged  per annum in the period - to -; in the period - to -, ; and in the period - to -, . For the whole of European Russia the corresponding figures are: , , , (see Agricultural Statistical Information, Vol. VII).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For example, according to the Zemstvo statistical returns for Balakhna Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, the cultivation of one dess. of potatoes requires . working days, including . working days of a woman occupied in planting, hoeing, weeding and digging. The greatest increase, therefore, is in the demand for the day labour of local peasant women.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In  the number of workers in European Russia employed in distilleries was estimated at , (Military Statistical Abstract. In Chapter VII we shall show that this source tremendously overstates the number of factory workers), and in  at , (according to Orlov\u2019s Directory ). The workers engaged in distilling proper are few in number and, moreover, differ but little from rural workers. \u201cAll the workers employed in the village distilleries,\u201d says Dr. Zhbankov, for example, \u201cwhich, moreover, do not operate regularly, since the workers leave for field-work in the summer, differ very distinctly from regular factory workers they wear peasant clothes, retain their rural habits, and do not acquire the particular polish characteristic of factory workers\u201d (loc. cit., II, ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The Ministry of Finance Yearbook, Vol.I.\u2014Military Statistical Abstract.\u2014Historico-Statistical Survey, Vol. II.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Historico-Statistical Survey, I.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Productive Forces, I, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Vestnik Finansov [Financial Messenger ], , No. , and , No .

The Military Statistical Abstract overstated the figure here too, giving it as ,, evidently counting the same workers twice). The figure for  is , workers (Orlov\u2019s Directory ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] We take the data given in the Historico-Statistical Survey as being the most uniform and comparable. The Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance (, No. , April), on the basis of official data of the Department of Commerce and Manufacture, estimated that in  there were in Russia  starch-making establishments whose output was valued at , rubles. The Military Statistical Abstract estimates that in  there were  establishments with an output valued at , rubles, but this undoubtedly included small establishments, not now reckoned as factories. Generally speaking, the statistics of this trade are very unsatisfactory: small factories are some times counted, and at others (much more often) are not. Thus, Orlov\u2019s Directory gives the number of establishments in Yaroslavl Gubernia in  as  (the List for - gives ), while according to the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. , ), in Rostov Uyezd alone there were  starch and treacle establishments. Hence, the figures given in the text can indicate only the dynamics of the phenomenon, but not the actual development of the industry.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VII, Pt , Moscow, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See Appendix to Chapter V, Industry No. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Loc. cit., p. . The working day in the peasant workshops is  to  hours, while in the big works in the same industry (according to Dementyev[]) a -hour working day prevails.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Compare with this statement the general view of V. Orlov on Moscow Gubernia as a whole (Returns, Vol. IV, Pt. , p. ): the prosperous peasants frequently rent the allotments of the peasant poor, and sometimes hold from  to  rented allotments.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] As a matter of interest, let us mention that both Mr. Prugavin (loc. cit., ), the author of the description of the Moscow industry (loc. cit., ), and Mr. V. V. (Essays on Handicraft Industry, ), have discerned the \u201cartel principle\u201d in the fact that some grating establishments belong to several owners. Our sharp-eyed Narodniks have contrived to observe a special \u201cprinciple\u201d in the association of rural entrepreneurs, and have failed to see any new social-economic \u201cprinciples\u201d in the very existence and development of a class of rural entrepreneurs.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance , no., Orlov\u2019s Directory, st and rd editions. We do not give figures for the number of establishments because our factory statistics confuse small agricultural oil-pressing establishments with big industrial ones, at times including the former, and at others not including them for different gubernias at different times. In the s, for example, a host of small oil presses were included in the category of \u201cworks.\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For example, in ,  works out of  had an output valued at ,, rubles out of ,, rubles. This victory of the industrial over the rural entrepreneurs is causing profound dissatisfaction among our agrarians (e.g., Mr. S. Korolenko, loc. cit.) and our Narodniks (e.g., Mr. N-on\u2019s Sketches, pp. -). We do not share their views. The big works will raise the productivity of labour and socialise production. That is one point. Another is that the workers the workers conditions in the big works will probably be better, and not only from the material angle, than at the small agricultural oil presses.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] V.

Industrial Vegetable and Fruit Growing; Suburban Farming\nWith the fall of serfdom, \u201clandlord fruit growing,\u201d which had been developed on quite a considerable scale, \u201csuddenly and rapidly fell into decline almost all over Russia.\u201d[] The construction of railways changed the situation, giving a \u201ctremendous impetus\u201d to the development of new, commercial fruit growing, and brought about a \u201ccomplete change for the better\u201d in this branch of commercial agriculture.[] On the one hand, the influx of cheap fruit from the South undermined the industry in the centres where it was formerly conducted[]; and on the other hand, industrial fruit growing developed, for example, in the Kovno, Vilna, Minsk, Grodno, Mogilev and Nizhni-Novgorod gubernias, along with the expansion of the fruit market.[] Mr. V. Pashkevich points out that an investigation into the condition of fruit farming in - revealed a considerable development of it as an industrial branch of agriculture in the previous ten years, an increase in the demand for gardeners, undergardeners, etc.[] Statistics confirm such views: the amount of fruit carried by the Russian railways is increasing,[] fruit imports, which increased in the first decade after the Reform, are declining.[]\n\nIt stands to reason that commercial vegetable growing, which provides articles of consumption for incomparably larger masses of the population than fruit growing does, has developed still more rapidly and still more extensively. Industrial vegetable growing becomes widespread, firstly, near the towns[] ; secondly, near factory and commercial and industrial settlements[] and also along the railways; and thirdly, in certain villages, scattered throughout Russia and famous for their vegetables.[] It should be observed that there is a demand for this type of produce not only among the industrial, but also among the agricultural population: let us recall that the budgets of the Voronezh peasants show a per-capita expenditure on vegetables of  kopeks, more than half of this expenditure being on purchased produce.\n\nTo acquaint ourselves with the social and economic relations that arise in this type of commercial agriculture we must turn to the data of local investigations in the particularly developed vegetable-growing areas. Near St. Petersburg, for example, frame and hot-house vegetable growing is widely developed, having been introduced by migratory vegetable growers from Rostov. The number of frames owned by big growers runs into thousands, and by medium growers, into hundreds. \u201cSome of the big vegetable growers supply tens of thousands of poods of pickled cabbage to the army.\u201d[] According to Zemstvo statistics in Petersburg Uyezd  households of the local population are engaged in vegetable growing (about  rubles income per household) and  in fruit growing. Capitalist relations are very extensively developed both in the form of merchant\u2019s capital (the industry is \u201cruthlessly exploited by profiteers\u201d) and in the form of hiring workers. Among the immigrant population, for example, there are  master vegetable growers (with an income of over , rubles each) and  worker vegetable growers (with an income of  rubles each.)[]\n\nThe peasant vegetable growers near Moscow are the same sort of typical members of the rural bourgeoisie. \u201cAccording to an approximate estimate, over  million poods of vegetables and greens reach Moscow\u2019s markets every year. Some of the villages do a big trade in pickled vegetables: Nogatino Volost sells nearly a million vedros of pickled cabbage to factories and barracks, and even sends consignments to Kronstadt. . . . Commercial vegetable growing is widespread in all the Moscow uyezds, chiefly in the vicinity of towns and factories.\u201d[] \u201cThe cabbage is chopped by hired labourers who come from Volokolamsk Uyezd\u201d (Historico-Statistical Survey, I, p. ).\n\nExactly similar relations exist in the well-known vegetable-growing district in Rostov Uyezd, Yaroslavl Gubernia, embracing  vegetable-growing villages\u2014Porechye, Ugodichi and others. All the land, except pastures and meadows, has long been turned into vegetable fields. The technical processing of vegetables\u2014preserving\u2014is highly developed.[] Together with the product of the land, the land itself and labour-power are converted into commodities. Despite the \u201cvillage community,\u201d the inequality of land tenure, for example, in the village of Porechye, is very great: in one case a family of  has  \u201cvegetable plots,\u201d in another a family of  has ; this is explained by the fact that no periodical land redistribution takes place here; only private redivisions take place, and the peasants \u201cfreely exchange\u201d their \u201cvegetable plots\u201d or \u201cpatches\u201d (Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia, \u2013).[] \u201cA large part of the field-work . . . is done by male and female day labourers, many of whom come to Porechye in the summer season both from neighbouring villages and from neighbouring gubernias\u201d (ibid., ). It is estimated that in the whole of Yaroslavl Gubernia , persons (of whom , are from Rostov) engaged in \u201cagriculture and vegetable growing\u201d are migratory workers\u2014i.e., in the majority of cases are wage-workers in the given occupation.[] The above quoted data on the migration of rural workers to the metropolitan gubernias,[] Yaroslavl Gubernia, etc., should be brought into connection with the development not only of dairy farming but also of commercial vegetable growing.\n\nVegetable growing also includes the hot-house cultivation of vegetables, an industry that is rapidly developing among the well-to-do peasants of Moscow and Tver gubernias.[] In the first-named gubernia the - census showed  establishments with , frames; there were  workers, of whom  (.%) were hired; the total output was valued at , rubles. The average hot-house vegetable grower had to put at least  rubles into the \u201cbusiness.\u201d Of the  peasants for whom house-to-house returns are given,  possess purchased land, and as many rent land, there is an average of . horses per peasant. It is clear from this that the hot-house vegetable industry is only within the reach of members of the peasant bourgeoisie.[]\n\nIn the south of Russia melon growing also comes within the type of commercial agriculture under review. Here are some brief observations about its development in a district described in an interesting article in the Vestnik Finansov (, No. ) on \u201cindustrial melon growing.\u201d This branch of production arose in the village of Bykovo (Tsarev Uyezd, Astrakhan Gubernia) at the end of the s and the beginning of the s. The melons, which at first went only to the Volga region, were consigned, with the coming of the railways, to the capital cities. In the s the output \u201cincreased at least tenfold\u201d owing to the enormous profits ( to  rubles per dess.) made by the initiators of the business. Like true petty bourgeois, they did all they could to prevent the number of growers from increasing and were most careful in guarding from their neighbours the \u201csecret\u201d of this new and profitable occupation. Of course, all these heroic efforts of the \u201cmuzhik cultivator\u201d[] to stave off \u201cfatal competition\u201d[] were in vain, and the industry spread much wider\u2014to Saratov Gubernia and the Don region. The drop in grain prices in the s gave a particularly strong impetus to production, compelling \u201clocal cultivators to seek a way out of their difficulties in crop rotation systems.\u201d[] The expansion of production considerably increased the demand for hired labour (melon growing requires a considerable amount of labour, so that the cultivation of one dessiatine costs from  to  rubles), and still more considerably increased the profits of the employers and ground-rent. Near \u201cLog\u201d Station (Gryazi-Tsaritsyn Railway), the area under water-melons in  was  dess., in  between  and  dess., and in  between , and , dess., while rent rose from  kopeks to between . and  rubles and to between  and  rubles per dess. for the respective years. The over-rapid expansion of melon planting led at last, in , to overproduction and a crisis, which finally confirmed the capitalist character of this branch of commercial agriculture. Melon prices fell to a point where they did not cover railway charges. The melons were left ungathered in the fields. After tasting tremendous profits the entrepreneurs now learned what losses were like. But the most interesting thing is the means they have chosen for combating the crisis: the means chosen is to win new markets, to effect such a cheapening of produce and of railway tariffs as to transform it from an item of luxury into an item of consumption for the people (and at points of production, into cattle feed). \u201cIndustrial melon growing,\u201d the entrepreneurs assure us, \u201cis on the road to further development; apart from high railway tariffs there is no obstacle to its further growth. On the contrary, the Tsaritsyn-Tikhoretskaya Railway now under construction . . . opens a new and extensive area for industrial melon growing.\u201d Whatever the further destiny of this \u201cindustry\u201d may be, at any rate the history of the \u201cmelon crisis\u201d is very instructive, constituting a miniature picture, it is true, but a very vivid one, of the capitalist evolution of agriculture.\n\nWe still have to say a few words about suburban farming. The difference between it and the above-described types of commercial agriculture is that in their case the entire farm is adapted to some one chief market product. In the case of suburban farming, however, the small cultivator trades in bits of everything: he trades in his house by letting it to summer tenants and permanent lodgers, in his yard, in his horse and in all sorts of produce from his fields and farmyard: grain, cattle feed, milk, meat, vegetables, berries, fish, timber, etc.; he trades in his wife\u2019s milk (baby-farming near the capitals), he makes money by rendering the most diverse (not always even mentionable) services to visiting townsfolk,[] etc., etc.[] The complete transformation by capitalism of the ancient type of patriarchal farmer, the complete subjugation of the latter to the \u201cpower of money\u201d is expressed here so vividly that the suburban peasant is usually put in a separate category by the Narodnik who says that he is \u201cno longer a peasant.\u201d But the difference between this type and all preceding types is only one of form. The political and economic essence of the all-round transformation effected in the small cultivator by capitalism is everywhere the same. The more rapid the increase in the number of towns, the number of factory, commercial and industrial townships, and the number of railway stations, the more extensive is the area of the transformation of our \u201cvillage community man\u201d into this type of peasant. We should not forget what was said in his day by Adam Smith\u2014that improved communications tend to convert every village into a suburb.[] Remote areas cut off from the outside world, already an exception, are with every passing day increasingly becoming as rare as antiquities, and the cultivator is turning with ever-growing rapidity into an industrialist subjected to the general laws of commodity production.\n\nIn thus concluding the review of the data on the growth of commercial agriculture, we think it not superfluous to repeat here that our aim has been to examine the main (by no means all) forms of commercial agriculture.\n\nNotes\n[] Historico-Statistical Survey, I, p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For example, in Moscow Gubernia.

Conclusions on the Significance of Capitalism in Russian Agriculture\nIn chapters II-IV the problem of capitalism in Russian agriculture has been examined from two angles. First we examined the existing system of social and economic relations in peasant and landlord economy, the system which has taken shape in the post-Reform period. It was seen that the peasantry have been splitting up at enormous speed into a numerically small but economically strong rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat. Inseparably connected with this \u201cdepeasantising\u201d process is the landowners\u2019 transition from the labour-service to the capitalist system of farming. Then we examined this same process from another angle: we took as our starting-point the manner in which agriculture is transformed into commodity production, and examined the social and economic relations characteristic of each of the principal forms of commercial agriculture. It was shown that the very same processes were conspicuous in both peasant and private-landowner farming under a great variety of agricultural conditions.\n\nLet us now examine the conclusions that follow from all the data given above.\n\n) The main feature of the post-Reform evolution of agriculture is its growing commercial, entrepreneur character. As regards private-landowner farming, this fact is so obvious as to require no special explanation. As regards peasant farming, however, it is not so easily established, firstly, because the employment of hired labour is not an absolutely essential feature of the small rural bourgeoisie. As we have observed above, this category includes every small commodity-producer who covers his expenditure by independent farming, provided the general system of economy is based on the capitalist contradictions examined in Chapter II. Secondly, the small rural bourgeois (in Russia, as in other capitalist countries) is connected by a number of transitional stages with the small-holding \u201cpeasant,\u201d and with the rural proletarian who has been allotted a patch of land. This circumstance is one of the reasons for the viability of the theories which do not distinguish the existence of a rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat among \u201cthe peasantry.\u201d[]\n\n) From the very nature of agriculture its transformation into commodity production proceeds in a special way, unlike the corresponding process in industry. Manufacturing industry splits up into separate, quite independent branches, each devoted exclusively to the manufacture of one product or one part of a product. The agricultural industry, however, does not split up into quite separate branches, but merely specialises in one market product in one case, and in another market product in another, all the other aspects of agriculture being adapted to this principal (i.e., market) product. That is why the forms of commercial agriculture show immense diversity, varying not only in different areas, but also on different farms. That is why, when examining the question of the growth of commercial agriculture, we must on no account confine ourselves to gross data for agricultural production as a whole.[]\n\n) The growth of commercial agriculture creates a home market for capitalism. Firstly, the specialisation of agriculture gives rise to exchange between the various agricultural areas, between the various agricultural undertakings, and between the various agricultural products. Secondly, the further agriculture is drawn into the sphere of commodity circulation the more rapid is the growth of the demand made by the rural population for those products of manufacturing industry that serve for personal consumption; and thirdly, the more rapid is the growth of the demand for means of production, since neither the small nor the big rural entrepreneur is able, with the old-fashioned \u201cpeasant\u201d implements, buildings, etc., etc., to engage in the new, commercial agriculture. Fourthly and lastly, a demand is created for labour-power, since the formation of a small rural bourgeoisie and the change-over by the landowners to capitalist farming presuppose the formation of a body of regular agricultural labourers and day labourers. Only the fact of the growth of commercial agriculture can explain the circumstance that the post-Reform period is characterised by an expansion of the home market for capitalism (development of capitalist agriculture, development of factory industry in general, development of the agricultural engineering industry in particular, development of the so-called peasant \u201cagricultural industries,\u201d i.e., work for hire, etc.).\n\n) Capitalism enormously extends and intensifies among the agricultural population the contradictions without which this mode of production cannot exist. Notwithstanding this, however, agricultural capitalism in Russia, in its historical significance, is a big progressive force. Firstly, capitalism has transformed the cultivator from a \u201clord of the manor,\u201d on the one hand, and a patriarchal, dependent peasant, on the other, into the same sort of industrialist that every other proprietor is in present-day society. Before capitalism appeared, agriculture in Russia was the business of the gentry, a lord\u2019s hobby for some, and a duty, an obligation for others; consequently, it could not be conducted except according to age-old routine, necessarily involving the complete isolation of the cultivator from all that went on in the world beyond the confines of his village. The labour-service system\u2014that living survival of old times in present-day economy\u2014strikingly confirms this characterisation. Capitalism for the first time broke with the system of social estates in land tenure by converting the land into a commodity. The farmer\u2019s product was put on sale and began to be subject to social reckoning\u2014first in the local, then in the national, and finally in the international market, and in this way the former isolation of the uncouth farmer from the rest of the world was completely broken down. The farmer was compelled willy nilly, on pain of ruin, to take account of the sum-total of social relations both in his own country and in other countries, now linked together by the world market. Even the labour-service system, which formerly guaranteed Oblomov an assured income without any risk on his part, without any expenditure of capital, without any changes in the age-old routine of production, now proved incapable of saving him from the competition of the American farmer. That is why one can fully apply to post-Reform Russia what was said half a century ago about Western Europe\u2014that agricultural capitalism hag been \u201cthe motive force which has drawn the idyll into the movement of history.\u201d[]\nSecondly, agricultural capitalism has for the first time undermined the age-old stagnation of our agriculture; it has given a tremendous impetus to the transformation of its technique, and to the development of the productive forces of social labour. A few decades of \u201cdestructive work\u201d by capitalism have done more in this respect than entire centuries of preceding history. The monotony of routine natural economy has been replaced by a diversity of forms of commercial agriculture; primitive agricultural implements have begun to yield place to improved implements and machines; the immobility of the old-fashioned farming systems has been undermined by new methods of agriculture. The course of all these changes is linked inseparably with the above-mentioned phenomenon of the specialisation of agriculture. By its very nature, capitalism in agriculture (as in industry) cannot develop evenly: in one place (in one country, in one area, on one farm) it pushes forward one aspect of agriculture, in another place another aspect, etc. In one case it transforms the technique of some, and in other cases of other agricultural operations, divorcing them from patriarchal peasant economy or from the patriarchal labour-service. Since the whole of this process is guided by market requirements that are capricious and not always known to the producer, capitalist agriculture, in each separate instance (often in each separate area, sometimes even in each separate country), becomes more one sided and lopsided than that which preceded it, but, taken as a whole, becomes immeasurably more many-sided and rational than patriarchal agriculture. The emergence of separate types of commercial agriculture renders possible and inevitable capitalist crises in agriculture and cases of capitalist overproduction, but these crises (like all capitalist crises) give a still more powerful impetus to the development of world production and of the socialisation of labour.[]\n\nThirdly, capitalism has for the first time created in Russia large-scale agricultural production based on the employment of machines and the extensive co-operation of workers. Before capitalism appeared, the production of agricultural produce was always carried on in an unchanging, wretchedly small way\u2014both when the peasant worked for himself and when he worked for the landlord\u2014and no \u201ccommunity character\u201d of land tenure was capable of destroying this tremendously scattered production. Inseparably linked with this scattered production was the scattered nature of the farmers themselves.[] Tied to their allotment, to their tiny \u201cvillage community,\u201d they were completely fenced off even from the peasants of the neighbouring village community by the difference in the categories to which they belonged (former landowners\u2019 peasants, former state peasants, etc.), by differences in the size of their holdings\u2014by differences in the terms on which their emancipation took place (which terms were sometimes determined simply by the individual attributes of the landlords and by their whims). Capitalism for the first time broke down these purely medieval barriers\u2014and it was a very good thing that it did. Now the differences between the various grades of peasants, between the various categories based on the size of allotment holdings, are far less important than the economic differences within each grade, each category and each village community. Capitalism destroys local seclusion and insularity, and replaces the minute medieval divisions among cultivators by a major division, embracing the whole nation, that divides them into classes occupying different positions in the general system of capitalist economy.[] The mass of cultivators were formerly tied to their place of residence by the very conditions of production, whereas the creation of diverse forms and diverse areas of commercial and capitalist agriculture could not but cause the movement of enormous masses of the population throughout the country; and unless the population is mobile (as we have said above) there can be no question of developing its understanding and initiative.\n\nFourthly, and lastly, agricultural capitalism in Russia for the first time cut at the root of labour-service and the personal dependency of the farmer. This system of labour-service has held undivided sway in our agriculture from the days of Russkaya Pravda[] down to the present day cultivation of the fields of private landowners with the peasants\u2019 implements; the wretchedness and uncouthness of the farmer, degraded by his labour being \u201csemi-free\u201d if not feudal, in character, are inevitable concomitants of this system; if the civil rights of the cultivator had not been impaired (by, for example, his belonging to the lowest social estate; corporal punishment; assignment to public works; attachment to allotment, etc.) the labour-service system would have been impossible. That is why agricultural capitalism in Russia has performed a great historical service in replacing labour-service by hired labour.[] Summing up what has been said above on the progressive historical role of Russian agricultural capitalism, it may be said that it is socialising agricultural production. Indeed, the fact that agriculture has been transformed from the privileged occupation of the top estate or the duty of the bottom estate into an ordinary commercial and industrial occupation; that the product of the cultivator\u2019s labour has become subject to social reckoning on the market; that routine, uniform agriculture is being converted into technically transformed and diverse forms of commercial farming; that the local seclusion and scattered nature of the small farmers is breaking down; that the diverse forms of bondage and personal dependence are being replaced by impersonal transactions in the purchase and sale of labour-power, these are all links in a single process, which is socialising agricultural labour and is increasingly intensifying the contradiction between the anarchy of market fluctuations, between the individual character of the separate agricultural enterprises and the collective character of large-scale capitalist agriculture.\n\nThus (we repeat once more), in emphasising the progressive historical role of capitalism in Russian agriculture we do not in the least forget either the historically transient character of this economic regime or the profound social contradictions inherent in it. On the contrary, we have shown above that it is precisely the Narodniks who, capable only of bewailing the \u201cdestructive work\u201d of capitalism, give an extremely superficial appraisal of these contradictions, glossing over the differentiation of the peasantry, ignoring the capitalist character of the employment of machinery in our agriculture, and covering up with such expressions as \u201cagricultural industries\u201d and \u201cemployments\u201d the emergence of a class of agricultural wage-workers.\n\nNotes\n[] The favourite proposition of the Narodnik economists that \u201cRussian peasant farming is in the majority of cases purely natural economy\u201d is, incidentally, built up by ignoring this fact. (The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices, I, .) One has but to take \u201caverage\u201d figures, which lump together both the rural bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat\u2014and this proposition will pass as proved!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It is to data of this kind that the authors of the book mentioned in the preceding note confine themselves when they speak of \u201cthe peasantry.\u201d They assume that every peasant sows just those cereals that he consumes, that he sows all those types of cereals that he consumes, and that he sows them in just that proportion in which they are consumed. It does not require much effort to \u201cdeduce\u201d from such \u201cassumptions\u201d (which contradict the facts and ignore the main feature of the post-Reform period) that natural economy predominates.\n\nIn Narodnik literature one may also encounter the following ingenious method of argument: each separate type of commercial agriculture is an \u201cexception\u201d\u2014by comparison with agriculture as a whole. Hence, all commercial agriculture in general, it is averred, must be regarded as an exception, and natural economy must be considered the general rule! In college textbooks on logic, in the section on sophisms, numerous parallels of such lines of reasoning are to be found.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mis\u00e8re de la philosophie (Paris, ), p. ; the author contemptuously describes as reactionary jeremiads, the longings of those who thirst for a return to the good old patriarchal life, simple manners, etc, and who condemn the \u201csubjection of the soil to the laws which dominate all other industries.\u201d[]\n\nWe are fully aware that to the Narodniks the whole of the argument given in the text may appear not only unconvincing but positively unintelligible, But it would be too thankless a task to analyse in detail such opinions as, for example, that the purchase-and-sale of the land is an \u201cabnormal\u201d phenomenon (Mr. Chuprov, in the debate on grain prices, p.  of the verbatim report), that the inalienability of the peasants\u2019 allotments is an institution that can be defended, that the labour-service system of farming is better, or at all events no worse, than the capitalist system, etc. All that has been said above goes to refute the political and economic arguments advanced by the Narodniks in support of such views.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The West-European romanticists and Russian Narodniks strongly emphasise in this process the one-sidedness of capitalist agriculture, the instability created by capitalism, and crises\u2014and on this basis deny the progressive character of capitalist advance as compared with pre-capitalist stagnation.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Accordingly, notwithstanding the difference in the forms of land tenure, one can fully apply to the Russian peasant what Marx said of the small French peasant: \u201cThe small-holding peasants form a vast mass, the members of which live in similar conditions but without entering into manifold relations with one another. Their mode of production isolates them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse. The isolation is increased by France\u2019s bad means of communication and by the poverty of the peasants. Their field of production (Produktionsfeld ), the small holding, admits of no division of labour in its cultivation, no application of science and, therefore, no diversity of development, no variety of talent, no wealth of social relationships. Each individual peasant family is almost self-sufficient, it itself directly produces the major part of its consumption and thus acquires its means of life more through exchange with nature than in intercourse with society. A small holding, a peasant and his family; alongside them another small holding, another peasant and another family. A few score of these make up a village, and a few score of villages make up a Department. In this way, the great mass of the French nation is formed by simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes.\u201d (Der achtzehnte Brumaire des Louis Bonaparte, Hmb., , S. \u2013.)[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cThe need for association, for organisation in capitalist society, has not diminished but, on the contrary, has grown immeasurably. But it is utterly absurd to measure this need of the new society with the old yardstick. This new society is already demanding firstly, that the association shall not be according to locality, social-estate or category; secondly, that its starting-point shall be the difference in status and interests that has been created by capitalism and by the differentiation of the peasantry.\u201d [V. Ilyin, loc. cit., pp. - footnote. (See present edition, Vol. , \u201cA Characterisation of Economic Romanticism.\u201d\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Russian Law.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] One of Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s innumerable plaints and lamentations over the destructive work of capitalism in Russia deserves special attention: \u201c. . . Neither the strife among the appanage princes nor the Tartar invasion affected the forms of our economic life\u201d (Sketches, p. ); only capitalism has displayed \u201ccontempt for its own historical past\u201d (p. ). The sacred truth! Capitalism in Russian agriculture is progressive precisely because it has displayed \u201ccontempt\u201d for the \u201cage-old\u201d, \u201ctime-hallowed\u201d forms of labour-service and bondage, which, indeed, no political storms, the \u201cstrife among the appanage princes\u201d and the \u201cTartar invasion\u201d inclusive, were able to destroy.\u2014Lenin\n\nX. Narodnik Theories on Capitalism in Agriculture. \u201cThe Freeing of Winter Time\u201d\nThe foregoing positive conclusions regarding the significance of capitalism must be supplemented by an examination of certain special \u201ctheories\u201d on this question current in our literature. Our Narodniks in most cases have been totally unable to digest Marx\u2019s fundamental views on agricultural capitalism. The more candid among them have bluntly declared that Marx\u2019s theory does not cover agriculture (Mr. V. V. in Our Trends ), while others (like Mr. N.\u2013on) have preferred diplomatically to evade the question of the relation between their \u201cpostulates\u201d and Marx\u2019s theory. One of the postulates most widespread among the Narodnik economists is the theory of \u201cthe freeing of winter time.\u201d The essence of it is as follows.[]\n\nUnder the capitalist system agriculture becomes a separate industry, unconnected with the others. However, it is not carried on the whole year but only for five or six months. Therefore, the capitalisation of agriculture leads to \u201cthe freeing of winter time,\u201d to the \u201climitation of the working time of the agricultural class to part of the working year,\u201d which is the \u201cfundamental cause of the deterioration of the economic conditions of the agricultural classes\u201d (N.\u2013on, ), of the \u201cdiminishing of the home market\u201d and of \u201cthe wastage of the productive forces\u201d of society (Mr. V. V.).\n\nHere you have the whole of this celebrated theory, which bases the most sweeping historical and philosophical conclusions solely on the great truth that in agriculture jobs are distributed over the year very unevenly! To take this one feature, to reduce it to absurdity by means of abstract assumptions, to discard all the other specific features of the complex process which transforms patriarchal agriculture into capitalist agriculture\u2014such are the simple methods used in this latest attempt to restore the romantic theories about pre-capitalist \u201cpeople\u2019s production.\u201d\n\nTo show how inordinately narrow this abstract postulate is, let us indicate briefly those aspects of the actual process that are either entirely lost sight of, or are underrated by our Narodniks. Firstly, the further the specialisation of agriculture proceeds, the more the agricultural population decreases, becoming an ever-diminishing part of the total population. The Narodniks forget this, although in their abstractions they raise the specialisation of agriculture to a level it hardly ever reaches in actual fact. They assume that only the operations of sowing and reaping grain have become a separate industry; the cultivation and the manuring of the soil, the processing and the carting of produce, stock raising, forestry, the repair of buildings and implements, etc., etc.\u2014all these operations have been turned into separate capitalist industries. The application of such abstractions to present-day realities will not contribute much towards explaining them. Secondly, the assumption that agriculture undergoes such complete specialisation presupposes a purely capitalist organisation of agriculture, a complete division into capitalist farmers and wage-workers. To talk under such circumstances about \u201cthe peasant\u201d (as Mr. N.\u2013on does, p. ) is the height of illogicality. The purely capitalist organisation of agriculture presupposes, in its turn, a more even distribution of jobs throughout the year (due to crop rotation, rational stock raising, etc.), the combination with agriculture, in many cases, of the technical processing of produce, the application of a greater quantity of labour to the preparation of the soil, etc.[] Thirdly, capitalism presupposes the complete separation of agricultural from industrial enterprises. But whence does it follow that this separation does not permit the combination of agricultural and industrial wage-labour ? We find such a combination in developed capitalist society everywhere. Capitalism separates the skilled workers from the plain labourers, the unskilled, who pass from one occupation to another, now drawn into jobs at some large enterprise, and now thrown into the ranks of the workless.[] The greater the development of capitalism and large-scale industry, the greater, in general, are the fluctuations in the demand for workers not only in agriculture, but also in industry.[] Therefore, if we presuppose the maximum development of capitalism, we must also presuppose the maximum facility for the transfer of workers from agricultural to non-agricultural occupations, we must presuppose the formation of a general reserve army from which labour-power is drawn by all sorts of employers. Fourthly, if we take the present-day rural employers, it cannot, of course, be denied that sometimes they experience difficulty in providing their farms with. workers. But it must not be for gotten, either, that they have a means of tying the workers to their farms, namely, by allotting them patches of land, etc. The allotment-holding farm labourer or day labourer is a type common to all capitalist countries. One of the chief errors of the Narodniks is that they ignore the formation of a similar type in Russia. Fifthly, it is quite wrong to discuss the freeing of the farmer\u2019s winter time independently of the general question of capitalist surplus-population. The formation of a reserve army of unemployed is characteristic of capitalism in general, and the specific features of agriculture merely give rise to special forms of this phenomenon. That is why the author of Capital, for instance, deals with the distribution of employment in agriculture in connection with the question of \u201crelative surplus-population,\u201d[] as well as in a special chapter where he discusses the difference between the \u201cworking period\u201d and the \u201ctime of production\u201d (Das Kapital, II. B., Chapter ). The working period is the period in which labour is applied to the product; the time of production is the time during which the product is in production, including the period in which labour is not applied to it. The working period does not coincide with the time of production in very many industries, among which agriculture is merely the most typical, but by no means the only one.[] In Russia, as compared with other European countries, the difference between the working period in agriculture and the time of production is a particularly big one. \u201cWhen capitalist production later accomplishes the separation of manufacture and agriculture, the rural labourer becomes ever more dependent on merely casual accessory employment and his condition deteriorates thereby. For capital . . . all differences in the turnover are evened out. Not so for the labourer\u201d (ibid., \u2013).[] So then, the only conclusion that follows from the specific features of agriculture in the instance under review is that the position of the agricultural worker must be even worse than that of the industrial worker. This is still a very long way from Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d that the freeing of winter time is the \u201cfundamental reason\u201d for the deterioration of the conditions of the \u201cagricultural classes\u201d (?!). If the working period in our agriculture equalled  months, the process of the development of capitalism would go on exactly as it does now; the entire difference would be that the conditions of the agricultural worker would come somewhat closer to those of the industrial worker.[]\n\nThus the \u201ctheory\u201d of Messrs. V. V. and N.\u2013on makes absolutely no contribution whatever even to the general problem of the development of agricultural capitalism. As for the specific features of Russia, it not only does not explain them, but on the contrary obscures them. Winter unemployment among our peasantry depends not so much on capitalism as on the inadequate development of capitalism. We have shown above (\u00a7IV of this chapter), from the data on wages, that of the Great-Russian gubernias, winter unemployment is most prevalent in those where capitalism is least developed and where labour-service prevails. That is quite understandable. Labour-service retards the. development of labour productivity, retards the development of industry and agriculture, and, consequently, the demand for labour-power, and at the same time, while tying the peasant to his allotment, provides him neither with employment in winter time nor with the possibility of existing by his wretched farming.\n\nNotes\n[] V.

Average male days, ; fluctuations: from  (February) to  (November). Average female days ; fluctuations: from  (January) to  (March). Is this reality anything like the abstraction the Narodniks are busying themselves with?\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Large-scale capitalist industry creates a nomad working class. It is formed from the rural population, but is chiefly engaged in industrial occupations. \u201cThey are the light infantry of capital, thrown by it, according to its needs, now to this point, now to that. . . . Nomad labour is used for various operations of building and draining, brick making, lime-burning, railway-making, etc.\u201d (Das Kapital, I, S. [].) \u201cIn general such large-scale undertakings as railways with draw a definite quantity of labour-power from the labour-market, which can come only from certain branches of economy, for example, agriculture . . .\u201d (ibid., II. B., S. ).[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For example the Moscow Medical Statistics placed the number of factory workers in this gubernia at ,; this was the number at work; the highest figure was , and the lowest, , (General Summary, etc., Vol. IV, Pt. I, p. ); in percentages: %\u2014%\u2014 %. By increasing, in general, the fluctuations in the number of workers, capitalism evens out, in this respect too, the differences between industry and agriculture.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For example, in regard to the agricultural relations of England, Marx says: \u201cThere are always too many agricultural labourers for the ordinary, and always too few for the exceptional or temporary needs of the cultivation of the soil\u201d (I, ),[] so that, notwithstanding the permanent \u201crelative surplus-population,\u201d the countryside seems to be inadequately populated. As capitalist production takes possession of agriculture, says Marx in another place, a surplus rural population is formed. \u201cPart of the agricultural population is therefore constantly on the point of passing over into an urban or manufacturing proletariat\u201d (ibid., )[]; this part of the population suffers chronically from unemployment; the work it gets is extremely irregular and is the worst paid (e.g., working at home for shops, etc.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Particularly noteworthy in this connection is Marx\u2019s observation that in agriculture too there are ways of distributing the demand for labour \u201cmore evenly over the entire year,\u201d namely, by raising a greater variety of products, by substituting crop rotation for the three-field system, cultivating root-crops, grasses, etc. but all these methods \u201crequire an increase of the circulating capital advanced in production, invested in wages, fertilisers, seed, etc.\u201d (ibid., S. -).[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] We say \u201csomewhat,\u201d because the deterioration of the conditions of the agricultural worker is far from being due to irregularity of employment alone.\u2014Lenin\n\nXI. Continuation.\u2014The Village Community.\u2014Marx\u2019s Views on Small-Scale Agriculture.\u2014Engels\u2019 Opinion of the Contemporary Agricultural Crisis\n\u201cThe community principle prevents capital from seizing agricultural production,\u201d\u2014that is how Mr. N.\u2014on (p. ) expresses another current Narodnik theory, formulated in just as abstract a fashion as the previous one. In Chapter II we quoted a series of facts showing the fallacy of this stock premise. Now let us add the following. It is a great mistake to think that the inception of agricultural capitalism itself requires some special- form of land tenure. \u201cBut the form of landed property with which the incipient capitalist mode of production is confronted does not suit it. It first creates for itself the form required by subordinating agriculture to capital. It thus transforms feudal landed property, clan property, small-peasant property in mark communes[] (Markgemeinschaft)\u2014no matter how divergent their juristic forms may be\u2014into the economic form corresponding to the requirements of this mode of production\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , ). Thus, by the very nature of the case, no peculiarities in the system of land tenure can serve as an insurmountable obstacle to capitalism, which assumes different forms in accordance with the different conditions in agriculture, legal relationships and manner of life. One can see from this how wrong is the very presentation of the question by our Narodniks, who have created a whole literature on the subject of \u201cvillage community or capitalism?\u201d Should some Anglomaniac aristocrat happen to offer a prize for the best work on the introduction of capitalist farming in Russia, should some learned society come forward with a scheme to settle peasants on farmsteads, should some idle government official concoct a project for -dessiatine holdings, the Narodnik hastens to throw down the gauntlet and fling himself into the fray against these \u201cbourgeois projects\u201d to \u201cintroduce capitalism\u201d and destroy that Palladium of \u201cpeople\u2019s industry,\u201d the village community. It has never entered the head of our good Narodnik that capitalism has been proceeding on its way while all sorts of projects have been drafted and refuted, and the community village has been turning, and has actually turned,[] into the village of small agrarians.\n\nThat is why we are very indifferent to the question of the form of peasant land tenure. Whatever the form of land tenure may be, the relation between the peasant bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat will not undergo any essential change. The really important question concerns not the form of land tenure at all, but the remnants of the purely medieval past, which continue to weigh down upon the peasantry\u2014the social-estate seclusion of the peasant communities, collective responsibility, excessively high taxation of peasant land out of all proportion to the taxation of privately-held land, the absence of full freedom in the purchase and sale of peasant lands, and in the movement and settlement of the peasantry.[] All these obsolete institutions, while not in the least safeguarding the peasantry against break-up, only lead to the multiplication of diverse forms of labour-service and bondage, to tremendous delay in social development as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion we must deal with an original Narodnik attempt to give an interpretation to some statements made by Marx and Engels in Volume III of Capital, in favour of their views that small-scale agriculture is superior to large-scale, and that agricultural capitalism does not play a progressive historical role. Quite often, with this end in view, they quote the following passage from Volume III of Capital :\n\n\u201cThe moral of history, also to be deduced from other observations concerning agriculture, is that the capitalist system works against a rational agriculture, or that a rational agriculture is incompatible with the capitalist system (although the latter promotes technical improvements in agriculture), and needs either the hand of the small farmer living by his own labour (selbst arbeitenden ) or the control of associated producers\u201d (III, , . Russ. trans., ).[]\n\nWhat follows from this assertion (which, let us note in passing, is an absolutely isolated fragment that has found its way into a chapter dealing with the way changes in the prices of raw materials affect profits, and not into Part VI, which deals specifically with agriculture)? That capitalism is incompatible with the rational organisation of agriculture (as also of industry) has long been known; nor is that the point at issue with the Narodniks. And the progressive historical role of capitalism in agriculture is especially emphasised by Marx here. There remains Marx\u2019s reference to the \u201csmall peasant living by his own labour.\u201d None of the Narodniks who have referred to this point has taken the trouble to explain how he understands this, has taken the trouble to connect this point with the context, on the one hand, and with Marx\u2019s general theory of small-scale agriculture, on the other. \u2014In the passage quoted from Capital the point dealt with is how considerably the prices of raw materials fluctuate, how these fluctuations disturb the proportionality and systematic working of production, how they disturb the conformity of agriculture and industry. It is only in this respect\u2014in respect of the proportionality, systematic working and planned operation of production\u2014that Marx places small peasant economy on a par with the economy of \u201cassociated producers.\u201d In this respect, even small medieval industry (handicraft) is similar to the economy of \u201cassociated producers\u201d (cf. Mis\u00e8re de la philosophie, edition cited, p. ), whereas capitalism differs from both these systems of social economy in its anarchy of production. By what logic can one draw the conclusion from this that Marx admitted the viability of small-scale agriculture,[] that he did not acknowledge the progressive historical role of capitalism in agriculture? Here is what Marx said about this in the special part dealing with agriculture, in the special section on small peasant economy (Chapter , \u00a7 V):\n\n\u201cProprietorship of land parcels by its very nature excludes the development of social productive forces of labour, social forms of labour, social concentration of capital, large-scale cattle raising, and the progressive application of science.\n\n\u201cUsury and a taxation system must impoverish it every where. The expenditure of capital in the price of the land withdraws this capital from cultivation. An infinite fragmentation of means of production, and isolation of the producers themselves. Monstrous waste of human energy. Progressive deterioration of conditions of production and increased prices of means of production\u2014an inevitable law of proprietorship of parcels. Calamity of seasonal abundance for this mode of production\u201d (III, , -. Russ. trans., ).[]\n\n\u201cSmall landed property presupposes that the overwhelming majority of the population is rural, and that not social, but isolated labour predominates; and that, therefore, under such conditions wealth and development of reproduction, both of its material and spiritual prerequisites, are out of the question, and thereby also the prerequisites for rational cultivation\u201d (III, , . Russ. trans., p. ).[]\n\nThe writer of these lines, far from closing his eyes to the contradictions inherent in large-scale capitalist agriculture, ruthlessly exposed them. But this did not prevent him from appreciating the historical role of capitalism:\n\n\u201c...One of the major results of the capitalist mode of production is that, on the one hand, it transforms agriculture from a mere empirical and mechanical self-perpetuating process employed by the least developed part of society into the conscious scientific application of agronomy, in so far as this is at all feasible under conditions of private property; that it divorces landed property from the relations of dominion and servitude, on the one hand, and, on the other, totally separates land as an instrument of production from landed property and landowner. . . . The rationalising of agriculture, on the one hand, which makes it for the first time capable of operating on a social scale, and the reduction ad absurdum of property in land, on the other, are the great achievements of the capitalist mode of production. Like all of its other historical advances, it also attained these by first completely impoverishing the direct producers\u201d (III, , -. Russ. trans., \u2013).[]\n\nOne would think that after such categorical statements by Marx there could be no two opinions as to how he viewed the question of the progressive historical role of agricultural capitalism. Mr. N.\u2013on, however, found one more subterfuge: he quoted Engels\u2019s opinion on the present agricultural crisis, which should, in his view, refute the proposition of the progressive role of capitalism in agriculture.[]\n\nLet us see what Engels actually says. After summarising the main propositions of Marx\u2019s theory of differential rent, Engels establishes the law that \u201cthe more capital is invested in the land, and the higher the development of agriculture and civilisation in general in a given country, the more rents rise per acre as well as in total amount, and the more immense becomes the tribute paid by society to the big landowners in the form of surplus-profits\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , . Russ. trans., ).[] This law, says Engels, explains \u201cthe wonderful vitality of the class of big landowners,\u201d who accumulate a mass of debts and nevertheless \u201cland on their feet\u201d in all crises; for example, the abolition of the Corn Laws in England, which caused a drop in grain prices, far from ruining the landlords, exceedingly enriched them.\n\nIt might thus seem that capitalism is unable to weaken the power of the monopoly represented by landed property.\n\n\u201cBut everything is transitory,\u201d continues Engels. \u201cTrans-oceanic steamships and the railways of North and South America and India\u201d called forth new competitors. The North American prairies and the Argentine pampas, etc., flooded the world market with cheap grain. \u201cAnd in face of this competition\u2014coming from virgin plains as well as from Russian and Indian peasants ground down by taxation\u2014the European tenant farmer and peasant could not prevail at the old rents. A portion of the land in Europe fell decisively out of competition as regards grain cultivation, and rents fell everywhere; our second case, variant \u2014falling prices and falling productivity of the additional investment of capital\u2014became the rule for Europe; and therefore the lament of landlords from Scotland to Italy and from the south of France to the east of Prussia. Fortunately, the plains are far from being entirely brought under cultivation; there are enough left to ruin all the big landlords of Europe and the small ones into the bargain\u201d (ibid., . Russ. trans., , where the word \u201cfortunately\u201d is omitted.).[]\n\nIf the reader has read this passage carefully it should be clear to him that Engels says the very opposite of what Mr. N.\u2013on wants to foist on him. In Engels\u2019s opinion the present agricultural crisis is reducing rent and is even tending to abolish it altogether; in other words, agricultural capitalism is pursuing its natural tendency to abolish the monopoly of landed property. No, Mr. N.\u2013on is positively out of luck with his \u201cquotations.\u201d Agricultural capitalism is taking another, enormous step forward; it is boundlessly expanding the commercial production of agricultural produce and drawing a number of new countries into the world arena; it is driving patriarchal agriculture out of its last refuges, such as India or Russia; it is creating something hitherto unknown to agriculture, namely, the purely industrial production of grain, based on the co-operation of masses of workers equipped with the most up-to-date machinery; it is tremendously aggravating the position of the old European countries, reducing rents, thus undermining what seemed to be the most firmly established monopolies and reducing landed property \u201cto absurdity\u201d not only in theory, but also in practice; it is raising so vividly the need to socialise agricultural production that this need is beginning to be realised in the West even by representatives of the propertied classes.[] And Engels, with his characteristic cheerful irony, welcomes the latest steps of world capitalism: fortunately, he says, there is still enough uncultivated prairie land left to enable things to continue as they have been doing. But our good Mr. N.\u2013on, \u00e0 propos des bottes,[] sighs for the \u201cmuzhik cultivator\u201d of yore, for the \u201ctime-hallowed\u201d . . . stagnation of our agriculture and of all the various forms of agricultural bondage which \u201cneither the strife among the appanage princes nor the Tartar invasion\u201d could shake, and which now\u2014oh, horror!\u2014are beginning to be most thoroughly shaken by this monstrous capitalism! O, sancta simplicitas!\n\nNotes\n[] In another place Marx points out that \u201ccommon lands (Gemeineigentum ) constitute the second supplement of the management of land parcels.\u201d (Das Kapital, III, , ).[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] If we are told that we are running ahead in making such an assertion, our reply will be the following. Whoever wants to depict some living phenomenon in its development is inevitably and necessarily confronted with the dilemma of either running ahead or lagging behind. There is no middle course. And if all the facts show that the character of the social evolution is precisely such that this evolution has already gone very far (see Chapter II), and if, furthermore, precise reference is made to the circumstances and institutions that retard this evolution (excessively high taxes, social-estate exclusiveness of the peasantry, lack of full freedom in the purchase and sale of land, and in movement and settlement), then there is nothing wrong in such running ahead.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The defence of some of these institutions by the Narodniks very glaringly reveals the reactionary character of their views, which is gradually bringing them closer and closer to the agrarians.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us recall that Engels, shortly before his death, and at a time when the agricultural crisis connected with the drop in prices was fully manifest, considered it necessary to protest emphatically against the French \u201cdisciples,\u201d who had made some concessions to the doctrine of the viability of small-scale agriculture.[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See Novoye Slovo, , No. , February, letter to editors by Mr. N.\u2013on, pp. -. Here also is the \u201cquotation\u201d on the \u201cmoral of history.\u201d It is remarkable that neither Mr. N.\u2013on nor any other of the numerous Narodnik economists who have tried to use the present agricultural crisis to refute the theory of the progressive historical role of capitalism in agriculture, has ever once raised the question in a straightforward manner, on the basis of a definite economic theory; has ever once stated the grounds which induced Marx to admit the progressiveness of the historical role of agricultural capitalism, or has definitely indicated just which of these grounds he repudiates, and why. In this, as in other cases, the Narodnik economists prefer not to oppose Marx\u2019s theory outright, but confine themselves to casting vague hints at the \u201cRussian disciples.\u201d Confining ourselves in this work to the economy of Russia, we have given above the grounds for our opinions on this question.\u2014Lenin\n\n Chapter VI. Capitalist Manufacture and Capitalist Domestic Industry\nI. The Rise of Manufacture and its Main Features\nBy manufacture is meant, as we know, co-operation based on division of labour. In origin, manufacture belongs directly to the above-described \u201cfirst stages of capitalism in industry.\u201d On the one hand, workshops with a more or less considerable number of workers gradually introduce division of labour, and in this way capitalist simple co-operation grows into capitalist manufacture. The statistics on the Moscow industries quoted in the preceding chapter clearly show the process of this genesis of manufacture: the larger workshops in all fourth category industries, in some of the third category, and in individual cases of the second category, systematically apply division of labour on a wide scale and must therefore be classed as types of capitalist manufacture. More detailed data on the technique and the economics of some of these industries will be given below.\n\nOn the other hand, we have seen how merchant\u2019s capital in the small industries, upon reaching its highest stage of development, reduces the producer to the position of a wage-worker processing the raw material of others for payment by the piece. If further development leads to the introduction of systematic division of labour into production and transforms the technique of the small producer, if the \u201cbuyer-up\u201d singles out certain detailed operations and gets them done by wage-workers in his own workshop, if, parallel with the distribution of work to be done in the home, and inseparably connected with it, big workshops with division of labour emerge (belonging very often to these same buyers-up), we are confronted with a process of the genesis of capitalist manufacture of another kind.[]\n\nManufacture is highly important in the development of capitalist forms of industry, as the link between handicrafts and small commodity production with primitive forms of capital, and large-scale machine industry (the factory). Manufacture is closer to the small industries because it continues to be based on hand technique, so that the big establishments cannot, therefore, fully displace the small ones, cannot completely divorce the industrialist from agriculture. \u201cManufacture was unable, either to seize upon the production of society to its full extent, or to revolutionise that production to its very core (in ihrer Tiefe ). It towered up as an economic work of art, on the broad foundation of the town handicrafts, and of the rural domestic industries.\u201d[] What brings manufacture closer to the factory is the rise of the big market, of big establishments with wage-workers, of big capital, which has brought masses of propertyless workers under its complete domination.\n\nIn Russian literature the prejudice regarding the isolation of so-called \u201cfactory\u201d production from \u201chandicraft\u201d production, regarding the \u201cartificiality\u201d of the former and the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d character of the latter, is so widespread that we think it particularly important to examine the data on all the more important branches of manufacturing industry and to show their economic organisation after they had grown out of the stage of small peasant industries, and before they were transformed by large-scale machine industry.\n\nNotes\n[] For a description of this process of the genesis of capitalist manufacture, see Marx\u2019s Das Kapital, III, -. Russ trans., \u2013.[]\n\n\u201cIt was not even in the bosom of the old guilds that manufacture was born. It was the merchant that became the head of the modern workshop, and not the old guild-master.\u201d (Mis\u00e8re de la philosophie, .[] We have had occasion elsewhere to enumerate the principal features of the concept manufacture according to Marx. [Studies,  (See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia. \u2013Ed.)]\u2014Lenin\n\nII. Capitalist Manufacture in Russian Industry\nLet us begin with the industries that process fibres.\n\n) The Weaving Industries\nThe weaving of linen, wool, cotton and silk fabrics, galloons, etc., was organised everywhere in Russia as follows (before the appearance of large-scale machine industry). The industry was headed by big capitalist workshops employing tens and hundreds of wage-workers; the owners of these workshops, possessing sizable capital, undertook the large-scale purchase of raw material, partly working it up in their own establishments, and partly giving out yarn and warp to small producers (workroom owners, middlemen,[], peasant-\u201chandicraftsmen\u201d etc.) who wove the cloth at home or in small workshops at piece rates. The work itself was done by hand, and the following operations were distributed among the workers: ) yarn-dyeing; ) yarn-winding (very often women and children specialised in this operation); ) yarn-fixing (\u201cfixers\u201d); ) weaving; ) weft-winding for weavers (bobbin hands, mostly children). Sometimes in the big workshops there were special \u201cthreaders\u201d (who threaded the warp through the eyes of the batten and reed.)[] of labour is usually applied, not only to single operations, but to wares, that is, the weavers specialise in producing various sorts of cloth. The selection of some operations to be done in the home does not, of course, make any change whatever to the economic structure of this type of industry. The workrooms or homes where the weavers work are simply external departments of the manufactory. The technical basis of such industry is hand production with extensive and systematic division of labour; from the economic point of view we see here the formation of large capital which controls the purchase of raw materials and the sale of wares on an extremely extensive (national) market, and under whose complete sway are a mass of proletarian weavers; a few large establishments (manufactories in the narrow sense of the term) dominate a mass of small ones. Division of labour leads to the emergence of specialist artisans from among the peasantry; non-agricultural centres of manufacture arise, such as the village of Ivanovo in Vladimir Gubernia (in  it became the town of Ivanovo-Voznesensk and is now a centre of large-scale machine industry), the village of Velikoye in Yaroslavl Gubernia, and many other villages in Moscow, Kostroma, Vladimir and Yaroslavl gubernias, which have now turned into factory towns.[] In our economic literature and statistics the industry organised in this way is usually split up into two parts: peasants who work in their homes, or in not particularly big workrooms, workshops, etc., are classed under \u201chandicraft\u201d industry, while the bigger workrooms and workshops are placed among the \u201cfactories and works\u201d (and, moreover, quite fortuitously, since no definitely established and uniformly applied rules exist as to the separation of small establishments from big ones, of workrooms from manufactories, of workers occupied in their homes from workers occupied in the workshop of the capitalist).[] Naturally, such classification, which places some wage-workers on one side, and some masters who hire these very wage-workers (in addition to the workers in their establishments) on the other, is nonsense from the scientific viewpoint.\n\nLet us illustrate this by detailed data regarding one of the \u201chandicraft weaving\u201d industries, namely, silk weaving in Vladimir Gubernia.[] The \u201csilk industry\u201d is a typical specimen of capitalist manufacture. Hand labour prevails. Of the total number of establishments the small ones constitute the majority ( out of , or % of the total, have from  to  workers), but in greater part they are not independent and are far behind the big ones in their significance to the industry as a whole. Establishments with  to  workers constitute % of the total (), but in them .% of the aggregate number of workers are concentrated, and they account for % of the total output. Of the total number of workers in the industry (,) there are , wage-workers, i.e., .%. \u201cOn the job we meet with division of labour both in wares and in individual operations.\u201d Weavers are rarely able to make both \u201cvelvet\u201d and \u201csatin\u201d (the two principal lines in this trade). \u201cThe division of labour into separate operations within the workshop is most strictly practised only in the big factories\u201d (i.e., manufactories) \u201cthat employ wage-workers.\u201d The fully independent proprietors number only , who alone buy the raw materials themselves and sell the finished article; they have  family workers and \u201cemploy , wage-workers, who in greater part are paid by the piece,\u201d a total, consequently, of , workers, or % of the aggregate number of workers. It is thus clear that the distribution by these manufactory owners, through the medium of \u201cmiddle-men\u201d (workroom owners), of work to be done in the home is no special form of industry at all, but is merely one of the operations of capital in manufacture. Mr. Kharizomenov rightly observes that the \u201cmass of small establishments (%) alongside the small number of big ones (%), and the insignificant number of workers employed per establishment ( /) conceal the true character of the trade\u201d (loc. cit., ). The specialisation characteristic of manufacture is seen here clearly in the separation of the industrialists from agriculture (the land is abandoned, on the one hand by the impoverished weavers, and on the other by the big manufactory owners) and in the formation of a special type of industrial population, who live much more \u201cdecently\u201d than do the agriculturists, and look down upon the muzhik (loc. cit., ). Our factory statistics have always registered only a very casually selected fraction of this industry.[]\n\nThe \u201cgalloon industry\u201d in Moscow Gubernia is capitalist manufacture organised in a quite analogous fashion.[] Such precisely is the case with regard to the printed calico industry in Kamyshin Uyezd, Saratov Gubernia. According to the Directory for , there were here  \u201cfactories\u201d with , workers and output totalling , rubles, while according to the List there was one \u201cwork distributing office\u201d with  workers in the establishment and an output totalling , rubles. (In other words, in  workers employed in the establishment and on the side were lumped together!) According to local investigators, in  nearly , looms were engaged in producing printed calico,[] an output totalling  million rubles, and \u201cthe whole business is run by a few manufacturers,\u201d who employ \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d too, including children of  and  years of age for a payment of  to  kopeks per day (Reports and Investigations, Vol. I).[] And so forth.\n\n) Other Branches of the Textile Industry. The Felt Trade.\nTo judge by official factory statistics, felt production shows a very poor development of \u201ccapitalism\u201d: in all European Russia there are altogether  factories, with , workers and an output totalling , rubles (Directory for ). But these figures merely show a casually picked fragment of a widely developed capitalist industry. Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia occupies first place for the development of \u201cfactory\u201d felt production, and in that gubernia the principal centre of the industry is the town of Arzamas and the suburb Viyezdnaya Sloboda (where there are  \u201cfactories\u201d with  workers and an output totalling , rubles; in  there were , inhabitants; and in the village of Krasnoye, ,). It is in the environs of these centres that \u201chandicraft\u201d felt-making is developed, in some  establishments, employing  workers, with an output totalling , rubles (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, V). To illustrate clearly the economic organisation of felt-making in this district, let us try the graphic method and indicate by specific symbols the producers who occupy special places in the general structure of the industry.\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that the separation of \u201cfactory\u201d and \u201chandicraft\u201d industry is purely artificial, that what we have before us is a single and integral structure of industry which fully fits into the concept of capitalist\nDiagram illustrating the organisation of the felt industry.\n(approximately)[]\n\nmanufacture.[] From the technical aspect it is hand production. The organisation of the work is that of co-operation based on division of labour, which is here observed in two forms: as to wares (some villages specialise in plain felt, others in boots, hats, socks, etc.), and as to individual operations (for example, the whole village of Vasilyev Vrag shapes hats and socks for the village of Krasnoye, where the semi-prepared article is finished, etc.). This is capitalist co-operation, for it is headed by big capital, which has created large manufactories and has brought under its sway (by an intricate web of economic relations) a mass of small establishments. The overwhelming majority of the producers have been transformed into workers performing one operation and producing for entrepreneurs under extremely insanitary conditions.[] The long standing of the industry and the fully established capitalist relations result in the separation of the industrialists from agriculture: in the village of Krasnoye agriculture is in utter ruin, and the life of the inhabitants differs from that of the agricultural population.[]\n\nQuite analogous is the organisation of the felt industry in a number of other districts. In  village communities of Semyonov Uyezd in the same gubernia, the industry in  was carried on by , households, with , persons working. Of , workers, only  worked for the market,  were wage-workers and , worked for masters on the basis, in greater part, of using the latter\u2019s materials;  households gave out work to , households. The big owners have workshops with as many as  wage-workers, and buy wool to a value of some , rubles per year.[] The big owners are called thousanders ; their turnover runs to from , to , rubles; they have their own wool warehouses, and their own booths for the sale of wares.[] For Kazan Gubernia the List gives  felt \u201cfactories,\u201d with  workers and an output totalling , rubles, as well as  outside workers. Evidently the latter are also included among the \u201chandicraftsmen,\u201d concerning whom we read that they often work for \u201cbuyers-up\u201d and that there are establishments having  workers.[] Of  felt \u201cfactories\u201d in Kostroma Gubernia,  are concentrated in Kineshma Uyezd, and have  workers employed in the establishments and  outside (List, pp. -; two of the enterprises have only outside workers. Steam-engines already appear). From the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission (XV) we learn that out of a total of , wool-carders and felt-makers in this gubernia, , are concentrated in Kineshma Uyezd. The Kostroma felt-makers are in greater part dependent or work for wages in extremely insanitary workshops.[] In Kalyazin Uyezd, Tver Gubernia, we find, on the one hand, that home work is done for \u201cfactory owners\u201d (List, ), and, on the other, that precisely this uyezd is a centre of \u201chandicraft\u201d felt-makers; as many as , of them come from this uyezd, passing through the wasteland called \u201cZimnyak\u201d (in the s it was the site of Alexeyev\u2019s cloth mill), and forming \u201can enormous labour market of wool-carders and felt-makers.\u201d[] In Yaroslavl Gubernia outside work for \u201cfactory owners is a]so done\u201d (List, ) and there are \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d who work for merchant proprietors, using the latter\u2019s wool, etc.\n\n) The Hat-and-Cap and Hemp-and-Rope Trades\nAbove we gave statistics for the hat industry of Moscow Gubernia.[] They show that two-thirds of the total output and of the total number of workers are concentrated in  establishments, which have an average of . wage-workers.[] The \u201chandicraft\u201d hat-makers perform only part of the hat-making operations: they make the shapes, which are sold to Moscow merchants who have their own \u201cfinishing establishments\u201d; on the other hand, \u201cclippers\u201d (women who clip the down) work at home for the \u201chandicraft\u201d hat-makers. Thus, all in all, we find here capitalist co-operation based on division of labour and entangled in a whole network of diverse forms of economic dependence. In the centre of the industry (the village of Klenovo, Podolsk Uyezd) the separation of the industrialists (mainly wage-workers) from agriculture[] is clearly to be seen, together with a rise in the level of the population\u2019s requirements: they live \u201cmore decently,\u201d dress in calico and even in cloth, buy samovars, abandon ancient customs, etc., thereby evoking the bitter complaints of the local admirers of old times.[] The new era even occasioned the appearance of migratory hat-makers.\n\nA typical example of capitalist manufacture is the cap industry in the village of Molvitino, Bui Uyezd, Kostroma Gubernia.[] \u201cThe principal . . . occupation in the village of Molvitino and in . . .  hamlets is the cap industry.\u201d Agriculture is being abandoned. Since  the industry has greatly developed; sewing-machines have become widely used. In Molvitino  workshops are busy all year round with  to  male and  to  female workers each. \u201cThe best workshop . . . has a turnover of about , rubles per annum.\u201d[] Work is also distributed to homes (for example, materials for the crowns are made by women in their homes). Division of labour cripples the workers, who work under the most insanitary conditions and usually contract tuberculosis. The lengthy existence of the industry (for over  years) has produced highly skilled craftsmen; the Molvitino craftsmen are known in the big cities and in the remote outer regions.\n\nThe centre of the hemp industry in the Medyn Uyezd, Kaluga Gubernia, is the village of Polotnyani Zavod. This is a large village (according to the census of  it had , inhabitants) with a population that is landless and highly industrial (over , \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d); it is the centre of the \u201chandicraft\u201d industries of Medyn Uyezd.[] The hemp industry is organised in the following way: the big proprietors (of whom there are three, the biggest being Yerokhin) have workshops employing wage-workers and circulating capital of more or less considerable dimensions for purchasing raw materials. The hemp is combed in the \u201cfactory,\u201d spun by spinners in their homes, and twisted both in the factory and in the home. It is warped in the factory and woven both in the factory and in the home. In  a total of  \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d was counted in the hemp industry; Yerokhin is considered to be both a \u201chandicraftsman\u201d and a \u201cfactory owner,\u201d employing - workers in  and in -; according to Reports and Investigations (Vol. II, p.), \u201chundreds of peasants\u201d work for him.\n\nIn Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, the rope industry is also centred in non-agricultural industrial villages, Nizhni Izbylets and Verkhni Izbylets in the Gorbatov Uyezd.[] According to Mr. Karpov (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, Vol. VIII), the Gorbatov-Izbylets district is one large rope-making area; part of the inhabitants of the town of Gorbatov are also engaged in the industry, and the villages of Verkhni Izbylets and Nizhni Izbylets are, in fact, \u201calmost part of the town of Gorbatov\u201d; the inhabitants live like townspeople, drink tea every day, wear clothing bought in the shops, and eat white bread. Altogether, as many as two-thirds of the inhabitants of  villages are engaged in the industry, a total of , working (, men and , women) with an output of about  / million rubles. The industry has been in existence for nearly  years, and is now declining. It is organised as follows: all work for  proprietors, using the latter\u2019s materials, are paid by the piece, are \u201ctotally dependent upon the proprietors\u201d and work from  to  hours a day. According to Zemstvo statistics () the industry employs , male workers (plus  females and males of non-working age). Of , working only  work for sale, , work for proprietors[] and  are wage-workers employed in the workshops of  proprietors. Of , allotment households, only , or a little over half, cultivate all their land themselves. Of , allotment-holding working persons, , or .%, do not engage in agriculture at all. Turning to the question as to who these \u201cproprietors\u201d are, we must pass from the sphere of \u201chandicraft\u201d industry to that of \u201cfactory\u201d industry. According to the List for - there were two rope factories there, with  workers employed on the premises and , working outside, with an output totalling , rubles. Both these establishments have installed motors (which they did not have either in  or in ), and we therefore clearly see here the transition from capitalist manufacture to capitalist machine industry, and the transformation of \u201chandicraft\u201d work distributors and buyers-up into real factory owners.\n\nIn Perm Gubernia the handicraft census of - registered  peasant rope-and-string yards, with  workers (of whom  were hired) and an output totalling , rubles.[] These small establishments are headed by big manufactories, which are reckoned together, viz.:  owners employ  workers ( hired) and have an output totalling , rubles.[] The system of production in these big establishments may serve as the most striking example of \u201cserial manufacture\u201d (as Marx calls it[]), i.e., the sort of manufacture in which different workers perform different consecutive operations in working up the raw material: ) hemp scutching; ) combing; ) spinning; ) coiling; ) tarring; ) winding on drum; ) passing threads through perforated board; ) passing threads through iron bush; ) stranding of plaits, twisting and gathering of ropes.[]\n\nThe organisation of the hemp industry in Orel Gubernia is evidently similar: from among the considerable number of small peasant establishments big manufactories emerge, principally in the towns, and are included among the \u201cfactories and works\u201d (according to the Directory for  there were in Orel Gubernia  hemp-scutching factories, with , workers and an output totalling , rubles). The peasants work in the hemp industry \u201cfor merchants\u201d (probably for the very same manufacturers), using the latter\u2019s materials, at piece rates, the work being divided up into special operations: \u201cscutchers\u201d scutch the hemp; \u201cspinners\u201d spin it; \u201cbearders\u201d trim it, \u201cwheelmen\u201d turn the wheel. The work is very hard; many contract consumption and \u201crupture.\u201d The dust is so thick that \u201cunless accustomed you will not stay in it for a quarter of an hour.\u201d The work is done in ordinary sheds from dawn to dusk, from May to September.[]\n\n) The Wood-Working Trades\nThe most typical example of capitalist manufacture in this sphere is the chest-making industry. According to the data, for instance, of the Perm investigators, \u201cthis industry is organised as follows: a few big proprietors, owning workshops that employ wage-workers, purchase materials, partly make the wares on their own premises, but mainly give out material to small workshops making parts, and in their own shops assemble them and, after finishing, send the ready article to market. Division of labour . . . is employed on the job extensively: the making of the entire chest is divided into ten or twelve operations, each separately performed by handicraftsmen. The organisation of the industry consists in the combination of workers performing one operation (Teilarbeiter, as they are called in Das Kapital ) under the command of capital.\u201d[] This is heterogeneous manufacture (heterogene Manufaktur, as Marx calls it[]), in which the different workers do not perform consecutive operations in turning the raw material into the product, but make the various parts of the product, which are afterwards assembled. The preference of the capitalists for the domestic work of \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d is to be explained partly by the above mentioned character of manufacture, and partly (and mainly) by the cheaper labour of the home workers.[] Let us observe that the relatively big workshops in this industry are sometimes also included among \u201cfactories and works.\u201d[]\n\nIn all probability, the chest-making industry is organised similarly in Vladimir Gubernia, in Murom Uyezd where, according to the List, there are  \u201cfactories\u201d (all hand-operated), with  workers on the premises and  outside, and an output totalling , rubles.\n\nThe carriage industry, in Perm Gubernia, for example, is organised on similar lines: from among the mass of small establishments there emerge assembly workshops employing wage-workers; the small handicraftsmen are workers who make parts of the carriages both out of their own materials, and out of materials supplied by the \u201cbuyers-up\u201d (i.e., owners of the assembly workshops.)[] We read about the Poltava \u201chandicraft\u201d carriage builders that in the suburb of Ardon there are workshops that employ wage-workers and also distribute work to homes (the bigger masters having as many as  outside workers).[] In Kazan Gubernia, division of labour as to wares is to be observed in the building of town carriages: some villages specialise in sleighs, others in wheeled vehicles, etc. \u201cThe town carriages, completely assembled in the villages (but without the metal work, wheels or shafts), are sent to Kazan merchant customers, who in turn send them to blacksmiths for the metal work. The carriages are then sent back again to the shops and workshops in the town, where they are finished off, i.e., are upholstered and painted. . . . Kazan, where town carriages were formerly iron-mounted, gradually passed this work on to handicraftsmen, who work at home for a smaller payment than do the town craftsmen....\u201d[] Hence, capital prefers to distribute work to home workers because this reduces the cost of labour-power. The organisation of the carriage industry, as is evident from the data quoted, constitutes, in the majority of cases, a system of handicraftsmen making parts, who are under the sway of capital.\n\nThe large industrial village of Vorontsovka, Pavlovsk Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia (, inhabitants in ), constitutes, as it were, a single manufactory of wooden articles (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, etc., Vol. IX, article by Rev. M. Popov). Over  houses are engaged in the industry (as well as some households in the suburb of Alexandrovka, which has over , inhabitants). They make carts, tarantasses, wheels, chests, etc., to a total of about , rubles. Less than one-third are independent masters; hired workers in masters\u2019 workshops are rare.[] The majority work to order for peasant merchants at piece rates. The workers are in debt to the proprietors and are worn out by arduous toil: the people are growing feebler. The inhabitants of the suburb are industrial, not of the rural type, and scarcely engage in agriculture at all (except to work vegetable plots), since their allotments are miserably small. The industry has been long in existence, diverting the population from agriculture and increasingly widening the rift between the rich and the poor. The people subsist on meagre food; they dress \u201cmore smartly than before,\u201d \u201cbut beyond their means,\u201d in clothing that is entirely bought. \u201cThe population has succumbed to the spirit of industry and trade.\u201d \u201cNearly all who have no craft carry on some trading. . . . Under the influence of industry and trade, the peasant has, generally speaking, become more unreserved, and this has made him more developed and resourceful.\u201d[]\n\nThe celebrated wooden-spoon industry of the Semyonov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, is close to capitalist manufacture in its organisation. True, there are no big workshops standing out from among the mass of small workshops and dominating them, but we find a deeply-rooted division of labour and the complete subjection of the mass of part-job workers to capital. Before it is ready, the spoon passes through no less than  hands, the buyers-up getting some of the operations done by specially hired workers or giving them out to specialist workers (for example, for varnishing); some of the villages specialise in particular operations (for example, the village of Dyakovo specialises in spoon finishing to the order of the buyer-up, at piece rates; the villages of Khvostikovo, Dianovo and Zhuzhelka specialise in varnishing, etc.). The buyers-up purchase the timber wholesale in the Samara and other gubernias, where they send parties of hired workers; they own warehouses for raw material and manufactured goods, supply the most valuable material to handicraftsmen for processing, etc. The mass of workers doing part jobs merge into a single, complex mechanism of production, entirely under the sway of capital. \u201cIt is all the same to the spoon-makers whether they work for hire at the master\u2019s cost and on his premises, or are occupied in their own cottages, for in this industry, as in others, everything has been weighed, measured and counted. The spoon-maker never earns more than just enough to keep body and soul together.\u201d[] It is quite natural that under such conditions the capitalists who dominate the whole trade are in no hurry to open their own workshops, and the industry, based on hand skill and traditional division of labour, stagnates in its seclusion and immobility. Tied to the land, the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d seem to have become petrified in their routine: as in , so in , they still count money in the old style, in banknotes and not in silver.\n\nThe toy industry in Moscow Gubernia is headed similarly by establishments of the capitalist-manufactory type.[] Of  workshops,  have over  workers each. Division of labour, both as to wares and as to individual operations, is practised on a very wide scale, enormously raising the productivity of labour (at the cost of crippling the worker). For example, it is estimated that a small workshop yields a return of % of the selling price, and a big workshop, one of %.[] Of course, the fixed capital of the big proprietors is also much larger; technical devices are met with (for example, drying sheds). The centre of the industry is a non-agricultural township, the suburb of Sergiyevsky (where there are , workers out of a total of ,, with an output to the amount of , rubles out of a total of , rubles; the population, according to the  census, numbers ,). The author of the article on this industry, referring to the prevalence of small workshops, etc., considers it more, but still not very, likely that the industry will develop into manufacture rather than into factory industry. \u201cIn the future, too,\u201d he says, \u201cthe small producers will always be able to compete more or less successfully with large-scale production\u201d (loc. cit., ). The author forgets that in manufacture the technical basis is always the same hand-production that obtains in the small industries; that the division of labour can never be such a decisive advantage that it will entirely eliminate the small producers, particularly if the latter resort to such means as lengthening the working day, etc.; and that manufacture is never in a position to embrace the whole of production, but remains a mere superstructure over the mass of small establishments.\n\n) The Processing of Livestock Produce. [The Leather and Fur Trades]\nThe most extensive areas of the leather industry present particularly striking examples of the complete merging of \u201chandicraft\u201d and factory industry, examples of capitalist manufacture highly developed (in depth and in breadth). What is characteristic is the fact that the gubernias which are conspicuous for the size of their \u201cfactory\u201d leather industry (Vyatka, Nizhni-Novgorod, Perm and Tver) are marked by a particular development of \u201chandicraft\u201d industries in this sphere.\n\nIn the village of Bogorodskoye, Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, there were, according to the Directory for ,  \u201cfactories\u201d with  workers and an output totalling , rubles; according to the List for - there were  \u201cworks,\u201d with , workers on the premises and  outside, and with an output totalling , rubles (the latter figures covering only the processing of livestock produce, the principal local industry). But these data deal only with the top levels of capitalist manufacture. Mr. Karpov in  computed in this village and its environs over  establishments, with , workers (a large number of whom worked at home for capitalists), and with an output totalling about ,, rubles[] in the following industries: tanning, shingle-gluing, basket-weaving (for packing goods), harness-making, horse-collar-making, mitten-making and, standing by itself, pottery. The Zemstvo census of  listed , industrialists for this district, and of , workers for whom detailed information is given, , work for hire in other people\u2019s workshops and  work at home for masters.[] \u201cBogorodskoye, with its population of ,, is a huge tannery in continuous operation.\u201d[] To be more precise, it is a \u201cserial\u201d manufactory controlled by a few big capitalists who buy the raw materials, tan the hides, and turn them into a variety of articles, hiring several thousand absolutely propertyless workers for the job and ruling over the small establishments.[] This industry has had a very long existence, since the th century; particularly memorable in the industry\u2019s history are the Sheremetevs (beginning of the th century), landlords who helped considerably to develop the industry and, incidentally, protected the proletariat, which came into existence here long ago, from the local rich. After  the industry greatly developed, and particularly did big establishments grow at the expense of the small ones; centuries of industrial activity produced from among the population remarkably skilled craftsmen who have carried the trade all over Russia. The firmly-rooted capitalist relations have led to the separation of industry from agriculture: hardly any farming is done in Bogorodskoye village itself, which, on the contrary, divorces neighbouring peasants who move into this \u201ctown\u201d from the land.[] Mr. Karpov notes in this village \u201ca complete absence of peasant characteristics among the inhabitants,\u201d so that \u201cyou would never think you were in a village and not a town.\u201d This village leaves Gorbatov and all the other uyezd towns of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia far behind, with the exception, perhaps, of Arzamas. It is \u201cone of the considerable commercial and industrial centres in the gubernia, and its industry and commerce run into the millions.\u201d \u201cThe radius of the industrial and commercial influence of Bogorodskoye is very wide; but most closely connected with the industry of Bogorodskoye is that of its environs within a radius of  to  versts. These industrial environs are, as it were, a continuation of Bogorodskoye itself.\u201d \u201cThe inhabitants of Bogorodskoye do not in the least resemble the ordinary, raw muzhiks: they are artisans of the burgher type, shrewd, experienced people, who look down on the peasants. The manner of life and the ethical standards of the Bogorodskoye inhabitants are completely urban.\u201d To this we must add that the industrial villages of Gorbatov Uyezd are marked by a relatively high level of literacy among the population. Thus, the percentage of literate and student men and women is, in the villages of Pavlovo, Bogorodskoye and Vorsma, .% and % respectively, as against .% and .% in the rest of the uyezd (see Zemstvo statistical Material ).\n\nQuite analogous (only on a smaller scale) are the relations in the leather-processing industries of the villages of Katunki and Gorodets (Balakhna Uyezd), Bolshoye Murashkino (Knyaginin Uyezd), Yurino (Vasil Uyezd), and Tubanayevka, Spasskoye, Vatras and Latyshikha in the same uyezd. These are similar non-agricultural centres with a \u201cring\u201d of surrounding agricultural villages, and with similar diverse industries and numerous small establishments (and also workers in the home) subordinated to big entrepreneurs, whose capitalist workshops are occasionally included among \u201cfactories and works.\u201d[] Without going into statistical details, which will provide nothing new compared with what has already been said, let us merely quote the following extremely interesting description of the village of Katunki:[]\n\u201cA certain patriarchal simplicity in the relations between masters and workmen, which, however, is not so noticeable at first sight and is, unfortunately (?), disappearing increasingly every year . . . testifies to the handicraft character of the industries (?). It is only recently that the factory character both of the industries and of the population has begun to be observed, under the influence, in particular, of the town, intercourse with which has been facilitated by the inauguration of the steamboat service. Today the village looks like a regular industrial township: there is no sign of agriculture whatever, the houses are built close together as in the towns; the fine brick houses of the rich, and alongside of them the miserable hovels of the poor; the long wooden and brick buildings of the factories crowded in the middle of the village \u2014 all this sharply distinguishes Katunki from the neighbouring villages and clearly points to the industrial character of the local population. The inhabitants themselves possess features of character that also call to mind the type of \u201cfactory hand\u201d who has already taken shape in Russia: a certain showiness in house furniture, in clothes and manners, spendthrift habits of life in most cases, and little care for the morrow, a forwardness and often affectation in speech, a certain superciliousness towards the country yokel \u2014 all these features are possessed by them in common with all Russian factory people.\u201d[]\nIn the town of Arzamas, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, the \u201cfactory\u201d statistics listed in  a total of  tanneries, employing  workers (Directory ); this is only a small fraction of the capitalist manufacture which embraces the fur, boot-making and other industries. The same factories employ workers in the home, both in the town of Arzamas (in , estimated at ) and in  suburban villages, where out of the  furrier households,  work for Arzamas merchants, using their materials and working  hours a day for  to  rubles per month[]; that is why the furriers are pallid, feeble and degenerating folk. In the suburb of Viyezdnaya Sloboda, of the  boot-maker households,  work for masters, from whom they receive the cut-out leather. The industry is of long standing, being about  years old, and is still growing and developing. The inhabitants hardly engage in agriculture at all; their whole manner of life is purely urban, and they live \u201cin grand style.\u201d The same applies to the furrier villages mentioned above, the inhabitants of which \u201clook down with disdain upon the peasant and call him a \u2018country bumpkin\u2019.\u201d[]\n\nWe find exactly the same thing in Vyatka Gubernia. The Vyatka and Slobodskoi uyezds are centres both of \u201cfactory\u201d and of \u201chandicraft\u201d leather and fur trades. In the Vyatka Uyezd, the handicraft tanneries are concentrated on the outskirts of the town and \u201csupplement\u201d the industrial activities of the big works,[] for example, by working for the big owners; working for the latter also, in the majority of cases, are the handicraft harness-makers and glue makers. The fur factory owners have hundreds working for them in the home, sewing sheepskins, etc. This is just a single capitalist manufactory with branches: sheepskin dressing and sheepskin-coat-making, leather and harness, etc. Still more striking are the relations existing in the Slobodskoi Uyezd (the centre of the industries is the suburb of Demyanka); here we see a small number of big factory owners[] at the head of handicraft tanners (numbering ), boot- and mitten-makers (), sheepskin-dressers (), and tailors ( make short sheepskin coats to order from capitalists). Generally speaking, such organisation of the production of leather goods is evidently very widespread: thus, in the town of Sarapul, Vyatka Gubernia, the List gives  tanneries, also making footwear, which employ, in addition to  workers on the premises, , outside workers (p. ). What would become of our \u201chandicrafts men,\u201d those representatives of \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d industry who are depicted in such bright hues by all sorts of Manilovs, if all the Russian merchants and factory owners were to compute with equal detail and precision the outside workers employed by them?[]\n\nReference should be made here to the industrial village of Rasskazovo, Tambov Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia (population in  was ,), a centre both of \u201cfactory\u201d industry (cloth mills, soap-works, tanneries and distilleries) and of \u201chandicraft\u201d industry, the latter being closely connected with the former; and to the industries: tanning, felt-making (as many as  masters, and establishments employing from  to  workers), glue-making, boot-making, stocking knitting (there is not a household where stockings are not knit from wool that \u201cbuyers-up\u201d give out by weight), etc. Near this village is the suburb of Belaya Polyana ( households), celebrated for industries of the same kind. In Morshansk Uyezd, the centre of the handicraft industries is the village of Pokrovskoye-Vasilyevskoye, which is also the centre of factory industry (see Directory and Reports and Investigations, Vol. III). In Kursk Gubernia, noteworthy as industrial villages and centres of \u201chandicraft\u201d industries are the suburbs: Veliko-Mikhailovka (Novy Oskol Uyezd; population in  was ,), Borisovka (Graivoron Uyezd \u2014 , inhabitants), Tomarovka (Belgorod Uyezd, , inhabitants), Miropolye (Sudzha Uyezd, over , inhabitants. See Reports and Investigations, Vol. I, Information for -). In the same villages you will also find leather \u201cworks\u201d (see Directory for ). The principal \u201chandicraft\u201d industry is leather and boot-making. It arose as far back as the first half of the th century and reached the peak of its development in the s of the th century having become \u201ca stable organisation of a purely commercial character.\u201d The whole business was monopolised by contractors, who bought the leather and gave it out to be processed by handicraftsmen. The railways destroyed this monopoly character of capital, and the capitalist contractors transferred their capital to more profitable undertakings. Today it is organised as follows: there are about  big entrepreneurs; they own workshops where wage-workers are employed, and also distribute work to homes; there are as many as , small independent masters (who, however, buy their leather from the big ones); there are  people who work at home (for the big masters), and as many wage-workers; then there are the apprentices. The total number of boot-makers is over ,. In addition, there are handicraft potters, icon-case makers, icon painters, table-cloth weavers, etc.\n\nA highly characteristic and typical example of capitalist manufacture is the squirrel-fur industry in Kargopol Uyezd, Olonets Gubernia, described with such knowledge of the facts, and with truthful and artless presentation of the whole life of the industrial population by a craftsman and teacher in the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission (Vol. IV). According to his description (in ), the industry has existed since the beginning of the th century:  masters employ  workers, in addition to which they have as many as , seamstresses and some  families of furriers working for them at home (in different villages), , to , persons in all, with an output totalling , rubles. As a point of interest, it should be noted that when this was a flourishing industry it was not included in the \u201cfactory\u201d statistics. The Directory for  makes no mention of it. But when it began to decline the statistics included it. The Directory for  listed for the town and the uyezd of Kargopol  works, with  workers and an output totalling , rubles, whereas the List gave  works, with  workers (plus  outside) and an output totalling , rubles.[] The order of things prevailing in this branch of capitalist manufacture is very instructive as a specimen of what goes on in our age-old, purely native \u201chandicraft industries,\u201d that have been left stranded in one of Russia\u2019s numerous rural backwoods. The craftsmen work  hours a day in a very unhealthy atmosphere and earn  rubles per month, less than  or  rubles per year. The masters\u2019 incomes amount to about , rubles per annum. The relations between masters and workers are \u201cpatriarchal\u201d: according to ancient custom, the master gives the workers kvass and salt gratis, which they have to beg from his cook. As a mark of gratitude to the master (for \u201cgiving\u201d them work) the workers come, without pay, to pull squirrel tails, and also clean furs after work. The workers live in the workshop all the week, and the masters knock them about, seemingly in a joke (p. , loc. cit.), make them do all sorts of jobs, such as raking hay, shovelling snow, fetching water, rinsing clothes, etc. Labour is astonishingly cheap in Kargopol itself, and the peasants in the vicinity \u201care ready to work for next to nothing.\u201d Work is done by hand, there is systematic division of labour, and there is a lengthy apprenticeship ( to  years); the lot of the apprentices can easily be imagined.\n\n) The Remaining Livestock Processing Trades\nA particularly noteworthy example of capitalist manufacture is the celebrated boot industry of the village of Kimry, Korcheva Uyezd, Tver Gubernia, and its environs.[] The industry is a very old one, having existed since the th century. Since the Reform, it has continued to grow and develop. In the early s Pletnev counted  volosts in the area covered by this industry, but in  the area included  volosts. Basically the organisation of the industry is as follows. It is headed by the owners of big workshops employing wage-workers; they distribute the cut-out leather to be made up by outside workers. Mr. Pletnev counted  such masters, employing  adults and  boys, with an output totalling , rubles, while the number of workers occupied at home for these capitalists is estimated by the author approximately at , adults and , boys. Then come the small masters, each with  to  wage-workers and  to  boys. These masters dispose of their goods mainly in the village market in Kimry; they number  and have  adults and  boys working for them; output totals , rubles. Hence, there are  masters altogether, employing , adults (of whom , work at home) and , boys (of whom , work at home), with an output totalling ,, rubles. Further, there are workshops which do various individual operations: currying (skin-cleaning with scraper); chipping (gluing of chips left from currying); special carting ( masters, with  employees and up to  horses); special carpentry (box-making), etc.[] Pletnev calculated the total output at . million rubles for the whole district. In  the number of handicraftsmen was computed at ,, and with migrants, ,, with an output totalling . million rubles. As to conditions of labour, it is important to note the excessively long working day ( to  hours) and the extremely insanitary working conditions, payment in goods, etc. The centre of the industry, Kimry village, \u201cis more like a small town\u201d (Reports and Investigations, I, ); the inhabitants are poor agriculturists, and are engaged in their industry all the year round; only the rural handicraftsmen give up the industry during haymaking. The houses in Kimry village are urban, and the inhabitants are distinguished for their urban habits of life (such as \u201cshowiness\u201d). Until very recently this industry was not included in \u201cfactory\u201d statistics, probably because the masters \u201creadily style themselves handicraftsmen\u201d (ibid., ). The List has for the first time included  boot workshops in Kimry district, with  to  workers each on the premises, and with no outside workers. Of course, it contains no end of gaps.\n\nManufacture also includes the button industry of Moscow Gubernia, Bronnitsi and Bogorodskoye uyezds \u2014 the making of buttons from hoofs and rams\u2019 horns. Engaged in this industry are  workers, employed in  establishments; the output totals , rubles. Establishments with fewer than  employees number ; those with  to  \u2014 ; those with  and more \u2014 . Masters who do without wage-workers number only ; these work for big masters, using the latter\u2019s materials. Only the big industrialists (who, as is evident from the figures given, should have from  to  workers per establishment) are quite independent. It is they, evidently, who figure in the Directory as \u201cfactory owners\u201d (see p. :  establishments with an output totalling , rubles and with  workers). This is \u201cserial manufacture\u201d; the horns are first steamed in what is called the \u201csmithy\u201d (a wooden hut with a furnace); then they are passed on to the workshop where they are cut up, after which they go to a stamping press, where the pattern is imprinted, and, lastly, are finished and polished on lathes. The industry has its apprentices. The working day is  hours. Payment in goods is a regular thing. The relations between masters and men are patriarchal, as seen in the following: the master calls the workers \u201cboys,\u201d and the pay-book is called the \u201cboys\u2019 book\u201d; when the master pays the workers, he lectures them and never grants in full their \u201crequests\u201d for payment.\n\nThe horn industry, which is included in our table of small industries (Appendix I to Chapter V, Industries Nos.  and ), is also of the same type. \u201cHandicraftsmen\u201d employing dozens of wage-workers figure also in the Directory as \u201cfactory owners\u201d (p. ). Division of labour is practised; work is also given out to home workers (horn trimmers). The centre of the industry in Bogorodsk Uyezd is the big village of Khoteichi, where agriculture is receding into the background (population in  was ,). The Moscow Zemstvo publication stated quite rightly: Handicraft Industries of Bogorodsk Uyezd, Moscow Gubernia, in , that this village \u201cis nothing but a large comb manufactory \u201d (p. , our italics). In , over  industrialists were counted in this village, with an output of from . to . million combs. \u201cMore often than not, the horn dealer is also a buyer-up of finished goods, and in many cases a big comb-maker as well.\u201d The position of those makers who are compelled to take horns \u201cat piece rates\u201d is particularly bad: \u201ctheir position is actually worse than that of the wage-workers in the big establishments.\u201d Dire need compels them to exploit the labour of their whole families beyond measure, to lengthen their working day and to put juveniles to work. \u201cDuring the winter, work in Khoteichi starts at one o\u2019clock in the morning, and it is hard to say for certain when it ends in the cottage of the \u2018independent\u2019 craftsman doing \u2018piece-work.\u2019\u201d Payment in goods is widely practised. \u201cThis system, eliminated with such difficulty from the factories, is still in full force in the small handicraft establishments\u201d (). Probably, the horn goods industry is organised on similar lines in Kadnikov Uyezd, Vologda Gubernia, in the area of Ustye village (known as \u201cUstyanshchina\u201d), where there are  hamlets. Mr. V. Borisov (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, Vol. IX) counts  handicraftsmen here, with an output totalling , rubles; all the handicraftsmen work for capitalists, who buy horns in St. Petersburg and tortoise-shell abroad.\n\nAt the head of the brush industry in Moscow Gubernia (see Appendix I to Chapter V, Industry No. ) we find big establishments with a large number of wage-workers and with systematic division of labour.[] It is interesting to note at this point the changes that took place in the organisation of this industry between  and  (see Moscow Zemstvo publication: The Brush Industry According to the Investigation of  ). Some well-to-do industrialists went to Moscow to carry on the industry there. The number of industrialists increased %, the increase being particularly large in the number of women (+%) and girls (+%). The number of big workshops with wage-workers diminished: the proportion of establishments with wage-workers dropped from % to %. This was due to the fact that the masters began to distribute work to be done in the home. The introduction into general use of the drilling machine (for making holes in brush blocks) accelerated and facilitated one of the main processes in brushmaking. The demand for \u201csetters\u201d (craftsmen who \u201cset\u201d bristle in the block) increased; and this operation, which became increasingly specialised, fell to the lot of women, their labour being cheaper. The women began to work at home setting bristle, and were paid by the piece. Thus, the growing resort to domestic industry was caused in this case by progress in technique (drilling machine), progress in division of labour (the women do nothing but set bristle), and progress in capitalist exploitation (the labour of women and girls being cheaper). This example shows very clearly that domestic industry by no means eliminates the concept of capitalist manufacture, but, on the contrary, is sometimes even a sign of its further development.\n\n) The Processing of Mineral Products\nIn the section relating to ceramics we get an example of capitalist manufacture in the industries of the Gzhel district (an area of  villages Bronnitsi and Bogorodskoye uyezds, Moscow Gubernia). The relevant statistics are given in our table of small industries (Appendix I to Chapter V, Industries Nos. ,  and ). From these data it is evident that despite the enormous differences between the three Gzhel industries: pottery, porcelain and decorative, these differences disappear as we pass from one grade of establishment to another in each industry, and we get a series of workshops of successively increasing dimensions. Here are the average numbers of workers per establishment according to grade in these three industries: . \u2014 . \u2014 . \u2014 .. \u2014 . \u2014 . \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 .. In other words, the workshops range from the very smallest to the very biggest. There is no doubt that the big establishments belong to the category of capitalist manufacture (inasmuch as they have not introduced machines, have not developed into factories); what is important, however, is not only this, but also that the small establishments are connected with the big ones ; that we have a single system of industry here and not separate workshops of one or other type of economic organisation. \u201cGzhel constitutes a single economic whole\u201d (Isayev, loc. cit., ), and the big workshops in the district have grown slowly and gradually out of the small ones (ibid., ). The work is done by hand,[] with considerable division of labour : among the potters we find wheel hands (specialising in different sorts of pottery), kilnmen, etc., and sometimes special workers for preparing colours. In the manufacture of porcelain-ware division of labour is extremely detailed: crushers, wheel hands, feeders, kilnmen, decorators, etc. The wheel hands even specialise in the various kinds of porcelain ware (cf. Isayev, loc. cit., : in one case division of labour increases productivity of labour by %). The decorators\u2019 shops work for the porcelain makers and are, therefore, only departments of the latter\u2019s manufactories, performing a special detailed operation. It is characteristic of developed capitalist manufacture that physical strength itself becomes a specialty. Thus, in Gzhel, some of the villages are engaged (almost to a man) in clay digging; for heavy work not requiring special skill (grinding), workers from the Tula and Ryazan gubernias are employed almost exclusively, being superior in strength and vigour to the not very robust Gzhelians. Payment in goods is widely practised. Agriculture is in a bad way. \u201cThe Gzhelians are a degenerating race\u201d (Isayev, ) \u2014 weak-chested, narrow-shouldered, feeble; the decorators lose their sight at an early age, etc. Capitalist division of labour breaks up the worker and deforms him. The working day is from  to  hours.\n\n) The Metal Trades. The Pavlovo Industries\nThe celebrated Pavlovo lock and cutlery industries cover the whole of Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, and Murom Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia. These industries originated very long ago. Smirnov states that as far back as  there were (according to the cadastres[])  smithies in Pavlovo. By the middle of the th century these industries constituted a far-flung network of fully developed capitalist relations. After the Reform, the industries in this district continued to develop and expand. According to the Zemstvo census of , in Gorbatov Uyezd  volosts and  villages were engaged in industry; a total of , households, , male workers (% of the total number working in these villages) and , old men, juveniles and women, , persons in all. In the Murom Uyezd, Mr. Grigoryev in  registered  industrial volosts,  villages, , households and , male workers (% of the total number working in these villages). Not only were large, non-agricultural industrial villages formed (Pavlovo, Vorsma), but even the surrounding peasants were diverted from agriculture: outside of Pavlovo and Vorsma, in Gorbatov Uyezd, , persons were engaged in industries, of whom ,, or more than half did not engage in agriculture. Life in centres like Pavlovo has become quite urban and has given rise to incomparably more developed requirements, more cultured environment, clothes, manner of life, etc., than among the surrounding \u201craw\u201d peasants.[]\n\nTurning to the economic organisation of the Pavlovo industries, we must first of all note the indubitable fact that the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d are headed by the most typical capitalist manufactories. For example, in the Zavyalovs\u2019 establishment (which already in the s employed over  workers at the bench and has now introduced a steam engine) a penknife passes through  or  hands: the forger, blade-maker, handle-maker (usually an outside worker), hardener, facer, polisher, finisher, grinder and marker. This is extensive capitalist co-operation based on division of labour, with a considerable number of the workers performing individual operations employed at home and not in the capitalist\u2019s workshop. Here are facts given by Mr. Labzin (in ) on the bigger establishments in the villages of Pavlovo, Vorsma and Vacha, covering all branches of production in this district:  proprietors had  workers occupied on the premises and , workers outside, making a total of ,, with an output totalling , rubles. How far this description of economic relations is applicable to the whole district at the present time may be seen from the following data[]:\n\nNumbers of persons engaged in industries and working.\nThus, the organisation of the industry as outlined by us prevails in all the districts. All in all, about three-fifths of the total number of workers are employed capitalistically. Here too, consequently, we find manufacture predominating in the general structure of the industry[] and holding masses of workers under its sway, without, however, being able to eradicate small production. The relative tenacity of the latter is fully explained, firstly, by the fact that in some branches of the Pavlovo industry mechanised production has not yet been introduced at all (for instance, in lock-making); and, secondly, by the fact that the small producer tries to save himself from sinking by resorting to means that cause him to sink far lower than the wage-worker. These means are: lengthening the working day, and reducing the standard of living and of general requirements. \u201cThe earnings of the group of handicraftsmen who work for proprietors are less subject to fluctuation\u201d (Grigoryev, loc. cit., ); at Zavyalovs\u2019, for example, the lowest-paid worker is the handle-maker; \u201che works at home, and that is why he is satisfied with lower earnings\u201d (). The handicraftsmen who work \u201cfor factory owners\u201d are \u201cable to earn somewhat more than the average earnings of the one who takes his products to the market. Larger earnings are particularly noticeable among the workers who live in the factories\u201d ().[] The working day in the \u201cfactories\u201d is from  / to  hours, with a maximum of  hours. \u201cThe working day of the home-working handicraftsmen, on the other hand, is never less than  hours and sometimes as much as  and even  hours\u201d (ibid.). It would not be in the least surprising if the law of June , [] caused an increase here in home-work; it is high time these \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d directed their efforts towards compelling the proprietors to organise factories! Let the reader also recall the notorious Pavlovo \u201cloan-purchase,\u201d \u201cexchange,\u201d \u201cwife-pawning\u201d and similar forms of bondage and personal degradation which grind down the quasi-independent small producer.[] Fortunately, rapidly developing large-scale machine industry does not so readily tolerate these worst forms of exploitation as manufacture does. Running ahead a little, let us quote data on the growth of factory production in this district.[]\n\nGrowth of factory production.\nWe thus see that ever-increasing numbers of workers are being drawn into large establishments, which are going over to the use of machines.[]\n) Other Metal Trades\nThe industries of Bezvodnoye village, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia and Uyezd also come under the head of capitalist manufacture. This is also an industrial village, the majority of whose inhabitants do not engage in agriculture at all, and which serves as the centre of an industrial area of several villages. According to the Zemstvo census of  (Material, Vol. VIII, Nizhni-Novgorod, ), in the Bezvodnoye Volost ( households) .% of the households cultivated no land, .% had no horses, .% engaged in industries, and .% had literate persons and schoolchildren in the family (as against an average for the uyezd of .%). The Bezvodnoye industries are devoted to the production of various metal goods: chains, fish-hooks, and metal fabrics; the output was estimated at  / million rubles in [] and  / million rubles in -.[] The organisation of the industry is as follows: work for proprietors, using their materials, which is distributed among a number of workers performing single operations and done partly in the employers\u2019 workshops and partly in the home. For example, in the making of fish-hooks the various operations are performed by \u201cbenders,\u201d \u201ccutters\u201d (who work in a special shed) and \u201cpointers\u201d (women and children who sharpen the hook-points in their homes); all these work at piece rates for the capitalist, while the bender gives out work on his own account to the cutters and pointers. \u201cMetal wire is now done by horse-driven windlasses; formerly the wire was drawn by blind men, who were brought here in large numbers. . . .\u201d One of the \u201cspecialities\u201d of capitalist manufacture! \u201cThe conditions under which this work is done differ very much from those in all the other trades. People have to work in a stifling atmosphere filled with the harmful vapours emanating from accumulated horse dung.\u201d[] Organised on the same lines of capitalist manufacture are the screen,[] the pin,[] and the gold-thread industries.[] In the last-named industry at the beginning of the s there were  establishments, employing  workers (of whom % were hired), with an output totalling , rubles; some of these capitalist establishments were occasionally also included among the \u201cfactories and works.\u201d[]\n\nThe locksmith industries of the Burmakino Volost (and surrounding volosts) of Yaroslavl Gubernia and Uyezd are probably organised on the same lines. At all events, here we observe the same division of labour (blacksmiths, blowers and locksmiths), the same extensive development of wage-labour (of  smithies in the Burmakino Volost,  employ wage-workers), the same predominance of big capital over all these detail workers (the buyers-up are at the top; the blacksmiths work for them, and the locksmiths for the blacksmiths), the same combination of the buying up of wares with the production of wares in capitalist workshops, some of which are occasionally included among the \u201cfactories and works.\u201d[]\n\nIn the appendix to the preceding chapter, statistics were given on the tray and the copper industries[] of Moscow Gubernia (the latter in the district known as \u201cZagarye\u201d). The data show that wage-labour plays a predominant part in these industries, that the industries are headed by large workshops employing an average of from  to  wage-workers per establishment, with an average output of from , to , rubles. If we add to this that division of labour is very widely practised here,[] it will be clear that what we have is capitalist manufacture.[] \u201cThe small industrial units, which are an anomaly under the existing conditions of technique and division of labour, can only hold out alongside the big workshops by lengthening the working day to the utmost\u201d (Isayev, loc. cit., p. ) \u2014 among the tray-makers, for example, for as long as  hours. The ordinary working day here is from  to  hours; with the small proprietors it is from  to  hours. Payment in goods is widely practised (both in  and in ).[] Let us add that the lengthy existence of this industry (it arose at the beginning of the th century, at the latest) and extensive specialisation have, in this case too, produced highly skilled workers; the Zagarians are famed for their craftsmanship. Specialities have also sprung up in the industry which need no preliminary training and are within the grasp of even under-age workers. \u201cThis very possibility,\u201d Mr. Isayev rightly observes, \u201cof becoming an under-age worker at once and acquiring a trade, as it were, without having to study, indicates that the handicraft spirit, which demands the training of labour-power, is disappearing; the simplicity of many of the detailed operations is a symptom of the transition of handicraft to manufacture\u201d (loc. cit., ). Let us only observe that to a certain degree the \u201chandicraft spirit\u201d always remains in manufacture, for its basis is the same hand production.\n\n) The Jewellery, Samovar and Accordion Trades\nThe village of Krasnoye, Kostroma Gubernia and Uyezd, is one of the industrial villages usually held up as centres of our \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d capitalist manufacture. This large village (in  it had , inhabitants) is purely urban in character; the inhabitants live like townspeople and (with very few exceptions) do not engage in agriculture. Krasnoye is the centre of the jewellery industry which covers  volosts and  villages (including Sidorovskoye Volost of Nerekhta Uyezd), and in them  households and about , workers.[] \u201cThe principal representatives of industry,\u201d said Mr. Tillo, \u201care undoubtedly the big industrialists of the village of Krasnoye: the Pushilovs, Mazovs, Sorokins, Chulkovs and other merchants. They buy materials (gold, silver and copper), employ craftsmen, buy up finished articles, distribute orders for work to be done in the home, supply samples, etc.\u201d (). The big industrialists have their workshops, so-called \u201crabotorni\u201d (laboratories), where the metal is smelted and forged, then to be given out for finishing to \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d; they have technical appliances, such as \u201cpretsi\u201d (presses and dies for stamping), \u201cpunches\u201d (for embossing designs), \u201crollers\u201d (for stretching the metal), benches, etc. Division of labour is widely practised: \u201cNearly every article passes through several hands in an established order in the course of manufacture. For example, in the making of ear-rings, the master industrialist first sends the silver to his own workshop, where part of it is rolled and part drawn into wire; then on receipt of an order the material is given to a craftsman who, if he has a family, divides the work among several persons; one uses a punch to cut the silver plates into the shapes for the ear-rings, another bends the wire into the rings with which the ear-rings are attached to the ears, a third solders these parts, and, lastly, a fourth polishes the finished ear-rings. None of this work is difficult, or requires much training; very often the soldering and the polishing are done by women and by children of  or  years of age\u201d ().[] Here, too, the working day is excessively long, usually as much as  hours. Payment in provisions is common.\n\nThe following statistics (published quite recently by a local assay inspector) clearly illustrate the economic structure of the industry:[]\n\nEconomic structure of jewellery, samovar and accordion industries.\n\u201cBoth the first groups (about two-thirds of the total number of craftsmen) should be classed as home-working factory workers rather than as handicraftsmen.\u201d In the top group \u201cwage-labour occurs more and more frequently. . . . The craftsmen have begun to buy articles made by others\u201d; in the upper strata of this group \u201cbuying-up predominates,\u201d and \u201cfour of the buyers-up have no workshops at all.\u201d[]\n\nThe samovar and accordion industries in Tula town and environs are highly typical examples of capitalist manufacture. Generally speaking, the \u201chandicraft\u201d industries in this district have a long history, dating back to the th century.[] They evidenced a particularly rapid development in the middle of the th century; Mr. Borisov considers that the second period in the development of the Tula industries then began. In  the first iron foundry was built (by the Dutchman Vinius). The Tula gunsmiths formed a separate smiths\u2019 suburb, constituted a separate social estate, enjoying special rights and privileges. In  the first iron foundry was erected in Tula by a famous Tula blacksmith, and the industry spread to the Urals and Siberia.[] Then began the third period in the history of the Tula industries. The craftsmen set up their own workshops and taught the trade to surrounding peasants. In the s and s the first samovar factories were started. \u201cBy  there were in Tula  different factories that belonged to gunsmiths, while those in existence at the present time nearly all belong to one-time gunsmiths, now Tula merchants\u201d (loc. cit., ). Here, consequently, we observe a direct continuity and connection between the old guild masters and the principals of subsequent capitalist manufacture. In  the Tula gunsmiths were freed from serf dependence[] and assigned to the burgher estate; earnings dropped as a consequence of the severe competition of the village handicraftsmen (which caused a reverse flow of industrialists from town to country); the workers turned to the samovar, lock, cutlery, and accordion industries (the first Tula accordions appeared in -).\n\nThe samovar industry is at present organised as follows. It is headed by big capitalists who own workshops employing tens and hundreds of wage-workers, but they also distribute many separate operations to be done by workers, urban and rural, in their homes; those who perform these operations sometimes still have their own workshops and employ wage-workers. Naturally, side by side with the big there are small workshops, with all the consecutive stages of dependence upon the capitalists. Division of labour is the general basis of the whole structure of this trade. The process of samovar-making is divided into the following separate operations: ) rolling the copper sheets into tubes (tubing); ) soldering the tubes; ) filing the seams; ) fitting the bottoms; ) beating out the shapes; ) cleaning the insides: ) turning the bodies and necks; ) plating; ) press-punching the vents in the bottoms and the covers; ) assembling the samovars. Further, there are the separate processes of casting the small copper parts: a) preparing the moulds and b) casting.[] Where work is given out to be done in the home, each of these operations may constitute a special \u201chandicraft\u201d industry. One of these \u201cindustries\u201d was described by Mr. Borisov in Vol. VII of the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission. This industry (samovar tubing) consists in peasants doing at piece rates one of the operations we have described, using merchants\u2019 materials. The handicraftsmen left Tula town to work in the countryside after ; the cost of living and standard of requirements were lower in the countryside (loc. cit., p. ). Mr. Borisov quite rightly attributes this tenacity of the \u201chandicraftsman\u201d to the retention of hand-labour in the beating out of samovars; \u201cit will always be profitable for the manufacturer to employ the village handicraftsman, because he works at from  to % below the rate of the urban artisan\u201d ().\n\nMr. Borisov estimated the value of the output of samovars in  at approximately  million rubles, the number of workers (handicraftsmen included) totalling from , to ,. In this case also the factory statistics cover only a fraction of capitalist manufacture. The Directory for  counted in Tula Gubernia  samovar \u201cfactories\u201d (all hand-operated) with , workers and an output totalling , rubles. The Directory for  gives  factories, , workers, and an output of . million rubles; the list of firms, however, contains only  factories ( steam operated), with , workers and an output totalling , rubles. Evidently, some hundred small establishments were in this case classed as \u201cfactories.\u201d Lastly, the List gives the following for -:  factories ( steam-operated), , workers (+  outside), and an output totalling ,, rubles. In these data neither the number of factories nor the number of workers are comparable (for the reason given above, and also because of the lumping together in previous years of workers on the premises and outside). The only thing beyond doubt is that manufacture is being steadily displaced by large-scale machine industry: in , there were  factories with  and more workers; in  there were  (one steam-operated) and in - there were  (three steam-operated).[]\n\nThe accordion industry, which is at a lower stage of economic development, is organised in precisely the same way.[] \u201cIn the making of accordions there are over ten separate trades\u201d (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, IX, ); the making of the different parts of an accordion or the performance of some of the operations constitute separate, quasi-independent \u201chandicraft\u201d industries. \u201cWhen things are quiet all the handicraftsmen work for factories or for more or less big workshops, the owners of which supply them with materials; when, however, there is a brisk demand for accordions, a large number of small producers appear, who buy up parts from the handicraftsmen, assemble them and take the finished articles to the local shops where accordions are very readily purchased\u201d (ibid.). Mr. Borisov in  estimated from , to , workers in this industry, with an output totalling about  million rubles; factory statistics in  showed two \u201cfactories,\u201d with  workers and an output totalling , rubles; in ,  factories, with  workers and an output totalling , rubles; in - one factory, with  workers (plus  outside) and an output totalling , rubles.[] Steam-engines are not employed at all. All these figure variations indicate a purely haphazard picking of individual establishments which are component parts of the complex organism of capitalist manufacture.\n\nNotes\n[] Cf.

It would be impossible and superfluous to give detailed data on all the weaving industries described in the literature on our handicraft industry. Moreover, in the majority of these industries the factory now reigns supreme. On the subject of \u201chandicraft weaving\u201d see also Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vols.

But according to Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia (Vol. VI, Pt.

(Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The centre of this industry is Sosnovka Volost, where the Zemstvo census of  counted , households, with a population of , persons of both sexes;  industrial establishments. Altogether in the volost % of the households were houseless (as against .% in the uyezd), and .% of the households cultivated on land (as against .% in the uyezd). See Statistical Returns for Saratou Gubernia, Vol. XI. \u2014 Capitalist manufacture has, consequently, created industrial centres here too which divorce the workers from the land.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The sources are shown in the text. The number of establishments is about half the number of independent workers ( establishments in Vasilyev Vrag,  +  +  in Krasnoye village and  establishments in the  small villages).

I, p. ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us observe that in this industry, as in the above-described weaving industries, capitalist manufacture is, strictly speaking, the economy of yesterday. Characteristic of the post-Reform era is the transformation of this manufacture into large-scale machine industry. The number of Gzhel potteries using steam-engines was  in ,  in  and  in  (according to data in The Ministry of Finance Yearbook, Vol. I, and Directory for  and ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See above regarding the greater literacy of the population of Pavlovo and Vorsma and the migration of peasants from the villages to these centres.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Data from Zemstvo statistical Material, and Mr. Annensky\u2019s Report, and also A. N. Potresov\u2019s researches (cited above). The figures for the Murom district are approximate. The number of inhabitants, according to the  census, was , in Vorsma, and , in Pavlovo.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The data we have given by no means express this predominance to the full: as will presently be seen, the handicraftsmen who work for the market are subjugated to capital even more than those who work for proprietors, and the latter handicraftsmen even more than the wage-workers. The Pavlovo industries show in strong relief that inseparable connection between merchant\u2019s and industrial capital which in general is characteristic of capitalist manufacture in its relation to the small producers.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Connection with the land is also an important factor in reducing earnings. The village handicraftsmen \u201con the whole earn less than the Pavlovo locksmiths\u201d (Annensky Report, p. ). True, we must bear in mind that the former grow their own grain, but even so \u201cthe conditions of the ordinary village handicraftsman can scarcely be considered better than those of the average Pavlovo locksmith\u201d ().\u2014Lenin\n\n[] During crises it also happens that they work literally without pay, exchange \u201cwhite for black,\u201d i.e., finished goods for raw materials; this happens \u201cquite often\u201d (Grigoryev, ibid., ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Data taken from Directory and List for the whole district, including the villages of Selitba and Vacha and their environs. The Directory for  undoubtedly included outside workers in the total number of factory workers; we have estimated the number of outside workers approximately, confining ourselves to a correction only for the two biggest establishments (the Zavyalovs and F. Varypayev). To compare the figures for \u201cfactories and works\u201d in the List and the Directory, only establishments with  and more workers must be taken (this is examined in greater detail in our Studies, article: On the Question of Our Factory Statistics) (See present edition, Vol. .\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In one branch of the Pavlovo industry, lock-making, there is, on the contrary, a decline in the number of workshops employing wage-workers. A. N. Potresov (loc. cit.), who recorded this fact in detail, pointed to its cause \u2014 the competition of the lock-making factory in Kovno Gubernia (Schmidt Brothers, which in  had  workers, with an output of , rubles, and in - had  workers, with an output of , rubles).\u2014Lenin\n\nIII. Technique in Manufacture. Division of Labour and its Significance\nLet us now draw conclusions from the foregoing data and see whether they are really indicative of a special stage in the development of capitalism in our industry.\n\nThe feature common to all the industries we have examined is the retention of hand production and systematic, widely practised division of labour. The process of production is split up into several single operations performed by different specialist craftsmen. The training of such specialists takes a fairly long time, and therefore a natural concomitant of manufacture is apprenticeship. It is well known that under the general conditions of commodity economy and capitalism this gives rise to the worst forms of personal dependence and exploitation.[] The disappearance of apprenticeship is connected with a higher development of manufacture and with the advent of large-scale machine industry, when machines reduce the period of training to a minimum or when such simple single operations arise as can be done even by children (see above example of Zagarye).\n\nThe retention of hand production as the basis of manufacture explains its comparative immobility, which is particularly striking when compared with the factory. The development and extension of division of labour proceeds very slowly, so that for whole decades (and even centuries) manufacture retains its form once it has been adopted; as we have seen, quite a number of the industries examined are of quite ancient origin, yet no great changes in methods of production have been observed in the majority of them until recently.\n\nAs for division of labour, we shall not repeat here the commonly known tenets of theoretical economics concerning the part it plays in the process of development of the productive powers of labour. On the basis of hand production no other progress in technique was possible except by division of labour.[] Let us merely note the two major circumstances that make clear the need for division of labour as a preparatory stage for large-scale machine industry. Firstly, the introduction of machines is possible only when the production process has been split into a number of the simplest, purely mechanical operations; machines are first used for the simplest operations and their spread to the more complicated processes is very gradual. For example, in weaving, the power-loom has long predominated in the production of plain fabrics, whereas silk weaving continues to be carried on mainly by hand; in the engineering trade the machine is applied first of all to one of the simplest operations \u2013 grinding, etc. But this splitting of production into the simplest operations, while being a necessary preparatory step to the introduction of large-scale machine production, leads at the same time to a growth of small industries. The surrounding population is enabled to perform such detailed operations in its homes, either to order of the manufactory owners, using their materials (bristle setting in brush manufacture, sewing sheepskins, sheepskin coats, mittens, boots, etc., in the leather trade, horn trimming in comb manufacture, samovar \u201ctubing,\u201d etc.), or even \u201cindependently\u201d buying the materials, making certain parts of the product and selling them to the manufacturers (in the hat, carriage, accordion and other industries, etc.). It seems paradoxical that the growth of small (sometimes even \u201cindependent\u201d) industries should be an expression of the growth of capitalist manufacture: nevertheless it is a fact. The \u201cindependence\u201d of such \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d is quite fictitious. Their work could not be done, and their product would on occasion even have no use-value, if there were no connection with other detailed operations, with other parts of the product. And only big capital, ruling (in one form or another) over a mass of workers performing separate operations was able[] to and did create this connection. One of the main errors of Narodnik economics is that it ignores or obscures the fact that the \u201chandicraftsman\u201d performing a single operation is a constituent part of the capitalist manufactory.\n\nThe second circumstance that must particularly be stressed is that manufacture trains skilled workers. Large-scale machine industry could not have developed so quickly in the post-Reform period had it not been preceded by a long period in which manufacture trained workers. For instance, the investigators of the \u201chandicraft\u201d weaving industry of the Pokrov Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, note the remarkable \u201ctechnical skill and experience\u201d of the weavers of Kudykino Volost (where the village of Orekhovo and the famous Morozov mills are situated): \u201cnowhere. . . do we find such intensity . . . of labour . . . ; a strict division of labour between the weaver and the bobbin-hand is invariably practised here. . . .\u201d \u201cThe past . . . has imparted to the Kudykinians . . . expert skill in the technique of production . . . an ability to cope with all sorts of difficulties.\u201d[] \u201cFactories cannot be erected in any village and in any number,\u201d we read in reference to silk weaving: \u201cthe factory must follow the weaver into the villages where, due to migratory labour\u201d (or, let us add, due to domestic industry), \u201ca contingent of proficient workers has been formed.\u201d[] Establishments like the St. Petersburg boot factory[][] could not have developed so quickly if in the district around Kimry village, say, skilled workers who have now taken to migration had not been developing for centuries, etc. That, incidentally, is why very great importance attaches to the formation by manufacture of a whole number of large districts which specialised in certain trades and trained large numbers of skilled workers.[]\n\nDivision of labour in capitalist manufacture disfigures and cripples the worker, including the \u201chandicraftsman\u201d who makes single parts. It produces virtuosi and cripples; the former as rare exceptions, whose skill arouses the astonishment of investigators,[] and the latter in the shape of the mass of \u201chandicraftsmen,\u201d \u2013 weak-chested, with inordinately developed arms, \u201ccurvature of the spine,\u201d[] etc., etc.\n\nNotes\n[] Let us confine ourselves to one example. In the village of Borisovka, Graivoron Uyezd, Kursk Gubernia, there is an icon-painting industry, employing about  persons. The majority of the craftsmen hire no workers, but keep apprentices, who work from  to  hours a day. When a proposal was made to set up an art school, these craftsmen strongly opposed it, for fear of losing the gratuitous labour-power of their apprentices (Reports and Investigations, I, ). In domestic industry the conditions of children under capitalist manufacture are no better than those of apprentices, since the domestic worker is compelled to lengthen the working day and exert all the efforts of his family to the utmost.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cThe domestic form of large-scale production and manufacture are an inevitable and to a certain extent even a desirable way out for small independent industry when it covers a large district\u201d (Kharizomenov, in Yuridichesky Vestnik, , No. , p. ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Why is it that only capital was able to create this connection? Because, as we have seen, commodity production gives rise to the scattered condition of the small producers and to their complete differentiation, and because the small industries bequeathed to manufacture a heritage of capitalist workshops and merchant\u2019s capital.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, IV, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid., III, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In  it had  workers and an output of , rubles; in -,  workers, output ,, rubles.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] This is very aptly described by the term \u201cwholesale crafts.\u201d \u201cBeginning with the th century,\u201d writes Korsak, \u201crural industry began to develop more perceptibly; whole villages, especially those near Moscow and situated along the high roads, began to engage in some particular industry; the inhabitants of some became tanners, of others weavers, and of still others dyers, cartwrights, smiths, etc. . . . Towards the close of the last century very many of these wholesale crafts, as some call them, had developed in Russia\u201d (loc. cit., -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us confine ourselves to two examples: Khvorov, the celebrated Pavlovo locksmith, made  locks to a weight of one zolotnik (. grammes. \u2013Ed.); some of the parts of these locks were no larger than a pin\u2019s head (Labzin, loc. cit., ). One toy-maker in Moscow Gubernia spent nearly all his life finishing harnessed horses and achieved such dexterity that he could finish  a day (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VI, Pt. II, pp. -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] This is how Mr. Grigoryev describes the Pavlovo handicraftsmen. \u201cI met one of these workers . . . who for six years had been working at the same vice and had with his bare left foot worn more than half way through the board on which he stood; with bitter irony he said that the employer intended to get rid of him when he had worn the board right through\u201d (op. cit., pp. -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Lenin refers here to the factory owned by the St. Petersburg Footwear Manufacturing Company, established in . In - the factory employed  workers and the value of its output was ,, rubles (figures taken from the List of Factories and Works, St. Petersburg, , Issue No. , pp. -). [p. ]\n\nIV. The Territorial Division of Labour and the Separation of Agriculture From Industry\nDirectly connected with division of labour in general is, as has been noted, territorial division of labour \u2013 the specialisation of certain districts in the production of some one product, of one sort of product and even of a certain part of a product. The predominance of hand production, the existence of a mass of small establishments, the preservation of the worker\u2019s connection with the land, the tying of the craftsman to a given trade, \u2013 all this inevitably gives rise to the seclusion of the different industrial districts of manufacture; sometimes this local seclusion amounts to complete isolation from the rest of the world,[] with which only the merchant masters have dealings.\n\nIn the following effusion Mr. Kharizomenov underrates the significance of the territorial division of labour: \u201cThe vast distances of the Empire go hand in hand with sharp differences of natural conditions: one locality is rich in timber and wild animals, another in cattle, while a third abounds in clay or iron. These natural features determined the character of industry. The great distances and inconveniences of communication made the transport of raw materials impossible, or extremely costly. As a result, industry had necessarily to nestle where an abundance of raw material was close at hand. Hence the characteristic feature of our industry \u2013 the specialisation of commodity production in large and compact areas\u201d (Yuridichesky Vestnik, loc. cit., p. ).\n\nTerritorial division of labour is not a characteristic feature of our industry, but of manufacture (both in Russia and in other countries); the small industries did not produce such extensive districts, while the factory broke down their seclusion and facilitated the transfer of establishments and masses of workers to other places. Manufacture not only creates compact areas, but introduces specialisation within these areas (division of labour as to wares). The availability of raw materials in the given locality is not at all essential for manufacture, and is hardly even usual for it, for manufacture presupposes fairly wide commercial intercourse.[]\n\nConnected with the above-described features of manufacture is the circumstance that this stage of capitalist evolution is marked by a specific form of separation of agriculture from industry. It is no longer the peasant who is the most typical industrialist, but the non-farming \u201cartisan\u201d (and at the other pole \u2013 the merchant and the workshop owner). In most cases (as we have seen) the industries organised on the lines of manufacture have non-agricultural centres: either towns or (much more often) villages, whose inhabitants hardly engage in agriculture at all, and which should be classed as settlements of a commercial and industrial character. The separation of industry from agriculture is here deeply rooted in the technique of manufacture, in its economy, and in the peculiarities of its way of life (or culture). Technique ties the worker to one trade and therefore, on the one hand, renders him unfit for agriculture (physically weak, etc.), and, on the other, demands continuous and long pursuit of the craft. The economic structure of manufacture is characterised by a far deeper differentiation among the industrialists than is the case in the small industries; and we have seen that in the small industries, differentiation in industry is paralleled by differentiation in agriculture. With the utter pauperisation of the mass of producers, which is a condition and a consequence of manufacture, its working personnel cannot be recruited from among farmers who are at all economically sound. Among the cultural peculiarities of manufacture are, firstly, the very lengthy (sometimes age-old) existence of the industry, which leaves its impress upon the population; and secondly, the higher standard of living of the population.[] We shall deal with the latter circumstance in greater detail further on, but first let us note that manufacture does not bring about the complete separation of industry from agriculture. Under hand technique the big establishments cannot eliminate the small ones completely, especially if the small handicraftsmen lengthen their working day and reduce the level of their requirements: under such conditions, manufacture, as we have seen, even develops the small industries. It is natural, therefore, that in the majority of cases we see around the non-agricultural centre of manufacture a whole region of agricultural settlements, the inhabitants of which also engage in industries. Hence, in this respect, too, we find clearly revealed the transitional character of manufacture between small hand production and the factory. If even in the West the manufacturing period of capitalism could not bring about the complete separation of the industrial workers from agriculture,[] in Russia, with the preservation of many institutions that tie the peasants to the land, such separation could not but be retarded. Therefore, we repeat, what is most typical of Russian capitalist manufacture is the non-agricultural centre which attracts the population of the surrounding villages \u2013 the inhabitants of which are semi-agriculturists and semi-industrialists \u2013 and dominates these villages.\n\nParticularly noteworthy in this connection is the fact of the higher cultural level of the population of such non-agricultural centres. A higher degree of literacy, a considerably higher standard of requirements and life, vigorous dissociation from the \u201crawness\u201d of \u201cnative village soil\u201d \u2013 such are the usual distinguishing features of the inhabitants of such centres.[] One can understand the enormous significance of this fact, which clearly demonstrates the progressive historical role of capitalism, and moreover of purely \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d capitalism, which even the most ardent Narodnik would scarcely dare characterise as \u201cartificial,\u201d since the overwhelming majority of the centres described are usually classified under the heading of \u201chandicraft\u201d industry! The transitional character of manufacture is revealed here too, since it merely begins the transformation of the mentality of the population, and only large-scale machine industry completes it.\n\nNotes\n[] The squirrel-fur industry in Kargopol Uyezd, the wooden spoon industry in Semyonov Uyezd.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Imported (i.e., not local) raw material is used in the weaving industries, the Pavlovo and Gzhel industries, the Perm leather industries, and many others (cf. Studies, pp. -). (See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia. \u2013Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. V. V. in his Essays on Handicraft Industry, assures us that \u201cin our country . . . there are very few localities of handicraft industry where agriculture has been entirely abandoned\u201d () \u2013 we have shown above that, on the contrary, there are very many \u2013 and that \u201cthe slight manifestations of division of labour that we observe in our country must be ascribed not so much to the energy of industrial progress as to the immobility of the size of peasant holdings. . . \u201d (). Mr. V. V. fails to notice that these \u201clocalities of handicraft industry\u201d are distinguished by a special system of technique, economy and culture, and that they characterise a specific stage in the development of capitalism. The important thing is that the majority of \u201cindustrial villages\u201d received the \u201csmallest allotments\u201d () \u2013 (in , after their industrial life had proceeded for scores and in some cases hundreds of years!) \u2013 and of course, had there not been this connivance of the authorities there would have been no capitalism.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Das Kapital, I, -.[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The importance of this fact impels us to supplement the data given in \u00a7 II with the following. Buturlinovka settlement, Bobrov Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia, is one of the centres of leather production. There are , households, of which , do not engage in agriculture. Population over ,. Households with literate persons constitute %, as against % for the uyezd (Zemstvo statistical returns for Bobrov Uyezd). Pokrovskaya settlement and Balakovo village, Samara Gubernia, each have over , inhabitants, of whom very many are from outside. Non-farming households \u2013 % and %. Literacy is above average. The statistical materials state that the commercial and industrial villages in general are distinguished for their higher literacy and the \u201cmass-scale appearance of non-farming households\u201d (Zemstvo statistical returns for Novouzensk and Nikolayevgk uyezds). Regarding the higher cultural level of \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d cf. additionally Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, III, p. ; VII, p. ; Smirnov, loc. cit., p. ; Grigoryev, loc. cit., p.  and foll.: Annensky, loc. cit., p. , Nizhni-Novgorod Handbook, Vol. II, pp. -; Reports and Investigations, II, p. ; III, . Then Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, p. , giving a lively account of the conversation of the investigator, Mr. Kharizomenov, with his driver, a silk-weaver. This weaver strongly and bitterly declaimed against the \u201cdrab\u201d life of the peasants, the scantiness of their requirements, their backwardness, etc., and wound up with the exclamation: \u201cGood Lord, to think what these people live for!\u201d It has long been observed that what the Russian peasant is poorest in is consciousness of his own poverty. Of the artisan in the capitalist manufactory (not to mention the factory), it must be said that in this respect he is, comparatively speaking, very rich.\u2014Lenin\n\nV. The Economic Structure of Manufacture\nIn all the industries organised on the lines of manufacture that we have examined, the vast mass of the workers are not independent, are subordinated to capital, and receive only wages, owning neither raw material nor finished product. At bottom, the overwhelming majority of the workers in these \u201cindustries\u201d are wage-workers, although this relationship never achieves in manufacture the completeness and purity characteristic of the factory. In manufacture, merchant\u2019s capital is combined with industrial capital, is interwoven with it in the most diverse ways, and the dependence of the operative on the capitalist assumes a host of forms and shades, from work for hire in another person\u2019s workshop, to work at home for a \u201cmaster,\u201d and finally to dependence in the purchase of raw material or in the sale of the product. Under manufacture, side by side with the mass of dependent workers, there always remains a more or less considerable number of quasi-independent producers. But all this diversity of forms of dependence merely covers up the main feature of manufacture, the fact that the split between the representatives of labour and of capital is already manifested in full force. By the time the emancipation of the peasants took place this split in the larger centres of Russian manufacture had already been sealed by a continuity of several generations. In all the \u201cindustries\u201d above examined we see a mass of people whose only means of livelihood is to work in a condition of dependence upon members of the propertied class; on the other hand, we see a small minority of well-to-do industrialists who control (in one form or another) nearly the whole industry of the given district. It is this fundamental fact that imparts to our manufacture a pronounced capitalist character, as distinct from the preceding stage. Dependence on capital and work for hire existed then too, but it had not yet taken definite shape, had not yet embraced the mass of industrialists, the mass of the population, had not given rise to a split among the various groups of individuals participating in production. Moreover, production itself in the preceding stage still preserves its small dimensions \u2013 the difference between the master and the worker is relatively small \u2013 there are scarcely any big capitalists (who always head manufacture) \u2013 nor are there any workers tied to a single operation and thereby tied to capital, which combines these detailed operations into a single mechanism of production.\n\nHere is an old writer\u2019s evidence which strikingly confirms this characterisation of the data cited by us above: \u201cIn the village of Kimry, as in other so-called rich Russian villages, Pavlovo, for example, half the population are beggars who live entirely on alms. . . . If an operative falls sick, and moreover lives alone, he risks going the next week without a crust of bread.\u201d[]\n\nThus, the main feature of the economy of Russian manufacture was already fully revealed by the s \u2013 the contrast between the \u201cwealth\u201d of a whole number of \u201ccelebrated\u201d \u201cvillages\u201d and the complete proletarisation of the overwhelming majority of \u201chandicraftsmen.\u201d Connected with this feature is the circumstance that the most typical workers in manufacture (namely, artisans who have entirely or virtually broken with the land) are already gravitating towards the next, and not the preceding, stage of capitalism, that they stand closer to the worker in large-scale machine industry than to the peasant. The above-quoted data on the cultural level of the handicraftsmen are striking proof of this. But that description cannot be extended to the whole mass of the working personnel in manufacture. The retention of a vast number of small establishments and small masters, the retention of connection with the land and the exceedingly extensive development of work in the home \u2013 all this leads to large numbers of \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d in manufacture gravitating still towards the peasantry, towards becoming small masters, towards the past and not the future,[] and clinging to all sorts of illusions about the possibility (by supreme exertion, by thrift and resource fullness) of becoming independent masters.[] Here is a remarkably fair appraisal of these petty-bourgeois illusions given by an investigator of the \u201chandicraft industries\u201d of Vladimir Gubernia:\n\n\u201cThe final victory of large-scale industry over small industry, the bringing together of the workers, scattered in numerous work rooms, within the walls of a single silk mill, is only a matter of time, and the sooner this victory is achieved the better it will be for the weavers.\n\u201cCharacteristic of the present organisation of the silk industry are the instability and indefiniteness of economic categories, the struggle between large-scale production, and small production and agriculture. This struggle drags the small master and the weaver into fevers of excitement, yielding them nothing but divorcing them from the land, dragging them into debt and overwhelming them in periods of depression. Concentration of production will not reduce the weaver\u2019s wages, but will make it unnecessary to entice workers and intoxicate them, to attract them with advances that do not correspond to their annual earnings. With the diminution of mutual competition factory owners lose interest in expending considerable sums on involving the weaver in debt. Moreover, large-scale production so clearly counterposes the interests of the factory owner and the workers, the wealth of the one and the poverty of the others, that the weaver cannot develop the desire to become a factory owner himself. Small production gives the weaver no more than large-scale production does, but it lacks the stability of the latter and for that reason corrupts the worker much more deeply. False hopes arise in the mind of the handicraft weaver, he looks forward to the opportunity of setting up his own loom. To achieve this ideal he strains himself to the utmost, falls into debt, steals, lies, regards his fellow-weavers not as friends in misfortune, but as enemies, as competitors for the very wretched loom that he sees in his mind\u2019s eye in the remote future. The small master does not understand his economic insignificance; he cringes to the buyers-up and the factory owners, hides from his fellow-weavers where and on what terms he buys his raw materials and sells his product. Imagining that he is an independent master, he becomes a voluntary and wretched tool, a plaything in the hands of the big traders. No sooner does he succeed in dragging himself out of the mire, in acquiring three or four looms, than he begins to talk about the troubles of the employer, the laziness and drunkenness of the weavers, about the necessity of insuring the factory owner against non-payment of debts. The small master is the incarnation of industrial servility, just as in the good old days the butler and the housekeeper were the incarnation of serf servility. So long as the instruments of production are not entirely divorced from the producer and the latter still has opportunities of becoming an independent master, so long as the economic gulf between the buyer-up and the weaver is bridged by proprietors, small masters and middle-men, who direct and exploit the lower economic categories and are subject to the exploitation of the upper ones, the social consciousness of those who work is obscured and their imagination is distorted by fictions. Competition arises where there should be solidarity, and the interests of what are really antagonistic economic groups are united. Not confining itself to economic exploitation, the present organisation of silk production finds its agents among the exploited and lays upon them the task of obscuring the minds and corrupting the hearts of those who work\u201d (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, Vol. III, pp. -).\n\nVI. Merchant\u2019s and Industrial Capital In Manufacture. The \u201cBuyer-Up\u201d and the \u201cFactory Owner\u201d\nFrom the data given above it is evident that along with big capitalist workshops we always find an extremely large number of small establishments at this stage of capitalist development; numerically, these, as a rule, even predominate, although they play a quite subordinate role in the sum-total of production. This retention (and even, as we have seen above, development) of small establishments under manufacture is quite a natural phenomenon. Under hand production, the large establishments have no decisive advantage over the small ones; division of labour, by creating the simplest detailed operations, facilitates the rise of small workshops. For this reason, a typical feature of capitalist manufacture is precisely the small number of relatively large establishments side by side with a considerable number of small establishments. Is there any connection between the one and the other? The data examined above leave no doubt that the connection between them is of the closest, that it is out of the small establishments that the large ones grow, that the small establishments are sometimes merely outside departments of the manufactories, that in the overwhelming majority of cases the connection between them is maintained by merchant\u2019s capital, which belongs to the big masters and holds sway over the small ones. The owner of the big workshop has to buy raw materials and sell his wares on a large scale; the bigger his turnover, the smaller (per unit of product) are his expenses on the purchase and sale of goods, on sorting, warehousing, etc., etc.; and so there arises the retail reselling of raw materials to small masters, and the purchase of their wares, which the manufactory owner resells as his own.[] If (as is often the case) bondage and usury are linked with these transactions in the sale of raw materials and the purchase of wares, if the small master gets materials on credit and delivers wares in payment of debt, the big manufactory owner obtains a high level of profit on his capital such as he could never obtain from wage-workers. Division of labour gives a fresh impetus to the development of such relations of dependence of the small masters upon the big ones: the latter either distribute materials in the homes for making up (or for the performance of certain detailed operations), or buy up from the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d parts of products, special sorts of products, etc. In short, the closest and most inseparable tie between merchant\u2019s and industrial capital is one of the most characteristic features of manufacture. The \u201cbuyer-up\u201d nearly always merges here with the manufactory owner (the \u201cfactory owner,\u201d to use the current but wrong term, which classifies every workshop of any size as a \u201cfactory\u201d). That is why, in the overwhelming majority of cases, data on the scale of production of the big establishments in themselves give no idea of their real significance in our \u201chandicraft industries,\u201d[] for the owners of such establishments have at their command the labour, not only of the workers employed in their establishments, but of a mass of domestic workers, and even (de facto ) of a mass of quasi-independent small masters, in relation to whom they are \u201cbuyers-up.\u201d[] The data on Russian manufacture thus bring out in striking relief the law established by the author of Capital, namely, that the degree of development of merchant\u2019s capital is inversely proportional to the degree of development of industrial capital.[] And indeed, we may characterise all the industries described in \u00a7 II as follows: the fewer the big workshops in them, the more is \u201cbuying-up\u201d developed, and vice versa; all that changes is the form of capital that dominates in each case and that places the \u201cindependent\u201d handicraftsman in conditions which often are incomparably worse than those of the wage-worker.\n\nThe fundamental error of Narodnik economics is that it ignores, or glosses over, the connection between the big and the small establishments, on the one hand, and between merchant\u2019s and industrial capital, on the other. \u201cThe factory owner of the Pavlovo area is nothing more than a complex type of buyer-up,\u201d says Mr. Grigoryev (loc. cit., p. ). That is true, not only of Pavlovo, but of the majority of industries organised on the lines of capitalist manufacture; the reverse is likewise true: the buyer-up in manufacture is a complex type of \u201cfactory owner\u201d; this, incidentally, is one of the fundamental differences between the buyer-up in manufacture and the buyer-up in the small peasant industries. But to see in this fact of the connection between the \u201cbuyer-up\u201d and the \u201cfactory owner\u201d some argument in favour of small industry (as Mr. Grigoryev and many other Narodniks do) means drawing absolutely arbitrary conclusions and distorting facts to fit preconceived notions. A host of facts testify, as we have seen, to the point that the combination of merchant\u2019s capital with industrial capital makes the position of the direct producer considerably worse than that of the wage-worker, lengthens his working day, reduces his earnings, and retards economic and cultural development.\n\nNotes\n[] Let us supplement the above by one other example. In the furnishing industry of Moscow Gubernia (information dated , from Mr. Isayev\u2019s book), the biggest industrialists are the Zemns, who introduced the making of costly furniture and \u201ctrained generations of skilled artisans.\u201d In  they established a sawmill of their own (in - \u2013 , rubles output,  workers, steam-engine). Let us note that altogether in this industry there were  establishments, , workers, of whom , or .%, were hired, and an output totalling , rubles. In the beginning of the s the Zenins began to buy raw materials wholesale in Nizhni-Novgorod. They bought timber in waggon-loads at  rubles per hundred planks and sold it to small handicraftsmen at - rubles. In  villages (where  are at work) the majority sell furniture to Zenin, who has a furniture and plywood warehouse in Moscow (established in ) with a turnover reaching , rubles. About  one-man jobbers are working for the Zenins.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Here is an example illustrating what has been said above. In the village of Negino, Trubchevsk Uyezd, Orel Gubernia, there is an oil works employing  workers, with an output of , rubles (Directory for ). This small works would seem to indicate that the role of capital in the local oil-pressing industry is very slight But the slight development of industrial capital is merely indicative of an enormous development of merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital. From the Zemstvo statistical returns we learn of this village that of  households  are completely in the grip of the local factory owner, who even pays all their taxes for them, lends them all they need (and that over many, many years), receiving help at a reduced price in payment of debt. The mass of the peasants in Orel Gubernia are in a similar state of bondage. Can one, under such circumstances, rejoice over the slight development of industrial capital?\u2014Lenin\n\n[] One can therefore imagine what sort of picture one gets of the economic organisation of such \u201chandicraft industries\u201d if the big manufactory owners are left out of account (after all, this is not handicraft, but factory industry!), while the \u201cbuyers-up\u201d are depicted as being \u201cvirtually quite superfluous and called into being solely by the failure to organise the sale of products\u201d (Mr. V. V., Essays on Handicraft Industry, )!\u2014Lenin\n\nVII. Capitalist Domestic Industry as an Appendage of Manufacture\nCapitalist domestic industry \u2013 i.e., the processing at home, for payment by the piece, of raw materials obtained from an entrepreneur \u2013 is also met with, as indicated in the preceding chapter, in the small peasant industries. Later we shall see that it is met with again (and on a large scale) alongside the factory, i.e., large-scale machine industry. Thus, capitalist domestic industry is met with at all stages of the development of capitalism in industry, but is most characteristic of manufacture. Both the small peasant industries and large-scale machine industry manage very easily without domestic industry. The manufactory period, however, of capitalist development, with its characteristic retention of the worker\u2019s connection with the land, and with an abundance of small establishments around big ones \u2013 can be imagined with difficulty, or hardly at all, without the distribution of home work.[] And the facts of Russia do indeed show, as we have seen, that in the industries organised on the lines of capitalist manufacture the distribution of home work is particularly widespread. That is why we think it most appropriate to examine in precisely this chapter the characteristic features of capitalist domestic industry, although some of the examples quoted below cannot be assigned specifically to manufacture.\n\nLet us point, first of all, to the multitude of middlemen between the capitalist and the worker in domestic industry. The big entrepreneur cannot himself distribute materials to hundreds and thousands of workers, scattered sometimes in different villages; what is needed is the appearance of middle-men (in some cases even of a hierarchy of middle-men) to take the materials in bulk and distribute them in small quantities. We get a regular sweating system,[] a system of the severest exploitation: the \u201csubcontractor\u201d (or \u201cworkroom owner,\u201d or \u201ctradeswoman\u201d in the lace industry, etc., etc.), who is close to the worker, knows how to take advantage even of specific cases of his distress and devises such methods of exploitation as would be inconceivable in a big establishment, and as absolutely preclude all possibility of control or supervision.[]\nAlongside the sweating system, and perhaps as one of its forms, should be placed the truck system[] --the system of payment in provisions\u2013which is prohibited in factories, but continues to reign in handicraft industries, especially where the work is distributed to homes. Above, in describing the various industries, instances were given of this widespread practice.\n\nFurther, capitalist domestic industry inevitably entails extremely insanitary working conditions. The utter poverty of the worker, the utter impossibility of controlling working conditions by regulations of any kind, and the combination of the living and working premises, such are the conditions that convert the dwellings of the home workers into hotbeds of infection and occupational disease. In the large establishments one can fight such things; domestic industry, however, is in this respect the most \u201cliberal\u201d form of capitalist exploitation.\n\nAn excessively long working day is also an essential feature of domestic work for the capitalist and of the small industries in general. Instances have been given illustrating the comparative length of the working day in the \u201cfactories\u201d and among the \u201chandicraftsmen.\u201d\n\nThe drawing of women and of children of the tenderest age into production is nearly always observed in domestic industry. To illustrate this, let us cite some facts from a description of the women\u2019s industries of Moscow Gubernia. There are , women engaged in cotton winding; children start work at the age of  or  (!); daily earnings are  kopeks, yearly  rubles. The working day in the women\u2019s industries in general is as much as  hours. In the knitting industry children start work from the age of six, daily earnings are  kopeks, yearly  rubles. Altogether , females are employed in the women\u2019s industries; they begin working from the age of  or  (in  out of  industries, which  industries account for , female workers); the average daily earnings are  kopeks, yearly  rubles  kopeks.[]\n\nOne of the most pernicious aspects of capitalist domestic industry is that it leads to a reduction in the level of the worker\u2019s requirements. The employer is able to recruit workers in remote districts where the popular standard of living is particularly low and where the worker\u2019s connection with the land enables him to work for a bare pittance. For example, the owner of a village stocking establishment explains that in Moscow rents are high and that, besides, the knitters \u201chave to be . . . supplied with white bread . . . whereas here the workers do the job in their own cottages and eat black bread. . . . Now how can Moscow compete with us!\u201d[] In the cotton-winding industry the explanation of the very low wages is that for the peasants\u2019 wives, daughters, etc., this is merely a supplementary source of income. \u201cThus, the system prevailing in this trade forces down to the utmost limit the wages of those for whom it is the sole means of livelihood, reduces the wages of those who obtain their livelihood exclusively by factory labour below their minimum needs, or retards the raising of their standard of living. In both cases it creates extremely abnormal conditions.\u201d[] \u201cThe factory seeks cheap weavers,\u201d says Mr. Kharizomenov, \u201cand it finds them in their native villages, far from the centres of industry. . . . That wages drop steadily as one moves from the industrial centres to the outer regions is an undoubted fact.\u201d[] Hence, the employers are perfectly well able to take advantage of the conditions which artificially tie the population to the rural districts.\n\nThe isolation of the home workers is a no less pernicious aspect of this system. Here is a graphic description of this aspect of the matter, as given by buyers-up themselves: \u201cThe operations of both\u201d (the small and the big buyers-up of nails from the Tver blacksmiths) \u201care organised according to one system \u2013 when they collect the nails, they pay partly in money and partly in iron, and to make the blacksmiths more tractable always have them working in their homes.\u201d[] These words provide a simple clue to the \u201cvitality\u201d of our \u201chandicraft\u201d industry!\n\nThe isolation of the home workers and the abundance of middle-men naturally lead to widespread bondage, to all kinds of personal dependence, which usually accompany \u201cpatriarchal\u201d relationships in remote rural districts. Workers\u2019 indebtedness to employers is extremely widespread in the \u201chandicraft\u201d industries in general, and in domestic industry in particular.[] Usually the worker is not only a Lohnsklave but also a Schuldsklave.[] Instances were given above of the conditions in which the worker is placed by the \u201cpatriarchal character\u201d of rural relationships.[]\n\nPassing from the description of capitalist domestic industry to the conditions making for its spread, we must first make mention of the connection between this system and the tying of the peasant to his allotment. The lack of freedom of movement, the necessity of occasionally suffering monetary loss in order to get rid of land (when payments for the land exceed returns from it, so that a peasant who leases his allotment finds himself paying a sum to the lessee), the social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant community \u2013 all this artificially enlarges the sphere of application of capitalist home-work, artificially binds the peasant to these worst forms of exploitation. Obsolete institutions and an agrarian system that is thoroughly saturated with the social-estate principle thus exert a most pernicious influence in both agriculture and industry, perpetuating technically backward forms of production which go hand in hand with the greatest development of bondage and personal dependence, with the hardest lot and the most helpless position of the working people.[]\n\nFurthermore, there is also an undoubted connection between home-work for capitalists and the differentiation of the peasantry. Extensive incidence of home-work presupposes two conditions: ) the existence of a mass of rural proletarians who have to sell their labour-power, and to sell it cheaply; ) the existence of well-to-do peasants, well acquainted with local conditions, who can undertake the function of agents in distributing work. A salesman sent in by the merchant will not always be able to fulfil this function (particularly in the more or less complex industries) and will hardly ever be able to fulfil it with such \u201cvirtuosity\u201d as can a local peasant, \u201cone of themselves.\u201d[] The big entrepreneurs would probably be unable to carry out half their operations in distributing work to home workers if they did not have at their command a whole army of small entrepreneurs who can be trusted with goods on credit or on commission, and who greedily clutch at every opportunity of enlarging their small commercial operations.\n\nFinally, it is extremely important to point to the significance of capitalist domestic industry in the theory of the surplus-population created by capitalism. No one has talked so much about the \u201cfreeing\u201d of the Russian workers by capitalism as have Messrs. V. V., N.-on and other Narodniks, but none of them has taken the trouble to analyse the specific forms of the \u201creserve army\u201d of labour that have arisen and are arising in Russia in the post-Reform period. None of the Narodniks has even noticed the trifling detail that home workers constitute what is, perhaps, the largest section of our \u201creserve army\u201d of capitalism.[] By distributing work to be done in the home the entrepreneurs are enabled to increase production immediately to the desired dimensions without any considerable expenditure of capital and time on setting up workshops, etc. Such an immediate expansion of production is very often dictated by the conditions of the market, when increased demand results from a livening up of some large branch of industry (e.g., railway construction), or from such circumstances as war, etc.[] Hence, another aspect of the process which we described in Chapter II as the formation of an agricultural proletariat of millions, is, incidentally, the enormous development in the post-Reform period of capitalist domestic industry. \u201cWhat has become of the hands released from the occupations of domestic, strictly natural economy, which had in view the family and the few consumers in the neighbouring market? The factories overcrowded with workers, the rapid expansion of large-scale domestic industry provide a clear answer\u201d (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, . Our italics). The figures given in the following section will show how great the number of workers employed by entrepreneurs in domestic industry must be in Russia today.\n\nNotes\n[] In Western Europe also, as we know, the manufactory period of capitalism was distinguished by the extensive development of domestic industry \u2013 in the weaving industries for instance. It is interesting to note that in describing clock-making, which he cites as a classic example of manufacture, Marx points out that the dial, spring and case are rarely made in the manufactory itself, and that, in general, the detail worker often works at home (Das Kapital, , -te Aufl., S. -).[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] These words are in English in the original.\u2014Ed.\n\n[] That, incidentally, is why the factory fights such middle-men, as, for example, the \u201cjobbers,\u201d workers who hire workmen on their own account. Cf. Kobelyatsky: Handbook for Factory Owners, etc., St. Petersburg, , p.  and foll. All the literature on the handicraft industries teems with facts testifying to the extreme exploitation of craftsmen by middle-men where work is distributed to homes. Let us cite as an example Korsak\u2019s general opinion, loc. cit., .p. , the description of \u201chandicraft\u201d weaving (quoted above), the descriptions of the women\u2019s industries in Moscow Gubernia (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vols. VI and VII), and many others.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] These words are in English in the original.\u2014Ed.\n\n[] Mme. Gorbunova, who has described the women\u2019s industries, wrongly gives the earnings as  kopeks and  rubles  kopeks respectively, for she takes only the average figures for each industry and leaves out of account the different numbers of women working in the different industries.[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VII, Pt. II, p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid., p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, . Cf. ibid., .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Reports and Investigations, , . Cf. ibid., : statement by factory owner Irodov that he finds it more profitable to give out work to hand weavers working in their homes.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Examples of workers\u2019 indebtedness to employers in the brush industry of Moscow Gubernia (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VI, Pt. I, p. ), the comb industry (ibid., ), the toy industry (Vol. VI, Pt. II, ), the stone-setting industry, etc., etc. In the silk industry the weaver is up to his ears in debt to the factory owner, who pays his taxes and, in general, \u201crents the weaver as one rents land,\u201d etc. (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Not only a wage-slave, but also a debt-slave.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cOf course,\u201d we read of the blacksmiths of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, \u201chere, too, the master exploits the worker\u2019s labour, but to a lesser degree (?), and moreover it is done patriarchally, as it were, by common consent (!) without any misunderstandings\u201d (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, IV, ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Of course, in all capitalist society there will always be a rural proletariat that agrees to take home-work on the worst terms; but obsolete institutions enlarge the sphere of application of domestic industry and hinder the struggle against it. Korsak, as far back as , pointed to the connection between the tremendously widespread nature of domestic industry in Russia and our agrarian system (loc. cit., -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] We have seen that the big master-industrialists, the buyers up, workroom owners and subcontractors are at the same time well to-do agriculturists. \u201cThe subcontractor,\u201d we read, for example, in a description of galloon-weaving in Moscow Gubernia (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VI, Pt. II, p. ), \u201cis a peasant just like his weaver, but has a cottage, a horse and a cow more than the weaver has, and perhaps is able with his whole family to drink tea twice a day.\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] This error of the Narodniks is all the more gross in that the majority of them want to follow the theory of Marx, who most emphatically stressed the capitalist character of \u201cmodern domestic industry\u201d and pointed especially to the fact that these home workers constitute one of the forms of the relative surplus-population characteristic of capitalism. (Das Kapital, I, S. S.  u. ff.;  u. ff.; Chapter , \u00a7  particularly.)[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] A small example. In Moscow Gubernia, the tailoring industry is widespread (Zemstvo statistics counted in the gubernia at the end of the s a total of , tailors working locally and , working away from home); most of the tailors worked for the Moscow ready-made clothing merchants. The centre of the industry is the Perkhushkovo Volost, Zvenigorod Uyezd (see data on the Perkhushkovo tailors in Appendix I to Chapter V, Industry No. ). The Perkhushkovo tailors did particularly well during the war of . They made army tents to the order of special contractors; subcontractors with  sewing-machines and ten women day workers \u201cmade\u201d from  to  rubles a day. The women were paid  kopeks per day. \u201cIt is said that in those busy days over  women day workers from various surrounding villages lived in Shadrino (the principal village in the Perkhushkovo Volost)\u201d (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VI, Pt. II, loc. cit., ). \u201cAt that time the Perkhushkovo tailors, that is, the owners of the workshops, made so much money that nearly all of them built themselves fine homes\u201d (ibid.). These hundreds of women day workers who, perhaps, would have a busy season once in  to  years, must always be available, in the ranks of the reserve army of the proletariat.\u2014Lenin\n\nVIII. What Is \u201cHandicraft\u201d Industry?\nIn the two preceding chapters we dealt mainly with what in Russia is usually called \u201chandicraft\u201d industry; we may now try to answer the question put in the heading.\n\nLet us begin with some statistics, so as to judge which of the forms of industry analysed above figure in publications among the general mass of \u201chandicraft industries.\u201d\n\nThe Moscow statisticians, in concluding their investigation of the peasant \u201cindustries,\u201d summarised all and sundry non-agricultural occupations. They listed altogether , persons (Vol. VII, Pt. III) engaged in local industries (in the making of commodities), but among these were included artisans (a section of the shoe-makers, glaziers and many others), wood sawyers, etc., etc. Not fewer than , (according to our calculations of the different industries) were domestic workers employed by capitalists.[] The number of wage-workers in the  industries for which we have been able to combine the data is ,, out of ,, i.e., .%. For Vladimir Gubernia we have obtained the following results (from five issues of Industries of Vladimir Gubernia ): altogether, , engaged in  industries; of these , were engaged in industries in which capitalist domestic industry predominates (including , wage-workers, i.e., hirelings of the second degree, so to speak). Further, there are  rural artisans (of whom  are hired) and , small commodity producers (of whom  are hired). The total number of capitalistically engaged workers is (, +  +  =) ,, i.e., .%.[] In Kostroma Gubernia (on the basis of Mr. Tillo\u2019s tables in the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission ), there are , local industrialists, of whom , are lumber-workers (fine \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d!), while , work in their homes for capitalists; some , are engaged in industries in which small commodity-producers predominate, and some , are village artisans.[] In  uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia there are (according to the same Transactions ) , local industrialists; of these, , are millers and oil-pressers; , are pure artisans (engaged in fabric-dyeing); , are partly artisans and partly commodity-producers, the overwhelming majority working independently; , engage in industries partly subordinated to capital; , engage in industries entirely subordinated to capital; , engage in industries in which wage-labour completely predominates. On the basis of the data in the Transactions regarding the other gubernias we have compiled a table of those industries on the organisation of which more or less detailed information is available. We get  industries employing , persons, with an output totalling ,, rubles. Of these, industries in which wage-labour and capitalist domestic industry predominate employ , persons (,, rubles); industries in which wage-workers and workers occupied at home for capitalists constitute only a minority employ , persons (,, rubles); and, finally, industries in which independent labour almost completely predominates employ , persons (, rubles). According to Zemstvo statistical materials regarding  industries of Gorbatov and Semyonov uyezds of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, there are , handicraftsmen, of whom , work for the local market; , work \u201cfor a master,\u201d and , as wage-workers; in other words, , are capitalistically employed workers. According to the returns of the - Perm handicraft census, of , handicraftsmen, , (%) are wage-workers, and , (%) work for buyers-up, in other words, % are capitalistically employed workers.[]\n\nFragmentary as the data are (no others were available), they nevertheless clearly show that, taken as a whole, a mass of capitalistically employed workers are classified among the \u201chandicraftsmen.\u201d For instance, those working at home for capitalists number (according to the above-quoted data) over ,. And this is for some  or  uyezds, by no means all of which have been investigated thoroughly. For the whole of Russia the number of workers of this type must be something like two million.[] If to these are added the wage-workers employed by \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d \u2013 and, as may be seen from the above-quoted figures, their number is by no means as small as is sometimes thought here in Russia \u2013 we shall have to concede that the figure of  million industrial workers capitalistically employed outside the so-called \u201cfactories and works\u201d is, if anything, a minimum figure.[]\n\nTo the question \u2013 \u201cWhat is handicraft industry?\u201d \u2013 the data quoted in the last two chapters compel us to give the answer that the term used is absolutely unsuitable for purposes of scientific investigation, and is one usually employed to cover all and sundry forms of industry, from domestic industries and handicrafts to wage-labour in very large manufactories.[] This lumping together of the most diverse types of economic organisation, which prevails in a host of descriptions of \u201chandicraft industries,\u201d[] was taken over quite uncritically and quite senselessly by the Narodnik economists, who made a tremendous step backward by comparison, for example, with a writer like Korsak, and availed themselves of the prevailing confusion of terms to evolve the most curious theories. \u201cHandicraft industry\u201d was regarded as something economically homogeneous, something sufficient unto itself, and was \u201ccounterposed \u201d (sic !) to \u201ccapitalism,\u201d which without further ado was taken to mean \u201cfactory\u201d industry. Let us take Mr. N.-on, for instance. On p.  of his Sketches we find the heading \u201cCapitalisation (?) of Industries,\u201d[] and then, without any reservation or explanation, \u201cData on Factories.\u201d. . . The simplicity is positively touching: \u201ccapitalism\u201d = \u201cfactory industry,\u201d and factory industry = what is classified under this heading in official publications. And on the basis of such a profound \u201canalysis\u201d the masses of capitalistically employed workers included among the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d are wiped off capitalism\u2019s account. On the basis of this sort of \u201canalysis\u201d the question of the different forms of industry in Russia is completely evaded. On the basis of this sort of \u201canalysis\u201d one of the most absurd and pernicious prejudices is built up concerning the distinction between our \u201chandicraft\u201d industry and our \u201cfactory\u201d industry, the divorcement of the latter from the former, the \u201cartificial character\u201d of \u201cfactory\u201d industry, etc. It is a prejudice because no one has ever so much as attempted to examine the data, which in all branches of industry show a very close and inseparable connection between \u201chandicraft\u201d industry and \u201cfactory\u201d industry.\n\nThe object of this chapter has been to show in what precisely this connection consists and precisely which specific technical, economic and cultural features are represented by the form of industry that in Russia stands between small-scale industry and large-scale machine industry.\n\nNotes\n[] Let us recall that Mr. Kharizomenov (article quoted above) calculated that of , persons engaged in  industries of Moscow Gubernia, % were engaged in industries where there was an absolute predominance of the domestic system of large-scale production.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Unfortunately, we are unable to acquaint ourselves with the latest work on handicraft industry in Yaroslavl Gubernia (Handicraft Industries. Published by Statistical Bureau of Yaroslavl Gubernia Zemstvo. Yaroslavl, ). Judging from the detailed review in Russkiye Vedomosti (, No. ), it is an extremely valuable piece of research. The number of handicraftsmen in the gubernia is estimated as , (the number of factory workers in  was placed at ,). Industries are on the decline. One-fifth of the enterprises employ wage-workers. One quarter of the total number of handicraftsmen are wage-workers. Of the total number of handicraftsmen % are engaged in establishments with  and more workers. Exactly one half of all the handicraftsmen work for masters, with materials supplied by the latter. Agriculture is on the decline; one-sixth of the handicraftsmen have neither horses nor cows, one-third cultivate by hiring a neighbour; one-fifth have no land under crops. The earnings of a handicraftsman are  /, rubles a week! (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] All these figures are approximate, for the source does not give precise figures. Among the village artisans are included millers, blacksmiths, etc., etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See Studies, pp. -. The figures for \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d here include artisans (%). If we exclude the artisans, we get .% wage-workers and .% working for buyers-up (p. ), i.e., .% are capitalistically employed workers. (See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia. \u2013Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For example, capitalist work in the home is particularly developed in the ready-made clothing industry, which is growing rapidly. \u201cThe demand for such an article of prime necessity as ready made clothing is increasing from year to year\u201d (Vestnik Finansov,  No. , Survey of Nizhni-Novgorod Fair). The enormous development of this industry has taken place only since the s. At the present time, in Moscow alone ready-made clothing is produced to a total value of not less than  million rubles, with some , workers employed. It is estimated that for the whole of Russia the output reaches the sum of  million rubles (Successes of Russian Industry According to Surveys of Expert Commissions, St. Petersburg , pp. l-). In St. Petersburg, the  census gave the number employed in ready-made clothing (Group XI, Classes -) as ,, counting members of industrialists families, including , workers, and , one-man producers with their families (St. Petersburg According to the Census of December ,  ). The  census shows that the total number of persons employed in the clothing industry in Russia was ,,, the members of their families numbering ,,; total ,,. (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us recall that the number of \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d in Russia is estimated at no less than  million (Mr. Kharizomenov\u2019s figure Mr. Andreyev gave the figure of  / million, but his methods are too sweeping)[]; consequently, the total figures given in the text cover about one-tenth of the total number of \u201chandicraftsmen.\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. Studies, p.  and foll. (See present edition, Vol, , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia. \u2013Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The desire to retain the term \u201chandicraftsmanship\u201d for the purpose of scientifically defining forms of industry has led in our publications to purely scholastic arguments about, and definitions of, this \u201chandicraftsmanship.\u201d One economist \u201cunderstood\u201d handicraftsmen to mean only commodity-producers, while another included artisans in this term; one considered connection with the land as an essential feature, while another allowed for exceptions; one excluded wage-labour, while another allowed for it where, for example, there were up to  workers, etc., etc. It goes without saying that arguments of this sort (instead of investigation of the different forms of industry) could lead nowhere. Let us observe that the tenacity of the special term \u201chandicraftsmanship\u201d is to be explained most of all by the social-estate divisions in Russian society; a \u201chandicraftsman\u201d is an industrialist belonging to the lower estates, a person who may be patronised and in relation to whom schemes may be concocted without compunction; the form of industry is left out of account. The merchant, however and the member of the nobility (even though they be small industrialists) are rarely classified as \u201chandicraftsmen.\u201d By \u201chandicraft\u201d industries are usually meant all sorts of peasant, and only peasant, industries.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] This term \u201ccapitalisation,\u201d of which Messrs. V. V. and N.-on are so fond, is permissible in a newspaper article, for the sake of brevity, but it is totally out of place in an economic investigation of which the whole purpose is to analyse the various forms and stages of capitalism, their significance, their connection, and their consecutive development. \u201cCapitalisation\u201d may be taken to mean anything in the world: the hiring of a single \u201clabourer,\u201d buying-up, and a steam-driven factory. How can one make head or tail of it, with all these things jumbled together!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Lenin refers to Y. N. Andreyev\u2019s Handicraft Industry in Russia According to the Investigations of the \u201cCommission of Inquiry into Handicraft Industry in Russia\u201d and Other Sources, St. Petersburg,  (the estimate of the number of persons engaged in \u201csubsidiary trades\u201d as  / millions is given on p.  of the book). Lenin also refers to the pamphlet by the same author entitled Handicraft Industry in Russia, St. Petersburg, , p. . [p.] Chapter VII. The Development of Large-Scale Machine Industry\nI. The Scientific Conception of the Factory and the Significance of \u201cFactory\u201d Statistics[]\nBefore dealing with large-scale machine (factory) industry, we must first establish the fact that the scientific conception of the term does not correspond at all to its common, everyday meaning. In our official statistics, and in literature generally, a factory is taken to mean any more or less big industrial establishment with a more or less considerable number of wage-workers. According to Marx\u2019s theory, however, the term large-scale machine (factory) industry applies only to a definite stage of capitalism in industry, namely, the highest stage. The principal and most important feature of this stage is the employment of a system of machines for production.[] The transition from the manufactory to the factory signifies a complete technical revolution, which does away with the craftsman\u2019s manual skill that has taken centuries to acquire, and this technical revolution is inevitably followed by the most thoroughgoing destruction of social production relations, by a final split among the various groups of participants in production, by a complete break with tradition, by an intensification and extension of all the dark aspects of capitalism, and at the same time by a mass socialisation of labour by capitalism. Large-scale machine industry is thus the last word of capitalism, the last word of its \u201celements of social progress\u201d[] and regress.\n\nFrom this it is clear that the transition from the manufactory to the factory is particularly important when we deal with the development of capitalism. Whoever confuses these two stages deprives himself of the possibility of understanding the transforming, progressive role of capitalism. That is the mistake made by our Narodnik economists, who, as we have seen, na\\\"ively identify capitalism generally with \u201cfactory\u201d industry and propose to solve the problem of the \u201cmission of capitalism\u201d and even of its \u201cunifying significance\u201d[] by simply referring to factory statistics. Apart from the fact that on matters of factory statistics these writers (as we shall show in detail below) have betrayed astonishing ignorance, they commit a still graver error in their amazingly stereotyped and narrow understanding of Marx\u2019s theory. In the first place, it is ridiculous to reduce the problem of the development of large-scale machine industry to mere factory statistics. It is a question not only of statistics, but of the forms assumed and the stages traversed by the development of capitalism in the industry of the country under consideration. Only after the substance of these forms and their distinguishing features have been made clear is there any sense in illustrating the development of this or that form by means of properly compiled statistics. If, however, they restrict themselves to Russian statistics, this inevitably leads to lumping together the most diverse forms of capitalism, to not seeing the wood for the trees. Secondly, to reduce the whole mission of capitalism to that of increasing the number of \u201cfactory\u201d workers means to betray as profound an understanding of theory as did Mr. Mikhailovsky when he expressed surprise as to why people talk about the socialisation of labour by capitalism, when all that this socialisation amounts to, he averred, is that several hundred or thousand workers saw, chop, cut, plane, etc., under one roof.[]\n\nThe task of our further exposition is twofold: on the one hand, we shall examine in detail the condition of our factory statistics and the question of their suitability. This, largely negative, work is necessary because the data involved are positively abused in our literature. On the other hand, we shall examine the data attesting to the growth of large-scale machine industry in the post-Reform period.\n\nNotes\n[] Das Kapital, I, Chapter  [Chap. , Eng. ed. \u2013Ed.].\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid., I, S. .[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. N.\u2013on in Russkoye Bogatstvo, , No. , pp.  and .\u2014See also his Sketches, and Mr. V.

Lenin\u2019s work of checking, processing, combining and scientifically grouping statistical data is shown in the notes he made in various books and from other material published in section  of Lenin Miscellany XXXIII. For Lenin\u2019s estimation of the main sources of factory statistics see also his article \u201cOn the Question of Our Factory Statistics.\u201d (See present edition, Vol. .) [p. ]\n\nII. Our Factory Statistics\nThe main source of factory statistics in Russia is the returns supplied annually by owners of factories and works to the Department of Commerce and Manufacture, in conformity with the law passed at the very beginning of the present century.[] The very detailed regulations in this law concerning the submission of information by factory owners are nothing but a pious wish, and to this day the factory statistics are organised on the old, purely pre-Reform lines and are simply appendices to gubernatorial reports. There is no precise definition of the term \u201cfactory and-works,\u201d and consequently gubernia and even uyezd authorities employ it in the most diverse ways. There is no central body to direct the proper and uniform collection, and verification, of returns. The distribution of industrial establishments among various departments (Mining, Department of Commerce and Manufacture, Miscellaneous Taxes Department, etc.) still further increases the confusion.[]\n\nIn Appendix II we cite the data on our factory industry in the post-Reform period that are to be found in official publications, namely, for the years of - and -. These data relate only to trades not subject to excise duty; moreover, for different periods information is given for a different number of trades (the returns for - and for  and subsequent years being the fullest); that is why we have singled out  trades for which data are available for - and -, i.e., for  years. To judge the value of these data, let us first examine the most important publications on our factory statistics. Let us begin with the s.\n\nThe compilers of factory statistics in the s fully appreciated the extremely unsatisfactory nature of the returns they were handling. In their unanimous opinion the number of workers and the total output were considerably understated in the factory-owners\u2019 reports; \u201cthere is no uniform definition, even for the different gubernias, of what should be regarded as a factory and a works, since many gubernias include among the factories and works, for example, windmills, brick-making sheds and small industrial establishments, while others take no account of them, with the result that even comparative data on the total numbers of factories and works in the different gubernias are valueless.\u201d[] Still more trenchant is the criticism by Bushen, Bok and Timiryazev,[] who, in addition, point to the inclusion of those occupied at home among the factory workers, to the fact that some factory owners supply returns only for workers who live on the factory premises, etc. \u201cThere are no correct official statistics on manufactory and factory industry,\u201d says Mr. Bushen, \u201cand there will be none until there is a change in the main principles on which the primary material is gathered.\u201d[] \u201cThe tables of factories and works for many trades include, evidently by misunderstanding, numerous purely artisan and handicraft establishments that possess nothing of the character of a factory or works.\u201d[] In view of this, the editors of the Yearbook refused even to summarise the data printed, \u201cnot desiring to pass on to the public incorrect and obviously exaggerated figures.\u201d[] To give the reader a precise idea of the extent of this obvious exaggeration, let us turn to the data given in the Yearbook, which differs to advantage from all other sources, in that it contains a list of factories with an output exceeding , rubles. At the present time (since ), establishments with a smaller total output are not counted as factories. An estimate of these small establishments according to the Yearbook reveals that , were included in the general list of factories, employing , workers and an output amounting to , rubles. The total number of factories, however, in  trades, according to the Yearbook, was ,, with , workers and an output totalling ,, rubles. Consequently, the small establishments represent . % of the total number of establishments, .% of the total number of workers, and .% of the total output. It stands to reason that it is absurd to regard such small establishments (with an average per establishment of a little over  workers and less than  rubles output) as factories, and that there can be no question of there being anything like a complete registration of them. Not only have such establishments been classed as factories in our statistics, but there have even been cases of hundreds of handicraftsmen being quite artificially and arbitrarily combined as a \u201cfactory.\u201d For example, this very Yearbook mentions in the rope-making trade of the Izbylets Volost, Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, a factory \u201cof the peasants of the Izbylets Volost;  workers;  spinning wheels; output , rubles\u201d (p. ); or in the village of Vorsma in the same uyezd, a factory of \u201ctemporarily bound peasants of Count Sheremetev;  smithies;  carpenters\u2019 benches (in homes);  horse-operated and  hand-operated grind stones;  workers; output , rubles\u201d (p. ). One can imagine what an idea of the real situation such statistics give![]\nA special place among the sources of factory statistics of the s is held by the Military Statistical Abstract (Vol. IV. Russia, St. Petersburg, ). It gives data on all the factories and works of the Russian Empire, including mining and excise-paying establishments, and estimates that in  there were in European Russia no more nor less than , factories, , workers, with an output totalling ,, rubles!! These curious figures were arrived at, firstly, because they were taken, not from the reports of the Ministry of Finance, but from the special returns of the Central Statistical Committee (these returns were never published in any of the Committee\u2019s publications, nor is it known by whom, how and when they were gathered and processed);[] secondly, because the compilers of the Military Statistical Abstract did not hesitate in the least to class even the smallest establishments as factories. (Military Statistical Abstract, p. ) and furthermore supplemented the basic returns with other material: returns of the Department of Commerce and Manufacture, returns of the Commissariat, returns of the Ordnance and Naval Departments, and finally, returns \u201cfrom the most diverse sources\u201d (ibid., p. XXIII).[] Therefore, in using the data of the Military Statistical Abstract for purposes of comparison with present-day data, Messrs. N.\u2013on,[] Karyshev[] and Kablukov[] revealed their total unfamiliarity with the principal sources of our factory statistics and their utterly uncritical attitude towards these statistics.\n\nDuring the debate in the Free Economic Society on the paper read by M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky, who pointed to the completely erroneous character of the figures in the Military Statistical Abstract, several speakers declared that even if there was an error in the number of workers, it was only a slight one\u2014 to %. That was said, for example, by Mr. V. V. (see verbatim report of debate, St. Petersburg, , p. ). He was \u201cjoined\u201d by Mr. V. Pokrovsky, who also confined himself to a bald statement (p. ). Without even attempting a critical examination of the various sources of our factory statistics, these people and their supporters contented themselves with generalities about the unsatisfactory nature of factory statistics, and about the data having recently become more exact (??) and so forth. The main issue, the crude error of Messrs. N.\u2013on and Karyshev, was thus simply glossed over, as P. B. Struve quite rightly observed (p. ). We therefore think it worth while to calculate those exaggerations in the data of the Military Statistical Abstract which could and should have been noticed by anybody handling the sources attentively. For  trades we have the parallel statistics for  both of the Ministry of Finance (Ministry of Finance Yearbook, I) and of unknown origin (Military Statistical Abstract ). For these trades, leaving out the metallurgical, the Military Statistical Abstract exaggerated the number of workers employed in factories and works in European Russia by ,. Further, for those trades for which the Yearbook gave only gross figures for the Empire, refusing to analyse them in detail in view of their \u201cobvious exaggeration\u201d (Yearbook, p. ), the Military Statistical Abstract gives , workers over and above these figures. In brick-making the number of workers is exaggerated by a minimum of , ; to convince oneself of this, one should compare the data by gubernias given in the Military Statistical Abstract and those in Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance, No.  of  and No.  of . For the metallurgical trades the Military Statistical Abstract exaggerated the number of workers by , as compared with that in the Yearbook, having evidently included some of the mine workers in its figure. For the excise-paying trades the Military Statistical Abstract, as we shall show in the next section, exaggerates the number of workers by nearly ,. Altogether there is an exaggeration of ,. This is a minimum and incomplete figure, for we lack material to verify the data of the Military Statistical Abstract for all trades. One can therefore judge to what extent those who assert that the error of Messrs. N.\u2013on and Karyshev is trifling are informed on this subject!\n\nIn the s much less was done to combine and analyse factory statistics than in the s. The Ministry of Finance Yearbook contains data for only  trades (not subject to excise duty) for - (Vols. VIII, X and XII; see Appendix II), the exclusion of the other trades being ascribed to the \u201cextremely unsatisfactory nature of the material\u201d for industries \u201cwhich are connected with agricultural life, or are appendages of artisan and handicraft industries\u201d (Vol. VIII, p. ; same, Vol. X, p. ). The most valuable source for the s is Mr. P. Orlov\u2019s Directory of Factories and Works (st edition, St. Petersburg, , returns for  taken from the same reports of factory owners to the Department of Commerce and Manufacture). This publication lists all establishments with an output of not less than , rubles. The others, being small and inseparable from handicraft establishments, are not enumerated in this list, but are included in the summarised data given by the Directory. Since no separate totals are given for establishments with an output of , rubles and over, the general data of the Directory, like those of previous publications, combine the small establishments with the large ones; for different trades and different gubernias unequal numbers of small establishments are included (quite fortuitously, of course) in the statistics.[] Regarding trades connected with agriculture, the Directory repeats (p. ) the Yearbook\u2019s reservation and refuses to give \u201ceven approximate totals\u201d (author\u2019s italics) owing to the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the data.[] This view (quite a legitimate one, as we shall see below) did not, however, prevent the inclusion in the Directory\u2019s general totals of all these particularly unreliable figures, which are thus lumped together with relatively reliable ones. Let us give the Directory\u2019s total figures for European Russia, with the observation that, unlike previous figures, they also embrace excise paying trades (the second edition of the Directory, , gives the returns for ; the third, , those for ):\n\nFactory data.\n[]\n\nWe shall show further that the drop in the number of factories indicated by these data was actually fictitious; the whole point is that at different times different numbers of small establishments were classed as factories. Thus, the number of establishments with an output exceeding , rubles was estimated in  at ,, and in , at ,; with an output of , rubles and over: in  at ,, and in  at ,.[]\n\nIn  the Department of Commerce and Manufactures began to issue in separate editions Collections of Data on Factory Industry in Russia (for  and subsequent years). These data are based on the material mentioned (factory owners\u2019 reports), and their treatment is far from satisfactory, being inferior to that in the above-mentioned publications of the s. The only improvement is that the small establishments, i.e., those with an output of under , rubles, are not included among the factories and works, and information regarding them is given separately, without their being distributed according to trades.[] This, of course, is a totally inadequate criterion of what a \u201cfactory\u201d is; a complete registration of establishments with an output exceeding , rubles is out of the question under the present system of gathering information; the separation of \u201cfactories\u201d in trades connected with agriculture is done quite haphazardly\u2014for instance, for some gubernias and in some years watermills and windmills are classed as factories, while in others they are not.[] The author of the section \u201cChief Results of Factory Industry in Russia for -\u201d (in the Collection for these years) falls repeatedly into error in disregarding the fact that the data for the different gubernias are dissimilar and not comparable. Finally, to our characterisation of the Collections let us add that till  inclusive they only covered trades not subject to excise duty, while from  onwards they cover all trades, including mining and excise-paying; no special mention is made of data comparable with others given previously, and no explanation whatever is given of the methods by which ironworks are included in the total number of factories and works (for instance, ironworks statistics have never given the value but merely the volume of works\u2019 output. How the compilers of the Collections arrived at the value of the output is unknown).\n\nIn the s there was still another source of information about our factory industry, one deserving attention for its negative qualities and because Mr. Karyshev used data from this source.[] This is the Returns for Russia for - (St. Petersburg, . Published by the Central Statistical Committee), which gives in one of its tables the \u201ctotals of output of factory industry in European Russia, \u201d (Table XXXIX); the number of factories and of workers is given only for Russia as a whole, without being distributed according to gubernias. The source of information is \u201cdata of reports of Messrs. the Governors\u201d (p. ). The data cover all trades, including both excise-paying and mining, and for every trade the \u201caverage\u201d number of workers and output per works is given for the whole of European Russia. Now it is these \u201caverages\u201d that Mr. Karyshev proceeded to \u201canalyse.\u201d To judge their value, let us compare the data in the Returns with those in the Collection (to make such a comparison we must subtract from the first-mentioned data the metallurgical, excise-paying, fishing and \u201cother\u201d trades; this will leave  trades; the data are for European Russia):\n\nFactory data, Returns vs. Collection.\nThus, the gubernatorial reports included tens of thousands of small agricultural and handicraft establishments among the \u201cfactories\u201d! Of course, such establishments were included among the factories quite fortuitously for the various trades, and for the various gubernias and uyezds. Here are examples of the number of works according to the Returns and the Collection, in some trades: fur\u2014, and ; leather\u2014, and ,; mat-and-bag\u2014 and ; starch-and-treacle\u2014, and ; flour-milling\u2014, and ,; oil-pressing\u2014, and ; tar-distilling\u2014, and ; brick-making\u2014, and ,; pottery and glazed tile\u2013, and . One can imagine the sort of \u201cstatistics\u201d that will be obtained if one estimates the \u201csize of establishments\u201d[] in our factory industry by taking \u201caverage figures\u201d based on such a method of computing \u201cfactories\u201d! But Mr. Karyshev forms his estimate in precisely this manner when he classes under large-scale industry only those trades in which the above mentioned \u201caverage number \u201d of workers per factory (for the whole of Russia) is over one hundred. By this phenomenal method the conclusion is reached that only a quarter of the total output is provided by \u201clarge-scale industry as understood within the above-indicated limits\u201d!! (p.  of article cited).[] Further on we shall show that factories with  and more workers actually account for more than half the total output of our factory industry.\n\nLet us observe, incidentally, that the data of the local gubernia statistical committees (which are used for the gubernatorial reports) are always distinguished by the utter vagueness of the term \u201cfactory-and-works\u201d and by the casual registration of small establishments. Thus, in Smolensk Gubernia, for -, some uyezds counted dozens of small oil-presses as factories, while others did not count any; the number of tar \u201cworks\u201d in the gubernia was given as  (according to Directory for , not one), with the same casual registration in the various uyezds, etc.[] For Yaroslavl Gubernia, the local statisticians in the s gave the number of factories as , (against  in the Directory for ), including (for some uyezds) hundreds of flour-mills, smithies, small potato-processing works, etc.[]\n\nQuite recently our factory statistics have undergone a reform which has changed the plan for the gathering of information, changed the significance of the term \u201cfactory and-works\u201d (new criteria have been adopted; the presence of an engine or of not less than  workers), and enlisted factory inspectors in the work of gathering and verifying information. We refer the reader for details to the above mentioned article in our Studies[] where a detailed examination is made of the List of Factories and Works (St. Petersburg, )[] compiled according to the new plan, and where it is shown that despite the reform, improvements in our factory statistics are scarcely noticeable ; that the term \u201cfactory-and-works\u201d has remained absolutely vague; that the data are very often still quite haphazard and must, therefore, be handled with extreme caution.[] Only a proper industrial census, organised on European lines, can extricate our industrial statistics from their chaotic condition.[]\n\nIt follows from the review of our factory statistics that the data they contain cannot in the overwhelming majority of cases be used without being specially processed, the principal object of which should be to separate the relatively useful from the utterly useless. In the next section we shall examine in this respect the data on the most important trades, but at the moment we put the question: is the number of factories in Russia increasing or decreasing? The main difficulty in answering this question is that in our factory statistics the term \u201cfactory\u201d is employed in the most chaotic manner; that is why the negative replies to this question which are sometimes given on the basis of factory statistics (e.g., by Mr. Karyshev) cannot be of any use. We must first establish some definite criterion for the term \u201cfactory\u201d; without that condition it would be absurd to illustrate the development of large-scale machine industry with data for establishments of which the totals have at various times included various numbers of small flour-mills, oil-presses, brick-sheds, etc., etc. Let us take as a criterion the employment of not fewer than  workers in the establishment, and then we shall see that the number of such industrial establishments in European Russia in  was a maximum of from , to ,, in  about ,, in  about ,, in - about ,, and in  about ,.[] Consequently, the number of factories in Russia in the post-Reform period is growing, and growing fairly rapidly.\n\nNotes\n[] For a detailed review of the sources of our factory statistics, see in Statistical Chronicle of the Russian Empire, Series II, Vol. VI, St. Petersburg, , Material for the Statistics of Factory Industry in European Russia for .

Timiryazev compared the returns made by over a hundred big factory owners for the official statistics with the returns they made for the  Exhibition. The latter figures proved to be % higher than the former (loc. cit., I, pp. IV-V). In  the Central Statistical Committee, as an experiment, instituted a special investigation of factory industry in Moscow and Vladimir gubernias (where in  nearly half of all the workers and of the total output of the factories and works of European Russia were concentrated). If we take the trades for which data are given both by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Statistical Committee, we get the following figures: according to the Ministry of Finance there were , factories, , workers, with an output totalling ,, rubles, whereas according to the investigation by the Central Statistical Committee there were , factories, , workers on premises plus , outside workers, and an output totalling ,, rubles.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It is very possible that these returns were simply taken from gubernatorial reports, which, as we shall see below, always enormously exaggerate the number of factories and works.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] How widely the Military Statistical Abstract applied the term \u201cfactory\u201d becomes particularly evident through the following: the Yearbook statistics are called \u201cthe statistics of our large establishments\u201d (p. , authors\u2019 italics).

This phenomenon may have its roots in many extremely important elements of Russian national economy. To them, by the way, should be assigned the system of land tenure of the mass of the population, the tenacity of the village community (sic !), which raises serious obstacles to the development of a professional class of factory workers in our country. With this is combined (!) the widespread character of the domestic form of the processing of products in the very (central) zone of Russia in which our factories and works are mainly concentrated\u201d (ibid., Mr. Karyshev\u2019s italics).

This is a big step forward in our factory statistics. The data for large workshops ( workers and over) are probably reliable, at least in some degree. The data for \u201cfactories\u201d with fewer than  workers are obviously casual and utterly worthless. For example, in Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia the number of factories employing fewer than  workers in  is given as ; the number of workers employed in them\u2014,, or an average of fewer than  workers. In Perm Gubernia there are  such factories with  workers! Ridiculous, of course.

Mr. Mikhailovsky very vividly described the chaotic condition of factory statistics, showing how the questionnaire travels \u201cdown to the lowest police official, who circulates it at last, getting a receipt, of course, to those industrial establishments which he deems worthy of attention, but most often in those of them which he circularised the previous years\u201d;\u2014how the replies given to the various questions are either: \u201csame as last year\u201d\u2014(it is enough to go over the Collections of the Department of Commerce and Manufacture for the various trades in various gubernias to be convinced of the truth of this) \u2014or are absolutely meaningless, etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The data concern all trades (i.e., including excise-paying) except mining. For ,  and - we have computed the data from Directories and the List. From the data in the List we have excluded printing works, of which no account was taken formerly in factory statistics (see Studies, p. ) [See present edition, Vol , \u201cOn the Question of Our Factory Statistics.\u201d \u2013Ed.]. For  we have according to the data in the Yearbook for  trades, , establishments each employing  and more workers, out of a total of , establishments; in  these  trades accounted for about four-fifths of the total number of establishments with  and more workers. The criterion adopted by us for the term \u201cfactory\u201d is, in our view, the most exact, since the most varied programmes for our factory statistics have undoubtedly accepted the inclusion of establishments with  and more workers among the factories, and this for all branches of industry. There can be no doubt that the factory statistics never could, and cannot now, register all establishments employing  and more workers (see instances in Chapter VI, II), but we have no grounds for thinking that there were more omissions formerly than now. For  the data are from the Collection of Factory Inspectors\u2019 Reports. In the  gubernias of European Russia there were , factories and works with over  workers  each.\u2014Lenin\n\nIII. An Examination of Historico-Statistical Data On the Development of Large-Scale Industry\nWe have noted above that to judge the development of large-scale industry from factory statistics it is necessary to separate the relatively useful material in these statistics from the utterly useless. Let us, with this in view, examine the main branches of our manufacturing industry.\n\n) Textile Trades\nAt the head of the wool trades is cloth production, which in  had an output of over  million rubles and employed , workers. The historico-statistical data on this trade indicate a considerable drop in the number of workers, namely, from , in  to , in .[] To appraise this phenomenon we must take account of the fact that up to the s inclusive, felt cloth production was organised on specific and original lines: it was concentrated in relatively large establishments which, however, did not in any way come under the category of capitalist factory industry, since they were based on the labour of serfs, or of temporarily bound peasants. In the surveys of the \u201cfactory\u201d industry of the s we therefore meet with the division of cloth mills into ) those owned by landlords or nobles, and ) those owned by merchants. The former produced mainly army cloth, the government contracts having been distributed equally among the mills in proportion to the number of machines. Compulsory labour was the cause of the technical backwardness of such establishments and of their employing a much larger number of workers than the merchant mills based on the employment of hired labour.[] The principal drop in the number of workers, engaged in felt cloth production took place in the gubernias with landlord factories; thus, in the  such gubernias (enumerated in the Survey of Manufactory Industries ), the number of workers dropped from , to , ( and ), while in the  gubernias with merchant factories (Moscow, Grodno, Liflandia, Chernigov and St. Petersburg) it dropped from , to ,. From this it is clear that we have here two opposite trends, both of which, however, indicate the development of capitalism\u2014on the one hand, the decline of landlord establishments of a manorial-possessional character,[] and on the other, the development of purely capitalist factories out of merchant establishments. A considerable number of the workers employed in felt cloth production in the s were not factory workers at all in the strict sense of the term; they were dependent peasants working for landlords.[] Cloth production is an example of that specific phenomenon of Russian history\u2014the employment of serf labour in industry. Since we are dealing only with the post-Reform period, the above brief remarks will suffice to show the way in which this phenomenon is reflected in factory statistics.[] We shall now quote some figures drawn from statistics on steam-engines in order to estimate the development of large-scale machine production in this industry: in -, in the wool-spinning and cloth industries of European Russia there were  mechanised establishments using  steam-engines with a total of , h.p., and in  there were  establishments using  steam-engines with a total of , h.p. The use of steam power, therefore, did not make very rapid progress; this is to be explained partly by the traditions of landlord factories and partly by the displacement of felt cloth by the cheaper worsted and mixed fabrics.[] In the years - there were seven mechanised establishments using  steam-engines with a total of  h.p., and in  there were  mechanised establishments employing  steam-engines to a total of , h.p.[]\n\nIn regard to the woollen-goods industry let us also take note of felt-making, a branch that shows in particularly striking fashion the impossibility of comparing factory statistics for different times: the figures for  are  factories with a total of  workers, while for  they are  factories with , workers. The former figure includes  small establishments employing  workers with an output of under , rubles, while the latter includes an establishment with four workers. In   small establishments were recorded in Semyonov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, where felt-making is now highly developed but is regarded as a \u201chandicraft\u201d and not a \u201cfactory\u201d industry (see Chapter VI, \u00a7 II, ).\n\nFurther, a particularly important place in the textile trades is held by cotton processing, a branch which now employs over , workers. Here we observe one of the biggest errors of our factory statistics, namely, the combining of factory workers and capitalistically occupied home workers. Large-scale machine industry developed here (as in many other cases) by drawing home workers into the factory. It is obvious how distorted this process will appear if work-distributing offices and work rooms are classed as \u201cfactories,\u201d if home workers are lumped together with factory workers! For  (according to the Yearbook ) up to , home workers were included among factory workers (by no means the full number, for the Yearbook, evidently by pure accident, omits in the case of Moscow Gubernia those notes about \u201cwork from village to village\u201d which are so abundant for Vladimir Gubernia). For  (according to the Directory ) we found only about , such workers. Clearly, the figures given in the factory statistics (\u2014, workers in the cotton weaving mills; \u2014,) underrate the increase in the number of factory workers that actually took place.[] Here are data showing what different establishments were classed at different times as cotton-weaving \u201cfactories\u201d:[]\n\nCotton-weaving factories.\nThus, the decrease in the number of \u201cfactories\u201d shown by the \u201cstatistics\u201d actually indicates the displacing of distributing offices and workrooms by the factory. Let us illustrate this by the example of two factories:\n\nTerentyev\u2019s and Garelin\u2019s factories.\nHence, to assess the development of large-scale machine production in this branch of industry it is best to take the data giving the number of power-looms. In the  there were about ,,[] and in  about ,. Large-scale machine industry was consequently developing at enormous speed. In cotton spinning and weaving there was recorded in - a total of  mechanised establishments, having  steam-engines totalling , h.p., and in ,  mechanised establishments, having  steam-engines with a total of , h.p.\n\nPrecisely the same mistake is made in Russian statistics in relation to linen production, wherein a decrease in the number of factory workers is erroneously shown (\u2014,; \u2014,). Actually, in , of , looms belonging to linen-mill owners only , were kept in their establishments, the remaining , being held by work room owners.[] The number of factory workers for , therefore, included about , home workers, and for  only about , (computed from Directory ). The number of power-looms, however, grew from , in  (computed from Military Statistical Abstract ) to , in , and of spindles from , to ,. In flax spinning and linen-weaving in the years - there were  mechanised establishments, having  steam engines with a total of , h.p., while in  there were  mechanised establishments, having  steam-engines with a total of , h.p.[]\n\nLastly, of the textile trades mention should be made of dyeing, printing and finishing, in which trades the factory statistics combine factories and the very smallest handicraft establishments with only  or  workers each and an output of a few hundred rubles.[] Naturally, this causes no little confusion and obscures the rapid growth of large-scale machine industry. The following figures reflect this growth: in the wool-cleaning, dyeing, bleaching and finishing trades in - there were  mechanised establishments with  steam-engines totalling , h.p.; in  there were  mechanised establishments with  steam-engines totalling , h.p.\n\n) Wood - Working Industries\nIn this section the most reliable data are those on saw milling, although in the past small establishments were also included here.[] The enormous development of this trade in the post-Reform period (\u2014 million rubles \u2014 million rubles), accompanied by a considerable increase in the number of workers (, and ,) and in the number of steam-powered establishments ( and ), is particularly interesting, in that it affords striking evidence of the growth of the lumber industry. Saw-milling is but one of the operations of the lumber industry, which is a necessary concomitant of the first steps of large-scale machine industry.\n\nAs to the rest of the trades in this section, namely, furnishing and carpentry, bast-matting, and pitch and tar\u2014the factory statistics relating to them are distinguished for their particularly chaotic condition. The small establishments so numerous in these trades were formerly included among the \u201cfactories\u201d in numbers fixed arbitrarily, and the same is sometimes done even today.[]\n\n) Chemical, Livestock - Product\nand Ceramic Industries\nThe statistics on the chemical industry proper are distinguished for their relative reliability. The following returns show its growth: in  chemical products were consumed in Russia to a total of  million rubles (. million rubles home produced and . million rubles imported); in , to a total of  / million rubles ( / million rubles home produced and  / imported); and in , to a total of . million rubles (. million rubles home produced and . imported).[] These data are particularly interesting because the chemical industries are extremely important as producers of auxiliary materials for large-scale machine industry, i.e., articles of productive (and not personal) consumption. As to potash and saltpetre production, let us remark that the number of factories given is unreliable, again due to the inclusion of small establishments.[]\n\nThe tallow trade has undoubtedly declined in the post-Reform period. Thus, the value of output of the tallow candle and tallow-boiling trade was estimated in - at . million rubles, and in  at  million rubles.[] This decline is to be explained by the growing use of mineral oils for lighting, which are displacing the old-time tallow candle.\n\nFor leather production (: , establishments with , workers and an output totalling . million rubles; : , establishments with , workers and an output totalling . million rubles) statistics constantly lump together factories and small establishments. The relatively high cost of raw materials, which explains the high total output, and the fact that this trade requires very few workers, make it particularly difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the handicraft establishments and the factories. In , of the total number of factories (,), only  had an output of less than , rubles; in  there were , out of a total of ,[]; in , of , factories[] , had an output of less than , rubles (these , factories employed , workers and had an output totalling , rubles). Thus, the number of factories increased, although the factory statistics show a decrease. As for the small leather establishments, their number is still very large today: for instance, The Factory Industry and Trade of Russia, published by the Ministry of Finance (St. Petersburg, ), gives a total of nearly , handicraft works, with , workers and an output of  million rubles. These \u201chandicraft\u201d establishments are much larger than those which in the s were included among \u201cfactories and works.\u201d Since small establishments are included among the \u201cfactories and works\u201d in unequal numbers in the different gubernias and in different years, the statistics on this trade should be treated with great caution. The steam-engine statistics for - gave for this industry  mechanised establishments with  steam-engines to a total of  h.p. and in  there were  mechanised establishments with  steam-engines to a total of , h.p. In these  factories , workers (more than a third of the total) were concentrated with an output totalling . million rubles (% of the total), so that the concentration of production was very considerable, and the productivity of labour in the large establishments far above the average.[]\n\nThe ceramic trades fall into two categories in accordance with the character of the factory statistics: in some, there is hardly any combining of small-scale production with large. That is why these statistics are fairly reliable. This applies to the following industries: glass, porcelain and chinaware, plaster and cement. Particularly remark able is the rapid growth of the last-mentioned trade, which is evidence of the development of the building industry: the total output in  was estimated at , rubles (Military Statistical Abstract ), and in  at ,, rubles; the number of power-operated establishments in - was , and in  it was . On the other hand, in the pottery and brick trades the inclusion of small establishments is observed on a tremendous scale, and for that reason the factory statistics are very unsatisfactory, being particularly exaggerated for the s and s. Thus, in the pottery trade in  there were listed  establishments, with , workers and an output totalling , rubles, and in ,  establishments with , workers and an output totalling , rubles. If we subtract the small establishments (those with an output of less than , rubles) we get: \u2014 establishments, with  workers and an output of , rubles; \u2014 establishments, with , workers and an output of , rubles. That is to say, instead of the decrease in the number of \u201cfactories\u201d and stagnation in the number of workers shown in the statistics, there was actually a considerable increase in both the one and the other. In brick-making the official data for  showed , establishments, with , workers and an output totalling ,, rubles; for \u2014, establishments, with , workers and an output of ,, rubles; and without the small establishments (those with an output of less than , rubles) we get for \u2014 establishments, with , workers and an output of ,, rubles; and for \u2014, establishments, with , workers and an output of ,, rubles.[]\n\n) Metallurgical Industries\nIn the factory statistics for the metallurgical industries the sources of confusion are, firstly, the inclusion of small establishments (exclusively in the s and s),[] and, secondly and mainly, the fact that metallurgical plants are \u201csubject, not to the jurisdiction\u201d of the Department of Commerce and Manufacture, but to that of the Department of Mines. The returns of the Ministry of Finance usually omit ironworks \u201con principle\u201d; but there have never been uniform and invariable rules for the separation of ironworks from the other works (and it would hardly be possible to devise them). That is why the factory statistics published by the Ministry of Finance always include ironworks to some extent, although the actual degree to which they are included varies for different gubernias and for different years.[] General data on the increased use of steam-engines in metallurgy since the Reform will be given below, when we deal with the mining and metallurgical industry.\n\n) Food Industries\nThese industries merit special attention for the question that concerns us, since the confusion in factory statistics attains here its maximum. And yet, these industries occupy a prominent place in our factory industry as a whole.\n\nThus, according to the Directory for  these industries account for , factories, with , workers and an output totalling  million rubles out of a total for European Russia of , factories, with , workers and an output of , million rubles. The fact is that the principal trades of this group\u2014flour-milling, groat milling and oil-pressing\u2014consist of the processing of agricultural produce. There are hundreds and thousands of small establishments in Russia engaged in this processing in every gubernia, and since there are no generally established rules for selecting the \u201cfactories and works\u201d from among them, the statistics pick out such small establishments quite fortuitously. That is why the numbers of \u201cfactories and works\u201d for different years and for different gubernias fluctuate enormously. Here, for example, are the figures for the flour-milling trade for various years, as taken from various sources: \u2014  mills (Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance ); \u2014 , (Yearbook ); \u2014, (Military Statistical Abstract ); \u2014, (Collection ); , (Returns for Russia ); ,  and \u2014,, , and ,[] (Collection ); -\u2014, (List ). Among the , mills listed in  (Collection ),  were steam-, , water-, , wind- and  horse-operated! Some gubernias counted only steam-mills, others included watermills (in numbers ranging from  to ), still others (the minority) included also windmills (from  to ) and horse-operated mills. One can imagine the value of such statistics, and of conclusions based on a credulous use of the data they provide![] Obviously, to judge the growth of large-scale machine industry we must first establish a definite criterion for the term \u201cfactory.\u201d Let us take as such a criterion the employment of steam-engines: steam-mills are a characteristic concomitant of the epoch of large-scale machine industry.[]\n\nWe get the following picture of the development of factory production in this branch of industry.[]\n\nFactory production in food industries.\nThe statistics for the oil-pressing trade are unsatisfactory for the same reason. For instance, in  , works were listed with , workers and an output totalling ,, rubles, and in  there were  works, with , workers and an output totalling ,, rubles. But this decrease in the number of factories and of workers is only apparent. If the data for  and  are made comparable, i.e., if we exclude establishments with an output of less than , rubles (not included in the lists) we get for :  works, with , workers and an output totalling ,, rubles, and for \u2014 works, with , workers and an output totalling ,, rubles. That large-scale machine industry has developed in this trade no less rapidly than in flour-milling is evident, for example, from the statistics for steam-engines; in - there were  steam-powered works, with  steam engines of  h.p., while in  there were  mechanised works, with  steam-engines totalling , h.p.\n\nThe other trades of this group are relatively small. Let us note that in the mustard and fish-products trades, for instance, the statistics of the s included hundreds of small establishments such as have nothing whatever in common with factories and are now not classed as such. The extent to which our factory statistics for various years need correction is evident from the following: with the exception of flour-milling, the Directory for  gave in this section a total of , establishments with , workers, and for \u2014, establishments with , workers. For  trades,[] small establishments (with an output of less than , rubles) were included as follows: in \u2014, with , workers and an output totalling , rubles and in , seven establishments, employing ten workers and with an output totalling two thousand rubles! To make the data comparable, one should, consequently, subtract in one case five thousand workers, and in the other, ten persons!\n\n) Excise - Paying and Other Trades\nIn some of the excise-paying trades we observe a decrease in the number of factory workers between the s and the present day, but the decrease is not nearly as considerable as is asserted by Mr. N.\u2013on,[] who blindly believes every figure in print. The fact is that for the majority of excise-paying trades the only source of information is the Military Statistical Abstract, which, as we know, tremendously exaggerates the totals in the factory statistics. Unfortunately, however, we have little material with which to verify the data in the Abstract . In distilling, the Military Statistical Abstract counted in  a total of , distilleries with , workers (in \u2014,, with , workers), but the number of distilleries does not coincide with the data of the Ministry of Finance, which in - calculated , operating distilleries and in -\u2014,.[] Judging by this, the number of workers is exaggerated by some , to ,. In vodka distilling, the Military Statistical Abstract computes , distilleries, with , workers (:  distilleries with , workers); of these Bessarabia Gubernia has , distilleries with , workers. The absurdity of these figures is glaring. In fact, we learn from material published by the Ministry of Finance[] that the actual number of vodka distilleries in Bessarabia Gubernia was  or , and in the whole of European Russia ,. The number of workers was consequently exaggerated by a minimum of  thousand. The cause of this exaggeration is, evidently, that the Bessarabian \u201cstatisticians\u201d included vineyard owners among the owners of distilleries (see below on tobacco making). In beer- and mead-brewing, the Military Statistical Abstract counts , breweries, with , workers (\u2014 breweries, with , workers), whereas The Ministry of Finance Yearbook estimates a total of , breweries in European Russia for . The number of workers is exaggerated here too.[] In the beet-sugar and sugar-refining trades, the Military Statistical Abstract exaggerates the number of workers by  thousand, counting , persons, as against , according to the data of The Ministry of Finance Yearbook (\u2014, workers). In tobacco-making, the Military Statistical Abstract gives , factories, with , workers (\u2014  factories, with , workers); of these, , factories with , workers are in Bessarabia Gubernia. Actually, the number of tobacco factories in Russia in  was , and in Bessarabia Gubernia .[] The number of workers has been exaggerated by about  thousand, and even the compilers of the Military Statistical Abstract themselves indicated that \u201cthe factories shown in Bessarabia Gubernia . . . are nothing but tobacco plantations\u201d (p. ). Mr. N.\u2013on evidently thought it superfluous to glance at the text of the statistical publication he uses; that is why he failed to notice the error, and discoursed with a highly serious air about a \u201cslight increase in the number of workers in the . . . tobacco factories\u201d (article cited, p. )!! Mr. N.\u2013on simply takes the total number of workers in the excise paying trades from the Military Statistical Abstract and the Directory for  (, and ,) and calculates the percentage of decrease. . . . \u201cIn a period of  years there has been a considerable drop in the number of workers employed. It has diminished by .%. . . . \u201cHere\u201d (i.e., in the excise-paying trades) \u201cwe see no signs of an increase, the plain fact being that the number of workers has simply declined by a quarter of its previous magnitude\u201d (ibid.). Indeed, what could be \u201csimpler\u201d! Take the first figure you lay your hands on, and calculate a percentage! As for the trifling circumstance that the figure given in the Military Statistical Abstract exaggerates the number of workers by some forty thousand, that can be ignored.\n\n) Conclusions\nThe criticism of our factory statistics given in the last two sections leads us to the following main conclusions:\n\n. The number of factories in Russia has been rapidly growing in the post-Reform period.\n\nThe opposite conclusion, which follows from our factory statistics, is erroneous. The point is that the figures we are given of factories include small artisan, handicraft and agricultural establishments, and the further back we go from the present day, the larger the number of small establishments included in the number of factories.\n\n. The number of factory workers and the volume of output of factories and works are likewise exaggerated for the past period in our statistics. This is due, firstly, to the fact that former]y a greater number of small establishments were included. Hence, the data for the industries that merge with handicrafts are particularly unreliable.[] Secondly, it is due to the fact that in the past more capitalistically employed home workers were classified as factory workers than today.\n\n. It is customary in this country to think that if figures are taken from the official factory statistics they must be considered comparable with other figures taken from the same source, and must be regarded as more or less reliable, until the contrary is proved. What has been said above, however, leads to the opposite conclusion, namely, that all comparisons of our factory statistics for different times and for different gubernias must be regarded as unreliable until the reverse is proved.\n\nNotes\n[] In all cases, unless otherwise stated, we take the data of the Yearbook for  and those of the Directories for  and .\u2014The Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. II) gives annual information on cloth production from  to ; the following are the five-year averages of workers employed from - to -: ,-,- ,; , and ,.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See A Survey of Various Branches of Manufactory Industry in Russia, Vol. I, St. Petersburg, , particularly pp.  and .

Concerning N. P. Gladkov\u2019s cloth factory in Volsk Uyezd Saratov Gubernia (in  it had  workers), we read in the Zemstvo statistical abstract for this uyezd (p. ) that peasants were forced to work in the factory belonging to the lord. \u201cThey worked in the factory until they married, and then became tax-paying members of the peasant community.\u201d In the village of Rvassy, Ranenburg Uyezd, Ryazan Gubernia, there was in  a cloth factory employing  workers. The peasants performed their Corv\u00e9e by working in the mill, which was closed down in  (Statistical Returns for Ryazan Gubernia, Vol. II, Pt.

At the present time, as we have seen above, the number of capitalistically employed home workers is much larger.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Establishments with an output of under , rubles are classed as workrooms. The data of the special investigation of factories and works in Moscow and Vladimir gubernias made in  by the Central Statistical Committee contain the repeated statement that the output figures of the small weaving establishments merely indicate pay for work done. Establishments that distribute work to home workers are classed as offices. For  the figure given for these establishments is far from complete, owing to obvious omissions in the case of Moscow Gubernia.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Military Statistical Abstract, .\u2014 Survey of Manufactory Industry, Vol, II, St. Petersburg, , p. . \u2014In  the number of power-looms used in cotton weaving (for the whole Empire, evidently) was reckoned at ,.

In every succeeding decade more factories were established than in the preceding one.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The small establishments in these industries are now classed with the handicrafts. Cf., for instance, the table of small industries (Appendix I) or Studies, pp. -. (See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia. \u2013Ed.). The Ministry of Finance Yearbook (Vol. I) refused to give totals for these industries because the figures were obviously exaggerated. Progress in statistics since then is expressed in an increased boldness and disregard of the quality of material used.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Thus, in the s, dozens of smithies were classed for some gubernias as \u201cironworks.\u201d\u2013 See Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance, , No. , p. ; , No.  p. .\u2014Statistical Chronicle, Series II, Vol. .\u2014Cf. also the example quoted above (\u00a7 II) where the Yearbook for  includes the small handicraftsmen of the Pavlovo district among the \u201cfactory owners.\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See examples in Studies, p.  and p.

The number of tobacco factories fluctuates greatly from year to year.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] If we take the gross figures for all trades and for long periods, the exaggeration resulting from the cause mentioned will not be great, for the small establishments account for a small percentage of the total number of workers and the total output. It goes without saying that one presumes a comparison of figures taken from similar sources (there can be no question of comparing the returns of the Ministry of Finance with those of gubernatorial reports, or of the Military Statistical Abstract ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The \u201clandlord establishment of a manorial-possessional character \u201d was a feudal manorial manufactory belonging to a landlord and employing his serf-peasants. By a decree of Peter I issued in , merchant factory owners were permitted to purchase peasants for work in their factories. The feudal workers attached to such enterprises were called \u201cpossessional peasants.\u201d [p. ]\n\nIV. The Development of the Mining Industry[]\nIn the initial period of Russia\u2019s post-Reform development the principal centre of ore-mining was the Urals. Constituting a single area, until quite recently separated sharply from Central Russia, it has at the same time an original industrial structure. For ages the basis of the \u201corganisation of labour\u201d in the Urals was serfdom, which to this day, the very end of the th century, leaves its impress on quite important aspects of life in this mining area. In the old days serfdom was the basis of the greatest prosperity of the Urals and of its dominant position, not only in Russia, but partly also in Europe. In the th century iron was one of Russia\u2019s principal items of export; in  nearly . million poods of iron were exported; in - from  to  / million poods; in - about  / million poods. Already \u201cin the s of the th century Russia was producing  / times as much pig-iron as France,  / times as much as Prussia and  times as much as Belgium.\u201d But the very serfdom that helped the Urals to rise to such heights when European capitalism was in its initial period was the very cause of the Urals\u2019 decline when capitalism was in its heyday. The iron industry in the Urals developed very slowly. In  Russia\u2019s output of pig-iron was about  / million poods, in  about  / million poods, in   million poods, in the s\u2014 to  million poods, in the s\u2014 to  million poods, in the s\u2014 to  million poods, in the s\u2014 to  million poods, in \u2014 / million poods. In one hundred years the output was not even doubled, and Russia dropped far behind other European countries, where large-scale machine industry had given rise to a tremendous development of metallurgy.\n\nThe main cause of stagnation in the Urals was serfdom; the ironmasters were at once feudal landlords and industrialists, and their power was based not on capital and competition, but on monopoly[] and their possessional right. The Ural ironmasters are big landowners even today. In , the  ironworks in the Empire had . million dessiatines of land (including . million dessiatines of forestland), of which . million belonged to  Urals ironworks (forestland covering . million dessiatines). On the average, consequently, each Urals works possesses vast latifundia covering some hundred thousand dessiatines. The allotment of land to the peasants from these estates has to this day not been completed. Labour is obtained in the Urals, not only by hire, but also on the labour-service basis. The Zemstvo statistics for Krasnoufimsk Uyezd, Perm Gubernia, for example, estimate that there are thousands of peasant farms that have the use of factory-owned land, pastures, woodland, etc., either gratis, or at a low rent. It stands to reason that this free use of the land actually has a very high cost, for it serves to reduce wages to a very low level; the ironworks get their \u201cown\u201d workers, tied down to the works and cheaply paid.[] Here is the way Mr. V. D. Belov describes these relationships:\n\nThe Urals enjoy the advantage, says Mr. Belov, of having workers who have been moulded by their \u201coriginal\u201d history. \u201cWorkers in other factories, abroad, or even in St. Petersburg, have not the interests of their factory at heart: they are here today and gone tomorrow. While the factory is running they work; when losses take the place of profits, they take up their knapsacks and go off as fast and as readily as they came. They and their employers are permanent enemies. . . . The position is entirely different in the case of the Ural workers. They are natives of the place and in the vicinity of the works they have their land, their farms and their families. Their own welfare is closely, inseparably, bound up with the welfare of the works. If it does well, they do well; if it does badly, it is bad for them; but they cannot leave it (sic !): they have more here than a knapsack (sic !); to leave means to wreck their whole world, to abandon the land, farm and family. . . . And so they are ready to hang on for years to work at half pay, or, what amounts to the same thing, to remain unemployed half their working time so that other local workers like themselves may earn a crust of bread. In short, they are ready to accept any terms the employers offer, so long as they are allowed to remain. . . . Thus, there is an inseparable bond between the Ural workers and the works; the relationships are the same today as they were in the past, before their emancipation from serf dependence; only the form of these relationships has changed, nothing more. The former principle of serfdom has been superseded by the lofty principle of mutual benefit.\u201d[]\n\nThis lofty principle of mutual benefit manifests itself primarily in reduction of wages to a particularly low level. \u201cIn the South . . . a worker costs twice and even three times as much as in the Urals\u201d\u2014for example, according to data covering several thousand workers,  rubles (annually per worker) as against  rubles. In the South \u201cat the first opportunity of earning a decent wage in the fields of their native villages or anywhere else, the workers leave the iron works, and coal- or ore-mines\u201d (Vestnik Finansov, , No. , p. ). In the Urals, however, a decent wage is not to be dreamt of.\n\nNaturally and inseparably connected with the low wages and servile status of the Ural workers is the technical backwardness of the Urals. There pig-iron is smelted mostly with the aid of wood fuel, in old-fashioned furnaces with cold or slightly heated blast. In , the number of cold-blast furnaces in the Urals was  out of , while in the South, there were  out of . A mineral-fuel furnace had an average output of . million poods per year, while a wood-fuel furnace had one of , poods. In  Mr. Keppen wrote: \u201cThe refining process of smelting pig-iron is still firmly established in the ironworks of the Urals, whereas in other parts of Russia it has been almost entirely displaced by the puddling process.\u201d[] Steam-engines are used to a far less extent in the Urals than in the South. Lastly, we cannot but note the seclusion of the Urals, its isolation from the centre of Russia owing to the vast distance and the absence of railways. Until quite recently the products of the Urals were transported to Moscow mainly by the primitive method of \u201cfloating\u201d by river once a year.[]\n\nThus the most direct survivals of the pre-Reform system, extensive practice of labour-service, bonded condition of the workers, low productivity of labour, backwardness of technique, low wages, prevalence of hand production, primitive and rapaciously antediluvian exploitation of the region\u2019s natural wealth, monopolies, hindrances to competition, seclusion and isolation from the general commercial and industrial march of the times\u2014 such is the general picture of the Urals.\n\nThe mining area in the South[] is in many respects the very opposite of the Urals. The South is in the period of formation and is as young as the Urals are old and the system prevailing there \u201ctime-hallowed.\u201d The purely capitalist industry which has arisen here during recent decades recognises no traditions, no social-estate or national divisions, no seclusion of definite sections of the population. There has been a mass influx of foreign capital, engineers and workers into South Russia; and in the present period of boom () entire factories are being brought there from America.[] International capital has not hesitated to settle within the tariff wall and establish itself on \u201cforeign\u201d soil: ubi bene, ibi patria[] .... The following are statistics on the displacement of the Urals by the South[]:\n\nOutput of pig-iron.\nThese figures clearly show what a technical revolution is now taking place in Russia, and what an enormous capacity for the development of productive forces is possessed by large-scale capitalist industry. The predominance of the Urals meant the predominance of serf labour, technical backwardness and stagnation.[] On the contrary, we now see that the development of metallurgical industry is proceeding faster in Russia than in Western Europe and in some respects even faster than in the United States. In  Russia produced .% of the world output of pig-iron ( million poods out of  million), and in \u2014.% (. million poods out of ,.) (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). In the last  years (-) Russia has trebled her output of pig-iron ( / to  / million poods), whereas it took France, for example,  years to do so (-), the U.S.A.  years (-), England  (-) and Germany  (-; see Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). The development of capitalism in the young countries is greatly accelerated by the example and the aid of the old countries. Of course, the last decade (-) has been a period of exceptional boom, which, like all capitalist prosperity, will inevitably lead to a crisis; but capitalist development cannot proceed at all except in spurts.\n\nThe introduction of machinery into production and the increase in the number of workers have been much more rapid in the South than in the Urals.[]\n\nSteam-engines, h.p. and mine-workers.\nThus we see that in the Urals the increase in the use of steam-power was only some  / times, whereas in the South it was sixfold ; the increase in the number of workers in the Urals was  / times, whereas in the South it was nearly fourfold.[] Consequently, it is capitalist large-scale industry that rapidly increases the number of workers, at the same time enormously increasing the productivity of their labour.\n\nAlongside of the South, mention should be made of the Caucasus, which is also characterised by an amazing growth of the mining industry in the post-Reform period. The out put of oil, which in the s did not even reach a million poods (, in ), was in \u2014I. million poods, in \u2014. million poods, in \u2014. million poods, in \u2014  million poods, in \u2014. million poods, in \u2014k million poods and in \u2014. million poods. Nearly all the oil is obtained in Baku Gubernia, and Baku \u201cfrom an insignificant town has turned into a first-class Russian industrial centre, with , inhabitants.\u201d[] The enormous development of the extraction and processing of oil has given rise in Russia to a greater consumption of kerosene that has completely ousted the American product (increase of personal consumption with the cheapening of the product by factory processing), and to a still greater consumption of oil by-products as fuel in factories, in works and on the railways (increase of productive consumption).[] The number of workers in the mining industry of the Caucasus has also grown very rapidly: from , in  to , in , i.e., has increased fivefold .\n\nTo illustrate the structure of industry in the South let us take the data for the coal industry in the Donets Basin (where the average mine is smaller than in any other part of Russia). Classifying the mines according to number of workers employed, we get the following picture:[] (See Table on p. .)\n\nMines according to number of workers employed.\nThus, in this area (and in this one only) there are extremely small peasants\u2019 mines, which, however, despite their great number, play an absolutely insignificant part in the total output ( small mines account for only % of the total coal output) and are marked by an exceedingly low productivity of labour. On the other hand, the  largest mines employ nearly all of the total number of workers and produce over % of the total coal output. Productivity of labour increases parallel with the increase in the size of the mines, even irrespective of whether machinery is used or not (cf., for example, categories V and III of mines, as to quantity of steam-power and output per worker). Concentration of production in the Donets Basin is steadily increasing: thus, in the four years -, of  coal consigners,  dispatched over , wagon-loads (i.e.,  million poods) each, making , wagon-loads out of ,, i.e., less than half. In the four years -, however, there were  consigners, of whom  dispatched over , wagon-loads each, making , wagon-loads out of ,,, i.e., over / of the total number.[]\n\nThe foregoing data on the development of the mining industry are particularly important in two respects: firstly, they reveal with exceptional clarity the essence of the change in social-economic relations that is taking place in Russia in all spheres of the national economy; secondly, they illustrate the theoretical proposition that in a developing capitalist society there is a particularly rapid growth of those branches of industry which produce means of production, i.e., articles not of personal, but of productive, consumption. The replacement of one form of social economy by another is particularly clear in the mining industry, because here the typical representatives of the two forms are distinct areas. In one area there is the old pre-capitalist world, with its primitive, routine technique, personal dependence of a population tied to place of residence, firmly established social-estate traditions, monopolies, etc.; while in the other area one finds a complete break with all tradition, a technical revolution, and the rapid growth of purely capitalist machine industry.[] This example brings out in bold relief the mistake of the Narodnik economists. They deny the progressive nature of capitalism in Russia, pointing to the fact that in agriculture our entrepreneurs readily resort to labour-service and in industry to the distribution of home work and that in mining they seek to secure the tying down of the worker, legislative prohibition of competition by small establishments, etc., etc. The illogicality of such arguments and their flagrant distortion of historical perspective are glaring. Whence, indeed, does it follow that the efforts of our entrepreneurs to utilise the advantages of pre-capitalist methods of production should be charged to our capitalism, and not to those survivals of the past which retard the development of capitalism and which in many cases are preserved by force of law? Can one be surprised, for instance, at the southern mine owners being eager to tie the workers down and to secure the legislative prohibition of competition by small establishments, when in the other mining area such tying down and such prohibitions have existed for ages, and exist to this day, and when in another area the ironmasters, by using more primitive methods and employing cheaper and more docile labour, get a profit on their pig-iron, without effort, of \u201ckopek per kopek and sometimes even one and a half kopeks per kopek\u201d?[] Should we not, on the contrary, be surprised at the fact that, under these circumstances, there are people who are capable of idealising the pre-capitalist economic order in Russia, and who shut their eyes to the most urgent and pressing necessity of abolishing all obsolete institutions that hinder the development of capitalism?[]\n\nOn the other hand, the data on the growth of the mining industry are important because they clearly reveal a more rapid growth of capitalism and of the home market on account of articles of productive consumption than on account of articles of personal consumption. This circumstance is ignored by Mr. N.\u2013on, for instance, who argues that the satisfaction of the entire home demand for the products of the mining industry \u201cwill probably take place very soon\u201d (Sketches, ). The fact is that the consumption of metals, coal, etc. (per inhabitant), does not and cannot remain stationary in capitalist society, but necessarily increases. Every new mile of railway, every new workshop, every iron plough acquired by a rural bourgeois increases the demand for the products of ore-mining. Although from  to  the consumption of pig-iron, for example, in Russia increased from  pounds per head to  / poods, even this latter amount will have to increase very considerably before it approaches the size of the demand for pig-iron in the advanced countries (in Belgium and England it is over  poods per inhabitant).\n\nNotes\n[] Sources: Semyonov, A Study of Historical Data on Russian Trade and Industry, Vol. III, St. Petersburg, , pp. -.

As we know, the terms on which the Ural peasants were emancipated from serf dependence were made to correspond to their position in the mining industry. The mining and works population was divided into workmen having no land, who had to work in the industry all year round, and agricultural labourers, having allotments, who had to do auxiliary jobs. Highly characteristic is the term that has survived to this day, namely, of Ural workers being \u201cdebtbound.\u201d When, for example, one reads in the Zemstvo statistics \u201cinformation about a team of workers bound by debt to their jobs in the shops of the Arta works\u201d one involuntarily turns to the title-page to see the date: Is it really ninety-four, and not, say, forty-four?[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Transactions of the Commission of Inquiry into Handicraft Industry, Vol. XVI, St. Petersburg, , pp. - and foll.

In his writings this author vividly portrays the specific life of the Urals, which differs very little from that of the pre-Reform period, with the lack of rights, ignorance and degradation of a population tied down to the factories, with the \u201cearnest, childish dissipations\u201d of the \u201cgentry,\u201d and the absence of that middle stratum of society (middle class and other intellectuals) which is so characteristic of capitalist development in all countries, not excluding Russia.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In mining statistics the term \u201cSouth and South-West Russian\u201d means the Volhynia, Don, Ekaterinoslav, Kiev, Astrakhan, Bessarabia, Podolsk, Taurida, Kharkov, Kherson and Chernigov gubernias. It is to these that the quoted figures apply.

Here is a sample of their eloquent complaints at last year\u2019s congresses: \u201cThe historical services rendered by the Urals are common knowledge. For two hundred years all Russia ploughed and reaped, hammered, dug and hewed with the products of Ural factories. The Russian people wore on their breasts crosses made of Ural copper, rode on Ural axles, used fire-arms made of Ural steel, cooked pancakes on Ural frying-pans, and rattled Ural pennies in their pockets The Urals satisfied the requirements of the entire Russian people. . .\u201d (who used scarcely any iron. In  the consumption of pig-iron in Russia was estimated at about  pounds per inhabitant, in \u2014. poods, and in \u2014. poods) \u201c. . . producing articles to suit their needs and tastes. The Urals generously (?) squandered their natural wealth, without chasing after fashion, or being carried away by the making of rails, fire grates and monuments. And in return for their centuries of service\u2014they found themselves one fine day forgotten and neglected\u201d (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ; Results of Mining Congresses in the Urals ). Indeed, what neglect of \u201ctime-hallowed\u201d institutions. And it is all the fault of insidious capitalism, which has introduced such \u201cinstability\u201d into our national economy. How much nicer it would be to live in the old way, without \u201cbeing carried away by the making of rails,\u201d and to cook oneself pancakes on Ural frying-pans!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. Bogolyubsky estimates the number of steam-engines used in mining in  at  with a total of , h.p.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The number of workers in iron production in the Urals in  was ,, and in \u2014,, in the South , and ,.

Is the Number of Workers in Large Capitalist Enterprises Growing?\nHaving examined the statistics of the factory and mining industries, we can now attempt to answer this question, one which has so much engaged the attention of the Narodnik economists, and which they have answered in the negative (Messrs. V. V., N.\u2013on, Karyshev and Kablukov have asserted that the number of factory workers in Russia is increasing\u2014if it is increasing\u2014more slowly than the population). Let us observe first of all that the question must be whether an increase is taking place in the commercial and industrial population at the expense of the agricultural population (of this below), or whether an increase is taking place in the number of workers employed in large-scale machine industry. It cannot be asserted that the number of workers in small industrial establishments or in manufactories must increase in a developing capitalist society, for the factory constantly eliminates the more primitive forms of industry. Our factory statistics, however, as was shown in detail above, do not always refer to the factory in the scientific sense of the term.\n\nTo examine the data on the question that interests us, we must take, firstly, the returns for all branches, and, secondly, the returns for a long period. Only if we do that is there a guarantee that the data will be more or less comparable. We take the years  and , a stretch of twenty-five years in the post-Reform period. Let us sum up the available statistics. The factory statistics give the fullest data for ; for European Russia they showed , factory workers in all trades except distilling, brewing, beet-sugar and tobacco.[] To determine the number of workers in these trades, we have to take the only data available, those of the Military Statistical Abstract, which, as has been shown above, must be corrected. By adding the , workers in the trades mentioned,[] we get the total number of factory workers in European Russia in  (in excise-paying and non-excise-paying trades) as ,.[] For  the corresponding figure will be ,.[] The increase is %, much greater than the increase in population. It must, however, be borne in mind that actually the increase was undoubtedly bigger than these figures show : above it was demonstrated in detail that the factory statistics for the s are exaggerated due to their inclusion of small handicraft, artisan and agricultural establishments, as well as home workers. Unfortunately, we are unable, for lack of material, to correct all these exaggerations in full, and prefer not to correct them in part, especially as more exact data will be given below regarding the number of workers in large factories.\n\nLet us pass to the mining and metallurgical statistics. For  the number of mine workers was given only for the copper and iron trades, as well as the gold and platinum fields; for European Russia it was ,.[] In , there were in the same trades , workers,[] i.e., more than twice as many. The latter figure represents .% of the total number of mine workers in European Russia in ; if we assume that in  the trades mentioned also covered .% of the total mine workers,[] we get the total number of mine workers for  as , and for  as ,. An increase of %.\n\nFurther, railway workers also belong to the category of workers in big capitalist enterprises. In , in European Russia, together with Poland and the Caucasus, they numbered ,.[] The figure for  is unknown, but it can be determined with a sufficient degree of approximation, since the number of railway workers employed per verst of railway fluctuates very slightly. Counting  workers per verst, we get the total number of railway workers in  as ,.[]\n\nLet us sum up our calculations.\n\nNumber of workers in large capitalist enterprises.\nThus, in  years the number of workers in large capitalist enterprises more than doubled, i.e., it increased not only much faster than the population in general, but even faster than the urban population.[] The steadily increasing diversion of workers from agriculture and from the small industries to big industrial enterprises is consequently beyond doubt.[] This is indicated by the very statistics that are so often resorted to and abused by our Narodniks. But the culminating point of their abuse of the statistics is the following truly phenomenal device: they work out the proportion of factory workers to the total population (!) and on the basis of the figure arrived at (about %) expatiate on how insignificant this \u201chandful\u201d[] of workers is! Mr. Kablukov, for example, after repeating the calculation of the proportion of \u201cfactory workers in Russia\u201d[] to the population, goes on to say: \u201cIn the West, however (!!), the number of workers engaged in manufacturing industry . . .\u201d (is it not obvious to every schoolboy that \u201cfactory workers\u201d and \u201cworkers engaged in manufacturing industry\u201d are not one and the same thing at all?) . . . \u201cconstitute quite a different proportion of the population,\u201d namely, from % in Britain to % in France. \u201cIt is not difficult to see that the difference in the proportion of the class of factory workers (!!) there and here is so great that it is out of the question to identify the course of our development with that of Western Europe.\u201d And this is written by a professor and specialist in statistics! With extraordinary valour he perpetrates two misrepresentations at one blow: ) factory workers are replaced by workers engaged in manufacturing industry, and ) the latter are replaced by the population engaged in manufacturing industry. Let us explain the meaning of these categories to our learned statisticians. In France, according to the census of , the workers engaged in manufacturing industry numbered . million\u2014less than one-tenth of the population (. million classified according to occupation; and . million not classified according to occupation). These are workers employed in all industrial establishments and enterprises, and not only factory workers. The population, however, that is engaged in manufacturing industry numbered . million (about % of the total population). Added here to the number of workers are employers, etc. ( million); then office employees, clerks, etc., . million; dependents in household, . million; and domestic servants, . million.[] To illustrate the corresponding proportions in Russia, we must take particular centres as our examples, for we have no statistics showing the occupations of the whole population. Let us take one urban and one rural centre. In Petersburg the factory statistics for  gave the number of factory workers as , (according to the Directory ), whereas according to the St. Petersburg census of December , , the number of persons of both sexes engaged in manufacturing industry was ,, distributed as follows:[]\n\nDistribution of persons of both sexes.\nAnother example: In Bogorodskoye village, Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia (which, as we have seen, does not engage in agriculture, but constitutes \u201ca single tannery as it were\u201d), there are, according to the Directory for ,  factory workers, whereas the population engaging in industries, according to the Zemstvo census of , numbers nearly , (the total population equals ,; more than / of the families engage in industries). Let these figures give food for thought to Messrs. N.\u2014on, Kablukov and Co.!\n\nAddendum to second edition. We now have the returns of the national census of , giving statistics on the occupations of the entire population. Here are the data, summarised by us, for the whole of the Russian Empire[] (in millions):\n\nOccupation by sex.\nNeedless to say, these data fully confirm what has been said above regarding the absurdity of the Narodnik device of comparing the number of factory workers with the whole population.\n\nIt will be interesting, first of all, to group the data on the occupational distribution of the whole population of Russia, in a way that will illustrate the division of social labour as the basis of the whole of commodity production and capitalism in Russia. From this point of view, the entire population should be distributed into three large subdivisions: I. Agricultural. II. Commercial and industrial. III. Unproductive (more precisely, not participating in economic activity). Of the nine groups given (a to i ), only one cannot be directly and entirely assigned to any one of these three main subdivisions. That is group g : private service, domestic servants and day labourers. This group has to be distributed approximately between the commercial-and-industrial and the agricultural population. We have assigned to the former the section of this group which is shown as residing in towns (. million), and to the latter those residing in rural areas (. million). We then get the following picture of the distribution of the total population of Russia:\n\nDistribution of total population of Russia.\nThis picture clearly shows, on the one hand, that commodity circulation and, hence, commodity production are firmly implanted in Russia. Russia is a capitalist country. On the other hand, it follows from this that Russia is still very backward, as compared with other capitalist countries, in her economic development.\n\nTo proceed. After the analysis we have made in the present work, the statistics of the occupations of the whole population of Russia can and should be used to determine approximately the main categories into which the entire population of Russia is divided according to class status, i.e., according to their status in the social system of production.\n\nIt is possible to determine these categories\u2014only approximately, of course\u2014because we know the main economic groups into which the peasantry are divided. And the entire mass of the agricultural population of Russia may safely be regarded as peasants, for the number of landlords in the sum-total is quite negligible. Quite a considerable section of landlords, moreover, are included in the category of rentiers, government officials, high dignitaries, etc. In the peasant mass of  millions, however, one must distinguish three main groups: the bottom group\u2014the proletarian and semi-proletarian strata of the population; the middle group\u2014the poor small peasant farmers; and the top group\u2014the well-to-do small peasant farmers. We have analysed above the main economic features of these groups as distinct class elements. The bottom group is the propertyless population, which earns its livelihood mainly, or half of it, by the sale of labour-power. The middle group comprises the poor small peasant farmers, for the middle peasant in the best of years just barely manages to make ends meet, but the principal means of livelihood of this group is \u201cindependent\u201d (supposedly independent, of course) small-scale farming. Finally, the top group consists of the well-to-do small peasant farmers, who exploit more or less considerable numbers of allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers and all sorts of wage-labourers in general.\n\nThese groups constitute approximately %, % and % respectively of the total. Above we invariably took the share of each group in the total number of households or farms. Now we shall take them as a proportion of the population. This change effects an increase in the bottom group and a decrease in the top one. But this, undoubtedly, is precisely the change that has taken place in Russia in the past decade, as is proved incontrovertibly by the decline in horse-ownership and by the ruin of the peasantry, the growth of poverty and unemployment in the rural districts, etc.\n\nThat is to say, among the agricultural population we have about . million proletarians and semi-proletarians about . million poor small peasant farmers and their families, and about . million of the population on the well-to-do small farms.\n\nNow the question is how to distribute the commercial and industrial and the unproductive population. The latter group contains sections of the population who obviously belong to the big bourgeoisie: all the rentiers (\u201cliving on income from capital and real estate\u201d\u2014first subdivision of group  in our statistics: ,), then part of the bourgeois intelligentsia, the high military and civil officials, etc. Altogether, these will number about  / million. At the opposite pole of this group of unproductive population are the lower ranks of the army, navy, gendarmerie and police (about . million), domestics and numerous servants (about / million altogether), nearly / million beggars, tramps, etc., etc. Here we can only roughly distribute the groups that most closely approximate to the main economic types: about  million will go to the proletarian and semi-proletarian population (partly lumpen-proletarians), about . million to the poor small proprietors, and about . million to the well-to-do small proprietors, including the bulk of the clerks, managerial personnel, bourgeois intellectuals, etc.\n\nLastly, among the commercial and industrial population the largest section is undoubtedly the proletariat, and the gulf is widest between the proletariat and the big bourgeoisie. But the census returns supply no data as to the distribution of this section of the population into employers, one-man producers, workers, etc. We have no alternative but to take as a model the above-quoted data on the industrial population of St. Petersburg, classified according to position in production. On the basis of these data we may roughly assign about % to the big bourgeoisie, % to the well-to-do petty bourgeoisie, % to the poor small proprietors and % to the proletariat. In Russia as a whole, small production in industry is, of course, much more tenacious than it is in St. Petersburg, but then we do not assign to the semi-proletarian population the mass of one-man producers and handicraftsmen who work in their homes for masters. Hence, on the whole, the proportions taken will in all probability not differ very much from what they actually are. For the commercial and industrial population we shall then get about . million big bourgeoisie, about . million well-to-do, about . million needy small producers, and about . million belonging to the proletarian and semi-proletarian strata of the population.\n\nBy combining the agricultural, commercial and industrial, and unproductive sections of the population, we shall get the following approximate distribution of the entire population of Russia according to class status:\n\nDistribution of population by class status.\nProletarians[]\n\nWe have no doubt that our Cadet and quasi-Cadet economists and politicians will raise their voices in indignation against this \u201cover-simplified\u201d concept of the economy of Russia. After all, it is so convenient, so advantageous to gloss over the profundity of economic contradictions in a detailed analysis and at the same time to complain of the \u201ccrudity\u201d of socialist views on these contradictions as a whole. Such criticism of the conclusion we have reached is, of course, without scientific value.\n\nDifferences of opinion are, of course, possible about the degree of approximation of various figures. It is of interest to note, from this point of view, the work of Mr. Lositsky, Studies of the Population of Russia Based on the Census of  (Mir Bozhy,[] , No. ). The author took the bare census figures of the number of workers and servants, and from these estimated the proletarian population in Russia at  million; the peasant and land-owning population at  million, employers and clerks in commerce and industry at about  million, and the population not engaged in industry at about  million.\n\nThe number of proletarians according to these figures comes quite close to the figure we have arrived at.[] To deny the existence of a vast mass of semi-proletarians among the poor peasants who are dependent upon \u201cemployments,\u201d among the handicraftsmen, etc., would be to scoff at all the data on the Russian economy. One need but recall the  / million horseless households in European Russia alone, the . million one-horse households, the sum-total of Zemstvo statistics on rented land, \u201cemployments,\u201d budgets, etc., to abandon all doubt about the huge size of the semi-proletarian population. To agree that the proletarian and semi-proletarian population taken together comprises one-half of the peasantry is probably no understatement and no exaggeration of its numbers. And outside of the agricultural population, the proletarians and semi-proletarians undoubtedly constitute a still higher percentage.\n\nFurther, if we are not to replace the complete economic picture by petty details, we should include among the well-to-do small proprietors a considerable section of the commercial and industrial managerial personnel, clerks, bourgeois intellectuals, government officials, and so on. Here we have perhaps been too cautious and fixed the number of this group of the population too high: it is quite possible that we-should have put the poor small proprietors at a higher figure and the well-to-do at a lower. But, of course, in making such divisions one does not lay claim to absolute statistical accuracy.\n\nStatistics should illustrate the socio-economic relations established by an all-round analysis, and not be made an end in themselves, as too often happens in our country. To gloss over the large numbers of the petty-bourgeois strata in the population of Russia would be simply to falsify the picture of our real economic situation.\n\nNotes\n[] Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance, , No .

It will be interesting therefore to examine the data available on this subject. For the years - the number of steam-engines is supplied by Material for the Statistics of Steam-Engines in the Russian Empire (St. Petersburg, . Published by the Central Statistical Committee).[] For  we have the figures of Collection of Data on Factory Industry, which cover all factory and mining trades.\n\nHere are these data compared:\n\nNumber of steam engines in industry.\nIn  years the total h.p. capacity of steam-engines in Russia increased threefold and in European Russia  / times. The number of steam-engines increased to a lesser degree, so that the average capacity per steam-engine rose considerably: in European Russia from  h.p. to  h.p., and in the Kingdom of Poland from  h.p. to  h.p. Large scale machine industry, consequently, developed very rapidly during this period. As regards steam-power capacity, the following gubernias, in -, were in the lead: St. Petersburg (, h.p.), Moscow (,), Kiev (,), Perm (,) and Vladimir (,)\u2014the total for these five gubernias being , h.p. or about / of the total for European Russia. Then follow the Podolsk (,), Petrokov (,) and Warsaw (,) gubernias. In  the order changed: Petrokov (,), St. Petersburg (,), Ekaterinoslav (,), Moscow (,), Vladimir (,) and Kiev (,)\u2014the total for the last five gubernias being , h.p., or nearly / the total for European Russia. Then follow the gubernias of Warsaw (,) and Perm (,). These figures clearly indicate the formation of two new industrial centres: in Poland and in the South. In Petrokov Gubernia, the total capacity increased .-fold, and in the Ekaterinoslav and Don gubernias taken together,[] from , to , h.p. or .-fold. These industrial centres, which have grown so rapidly, have moved up from the bottom to the top places and have supplanted the old industrial centres. Let us observe that these data, too, reveal the particularly rapid growth of the industries producing articles of productive consumption, namely, the mining and metallurgical industries. In - these industries employed , steam-engines with a total of , h.p. (in European Russia) and in  , steam engines with a total of , h.p., i.e., an increase in  years that exceeds the increase in the total number of steam-engines in industry as a whole in  years. The industries producing means of production constitute an ever-growing part of industry as a whole.[]\n\nNotes\n[] Of the  groups of trades we omit, for purposes of comparison with , the following groups: I (agriculture), XII (printing and lithography) and XIII (\u201cplumbing,\u201d etc.). Locomobiles are counted with steam-engines.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] We combine these gubernias because their boundaries have changed since .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The progress made in the employment of steam-engines in Russia since  may be seen from the fact that in , according to the factory inspectors\u2019 reports, there were in  gubernias , factory steam-boilers; the total, not including those employed in agriculture, was ,. (Note to nd edition.\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\nVII. The Growth of Large Factories\nThe unsatisfactory nature of our factory statistics, as demonstrated above, has compelled us to resort to more complex calculations in order to determine the development of large-scale machine industry in Russia since the Reform. We have selected data for , ,  and - on the largest factories, namely, those with  and more workers per establishment.[] Outside workers are strictly separated only in the data of the List for -; hence, the data for previous years (particularly  and ) may still be somewhat exaggerated, notwithstanding the corrections referred to in the footnote.\n\nWe give the returns on these largest factories (p. ).\n\nLargest factories in European Russia in the years...\nLet us commence our analysis of this table with the data for the years ,  and . The total number of large factories changed during these years as follows: , , , or in percentages: , , . In the course of  years the number of large factories increased, consequently, by nearly fifty per cent. Moreover, if we take the data for the different categories of large factories, we shall see that the larger the factories, the faster their number grows (A: , ,  factories; B: , , ; C: , , ). This indicates a growing concentration of production.\n\nThe number of mechanised establishments grows more rapidly than the total number of factories; in percentages as follows: , , . An increasing number of large factories introduce steam-engines. The larger the factories, the greater the number of mechanised establishments among them; if we calculate the percentage of these establishments to the total number of factories in the given category, we obtain the following: A) %, %, %; B) %, %, %; C) %, %, %. The employment of steam-engines is closely bound up with the expansion of the volume of output, with the expansion of co-operation in production.\n\nThe number of workers in all large factories changed in percentages as follows: , , . During the  years the number of workers doubled, i.e., exceeded the increase in the total number of \u201cfactory workers.\u201d The average number of workers per large factory was by years: , , , and by categories: A) , , ; B) , , ; C) ,, ,, ,. An increasing number of workers are thus being concentrated in the largest factories. In , factories with , workers and over employed % of the total number of workers in large factories; in , %; in , %.\n\nThe change in the output of all large factories expressed in percentages will be: , , ; and by categories: A) , , ; B) , , ; C) , , . Hence, the volume of output of all large factories increased almost threefold, and the larger the factory, the more rapid the increase. But if we compare the productivity of labour for each separate year according to the different categories, we shall get a somewhat different picture. The average output per worker in all large factories will be:  rubles, ,, ,; and by categories: A) , ,, ,; B) , ,, ,; C) , ,, ,. Thus, for each separate year we observe no increase in output (per worker) as we pass from the bottom category to the top. This is because the various categories include, in unequal proportions, factories in industries using raw materials of different value and obtaining, therefore, an annual output per worker of different value.[]\n\nWe do not think it worth while to examine in equal detail the data for the years - and for the years ---, since this would mean repeating all that has been said above for somewhat different percentages.\n\nLatterly, the Collection of Factory Inspectors\u2019 Reports has supplied data on the distribution of factories and works into groups according to the number of workers employed. Here are the data for :\n\nDistribution of factories and works by number of workers employed.\nRussia[]\n\nA comparison of these with the afore-cited data will involve a certain inaccuracy, a slight one, it is true. At all events, they show that the number of large factories (those with over  or over  workers) and the number of workers employed in them are rapidly increasing. The concentration of workers and, consequently, of production, also increases in the largest of these large factories.\n\nPage  of The Development of Capitalism in Russia, .\nComparing the data on the large factories with those on all \u201cfactories and works\u201d given in our of official statistics, we see that in  the large factories, constituting .% of all \u201cfactories and works\u201d concentrated .% of the total number of factory workers and .% of the total output. In  they constituted .% of the total number of \u201cfactories and works,\u201d and concentrated .% of all factory workers and .% of the total output. In - they constituted .% of all \u201cfactories and works,\u201d and concentrated % of all factory workers and .% of the total output. In , the large factories in European Russia, those with over  workers, constituted % of the total number of factories and works and concentrated .% of the total number of factory workers.[] Thus, the large, mostly steam-powered, factories, despite their small numbers, concentrate an overwhelming and ever-growing proportion of the workers and output of all \u201cfactories and works.\u201d The tremendous rapidity with which these large factories have been growing in the post-Reform period has already been noted. Let us now cite data on the equally large enterprises in the mining industry.[]\nLargest industrial enterprises in European Russia in .\nIn the mining industry the concentration of workers in large enterprises is still greater (although the percentage of enterprises employing steam-engines is smaller); , workers out of ,, i.e., .%, are concentrated in enterprises with  and more workers; almost half of the mine workers (, out of ,) are employed in a few very large establishments each employing , and more workers. And of the total number of factory and mining workers in European Russia (,, in ), three-fourths (.%) are concentrated in enterprises employing  workers and over; nearly half (, out of ,,) are concentrated in enterprises each employing  and more workers.[]\n\nWe think it worth while to deal here with the question raised by Mr. N.\u2013on concerning a \u201cslowing down\u201d of the development of capitalism and of the growth of the \u201cfactory population\u201d in the period of -, as compared with that of -.[] From this remarkable discovery Mr. N.\u2013on contrived, thanks to the original logic that distinguishes him, to draw the conclusion that \u201cthe facts fully confirm\u201d the assertion made in Sketches that \u201ccapitalism, after reaching certain limits of its development, effects a shrinkage of its own home market.\u201d\u2014Firstly, it is absurd to argue that a \u201cslowing down in the rate of increase\u201d indicates a shrinkage of the home market. If the number of factory workers is growing faster than the population (and this is precisely the case according to Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s own data; an increase between  and  of %), this shows that the population is being diverted from agriculture and that the home market is growing even for articles of personal consumption. (We say nothing of the market for means of production.) Secondly, a \u201cdecline in the growth,\u201d expressed in percentages always has to take place in a capitalist country at a certain stage of development, for small magnitudes always grow faster, in percentages, than big ones. The only deduction one can draw from the fact that the initial steps in the development of capitalism are particularly rapid is that the young country is striving to overtake the older ones. It is wrong, however, to take the percentage increase in the initial period as a standard for subsequent periods. Thirdly, the fact itself of a \u201cdecline in the growth\u201d is not proved at all by comparing the periods taken by Mr. N.\u2013on. The development of capitalist industry cannot proceed except in cycles; therefore, to compare different periods, one must take data for a whole number of years,[] so that the particularly prosperous, boom years and the slump years may stand out distinctly. Mr. N.\u2013on did not do this and slipped into profound error, for he overlooked the fact that the year  was a high boom year. Moreover, Mr. N.\u2013on did not even hesitate to \u201cconcoct\u201d the opposite assertion. \u201cWe must also note,\u201d he argues, \u201cthat the intervening year (between  and ) of  was a year of crop failure, so that the number of workers registered in that year was below the normal\u201d!! (ibid., pp. -). Mr. N.\u2013on had only to glance at the text of the very publication from which he plucked the figures for  (Directory, rd edition), to read there that  was marked by a \u201cspurt\u201d in industry, particularly in leather and machine building (p. IV), and that this was due to the enhanced demand for goods after the war and to increased government orders. It is sufficient to look through the Directory for  to get a clear idea of the extent of this spurt.[] But Mr. N.\u2013on does not hesitate completely to distort the facts to suit his romantic theory.\n\nNotes\n[] Sources: The Ministry of Finance Yearbook, I (data only for  trades)- Directories, first and third editions\u2014data for all trades, as well as those in the List ; but for a comparison of the data in the List and in the Directory, the manufacture of rails must be omitted from the trades given in the latter establishments for which home workers were included among the factory workers are omitted. In some cases the inclusion of home workers is specifically indicated in footnotes in the publications mentioned; in others the fact emerges from a comparison of the data for different years: cf., for instance, the data on cotton weaving in Saratov Gubernia for , , and -. (Cf. Chapter VI, \u00a7 II, .)\u2014Sinzheimer (Ueber die Grenzen der Weiterbildung des fabrikm\\\"assigen Grossbetriebes in Deutschland, Stuttgart, ) [On the Limits of Extension of Large-Scale Factory Production in Germany, Stuttgart, . \u2013Ed.] classifies under large factories enterprises with  and more workers. We do not think this standard low, but owing to the difficulties involved in calculating Russian data, we have had to limit ourselves to the largest factories.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Thus, in , category A included  sugar-refineries, where the average annual output per worker was about , rubles, whereas in the textile factories (included in the top categories) the average annual output per worker ranged from  to , rubles.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The total figures for our factory industry as given by the Directory and the List were quoted above, in \u00a7 II [Cf. Studies, p.  (See present edition, Vol.  \u201cOn the Question of Our Factory Statistics.\u201d \u2013Ed.)]. We would point out that the rise in the percentage of large factories in the total number of \u201cfactories and works\u201d indicates above all that this latter term is gradually acquiring a more restricted meaning in our statistics.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] These data have been compiled from Statistical Returns for the Mining and Metallurgical Industries. In , enterprises enumerated in the Directory having been excluded. By this exclusion, the total number of mining workers in European Russia is reduced by , (,-, = ,).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The industrial census for  for the whole of German industry, including mine development, which is not registered in Russia, recorded a total of  establishments with , and more workers; the aggregate number of workers in these establishments was ,. Hence, the largest factories in Russia are larger than those in Germany.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Russkoye Bogatstvo, , No. , p.  and foll.

In copper-working one notes the production of supplies for the troops and of military instruments pp. -); explosive factories work at full capacity, etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] : Lenin supplemented this table later with the corresponding figures for  (see illustration on p. ). The data entered by Lenin were taken from Collection of Factory Inspectors\u2019 Reports for  (no. -), published in . Consequently. Lenin\u2019s entries were made either in  or in . [p. ]\n\nVIII. The Distribution of Large-Scale Industry\nBesides the concentration of production in very large establishments, the concentration of production in separate factory industrial centres and the different types of factory centres are also important in characterising large-scale machine industry. Unfortunately, our factory statistics not only supply unsatisfactory and incomparable material, but arrange it in a far from adequate manner. For example, in contemporary publications the distribution of industry is shown only by gubernias (and not by towns and uyezds as was done in the best publications of the s, which, in addition, illustrated the distribution of factory industry with maps). But in order to present an accurate picture of the distribution of large-scale industry, the data must be taken for separate centres, i.e., for separate towns, industrial settlements, or groups of industrial settlements situated close together; gubernias or uyezds are too big as territorial units.[] In view of this, we thought it advisable to compute from the Directory for  and  data on the concentration of our factory industry in the most important centres. The table given in the appendix (Appendix III) contains data for  factory centres in European Russia, centres in which about half the total number of factory workers are concentrated.[]\n\nThe table shows three main types of factory centres in Russia. ) The towns. These take first place, being distinguished for the greatest concentration of both workers and establishments. Particularly outstanding in this respect are the large towns. In each of the metropolitan cities (including the suburbs) about , factory workers are concentrated; Riga has ,, Ivanovo-Voznesensk , and Bogorodsk had , in ; the other towns have fewer than , each. It is sufficient to take a cursory glance at the official figures on factory workers in several large cities (Odessa\u2014, in , Kiev\u2014,, Rostov on-Don\u2014,, etc.) to be convinced that these figures are ridiculously low. The instance of St. Petersburg given above shows how many times these figures would have to be multiplied for the correct number of industrial workers in these centres to be obtained. In addition to the towns, the suburbs must also be indicated. The suburbs of large towns are very often big industrial centres, but from the data we possess we have been able to separate only one such centre, the suburbs of St. Petersburg, where in  the number of workers was ,. Several of the settlements in the Moscow Uyezd included in our table are also actually suburbs.[]\nThe second type of centre is the factory villages, which are particularly numerous in the Moscow, Vladimir and Kostroma gubernias (of the  most important rural centres included in our table,  are in these gubernias). These centres are headed by the township of Orekhovo-Zuyevo (in the table, Orekhovo and Zuyevo are given separately, but they are actually one centre); as to the number of workers, it comes second only to the capitals (, in ).[] In the three gubernias indicated, as also in the Yaroslavl and Tver gubernias, the majority of the rural factory centres are formed by huge textile mills (cotton-spinning and weaving, linen, wool-weaving, etc.). Formerly, there were almost always work-distributing offices in such villages, i.e., centres of capitalist manufacture, which held sway over masses of neighbouring hand weavers. In those cases where the statistics do not confuse home workers with factory workers, the data on the development of such centres clearly reveal the growth of large-scale machine industry which attracts thousands of peasants from the surrounding areas and transforms them into factory workers. Further, a considerable number of rural factory centres are formed by large mining and metallurgical plants (Kolomna Works in the village of Bobrovo, Yuzovka Works, Bryansk Works, and others); the majority of these are classified under mining, and for that reason were not included in our table. The beet sugar refineries situated in the villages and townships of the south-western gubernias also form quite a number of village factory centres; for our example we have taken one of the largest, the township of Smela, in Kiev Gubernia.\n\nThe third type of factory centre is the \u201chandicraft\u201d villages, the largest establishments in which are often classified as \u201cfactories and works.\u201d In our table, the villages of Pavlovo, Vorsma, Bogorodskoye and Dubovka serve as examples of such centres. A comparison between the number of factory workers in such centres and the total of their industrial population was made above in the case of Bogorodskoye village.\n\nIf we group the centres given in our table according to number of workers in each centre and according to the type of centre (town or village), we get the following data (see next page).\n\nLeading centres of factory industry in European Russia.\nThe table shows that in  there were , workers (out of a total of ,) concentrated in these  centres, while in  there were , (out of ,). Accordingly, the number of workers increased by .%, whereas in the large factories in general (of  and more workers) the increase was only .%, while the total number of workers increased over this period by only .%. Thus the workers are being concentrated in the largest centres. In , only  centres had over , workers; in  there were . Particularly striking is the increase in the number of centres with from , to , workers. This occurred for two reasons: ) because of the exceptional growth of factory industry in the South (Odessa, Rostov-on-Don, etc.); and ) because of the growth of the factory villages in the central gubernias.\n\nA comparison between the urban and the rural centres shows that in  the latter embraced about one-third of the total number of workers in the leading centres (, out of ,). For the whole of Russia this proportion should be higher, i.e., more than one-third of the factory workers must be outside of the towns. Indeed, all the outstanding urban centres are included in our table, whereas rural centres with several hundred workers each, apart from those we have mentioned, exist in exceedingly large numbers (settlements with glass-works, brickworks, distilleries, beet-sugar refineries, etc.). Mining workers are also to be found mainly outside of towns. One may consider, therefore, that of the total number of factory and mining workers in European Russia not less (and maybe more) than half are to be found outside of towns. This conclusion is very important, for it shows that the industrial population in Russia greatly exceeds the urban population.[]\n\nIf we now turn to the pace at which factory industry develops in urban and in rural centres, we see that it is undoubtedly faster in the latter. The number of urban centres with , workers and over in the period taken grew very slightly (from  to ), while the number of rural centres in this category grew very considerably (from  to ). The number of workers in the  urban centres grew by only . % (from , to ,), while in the  rural centres it grew by .% (from , to ,). The average number of workers per urban centre rose only from , to ,, whereas the average number per rural centre rose from , to ,. Thus, factory industry evidently tends to spread with particular rapidity outside the towns, to create new factory centres and to push them forward faster than the urban centres, and to penetrate deep into remote rural areas that would seem to be isolated from the world of big capitalist enterprises. This supremely important circumstance shows us, firstly, the rapidity with which large-scale machine industry transforms social and economic relationships. What formerly took ages to take shape now springs up in a decade or so. We have only to compare, for instance, the formation of such non-agricultural centres as the \u201chandicraft villages\u201d indicated in the previous chapter\u2014Bogorodskoye, Pavlovo, Kimry, Khoteichi, Velikoye and others\u2014with the process of the establishment of new centres by the modern factory, which at once draws the rural population by the thousands into industrial settlements.[] Social division of labour receives a tremendous impetus. Mobility of the population replaces the former immobility and isolation as a necessary condition of economic life. Secondly, the transfer of factories into the rural districts shows that capitalism is surmounting the obstacles which the social-estate seclusion of the peasant community creates for it, and is even deriving benefit from this seclusion. While the erection of factories in the countryside involves quite a few inconveniences, it does, however, guarantee a supply of cheap labour. The muzhik is not allowed to go to the factory, so the factory goes to the muzhik.[] The muzhik lacks complete freedom (thanks to the collective-responsibility system and the obstacles to his leaving the community) to seek the employer who gives the greatest advantage; but the employer has a perfect way of seeking out the cheapest worker. Thirdly, the large number of rural factory centres and their rapid growth proves groundless the opinion that the Russian factory is isolated from the mass of the peasantry, that it exercises little influence over them. The specific character of the distribution of our factory industry shows, on the contrary, that its influence is very widespread, and that it is far from being confined to the walls of the factory.[] On the other hand, however, this specific character of the distribution of our factory industry cannot but result in a temporary retardation of the transforming influence of large-scale machine industry on the population it employs. By converting the backwoodsman-muzhik into a factory worker at one stroke, the factory may for a time ensure for itself a supply of the cheapest, least developed and least exacting \u201chands.\u201d It is obvious, however, that such retardation cannot go on for long, and that it is purchased at the price of a still greater expansion of the area subjected to the influence of large-scale machine industry.\n\nNotes\n[] \u201c. . . In the uyezds (of Moscow Gubernia) the factories and works are far from evenly distributed: in highly industrialised uyezds side by side with localities which, because of the more or less considerable concentration there of factory establishments, can be called real factory centres, one comes across entire volosts almost wholly devoid of factory industry; and, on the contrary, in uyezds generally poor in factories and works, there are districts with a more or less considerable development of one industry or another; side by side with handicraft cottages and workrooms larger establishments have arisen possessing all the attributes of large-scale production.\u201d (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Section of sanitation Statistics, vol. IV, Sec., Moscow, , p. .) This publication, the best in contemporary factory statistical literature, illustrates the distribution of large-scale industry with the aid of a detailed map. The only thing lacking for a complete picture of the distribution of factory industry is a classification of centres according to the number of factories, workers and total output.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The table includes only establishments with a minimum output of , rubles, and of the flour-mills only the steam-powered ones. Outside workers are excluded wherever it has been stated that they are included among factory workers; such exclusions are indicated by an asterisk (*). The industrial boom of  could not but affect these data, too.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201c. . . The large village of Cherkizovo in the vicinity of Moscow is, according to the local inhabitants, one large factory, and is a continuation of Moscow in the literal sense of the word. . . . Nearby, beyond the Semyonovskaya Tollgate . . . again a large number of diverse factories are clustered. . . . At no great distance from here we see the village of Izmailovo, with its weaving sheds, and the enormous Izmailovo Textile Mill.\u201d That is to the north of Moscow. To the south, \u201cbeyond the Serpukhov Tollgate, what we meet first is the immense Danilov Textile Mill, in itself a whole township. . . . Further on, at no great distance from each other, are a whole ring of large brick works,\u201d etc. (Statistical Returns, IV, Sec. I, pp. -). Thus, the concentration of factory industry is actually more considerable than we were able to indicate in our table.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In , only , were recorded here. Evidently, different methods of registration were employed.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The population census of January , , fully confirmed this conclusion. The urban population throughout the Empire was given as ,, persons of both sexes. The commercial and industrial population, as we showed above, is . millions. (Note to nd edition.\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cIn the township of Krivoi Rog the population grew between  and  from , to ,, at the Kamenka Works of the Dnieper Company\u2014from , to ,; near Druzhkovka station, where as late as  there was nothing but station buildings, there is now a settlement of , people; at the Gdantsevka Works there are nearly , people; near Konstantinovka station, where a number of works have been erected, a new settlement is being formed; Yuzovka is now a town with a population of ,. . . . On the sandy wasteland at Nizhne-Dnieprovsk, near Ekaterinoslav, where a number of factories are now situated, a new settlement has sprung up with a population of ,. The works at Mariupol has attracted a new population of ,, etc. Populated centres are springing up around the coal mines\u201d (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). According to the Russkiye Vedomosti (November , , No. ), the Bakhmut Uyezd Zemstvo Assembly has filed an application for the status of townships to be granted to commercial settlements with a population of , and the status of towns to those with a population of ,. . . . \u201cThere is to be observed here . . . an unparalleled growth of commercial and factory settlements. . . . Altogether, there are by now as many as thirty settlements, which have been springing up and growing at a truly American pace. . . . In Volyntsevo, where a huge metallurgical works with  blast furnaces, a foundry and a rolling mill is nearing completion and will be started in the beginning of November, there is a population of from , to ,, which has settled on what only recently was almost uninhabited steppe. With the influx of a factory population we also observe an influx of traders, handicraftsmen and small industrialists in general, who anticipate an easy and rapid sale to the working population of all kinds of goods.\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cThe factory seeks cheap weavers, and finds them in their native villages. . . . The factory must follow the weaver. . . .\u201d (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, .)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us recall the fact cited above (Chapter III, \u00a7 IV, p. , footnote) of the influence exerted by the mining industry in Bakhmut Uyezd, Ekaterinoslav Gubernia, on the local agricultural system.\u2014Characteristic also are the common complaints of landowners about the factories \u201cspoiling\u201d the population.\u2014Lenin\n\nIX. The Development of the Lumber and Building\nIndustries\nOne of the necessary conditions for the growth of large-scale machine industry (and a highly characteristic concomitant of its advance) is the development of the industry for the supply of fuel and building materials, as well as of the building industry. Let us begin with the lumber industry.\n\nThe felling and preliminary dressing of trees for their own needs has been an occupation of the peasantry from time immemorial, one that nearly everywhere forms part of the tiller\u2019s round of work. By the lumber industry, however, we mean exclusively the preparation of lumber for sale. Characteristic of the post-Reform period is a particularly rapid growth of this industry, the demand for timber having grown rapidly both for personal consumption (the growth of towns, the increase of the non-agricultural population in the villages, and the loss of woodland by the peasants upon their emancipation) and, particularly, for productive consumption. The development of commerce, industry, urban life, military requirements, railroads, etc., etc., has led to an enormous increase in the demand for timber to be used, not by human beings, but by capital. In the industrial gubernias, for instance, the price of wood fuel has risen \u201cby leaps and bounds\u201d: \u201cin the last five years (up to ) the price of wood fuel has more than doubled\u201d.[] \u201cThe price of timber has begun to rise enormously.\u201d[] In Kostroma Gubernia \u201cwith the huge consumption of wood fuel by the factories the price has doubled in the past seven years,\u201d[] etc. Timber exports rose from ,, rubles in  to ,, rubles in  and ,, rubles in , i.e., in the ratio  :  : .[] The amount of building timber and wood fuel transported along he inland waterways of European Russia in - averaged  million poods per year[] and in -,  million poods per year,[] i.e., there was a more than fourfold increase. The amount transported by railway in - averaged  million poods,[] whereas in - it was probably no more than  million poods.[] That is to say, total timber freights in the s amounted to about  million poods, and in - to  million poods\u2014a more than fourfold increase. The vast growth of the lumber industry in precisely the post Reform period is thus beyond doubt.\n\nHow is this industry organised? On purely capitalist lines. Forestland is bought from landowners by entrepreneurs\u2014\u201clumber industrialists,\u201d who hire workers to fell and saw the timber, to float it, etc. In Moscow Gubernia, for example, the Zemstvo statisticians listed only  lumber industrialists out of , peasants engaged in lumber industries.[] In Slobodskoi Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia,  lumber industrialists were listed (\u201cthe small ones are mostly subcontractors of the big ones,\u201d of whom there were only ), while the number of workers engaged in lumbering was ,, with average earnings of  / rubles per worker.[] Mr. S. Korolenko calculated that in the whole of European Russia as many as  million peasants were engaged in lumbering,[] and this figure is hardly an exaggeration if, for instance, in  uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia (out of ) about , lumber workers were listed, and in the whole of Kostroma Gubernia, about ,.[] Lumbering is one of the worst paid occupations; the sanitary conditions are atrocious, and the workers\u2019 health is severely affected. Left to toil in the remote forest depths, these workers are in a totally defenceless position, and in this branch of industry bondage, the truck system, and such-like concomitants of the \u201cpatriarchal\u201d peasant industries prevail. In confirmation of this description, let us quote some opinions of local investigators. Moscow statisticians mention the \u201ccompulsory purchase of provisions,\u201d which usually reduces to a marked degree the lumber workers\u2019 earnings. The Kostroma lumbermen \u201clive in teams in the forests, in hastily and badly erected shanties, where there are no stoves, and which are heated by open hearths. Bad food, consisting of bad soup and of bread which is like stone by the end of the week, fetid air . . . constantly damp clothes . . . all this is bound to have a disastrous effect upon the health of the lumber industrialists.\u201d The people live in \u201cmuch dirtier\u201d conditions in the \u201clumber\u201d volosts than in the industrial volosts (i.e., the volosts in which outside employment predominates).[] Regarding Tikhvin Uyezd, Novgorod Gubernia, we read: \u201cAgriculture . . . constitutes an auxiliary source of income, although in all official statistics you will find that the people engage in farming. . . . All that the peasant gets to meet his essential needs is earned in felling and floating lumber for the lumber industrialists. But a crisis will set in soon: in some five or ten years, no forests will be left. . . .\u201d \u201cThe men who work in the lumber camps are more like boatmen[]; they spend the winter in the forest-encircled lumber camps . . . and in the spring, having lost the habit of working at home, are drawn to the work of lumber floating; harvesting and haymaking alone make them return to their homes. . . .\u201d The peasants are in \u201cperpetual bondage\u201d to the lumber industrialists.[] Vyatka investigators note that the hiring season for lumbering is usually arranged to coincide with tax-paying time, and that the purchase of provisions from the employer greatly reduces earnings. . . . \u201cBoth the tree fellers and the wood-choppers receive about  kopeks per summer day, and about  kopeks per day when they work with their own horses. . . . This paltry pay is an inadequate remuneration for labour, if we bear in mind the extremely insanitary conditions under which it is done,\u201d[] etc., etc.\n\nThus, the lumber workers constitute one of the big sections of the rural proletariat; they have tiny plots of land and are compelled to sell their labour-power on the most disadvantageous terms. The occupation is extremely irregular and casual. The lumbermen, therefore, represent that form of the reserve army (or relative surplus-population in capitalist society) which theory describes as latent[]; a certain (and, as we have seen, quite large) section of the rural population must always be ready to undertake such work, must always be in need of it. That is a condition for the existence and development of capitalism. To the extent that the forests are destroyed by the rapacious methods of the lumber industrialists (which proceeds with tremendous rapidity), an ever-growing need is felt for replacing wood by coal, and the coal industry, which alone is capable of serving as a firm basis for large-scale machine industry, develops at an ever faster rate. Cheap fuel, obtainable at any time and in any quantity, at a definite and little fluctuating price\u2014such is the demand of the modern factory. The lumber industry is not in a position to meet this demand.[] That is why its predominance over the coal industry as a source of fuel supply corresponds to a low level of capitalist development. As for the social relations of production, in this respect the lumber industry is to the coal industry approximately what capitalist manufacture is to large-scale machine industry. The lumber industry means a technique of the most elementary kind, the exploitation of natural resources by primitive methods; the coal industry leads to a complete technical revolution and to the extensive use of machinery. The lumber industry leaves the producer a peasant; the coal industry transforms him into a factory hand. The lumber industry leaves all the old, patriarchal way of life practically intact, enmeshing in the worst forms of bondage the workers left to toil in the remote forest depths and taking advantage of their ignorance, defencelessness and isolation. The coal industry creates mobility of the population, establishes large industrial centres and inevitably leads to the introduction of public control over production. In a word, the change-over described is of the same progressive significance as the replacement of the manufactory by the factory.[]\n\nBuilding was originally also part of the peasant\u2019s round of domestic occupations, and it continues to be so to this day wherever semi-natural peasant economy is preserved. Subsequent development leads to the building workers\u2019 turning into specialist artisans, who work to customers\u2019 orders. In the villages and small towns the building industry is largely organised on these lines even today; the artisan usually maintains his connection with the land and works for a very narrow circle of small clients. With the development of capitalism, the retention of this system of industry becomes impossible. The growth of trade, factories, towns and railways creates a demand for types of buildings that are architecturally and dimensionally different from the old buildings of the patriarchal epoch. The new buildings require very diverse and costly materials, the co-operation of masses of workers of the most varied specialities and a considerable length of time for their completion; the distribution of these new buildings does not correspond at all to the traditional distribution of the population; they are erected in large towns or suburbs, in uninhabited places, along railways in process of construction, etc. The local artisan turns into a migratory worker and is hired by an entrepreneur contractor, who gradually thrusts himself in between the consumer and the producer and becomes a real capitalist. The spasmodic development of capitalist economy, the alternation of prolonged periods of bad business with periods of \u201cbuilding booms\u201d (like the one we are experiencing now, in ) tremendously accelerate the expansion and deepening of capitalist relationships in the building industry.\n\nSuch, according to the material of Russian economic literature, has been the post-Reform evolution of the industry under review.[] This evolution finds particularly striking expression in the territorial division of labour, in the formation of large areas in which the working population specialises in some particular branch of building.[] This specialisation of areas presupposes the formation of large markets for building work and, in this connection, the rise of capitalist relationships. To illustrate this point let us quote data for one such area. Pokrov Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, has long been celebrated for its carpenters, who already at the beginning of the century constituted more than half the total population. After the Reform carpentry continued to spread.[] In \u201cthe carpenters\u2019 area the contractors are an element analogous to the subcontractors and factory owners\u201d; they are usually drawn from among the most enterprising members of carpenters\u2019 artels. \u201cCases are not rare of contractors in ten years accumulating from , to , rubles and more of clear profit. Some of the contractors employ from  to  carpenters and have become real capitalists. . . . It is not surprising that the local peasants say that \u2018nothing pays so well as trading in carpenters.\u2019\u201d[] It would be hard to give a more striking characterisation of the quintessence of the present organisation of the industry! \u201cCarpentry has left a deep impress upon the whole of peasant life in this locality. . . . The peasant carpenter devotes less and less time to agriculture, and eventually gives it up altogether.\u201d Life in the cities has laid the impress of culture on the carpenter: he lives a much cleaner life than do the surrounding peasants, and is conspicuous for his \u201ccultured appearance,\u201d for \u201chis relatively high mental development.\u201d[]\n\nThe total number of building workers in European Russia must be very considerable, judging from the fragmentary data available. In Kaluga Gubernia the number of building workers in  was estimated at ,, both local and migratory. In Yaroslavl Gubernia there were in -\u2014according to official data\u2014, migratory. In Kostroma Gubernia there were about , migratory. In  uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia (out of ), there were about , migratory (in the s). In  uyezds in Tyer Gubernia (out of ), there were ,, both local and migratory. In Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, there were ,, both local and migratory. The number of carpenters alone who left Ryazan Gubernia every year to work in other districts was, according to official figures for  and , not less than ,. In Orel Uyezd, Orel Gubernia, there are , building workers. In  uyezds of Poltava Gubernia (out of ), there are ,. In Nikolayevsk Uyezd, Samara Gubernia, there are ,.[] Judging by these figures, the number of building workers in European Russia must be not less than one million.[] This figure must rather be considered a minimum, for all the sources show that the number of building workers has grown rapidly in the post-Reform period.[] The building workers are industrial proletarians in the making, whose connection with the land\u2014already very slight today[] \u2014is becoming slighter every year. The conditions of building workers are very different from those of lumber workers and are more like those of factory workers. They work in large urban and industrial centres, which, as we have seen, considerably raise their cultural standards. While the declining lumber industry typifies weakly developed forms of a capitalism that still tolerates the patriarchal way of life, the developing building industry typifies a higher stage of capitalism, leads to the formation of a new class of industrial workers, and marks a deep-going differentiation of the old peasantry.\n\nNotes\n[] Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, I, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid., IV, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Zhbankov, The Influence of Industries Employing Migratory Workers on the Movement of the Population, Kostroma, , p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Productive Forces.

It is not production that follows consumption, but consumption that follows production.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, XI, pp. -, , . Cf. the numerous references in the Zemstvo Returns for Trubchevsk Uyezd, Orel Gubernia, to the fact that \u201cagriculture is of secondary importance,\u201d and that the principal part is played by industries, particularly lumbering (Statistical Returns for Trubchevsk Uyezd, Orel, , particularly remarks on villages).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Das Kapital, I, S. .[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Here is an illustration of this taken from the Report of the Members of the Commission of Inquiry into Factory Industry in the Kingdom of Poland (St. Petersburg, , Pt. I). Coal in Poland costs half the Moscow price. The average expense of fuel per pood of yarn in Poland is  to  kopeks, and in the Moscow area\u2014 to  kopeks. In the Moscow area fuel is stocked for  to  months, in Poland for not more than  months, and in most cases for  to  weeks.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. N.\u2013on, in dealing with the replacement of the lumber by the coal industry (Sketches, , ), confined himself, as usual, to mere lamentations. Our romanticist tries not to notice the trifling fact that behind the capitalist coal industry stands the equally capitalist lumber industry, which is marked by incomparably worse forms of exploitation. But he dwells at length on the \u201cnumber of workers\u201d! What are some , British miners compared to the millions of unemployed peasants? \u2014he asks (). To this we reply: that capitalism creates a relative surplus-population is beyond doubt, but Mr. N.\u2013on has absolutely failed to see the connection between this and the requirements of large-scale machine industry. To compare the number of peasants engaged in various occupations even casually and irregularly with the number of specialist miners engaged exclusively in coal extraction, is absolutely senseless. Mr. N.\u2013on resorts to such devices only in order to hide the fact of the rapid growth in Russia of both the number of factory and mine workers, and of the commercial and industrial population in general, since that mars his theory.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] As we have had occasion to state above, it is difficult to establish this evolution because in our literature building workers in general are often called \u201cartisans,\u201d wage-workers being quite incorrectly classified in this category.\u2014Regarding the analogous development of the organisation of the building industry in the West see, for instance Webb, Die Geschichte des britischen Trade Unionismus, Stuttgart, , S. .[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In Yaroslavl Gubernia, for instance, Danilov Uyezd is particularly famous for its stove builders, plasterers and bricklayers its different volosts mainly supplying specialists in one or other of these trades. Quite a large number of painters come from the Trans-volga part of Yaroslavl Uyezd; carpenters come from the central part of Mologa Uyezd, etc. (Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia, Vol II, Yaroslavl, , p.  and others.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] At the end of the s, about , carpenters used to leave the Argunovo district (Argunovo Volost is the centre of the industry). In the s, out of  villages in the Pokrov Uyezd,  were engaged in carpentry (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, IV, p. , and foll.).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid., pp. -.

Mr. V. V. (Essays on Handicraft Industry, ) cites data for  uyezds in Poltava, Kursk and Tambov gubernias. The total number of building workers (Mr. V. V. classifies them all; and wrongly so, as \u201csmall industrialists\u201d) is ,, ranging from .% to .% of the total adult male population of the uyezds. If we take the average percentage (.%) as the standard, the number of building workers in European Russia would be  / million (counting  million adult male workers). The gubernias mentioned occupy a position midway between those where the building industries are most developed and those where they are least developed.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The census of January ,  (General Summary, ), gives the number of the independent population (those earning their own livelihood) engaged in the building industry throughout the Empire as ,, plus , cultivators occupied in this industry as a side line. (Note to nd edition.\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Fire insurance figures may, to some extent, help us to gauge the dimensions of the building industry.

The Appendage to the Factory\nBy the appendage to the factory we mean those forms of wage-labour and small industry whose existence is directly connected with the factory. These include, first of all (in part), the lumber and building workers, of whom we have spoken and who in some cases directly form part of the industrial population of factory centres, and in others belong to the population of surrounding villages.[] Further, they include workers employed on peat bogs\u2014which are sometimes worked by factory owners themselves[]; carters, loaders, packers, and so-called labourers generally, who always constitute a fairly considerable part of the population of industrial centres. In St. Petersburg, for instance, the census of December , , registered , persons (of both sexes) in the group of \u201cday labourers and labourers\u201d; then , persons (of both sexes) in the carting industry, of whom , are specially engaged in carting heavy and miscellaneous loads. Further, certain auxiliary work is done for factories by small \u201cindependent\u201d industrialists; in factory centres or their environs such industries spring up as barrel-making for oil-mills and distilleries,[] basket-making for packing glassware,[] packing-case making for hardware, the making of wooden handles for joiners\u2019 and fitters\u2019 tools,[] the making of brads for footwear factories, and of \u201ctanning\u201d for leather works, etc.,[] the weaving of bast-matting for the packing of factory wares (in the Kostroma and other gubernias), the making of \u201csticks\u201d for matches (in the Ryazan, Kaluga and other gubernias), cardboard-box making for tobacco factories (in the environs of St. Petersburg),[] the making of wood-dust for vinegar factories,[] the spinning of waste yarn in small spinning sheds (in Lodz), which has developed owing to the demand created by the big mills,[] etc., etc. All these small industrialists, like the wage-workers referred to above, belong either to the industrial population of factory centres, or to the semi-agricultural population of the surrounding villages. Furthermore, when a factory\u2019s work is limited to the production of a semi-manufactured article, small industries are sometimes called into existence which engage in treating it further; for example, machine spinning has given an impetus to handicraft weaving, and \u201chandicraft\u201d producers of metal goods cluster around ironworks, etc. Finally, capitalist domestic industry is often an appendage to the factory.[] The epoch of large-scale machine industry is marked in all countries by the extensive development of capitalist domestic industry in such branches as, for example, ready-made clothing. We have spoken above of the wide extent of such industry in Russia, of the conditions peculiar to it and of the reason for considering it more correct to describe it in the chapter on manufacture.\n\nIn order to give anything like a full description of the appendage to the factory one needs complete statistics on the occupations of the population, or monographic descriptions of the entire economic life of factory centres and their environs. But even the fragmentary data with which we have had to content ourselves show the incorrectness of the opinion widespread here that factory industry is isolated from other forms of industry, that the factory population is isolated from the population not employed in factories. The development of forms of industry, like that of all social relationships in general, cannot but proceed very gradually, among a mass of interlocking, transitional forms and seeming reversions to the past. Thus, the growth of small industries may express (as we have seen) the progress of capitalist manufacture; now we see that the factory, too, may sometimes develop small industries. Work for the \u201cbuyer-up,\u201d is also an appendage to both the manufactory and the factory. To give a proper assessment of the significance of such phenomena, we must consider them in conjunction with the whole structure of industry at the given stage of its development and with the main trends of this development.\n\nNotes\n[] For instance, in Ryazan Gubernia \u201cat the Khludov factory alone\u201d (-\u2014, workers, output  million rubles), \u201cas many as , horses are engaged in the winter in wood-carting, most of them belonging to peasants of the Yegoryevsk Uyezd\u201d[] (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, VII, pp. -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Chaos also reigns in the statistics for the peat industry. As a rule this industry is not classified among the \u201cfactory\u201d trades (cf. Kobelyatsky, Handbook, p. ), although at times it is. For instance, the List gives  peat fields employing , workers in Vladimir Gubernia and in that gubernia alone, although peat is extracted in other gubernias as well. According to Svirsky (Factories and Works of Vladimir Gubernia ), in  there were , persons employed in extracting peat in Vladimir Gubernia. The total number of workers in Russia employed in the extraction of peat must be many times greater.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, Vol. VI.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid., Vol. VIII, in Novgorod Gubernia.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Ibid., Vol. IX, in the suburban volosts of Tula Uyezd.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In Perm Gubernia, near the town of Kungur, in Tver Gubernia in the village of Kimry, etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See Report of the Zemstvo Board of the St. Petersburg Uyezd for .

Fourteen factories, each with from . to  workers, employed , outside workers. The registration of outside work by the List is quite haphazard and full of gaps. The Collection of Factory Inspectors\u2019 Reports estimates for  a total of  work-distributing offices, giving work to , workers. These data are very incomplete, of course; nevertheless, it is characteristic that the overwhelming majority of these offices, and the workers they employ, relate to centres of factory industry (Moscow area:  offices , workers; Saratov Gubernia\u2014Sarpinka fabrics\u2014 offices, , workers).

Khludov.\u201d The bracketed data (showing the number of workers and the value of output) given in Lenin\u2019s footnote were taken from the List of Factories, St. Petersburg, , Issue No. . [p. ]\n\nXI. The Complete Separation of Industry\nFrom Agriculture\nThe complete separation of industry from agriculture is effected only by large-scale machine industry. The Russian facts fully confirm this thesis, which was established by the author of Capital for other countries,[] but which is usually ignored by the Narodnik economists. Mr. N.\u2013on in his Sketches talks in and out of season about \u201cthe separation of industry from agriculture,\u201d without, however, taking the trouble to examine, on the basis of precise data, how this process is actually taking place and what different forms it assumes. Mr. V. V. points to the connection of our industrial worker with the land (in manufacture ; our author does not think it necessary to distinguish the various stages of capitalism, although he pretends he is following the theory of the author of Capital !) and declaims in this regard about the \u201cshameful (sic !) dependence\u201d \u201cof our (author\u2019s italics) capitalist industry\u201d upon the worker farmer, etc. (Destiny of Capitalism, p.  and others). Mr. V. V. has apparently not heard, or has forgotten if he has beard, that not only in \u201cour country\u201d but everywhere in the West, capitalism failed to bring about the complete separation of the workers from the land before large-scale machine industry was established. Finally, Mr. Kablukov has quite recently presented his students with the following amazing distortion of the facts: \u201cWhereas in the West work in the factory is the sole means of livelihood for the worker, in our country, with relatively few exceptions (sic !!!), the worker regards work in the factory as a subsidiary occupation, he is more attracted to the land.\u201d[]\n\nA factual analysis of this question has been made in Mr. Dementyev\u2019s essay on the \u201cfactory workers\u2019 connection with agriculture\u201d in the Moscow sanitary statistics.[] Systematically collated statistics embracing about , workers have shown that only .% of the factory workers leave for agricultural employment. But far more important is the fact, proved in the greatest detail in the work mentioned, that it is precisely machine production that divorces the workers from the land. Of a whole series of figures quoted in proof of this fact we select the following most striking ones.[]\n\nPer cent leaving for work in fields.\nWe have supplemented the author\u2019s table by dividing  of the trades into those carried on by hand and those by machinery. As regards the ninth, felt cloth production, let us note that it is conducted partly by hand and partly by machinery. Of the weavers in hand-loom factories about % leave for field-work, while of those working on power-looms not one leaves; of the workers in departments of cloth mills that are mechanised .% leave. \u201cThus, the most important reason for factory workers breaking their ties with the land is the transition from hand to machine production. Despite the still relatively considerable number of factories with hand production, the number of workers employed in them, as compared with the number in factories with machine production, is quite negligible, that is why, of those who leave for field-work, we get proportions as small as .% of adult workers in general and .% of adult workers belonging exclusively to the peasant social estate.\u201d[] Let us recall that the returns of the sanitary inspection of factories in Moscow Gubernia gave the following figures: mechanical factories, .% of the total (including .% using steam-engines); in these, .% of the total number of workers are concentrated. Hand-labour factories constitute .%, employing only .% of the total number of workers. At the  mechanised factories there are , workers ( workers per factory), while at the  hand labour factories there are , workers ( workers per factory).[] We have shown above the considerable concentration of all Russian factory workers in the largest enterprises, mostly mechanised, which have an average of  and more workers per establishment. Mr. Dementyev has studied in detail the influence of the workers\u2019 place of birth on their separation from the land, differences between local-born and migrant workers, differences in social estate (burgher or peasant), etc., and it turned out that all these differences are eclipsed by the influence of the main factor: the transition from hand to machine production.[] \u201cWhatever causes may have helped to turn the former cultivator into a factory worker, these special workers already exist. They are merely counted as peasants, but their only connection with the village is by way of the taxes they pay when renewing their passports, for actually they have no farm in the village, and very often not even a house, which has usually been sold. Even their right to land they retain only juridically, so to speak, and the disorders that took place in - at many factories showed that these workers themselves feel totally alien to the village, just as the peasants in their turn regard them, offspring of their fellow-villagers, as strangers. We are consequently faced with an already crystallised class of workers, possessing no homes of their own and virtually no property, a class bound by no ties and living from hand to mouth. And its origin does not date from yesterday. It has its factory genealogy, and a fairly large section of it is already in its third generation.\u201d[] Lastly, interesting material on the separation of the factory from agriculture is provided by the latest factory statistics. The List of Factories and Works (data for -) gives information on the number of days in the year during which each factory operates. Mr. Kasperov hastened to use these data in support of the Narodnik theories when he calculated that \u201con the average, the Russian factory works  days a year,\u201d that \u201c% of the factories in this country work less than  days a year.\u201d[] It goes without saying that in view of the vagueness of the term \u201cfactory,\u201d such overall figures are practically valueless, since they do not indicate how many workers are employed for specific numbers of days in the year. We have computed the appropriate figures of the List for those large factories (with  and more workers) which, as we have seen above (\u00a7 VII), employ about / of the total number of factory workers. It turns out that the average number of working days per year in the different categories was as follows: A) ; B) ; C) ,[] and for all the large factories, . If we calculate the average number of working days per worker we will get  working days per year as the average number per worker of a large factory. Of the  sections into which the various trades are divided in the List, only in one is the average number of working days, for the bottom categories, below , namely in section XI (food products): A) ; B) ; C) . Factories in categories A and B in this section employ , workers, which is .% of the total number of workers in the large factories (,). We would point out that this section combines quite diverse trades, e.g., beet-sugar and tobacco, distilling and flour-milling, etc. For the remaining sections the average number of working days per factory is as follows: A) ; B) ; C) . Thus, the larger the factories the greater the number of days they operate in the course of the year. The general data for all the biggest factories in European Russia, therefore, confirm the conclusions of the Moscow sanitary statistical returns and prove that the factory creates a class of permanent factory workers.\n\nSo then, the data on Russian factory workers fully confirm the theory of Capital that it is large-scale machine industry that brings about a complete and definite revolution in the conditions of life of the industrial population, separating it once and for all from agriculture and from the century-old traditions of patriarchal life connected with it. But, by destroying patriarchal and petty-bourgeois relationships, large-scale machine industry creates, on the other hand, conditions which draw wage-workers in agriculture and industry closer together: firstly, it introduces into the rural districts generally the commercial and industrial way of life which has first arisen in the non-agricultural centres; secondly, it creates mobility of the population and large markets for the hiring of both agricultural and industrial workers; thirdly, by introducing machinery into agriculture, large-scale machine industry brings into the rural districts skilled industrial workers, distinguished for their higher standard of living.\n\nNotes\n[] Das Kapital, I, S. -.[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Lectures on Agricultural (sic !)

Three Stages in the Development of Capitalism\nin Russian Industry\nLet us now sum up the main conclusions to be drawn from the data on the development of capitalism in our industry.[]\n\nThere are three main stages in this development: small commodity-production (small, mainly peasant industries); capitalist manufacture; and the factory (large-scale machine industry). The facts utterly refute the view widespread here in Russia that \u201cfactory\u201d and \u201chandicraft\u201d industry are isolated from each other. On the contrary, such a division is purely artificial. The connection and continuity between the forms of industry mentioned is of the most direct and intimate kind. The facts quite clearly show that the main trend of small commodity-production is towards the development of capitalism, in particular, towards the rise of manufacture; and manufacture is growing with enormous rapidity before our very eyes into large-scale machine industry. Perhaps one of the most striking manifestations of the intimate and direct connection between the consecutive forms of industry is the fact that many of the big and even the biggest factory owners were at one time the smallest of small industrialists and passed through all the stages from \u201cpopular production\u201d to \u201ccapitalism.\u201d Savva Morozov was a peasant serf (he purchased his freedom in ), a cowherd, a carter, a worker weaver, a handicraft weaver who used to journey to Moscow on foot in order to sell his goods to buyers-up; then he became the owner of a small establishment, a work-distributing office, a factory. When he died in , he and his numerous sons owned two large factories. In , the  factories belonging to his descendants employed , workers, producing goods to the value of  million rubles.[] In the silk industry of Vladimir Gubernia, a number of big factory owners were formerly worker weavers or \u201chandicraft\u201d weavers.[] The biggest factory owners in Ivanovo-Voznesensk (the Kuvayevs, Fokins, Zubkovs, Kokushkins, Bobrovs and many others) were formerly handicraftsmen.[] The brocade factories in Moscow Gubernia all grew out of handicraft workrooms.[] The factory owner Zavyalov, of Pavlovo district, still had in  \u201ca vivid recollection of the time when he was a plain employee of craftsman Khabarov.\u201d[] Factory owner Varypayev used to be a small handicrafts man.[] Kondratov was a handicraftsman who used to walk to Pavlovo carrying his wares in a bag.[] Millowner Asmolov used to be a pedlars\u2019 horse-driver, then a small trader, then proprietor of a small tobacco workshop, and finally owner of a factory with a turnover of many millions.[] And so on and so forth. It would be interesting to see how, in these and similar cases, the Narodnik economists would determine where \u201cartificial\u201d capitalism begins and \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d industry ends.\n\nThe three main forms of industry enumerated above differ first of all in their systems of technique. Small commodity-production is characterised by its totally primitive, hand technique that remained unchanged almost from time immemorial. The small producer in industry remains a peasant who follows tradition in his methods of processing raw material. Manufacture introduces division of labour, which effects a substantial change in technique and transforms the peasant into a factory-hand, a \u201clabourer performing one detailed operation.\u201d But production by hand remains, and, on its basis, progress in methods of production is inevitably very slow. Division of labour springs up spontaneously and is passed on by tradition just as peasant labour is. Large-scale machine industry alone introduces a radical change, throws manual skill overboard, transforms production on new, rational principles, and systematically applies science to production. So long as capitalism in Russia did not organise large-scale machine industry, and in those industries in which it has not done so yet, we see almost complete stagnation in technique, we see the employment of the same hand-loom and the same watermill or windmill that were used in production centuries ago. On the other hand, in industries subordinated to the factory we observe a complete technical revolution and extremely rapid progress in the methods of machine production.\n\nWe see that the different stages of the development of capitalism are connected with different systems of technique. Small commodity-production and manufacture are characterised by the prevalence of small establishments, from among which only a few large ones emerge. Large-scale machine industry completely eliminates the small establishments. Capitalist relationships arise in the small industries too (in the form of workshops employing wage-workers and of merchant\u2019s capital), but these are still poorly developed and are not crystallised in sharp oppositions between the groups participating in production. Neither big capital nor extensive proletarian strata as yet exist. In manufacture we see the rise of both. The gulf between the one who owns the means of production and the one who works now becomes very wide. \u201cWealthy\u201d industrial settlements spring up, the bulk of whose inhabitants are poor working people. A small number of merchants, who do an enormous business buying raw materials and selling finished goods, and a mass of detail workers living from hand to mouth\u2014such is the general picture of manufacture. But the multitude of small establishments, the retention of the tie with the land, the adherence to tradition in production and in the whole manner of living\u2014 all this creates a mass of intermediary elements between the extremes of manufacture and retards the development of these extremes. In large-scale machine industry all these retarding factors disappear; the acuteness of social contradictions reaches the highest point. All the dark sides of capitalism become concentrated, as it were: the machine, as we know, gives a tremendous impulse to the greatest possible prolongation of the working day; women and children are drawn into industry; a reserve army of unemployed is formed (and must be formed by virtue of the conditions of factory production), etc. However, the socialisation of labour effected on a vast scale by the factory, and the transformation of the sentiments and conceptions of the people it employs (in particular, the destruction of patriarchal and petty-bourgeois traditions) cause a reaction: large-scale machine industry, unlike the preceding stages, imperatively calls for the planned regulation of production and public control over it (a manifestation of the latter tendency is factory legislation).[]\n\nThe very character of the development of production changes at the various stages of capitalism. In the small industries this development follows in the wake of the development of peasant economy; the market is extremely narrow, the distance between the producer and the consumer is short, and the insignificant scale of production easily adapts itself to the slightly fluctuating local demand. That is why industry at this stage is characterised by the greatest stability, but this stability is tantamount to stagnation in technique and the preservation of patriarchal social relationships tangled up with all sorts of survivals of medieval traditions. The manufactories work for a big market\u2014 sometimes for the whole country\u2014and, accordingly, production acquires the instability characteristic of capitalism, an instability which attains the greatest intensity under factory production. Large-scale machine industry can only develop in spurts, in alternating periods of prosperity and of crisis. The ruin of small producers is tremendously accelerated by this spasmodic growth of the factory; the workers are drawn into the factory in masses during a boom period, and are then thrown out. The formation of a vast reserve army of unemployed, ready to undertake any kind of work, becomes a condition for the existence and development of large-scale machine industry. In Chapter II we showed from which strata of the peasantry this army is recruited, and in subsequent chapters we indicated the main types of occupations for which capital keeps these reserves ready. The \u201cinstability\u201d of large-scale machine industry has always evoked, and continues to evoke, reactionary complaints from individuals who continue to look at things through the eyes of the small producer and who forget that it is this \u201cinstability\u201d alone that replaced the former stagnation by the rapid transformation of methods of production and of all social relationships.\n\nOne of the manifestations of this transformation is the separation of industry from agriculture, the liberation of social relations in industry from the traditions of the feudal and patriarchal system that weigh down on agriculture. In small commodity-production the industrialist has not yet emerged at all from his peasant shell; in the majority of cases he remains a farmer, and this connection between small industry and small agriculture is so profound that we observe the interesting law of the parallel differentiation of the small producers in industry and in agriculture. The formation of a petty bourgeoisie and of wage-workers proceeds simultaneously in both spheres of the national economy, thereby preparing the way, at both poles of differentiation, for the industrialist to break with agriculture. Under manufacture this break is already very considerable. A whole number of industrial centres arise that do not engage in agriculture. The chief representative of industry is no longer the peasant, but the merchant and the manufactory owner on the one hand, and the \u201cartisan\u201d on the other. Industry and the relatively developed commercial intercourse with the rest of the world raise the standard of living and the culture of the population; the peasant is now regarded with disdain by the manufactory workman. Large-scale machine industry completes this transformation, separates industry from agriculture once and for all, and, as we have seen, creates a special class of the population totally alien to the old peasantry and differing from the latter in its manner of living, its family relationships and its higher standard of requirements, both material and spiritual.[] In the small industries and in manufacture we always find survivals of patriarchal relations and of diverse forms of personal dependence, which, in the general conditions of capitalist economy, exceedingly worsen the condition of the working people, and degrade and corrupt them. Large-scale machine industry, which concentrates masses of workers who often come from various parts of the country, absolutely refuses to tolerate survivals of patriarchalism and personal dependence, and is marked by a truly \u201ccontemptuous attitude to the past.\u201d It is this break with obsolete tradition that is one of the substantial conditions which have created the possibility and evoked the necessity of regulating production and of public control over it. In particular, speaking of the transformation brought about by the factory in the conditions of life of the population, it must be stated that the drawing of women and juveniles into production[] is, at bottom, progressive. It is indisputable that the capitalist factory places these categories of the working population in particularly hard conditions, and that for them it is particularly necessary to regulate and shorten the working day, to guarantee hygienic conditions of labour, etc.; but endeavours completely to ban the work of women and juveniles in industry, or to maintain the patriarchal manner of life that ruled out such work, would be reactionary and utopian. By destroying the patriarchal isolation of these categories of the population who formerly never emerged from the narrow circle of domestic, family relationships, by drawing them into direct participation in social production, large-scale machine industry stimulates their development and increases their independence, in other words, creates conditions of life that are incomparably superior to the patriarchal immobility of pre-capitalist relations.[]\nThe settled character of the population is typical of the first two stages of industrial development. The small industrialist, remaining a peasant, is bound to his village by his farm. The artisan under manufacture is usually tied to the small, isolated industrial area which is created by manufacture. In the very system of industry at the first and second stages of its development there is nothing to disturb this settled and isolated condition of the producer. Intercourse between the various industrial areas is rare. The transfer of industry to other areas is due only to the migration of individual small producers, who establish new small industries in the outlying parts of the country. Large-scale machine industry, on the other hand, necessarily creates mobility of the population; commercial intercourse between the various districts grows enormously; railways facilitate travel. The demand for labour increases on the whole\u2014rising in periods of boom and falling in periods of crisis, so that it becomes a necessity for workers to go from one factory to another, from one part of the country to another. Large-scale machine industry creates a number of new industrial centres, which grow up with unprecedented rapidity, sometimes in unpopulated places, a thing that would be impossible without the mass migration of workers. Further on we shall speak of the dimensions and the significance of the so-called outside non-agricultural industries. At the moment we shall limit ourselves to a brief presentation of Zemstvo sanitation statistics for Moscow Gubernia. An inquiry among , factory workers showed that ,, or .% of the total, were born in the uyezd in which they worked. Hence, nearly half the workers had migrated from one uyezd to another. The number of workers who were born in Moscow Gubernia was ,, or %.[] More than a third of the workers came from other gubernias (chiefly from gubernias of the central industrial zone adjacent to Moscow Gubernia). A comparison of the different uyezds shows the most highly industrialised ones to be marked by the lowest percentage of locally-born workers. For example, in the poor]y industrialised Mozhaisk and Volokolamsk uyezds from  to % of the factory workers are natives of the uyezd where they work. In the very highly industrialised Moscow, Kolomna and Bogorodsk uyezds the percentage of locally born workers drops to %, % and %. From this the investigators draw the conclusion that \u201cthe considerable development of factory production in an uyezd encourages the influx of outside elements.\u201d[] These facts show also (let us add) that the movement of industrial workers bears the same features that we observed in the movement of agricultural workers. That is to say, industrial workers, too, migrate not only from localities where there is a surplus of labour, but also from those where there is a shortage. For example, the Bronnitsi Uyezd attracts , workers from other uyezds of Moscow Gubernia and from other gubernias, while at the same time providing , workers for the more highly industrialised Moscow and Bogorodsk uyezds. Hence, workers leave not only because they do not find \u201clocal occupations at hand,\u201d but also because they make for the places where conditions are better. Elementary as this fact is, it is worth while giving the Narodnik economists a further reminder of it, for they idealise local occupations and condemn migration to industrial districts, ignoring the progressive significance of the mobility of the population created by capitalism.\n\nThe above-described characteristic features which distinguish large-scale machine industry from the preceding forms of industry may be summed up in the words\u2014socialisation of labour. Indeed, production for an enormous national and international market, development of close commercialties with various parts of the country and with different countries for the purchase of raw and auxiliary materials, enormous technical progress, concentration of production and of the population in colossal enterprises, demolition of the worn-out traditions of patriarchal life, creation of mobility of the population, and improvement of the worker\u2019s standard of requirements and his development\u2014all these are elements of the capitalist process which is increasingly socialising production in the country, and with it those who participate in production.[]\n\nOn the problem of the relation of large-scale machine industry in Russia to the home market for capitalism, the data given above lead to the following conclusion. The rapid development of factory industry in Russia is creating an enormous and ever-growing market for means of production (building materials, fuel, metals, etc.) and is increasing with particular rapidity the part of the population engaged in making articles of productive and not personal consumption. But the market for articles of personal consumption is also growing rapidly, owning to the growth of large-scale machine industry, which is diverting an increasingly large part of the population from agriculture into commercial and industrial occupations. As for the home market for factory-made products, the process of the formation of that market was examined in detail in the early chapters of this book.\n\nNotes\n[] Confining ourselves, as stated in the preface, to the post-Reform period, we leave aside the forms of industry that were based on the labour of the serf population.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, IV, -. \u2014Directory for .\u2014Shishmaryov: A Brief Sketch of Industry in the Region of the Nizhni-Novgorod and Shuya-Ivanow Railways, St. Petersburg, , pp. -.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, p.  and foll.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Shishmaryov, -.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VII, Pt.

Before us is a free young woman, hampered by no obstacles, emancipated from the family and from all that constitutes the peasant woman\u2019s conditions of life, a young woman who at any moment may leave one place for another, one employer for another, and may at any moment find herself without a job . . . without a crust of bread. . . .

I (Moscow, ), p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The data quoted in the last three chapters show, in our opinion, that the classification of the capitalist forms and stages of industry given by Marx is more correct and sound than the now current classification which confuses the manufactory with the factory and regards working for a buyer-up as a special form of industry (Held, B\\\"ucher). To confuse the manufactory with the factory is to make purely superficial features the basis for classification and to ignore the essential features of technique, economy and social life which distinguish manufacture from the machine period of capitalism. As to capitalist domestic industry, it undoubtedly plays a very important part in the mechanism of capitalist industry. Just as undoubtedly, work for the buyer-up is particularly characteristic of pre-machine capitalism; but it is also to be met with (and on no small scale) in the most diverse periods of capitalist development. The significance of work for the buyer-up is not to be understood unless studied in connection with the whole structure of industry in the given period, or at the given stage of capitalist development. The peasant who weaves baskets to the order of the village shopkeeper, the Pavlovo artisan who makes knife-handles in his home to the order of Zavyalov, the woman worker who makes clothes, footwear, gloves or boxes to the order of big mill owners or merchants\u2014all work for buyers-up, but in all these instances capitalist domestic industry bears a different character and has a different significance. We do not, of course, in the least deny the merits of B\\\"ucher, for example, in studying pre-capitalist forms of industry, but we think his classification of capitalist forms of industry is wrong.\u2014We cannot agree with the views of Mr. Struve (see Mir Bozhy, , No. ) inasmuch as he adopts B\\\"ucher\u2019s theory (in the part mentioned) and applies it to Russian \u201chandicraftism.\u201d (Since these lines were written, in , Mr. Struve has managed to complete the cycle of his scientific and political development. From a person oscillating between B\\\"ucher and Marx, between liberal and socialist economics, he has become a liberal bourgeois of the purest water. The writer of these lines is proud of having helped, as far as has been in his power, to purge Social-Democracy of such elements. (Note to nd edition.\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin Chapter V. The First Stages of Capitalism in Industry\nLet us now pass from agriculture to industry. Here, too, our task is formulated as in the case of agriculture: we have to analyse the forms of industry in post-Reform Russia, that is, to study the present system of social and economic relations in manufacturing industry and the character of the evolution of that system. Let us start with the most simple and primitive forms of industry and trace their development.\n\nI. Domestic Industry And Handicrafts\nBy domestic industry we mean the processing of raw materials in the household (peasant family) that produces them. Domestic industries are a necessary adjunct of natural economy, remnants of which are nearly always retained where there is a small peasantry. It is natural, therefore, that in Russian economic literature one should meet repeated references to this type of industry (the domestic production of articles from flax, hemp, wood, etc., for consumption in the home). However, the existence of domestic industry on any extensive scale is rarely found nowadays and only in the most remote localities; until very recently, Siberia, for example, was one of them. Industry as a profession does not yet exist in this form: industry here is linked inseparably with agriculture, together they constitute a single whole.\n\nThe first form of industry to be separated from patriarchal agriculture is artisan production, i.e., the production of articles to the order of a consumer.[] The raw materials may belong either to the customer-consumer or to the artisan, and payment for the latter\u2019s work is made either in cash or in kind (artisan\u2019s premises and keep, remuneration with part of the product, for example, flour, etc.). While constituting an essential part of urban life, artisan production is to be met on a considerable scale in the rural districts too, where it serves as a supplement to peasant farming. A certain percentage of the rural population consists of specialist-artisans engaged (sometimes exclusively, sometimes in conjunction with agriculture) in tanning, boot-making, tailoring, blacksmithery, dyeing of homespun fabrics, finishing of peasant-made woollens, flour-milling, etc. Owing to the extremely unsatisfactory state of our economic statistics we have no precise data on the degree to which artisan production is spread throughout Russia; but isolated references to this form of industry are scattered through nearly all descriptions of peasant farming and investigations of what is called \u201chandicraft\u201d industry,[] and are even to be found in official factory statistics.[] The Zemstvo statistical returns, in registering peasant industries, sometimes single out a special group, \u201cartisans\u201d (cf. Rudnev, loc. cit.), but this category (according to current terminology) includes all building workers. From the viewpoint of political economy this is utterly wrong, for the bulk of the building workers belong to the category, not of independent industrialists working on orders from customers, but of wage-workers employed by contractors. Of course, it is not always easy to distinguish the village-artisan from the small commodity-producer or from the wage-worker; this requires an economic analysis of the data concerning every small industrialist. A noteworthy attempt to draw a strict line of demarcation between artisan production and the other forms of small industry is the analysis of the returns of the Perm handicraft census of \u2013.[] The number of local village artisans was estimated at approximately one per cent of the peasant population, and (as might have been expected) the largest percentage of artisans was found in the uyezds where industry was least developed. As compared with the small commodity-producers, the artisans are more closely connected with the land: . per  artisans engage in agriculture (among the other \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d the percentage is lower). The employment of wage-labour is met with among artisans too, but is less developed among industrialists of this type than among the others. The size of establishments (taking the number of workers) is also smaller among the artisans. The average earnings of the artisan-cultivator are estimated at . rubles per year, and of the non-cultivator at . rubles.\n\nWe confine ourselves to these brief remarks, since a detailed examination of artisan production does not enter into our task. In this form of industry commodity production does not yet exist; here only commodity circulation makes its appearance, in the case where the artisan receives payment in money, or sells the share of the product he has received for work done and buys himself raw materials and instruments of production. The product of the artisan\u2019s labour does not appear in the market, hardly ever leaving the sphere of peasant natural economy.[] It is natural, therefore, that artisan production is characterised by the same routine, fragmentation and narrowness as small patriarchal agriculture. The only element of development native to this form of industry is the migration of artisans to other areas in search of employment. Such migration was fairly widely developed, particularly in the old days, in our rural districts; usually it led to the organisation of independent artisan establishments in the areas of attraction.\n\nNotes\n[] Kundenproduktion. Cf. Karl Blucher, Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft, Tubingen, . (Work done to order. Cf. Karl Blucher, The Rise of the National Economy.\u2014Ed.)[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It would be impossible to cite quotations in support of this; innumerable references to artisan production are scattered throughout all investigations of handicraft industry, although according to the most accepted view, artisans do not come within the category known as handicraftsmen. We shall have more than one occasion to see how hopelessly indefinite is the term \u201chandicraft.\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The chaotic condition of these statistics is illustrated particularly vividly by the fact that no criteria have yet been decided on for distinguishing handicraft from factory establishments. In the s, for example, village dyeing sheds of a purely handicraft type were classified with the latter (The Ministry of Finance Yearbook, Vol. I, pp. -), and in , peasant fulling mills were mixed up with woollen factories (Orlov\u2019s Directory of Factories and Works, rd ed., p. ), etc. Nor is the latest List of Factories (St. Petersburg, ) free from this confusion. For examples, see our Studies, pp. -. [See also present edition, Vol, , \u201cOn the Question of Our Factory Statistics.\u201dEd.]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] We have devoted a special article to this census in our Studies, pp. -. (See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia and General Problems of \u201cHandicraft\u201d Industry.\u2014Ed.) All the facts cited in the text concerning the Perm \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d are taken from that article.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The closeness of artisan production to the natural economy of the peasants sometimes leads to attempts on their part to organise such production for the whole village, the peasants providing the artisan with his keep, he undertaking to work for all the inhabitants of the village concerned. Nowadays this system of industry is to be met with only by way of exception, or in the most remote border regions (for example, the blacksmith\u2019s trade is organised on these lines in some of the villages in Transcaucasia. See Reports and Investigations of Handicraft Industry in Russia, Vol. II, p. ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Lenin gives an appreciation of the research done by B\\\"ucher, and of the latter\u2019s classification of the stages and forms of industrial development, in Chapter VII of The Development of Capitalism in Russia, in his footnote on page . The most important part of Blucher\u2019s work, that devoted to the origin of the national economy, was translated into Russian by Lenin apparently when he was in exile, in the village of Shushenskoye. Lenin\u2019s translation has not been published. [p.]\n\nII. Small Commodity-Producers In Industry. The Craft Spirit In The Small Industries\nWe have seen that the artisan appears on the market, although not with the wares he produces. Naturally, once he comes into contact with the market, he begins in time to produce for the market, i.e., becomes a commodity producer. This transition takes place gradually, at first as an experiment: goods are sold which are left on his hands by chance, or are produced in his spare time. The gradualness of the transition is heightened by the fact that the market for wares is at first extremely restricted, so that the distance between the producer and the consumer increases very slightly, and the product passes as hitherto directly from the producer to the consumer, its sale sometimes being preceded by its exchange for agricultural produce.[] The further development of commodity production is expressed in the expansion of commerce in the appearance of specialist merchants, buyers-up; the market for wares is not the small village bazaar or the district fair,[] but the whole region, then the whole country, and sometimes even other countries. The production of industrial wares in the shape of commodities is the first step to the separation of industry from agriculture, and to mutual exchange between them. Mr. N.-on, with his characteristically stereotyped and abstract way of understanding things, limits himself to declaring that the \u201cseparation of industry from agriculture\u201d is a quality of \u201ccapitalism\u201d in general, without taking the trouble to examine either the different forms of this separation or the different stages of capitalism. It is important to note, therefore, that commodity production on the smallest scale in the peasant industries already begins to separate industry from agriculture, although at that stage of development the industrialist does not, in the majority of cases, separate from the agriculturist. Later on we shall show how the more developed stages of capitalism lead to the separation of industrial from agricultural enterprises, to the separation of industrial workers from agriculturists.\n\nIn the rudimentary forms of commodity production, competition among the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d is still very slight, but as the market expands and embraces wide areas, this competition grows steadily stronger and disturbs the small industrialist\u2019s patriarchal prosperity, the basis of which is his virtually monopolist position. The small commodity-producer feels that his interests, as opposed to the interests of the rest of society, demand the preservation of this monopolist position, and he therefore fears competition. He exerts every effort, individually and with others, to check competition, \u201cnot to let\u201d rivals into his district, and to consolidate his assured position as a small master possessing a definite circle of customers. This fear of competition so strikingly reveals the true social nature of the small commodity-producer that we think it necessary to examine the relative facts in greater detail. In the first place, let us quote an example relative to handicraft. The Kaluga sheepskin dressers go off to other gubernias to treat sheepskins; this industry has declined since the abolition of serfdom; the landlords, when they released serfs for \u201csheepskinning,\u201d in return for a sizable tribute, took great care that the sheepskinners knew their \u201cdefinite places\u201d and did not permit other dressers to invade their districts. Organised on these lines the industry was so profitable that \u201cplaces\u201d were transferred for as much as  and , rubles, and if an artisan came to a district other than his own, it sometimes led to sanguinary clashes. The abolition of serfdom undermined this medieval prosperity: \u201cthe convenience of railway travel in this case also aids competition.\u201d[] One of the phenomena of the same type observed in a number of industries and bearing fully the character of a general rule, is the desire of the small industrialists to keep technical inventions and improvements secret, to conceal profitable occupations from others, in order to stave off \u201cfatal competition.\u201d Those who establish a new industry or introduce some improvement in an old one, do their utmost to conceal these profitable occupations from their fellow-villagers and resort to all sorts of devices for this purpose (e.g., as a make-believe they keep the old arrangements in the establishment), let no one enter their workshops, work in garrets and say nothing about their work even to their own children.[] The slow development of the brush-making industry in Moscow Gubernia \u201cis usually attributed to the present producers\u2019 objection to having new competitors. It is said that they do all they can to conceal their work from strangers, and so only one producer has apprentices from outside.\u201d[] Concerning the village of Bezvodnoye, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, famous for its metalware industry, we read the following: \u201cIt is remarkable that to this day\u201d (the beginning of the s; the industry has existed since the beginning of the s) \u201cthe inhabitants of Bezvodnoye carefully conceal their craft from the neighbouring peasants. They have made more than one attempt to induce the volost administration to issue an instruction making it a punishable offence to carry the craft to another village; though they have failed to get this formality adopted, each of them seems to be morally bound by such an instruction, in virtue of which they refrain from giving their daughters in marriage to inhabitants of neighbouring villages, and as far as possible avoid taking girls in marriage from those villages.\u201d[]\n\nThe Narodnik economists have not only tried to obscure the fact that the bulk of the small peasant industrialists belong to the category of commodity-producers, but have even created quite a legend about some profound antagonism allegedly existing between the economic organisation of the small peasant industries and large-scale industry. The unsoundness of this view is also evident, by the way, from the above-quoted data. If the big industrialist stops at nothing to ensure himself a monopoly, the peasant engaging in \u201chandicrafts\u201d is in this respect his twin brother; the petty bourgeois endeavours with his petty resources to uphold substantially the same class interests the big manufacturer seeks to protect when he clamours for protection, bonuses, privileges, etc.[]\n\nIII. The Growth of Small Industries After the Reform. Two Forces of This Process and its Significance\nFrom the foregoing there also emerge the following features of small production that merit attention. The appearance of a new industry signifies, as we have already observed, a process of growing social division of labour. Hence, such a process must necessarily take place in every capitalist society, to the extent that a peasantry and semi-natural agriculture still remain to one degree or other, and to the extent that diverse ancient institutions and traditions (due to bad means of communication, etc.) prevent large-scale machine industry from directly replacing domestic industry. Every step in the development of commodity economy inevitably leads to the peasantry producing an ever-increasing number of industrialists from their ranks; this process turns up new soil, as it were, prepares new regions in the most backward parts of the country, or new spheres in the most backward branches of industry, for subsequent seizure by capitalism. The very same growth of capitalism manifests itself in other parts of the country, or in other branches of industry, in an entirely different way; not in an increase but in a decrease in the number of small workshops and of home workers absorbed by the factory. It is clear that a study of the development of capitalism in the industry of a given country requires that the strictest distinction be made between these processes; to mix them up is to lead to an utter confusion of concepts.[]\nIn post-Reform Russia the growth of small industries, expressing the first steps in the development of capitalism, has manifested, and manifests, itself in two ways: firstly, in the migration of small industrialists and handicraftsmen from the central, long-settled and economically most advanced gubernias, to the outer regions; secondly, in the formation of new small industries and the spread of previously existing industries among the local population.\n\nThe first of these processes is one of the manifestations of the colonisation of the border regions to which we have referred (Chapter IV, \u00a7 II). The peasant industrialist in the Nizhni-Novgorod, Vladimir, Tver, Kaluga and other gubernias, sensing the increased competition accompanying the growth of the population, and the growth of capitalist manufacture and of the factory that constitute a menace to small production, leaves for the South, where \u201cartisans\u201d are still few, earnings high and the living cost low. In the new locality a small establishment was set up which laid the foundations for a new peasant industry that spread later in the village concerned and in its environs. The central districts of the country, possessing an industrial culture of long standing, thus helped the development of the same culture in new parts of the country, where settlement was beginning. Capitalist relations (which, as we shall see below, are also characteristic of the small peasant industries) were thus carried to the entire country.[]\n\nLet us pass to the facts that express the second of the above-mentioned processes. We shall first say that although we note the growth of small peasant establishments and industries, we do not as yet deal with their economic organisation: from what follows it will be evident that these industries either lead to the formation of capitalist simple co-operation and merchant\u2019s capital or constitute a component part of capitalist manufacture.\n\nThe fur industry in Arzamas Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, began in the town of Arzamas and then gradually spread to the surrounding villages, embracing an ever larger area. At first there were few furriers in the villages and they employed numerous workers; labour was cheap, since people hired themselves out in order to learn the trade. After learning it they left and opened small establishments of their own, thus preparing a wider field for the domination of capital, which now controls a large section of the industrialists.[] Let us note in general that this abundance of wage-workers in the first establishments of a rising industry and the subsequent transformation of these wage-workers into small masters is a very widespread phenomenon, bearing the character of a general rule.[] Obviously, It would be a profound error to deduce from this that \u201cin spite of various historical considerations . . . it is not big establishments that absorb small ones, but small ones that grow out of big ones.\u201d[] The large size of the first establishments expresses no concentration of the industry; it is explained by the solitary character of these establishments and by the eagerness of local peasants to learn a profitable trade in them. As to the process of the spread of peasant industries from their old centres to the surrounding villages, it is observed in many cases. For example, the post-Reform period saw the development (as regards the number of villages involved in industry, the number of industrialists, and the total output) of the following exceptionally important industries: the lock and cutlery industry of Pavlovo, tanning and boot-making in the village of Kimry, the knitting of woollen slippers in the town of Arzamas and in its environs,[] the metalware industry of the village of Burmakino, the cap-making industry of the village and of the district of Molvitino, the glass, hat and lace industries of Moscow Gubernia, the jewellery industry of Krasnoselskoye District, etc.[] The author of an article on handicraft industries in seven volosts of Tula Uyezd notes as a general phenomenon \u201can increase in the number of artisans since the peasant Reform,\u201d \u201cthe appearance of artisans and handicraftsmen in places where there were none in pre-Reform times.\u201d[] A similar view is expressed by Moscow statisticians.[] We can support this view with statistics regarding the date of origin of  handicraft establishments in  industries of Moscow Gubernia.[]\nNumber of establishments founded.\nSimilarly, the Perm handicraft census revealed (according to data showing the time of origin of , small artisan and handicraft establishments) that the post-Reform period is characterised by a particularly rapid growth of small industries. It will be interesting to take a closer glance at this process of the rise of new industries. The production of woollen and semi-silk fabrics in Vladimir Gubernia began recently, in . At first this was a peasant outside occupation, but later \u201csubcontractors\u201d made their appearance in the villages, who distributed yarn. One of the first \u201cfactory owners\u201d at one time traded in groats, buying them up in the Tambov and Saratov \u201csteppes.\u201d With the building of railways, grain prices were levelled out, the grain trade became concentrated in the hands of millionaires, and so our merchant decided to invest his capital in an industrial weaving enterprise; he went to work in a factory, learnt the business and became a \u201csubcontractor.\u201d[] Thus, the formation of a new \u201cindustry\u201d in this locality was due to the fact that the general economic development of the country was forcing capital out of trade and directing it towards industry.[] The investigator of the industry we have taken as an example points out that the case he has described is by no means an isolated one: the peasants who earned their living by outside employments \u201cwere pioneers in all sorts of industries, carried their technical knowledge to their native villages, got new labour forces to follow their example and migrate, and fired the imagination of the rich muzhiks with stories of the fabulous profits which the industry brought the workroom owner and the subcontractor. The rich muzhik, who used to store his money away in a chest, or traded in grain, paid heed to these stories and put his money into industrial undertakings\u201d (ibid.). The boot and felt industries in Alexandrov Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, arose in some places in the following way: the owners of calico workrooms or of small yarn-distributing shops, seeing that handweaving was declining, opened workshops of another kind, sometimes hiring craftsmen so as to get to know the trade and to teach their children.[] To the extent that large-scale industry forces small capital out of the branch of production, this capital flows into others and stimulates their development in the same direction.\n\nThe general conditions of the post-Reform period which called forth the development of small industries in the rural districts are very vividly described by investigators of Moscow industries. \u201cOn the one hand, the conditions of peasant life have greatly deteriorated during this period,\u201d we read in a description of the lace industry, \u201cbut on the other, the requirements of the population, of that part which lives under more favourable conditions, have considerably increased.[] And the author, using the data of the region he has taken, notes an increase in the number of those owning no horses and raising no crops, side by side with an increase in the number of peasants owning many horses and in the total number of cattle belonging to peasants. Thus, on the one hand, there was an increase in the number of persons in need of \u201coutside earnings\u201d and in search of industrial work, while on the other, a minority of prosperous families grew rich, accumulated \u201csavings,\u201d and were \u201cable to hire a worker or two, or give out work to poor peasants to be done at home.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d the author explains, \u201cwe are not dealing here with cases where individuals who are known as kulaks, or blood-suckers, develop from among such families; we are merely examining most ordinary phenomena among the peasant population.\u201d\n\nSo then, local investigators point to a connection between the differentiation of the peasantry and the growth of small peasant industries. And that is quite natural. From the data given in Chapter II it follows that the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry had necessarily to be supplemented by a growth of small peasant industries. As natural economy declined, one form of raw-material processing after another turned into separate branches of industry; the formation of a peasant bourgeoisie and of a rural proletariat increased the demand for the products of the small peasant industries, while at the same time supplying free hands for these industries and free money.[]\n\nNotes\n[] Here is an interesting example of how these two different processes occur in one and the same gubernia, at one and the same time and in one and the same industry. The spinning-wheel industry (in Vyatka Gubernia) is ancillary to the domestic production of fabrics. The development of this industry marks the rise of commodity production, which embraces the making of one of the instruments for the production of fabrics. Well, we see that in the remote parts of the gubernia, in the north, the spinning wheel is almost unknown (Material for a Description of the Industries of Vyatka Gubernia, II, ) and there \u201cthe industry might newly emerge,\u201d i.e., might make the first breach in the patriarchal natural economy of the peasants. Meanwhile, in other parts of the gubernia this industry is already declining, and the investigators believe that the probable cause of the decline is \u201cthe increasingly widespread use among the peasantry of factory-made cotton fabrics\u201d (p ). Here, consequently, the growth of commodity production and of capitalism is manifested in the elimination of petty industry by the factory.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See, for example, S. A. Korolenko, loc. cit., on the movement of industrial workers to the outer regions, where part of them settle. Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, Vol. I (on the preponderance in Stavropol Gubernia of industrialists from the central gubernias), Vol. III, pp. - (the migration of boot-makers from Viyezdnaya, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, to the Lower-Volga towns); Vol. IX (tanners from the village of Bogorodskoye in the same gubernia established tanneries all over Russia).

Data On House-To-House Censuses Of Handicraftsmen In Moscow Gubernia\nLet us now examine the social and economic relations that develop among the small commodity-producers in industry. The task of defining the character of these relations is similar to the one outlined above, in Chapter II, in relation to the small farmers. Instead of the scale of farming, we must now take as our basis the size of the industrial establishments; we must classify the small industrialists according to the size of their output, ascertain the part wage-labour plays in each group, the conditions of technique, etc.[] The handicraft house-to-house censuses that we need for such an analysis are available for Moscow Gubernia.[] For a number of industries the investigators quote precise statistics on output, and sometimes also on the farms of each separate craftsman (date of origin of establishment, number of workers, family and hired, total annual output, number of horses owned by craftsmen, method of cultivating the soil, etc.). The investigators provide no classified tables, however, and we have therefore been obliged to compile them ourselves, dividing the craftsmen in each industry into grades (I, bottom; II, middle and III, top) according to the number of workers (family and hired) per establishment, and sometimes according to the volume of output, technical organisation, etc. In general, the criteria according to which the craftsmen have been divided into grades are based on all the data given in the description of the industry; but in different industries we have found it necessary to take different criteria for dividing the craftsmen into grades. For example, in very small industries we have placed in the bottom grade establishments with  worker, in the middle grade those with , and in the top grade those with  and more; whereas in the bigger industries we have placed in the bottom grade establishments with  to  workers, in the middle grade those with  to , etc. Had we not employed different methods of classification we could not have presented for each industry data concerning establishments of different size. The table drawn up on these lines is given in the Appendix (see Appendix I); it shows the criteria according to which the craftsmen in each industry are divided up into grades, gives for each grade in each industry absolute figures of the number of establishments, workers (family and hired combined), aggregate output, establishments employing wage-workers, number of wage-workers. To describe the farms of the handicraftsmen we have calculated the average number of horses per peasant household in each grade and the percentage of craftsmen who cultivate their land with the aid of \u201ca labourer\u201d (i.e., resort to the hire of rural workers). The table covers a total of  industries, with , establishments and , employed and an aggregate output valued at over  million rubles; but if we subtract the  industries not included in the general list because of incompleteness of data, or because of their exceptional character,[] there is a total of  industries, , establishments, , workers and an aggregate output of ,, rubles, or, with corrections (in the case of  industries), about  / million rubles.\n\nSince there is no need to examine the data for all the  industries, and as it would be too arduous a task, we have divided these industries into four categories: )  industries with an average of . to . workers (family and hired combined) per establishment; )  industries with an average of . to . workers; )  industries with an average of . to . workers; and )  industries with an average of . to . workers. Thus, in each category we have combined industries that are fairly similar as regards the number of workers per establishment, and in our further exposition we shall limit ourselves to the data for these four categories of industries. We give these data in extenso. (See Table on p. .)\n\nThis table combines those principal data on the relations between the top and bottom grades of handicrafts men that will serve us for our subsequent conclusions. We can illustrate the summarised data for all four categories with a chart drawn up in exactly the same way as the one with which, in Chapter II, we illustrated the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry. We ascertain what percentage each grade constitutes of the total number of establishments, of the total number of family workers, of the total number of establishments with wage-workers, of the total number of workers (family and wage combined), of the aggregate output and of the total number of wage-workers, and we indicate these percentages (in the manner described in Chapter II) on the chart (see chart on p. ).\n\nCategories of industries.\nLet us now examine the conclusions to be drawn from these data.\n\nWe begin with the role of wage-labour. In the  industries wage-labour predominates over family labour: % of the workers are hired; for the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d of Moscow Gubernia this percentage is even lower than the actual one. We have computed the data for  industries of Moscow Gubernia for which exact figures as to wage-workers employed are available, and got the figure of , wage-workers out of a total of , workers, i.e., .%. For Perm Gubernia the percentage of wage-workers among all handicraftsmen and artisans combined was established as .%, and among commodity-producers alone, as from . to .%. But these gross figures, as we shall see below, embrace not only small commodity-producers, but also capitalist manufacture. Far more interesting, therefore, is the conclusion that the role of wage-labour rises parallel to the increase in the size of establishments: this is observed both in comparing one category with another and in comparing the different grades in the same category. The larger the establishments, the higher the percentage of those employing wage-workers and the higher the percentage of wage-workers. The Narodnik economists usually limit themselves to declaring that among the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d small establishments with exclusively family workers prevail, and in support of this often cite \u201caverage\u201d figures. As is evident from the data given, these \u201caverages\u201d are unsuitable for characterising the phenomenon in this regard, and the numerical preponderance of small establishments with family workers does not in the least eliminate the basic fact that the tendency of small commodity production is towards the ever-growing employment of wage-labour, towards the formation of capitalist workshops. Moreover, the data cited also refute another, no less widespread, Narodnik assertion, namely, that wage-labour in \u201chandicraft\u201d production really serves to \u201csupplement\u201d family labour, that it is resorted to not for the purpose of profit-making, etc.[] Actually, however, it turns out that among the small\n\nChart summarizing data given in preceding table.\nindustrialists\u2014just as among the small agriculturists\u2014the growing employment of wage-labour runs parallel to the increase in the number of family workers. In the majority of industries we see that the employment of wage-labour increases as we pass from the bottom grade to the top, notwithstanding the fact that the number of family workers per establishment also increases. The employment of wage-labour does not smooth out differences in the size of the \u201chandicraftsmen\u2019s\u201d families, but accentuates them. The chart very clearly shows this common feature of the small industries: the top grade employs the bulk of the wage-workers, despite the fact that it is best provided with family workers. \u201cFamily co-operation \u201d is thus the basis of capitalist co-operation.[] It goes without saying, of course, that this \u201claw\u201d applies only to the smallest commodity-producers, only to the rudiments of capitalism; this law proves that the tendency of the peasantry is to turn into petty bourgeois. As soon as workshops with a fairly large number of wage-workers arise, the significance of \u201cfamily co-operation\u201d must inevitably decline. And we see, indeed, from our data that this law does not apply to the biggest grades of the top categories. When the \u201chandicraftsman\u201d turns into a real capitalist employing from  to  wage-workers, the part played by family labour in his workshops declines and becomes quite insignificant (for example, in the top grade of the top category, family workers constitute only % of the total number of workers). In other words, to the extent that the \u201chandicraft\u201d industries are so small that \u201cfamily co-operation\u201d predominates in them, this family co-operation is the surest guarantee of the development of capitalist co-operation. Here, consequently, stand out in full relief the dialectics of commodity production, which transform \u201cworking with our own hands\u201d into working with others\u2019 hands, into exploitation.\n\nLet us pass to the data on productivity of labour. The data on total output per worker in each grade show that with the increase in the size of the establishment labour productivity improves. This is to be observed in the overwhelming majority of the industries, and in all categories of industries without exception; the chart graphically illustrates this law, showing that the share of the top grade in total output is greater than is its share in the total number of workers; in the bottom grade the reverse is the case. The total output per worker in the establishments of the top grades is from  to  per cent higher than that in the bottom grade establishments. It is true that the big establishments usually have a longer working period and sometimes handle more valuable material than do the small ones, but these two circumstances cannot eliminate the fact that labour productivity is considerably higher in the big workshops than in the small ones.[] Nor can it be otherwise. The big establishments have from  to  times as many workers (family and hired combined) as the small ones, and co-operation on a larger scale cannot but increase the productivity of labour. The big workshops are always better equipped technically, they have better implements, tools, accessories, machines, etc. For example, in the brush industry, a \u201cproperly organised workshop\u201d must have as many as  workers, and in hook-making  to  workers. In the toy industry the majority of handicraftsmen make shift with ordinary stoves for drying their goods; the bigger toy-makers have special drying ovens, and the biggest makers have special drying premises. In metal toy-making,  makers out of  have special workshops, divided as follows: I)  have none; II)  have ; and III)  have . A total of  mirror and picture-frame makers have  special workshops, the figures by grades being: I)  have ; II)  have ; and III)  have . In the screen-plaiting industry screens are plaited by hand (in grade I), and woven mechanically (in grades II and III). In the tailoring industry the number of sewing-machines per owner according to grade is as follows: I) .; II) .; and III) ., etc., etc. In investigating the furniture industry, Mr. Isayev notes that the one-man business suffers the following disadvantages: ) lack of a complete set of tools; ) limited assortment of articles made, because there is no room in the craftsman\u2019s hut for bulky articles; ) much higher cost of materials when bought retail ( to % higher); ) necessity of selling wares cheaper, partly due to lack of confidence in the small \u201chandicraftsman\u201d and partly to his need of money.[] It is well known that exactly the same sort of thing is to be observed not only in the furniture industry, but also in the vast majority of small peasant industries. Lastly, it must be added that the value of the goods produced per worker not only increases from the bottom to the top grade in the majority of industries, but also from the small to the big industries. In the first category of industries the average output per worker is  rubles, in the second and third about  rubles, and in the fourth over  rubles (the figure  should, for the reason stated above, be increased by about fifty per cent). This circumstance points to the connection between the rise in the price of raw materials and the ousting of the small establishments by the big ones. Every step in the development of capitalist society is inevitably accompanied by a rise in the price of such materials as timber, etc., and thus hastens the doom of the small establishments.\n\nFrom the foregoing it follows that the relatively big capitalist establishments also play a tremendous part in the small peasant industries. While constituting a small minority of the total number of establishments, they concentrate, however, quite a big share of the total number of workers, and a still bigger share of the total output. Thus, in  industries of Moscow Gubernia, the top-grade establishments, constituting % of the total, account for % of the aggregate output; while the bottom-grade establishments, constituting % of the total, account for only % of the aggregate output. It goes without saying that the distribution of the net income from the industries must be far more uneven. The data of the Perm handicraft census of - clearly illustrate this. Selecting the largest establishments in  industries we get the following picture of the relations between the small and big establishments.[]\n\nRelations between small and big establishments.\nAn insignificant number of big establishments (less than / of the total number), which employ about / of the total number of workers, account for almost half the total output and nearly / of the total income (combining the workers\u2019 wages and the employers\u2019 incomes). The small proprietors obtain a net income considerably below the wages of the hired workers employed in the big establishments; elsewhere we have shown in detail that this phenomenon is no exception but is a general rule for small peasant industries.[]\n\nSumming up the conclusions that follow from the data we have analysed, we must say that the economic system of the small peasant industries is typically petty bourgeois, the same as that which we have seen among the small farmers. The expansion, development and improvement of the small peasant industries cannot take place in the present social and economic atmosphere except by generating a minority of small capitalists on the one hand, and a majority of wage-workers, or of \u201cindependent craftsmen\u201d who lead a harder and worse life than the wage-workers, on the other. We observe, consequently, in the smallest peasant industries the most pronounced rudiments of capitalism\u2014of that very capitalism which various economists of the Manilov[] type depict as something divorced from \u201cpeople\u2019s production.\u201d From the viewpoint of the home market theory the facts we have examined are also of no little importance. The development of small peasant industries leads to an expansion of the demand by the more prosperous industrialists for means of production and for labour-power, which is drawn from the ranks of the rural proletariat. The number of wage-workers employed by village artisans and small industrialists all over Russia should be quite impressive, if in the Perm Gubernia alone, for example, there are about ,.[]\n\nNotes\n[] Describing \u201chandicraft\u201d industry in Chernigov Gubernia, Mr. Varzer notes \u201cthe variety of economic units\u201d (on the one hand families with incomes from  to  rubles, and on the other, \u201calmost paupers\u201d) and makes the following observation: \u201cUnder such circumstances, the only way to present a full picture of the economic life of the craftsmen is to make a house-to-house inventory and to classify their establishments in a number of average types with all their accessories. Anything else will be either a fantasy of casual impressions or arm-chair exercises in arithmetical calculations based on a diversity of average norms. . . \u201c (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, Vol. V, p. ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vols. VI and VII. Industries of Moscow Gubernia, and A. Isayev\u2019s Industries of Moscow Gubernia, Moscow, -,  vols. For a small number of industries similar information is given in Industries of Vladimir Gubernia. It goes without saying that in the present chapter we confine ourselves to an examination of only those industries in which the small commodity-producers work for the market and not for buyers-up,\u2014at all events, in the overwhelming majority of cases. Work for buyers-up is a more complicated phenomenon, one that we shall examine separately later on. The house-to-house censuses of handicraftsmen who work for buyers-up are unsuitable for judging the relations existing among small commodity-producers.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] On these grounds the pottery \u201cindustry,\u201d in which  establishments employ , wage-workers, has been excluded. It is characteristic of the confusion of terms prevailing among us that the Moscow statisticians included this industry, too, among the \u201chandicraft\u201d industries (see combined tables in Part III of Vol. VII, loc. cit.).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See, for example, Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VI, Pt. , p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The same conclusion follows from the data regarding the Perm \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d, see our Studies, pp. -. (See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia.\u2014Ed.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For the starch-making industry, which is included in our tables, data are available on the duration of the working period in establishments of various sizes. It appears (as we have seen above) that even in an equal period the output per worker in a big establishment is higher than that in a small one.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The small producer tries to make up for these unfavourable conditions by working longer hours and with greater intensity (loc cit., p ). Under commodity production, the small producer both in agriculture and in industry carries on only by cutting down his requirements.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See our Studies, p. l and foll. (see present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia.\u2014Ed.) where data are given for each industry separately. Let us note that all these data refer to handicraftsmen cultivators who work for the market.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] From the data given in the text it can be seen that in the small peasant industries a tremendous, and even predominant, part is played by establishments with an output exceeding , rubles. Let us recall that in our official statistics establishments of this kind have always been, and still are, classed among \u201cfactories and works\u201d [cf. Studies, pp.  and  (see present edition, Vol, , \u201cOn the Question of Our Factory Statistics.\u201dEd.) and Chapter VII, \u00a7 II]. Thus, if we thought it permissible for an economist to use the current, traditional terminology beyond which our Narodniks have never gone, we would be entitled to establish the following \u201claw\u201d: among peasant \u201chandicraft\u201d establishments a predominant part is played by \u201cfactories and works,\u201d not included in official statistics because of their unsatisfactory nature.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us add that in other gubernias, besides Moscow and Perm, the sources note quite analogous relations among the small commodity producers. See, for instance, Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, Vol. II, house-to-house censuses of shoemakers and fullers; Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, Vol II\u2014on the wheelwrights of Medyn Uyezd; Vol. II\u2014on the sheepskin dressers of the same uyezd; Vol. III\u2014on the furriers of Arzamas Uyezd, Vol. IV\u2014on the fullers of Semyonov Uyezd and on the tanners of Vasil Uyezd, etc. Cf. Nizhni-Novgorod Handbook, Vol. IV, p. ,\u2014A. S. Gatsisky\u2019s general remarks about the small industries speak of the rise of big workshops. Cf, Annensky\u2019s report on the Pavlovo handicraftsmen (mentioned above), on the classification of families according to weekly earnings, etc. etc. All these sources differ from the house-to-house census data we have examined only in their incompleteness and poverty. The essence of the matter, however, is identical everywhere.\u2014Lenin\n\nV. Capitalist Simple Co-Operation\nThe establishment by small commodity-producers of relatively large workshops marks the transition to a higher form of industry. Out of scattered small production rises capitalist simple co-operation. \u201cCapitalist production only then really begins . . . when each individual capital employs simultaneously a comparatively large number of labourers; when consequently the labour-process is carried on an extensive scale and yields, relatively, large quantities of products. A greater number of labourers working together, at the same time, in one place (or, if you will, in the same field of labour), in order to produce the same sort of commodity under the mastership of one capitalist, constitutes, both historically and logically, the starting-point of capitalist production. With regard to the mode of production itself, manufacture, in its strict meaning, is hardly to be distinguished, in its earliest stages, from the artisan trades of the guilds, otherwise than by the greater number of workmen simultaneously employed by one and the same individual capital. The workshop of the medieval master handicraftsman is simply enlarged\u201d (Das Kapital, I, S. ).[]\n\nIt is this starting-point of capitalism that is to be seen, consequently, in our small peasant (\u201chandicraft\u201d) industries. The different historical situation (absence or slight development of guild handicrafts) merely changes the way in which identical capitalist relations are made manifest. The difference between the capitalist workshop and the workshop of the small industrialist lies at first only in the number of workers simultaneously employed. That is why the first capitalist establishments, being numerically in the minority, are submerged, as it were, in the general mass of small establishments. However, the employment of a larger number of workers inevitably leads to consecutive changes in production itself, to the gradual transformation of production. Under primitive hand technique differences between the individual workers (in strength, dexterity, skill, etc.) are always very considerable; if only for this reason the position of the small industrialist is extremely precarious; his dependence upon market fluctuations assumes the most burdensome forms. Where, however, several workers are employed in an establishment, the individual differences between them are smoothed out in the workshop itself: \u201cthe collective working day of a large number of workmen simultaneously employed . . . gives one day of average social labour,\u201d[] and as a consequence, the manufacture and sale of the products of the capitalist workshop acquire incomparably greater regularity and stability. It becomes possible to make fuller use of premises, warehouses, implements, instruments of labour, etc.; and this leads to a cheapening of production costs in the larger workshops.[] The organisation of production on a larger scale and the simultaneous employment of many workers require the accumulation of a fairly large capital, which is often formed, not in the sphere of production, but in the sphere of trade, etc. The size of this capital determines the form in which the proprietor himself takes part in the enterprise\u2014whether he himself is a worker, if his capital is still very small, or whether he gives up working himself and specialises in commercial and entrepreneur functions. \u201cOne can establish a connection between the position of the workshop owner and the number of his workers\u201dwe read, for example, in a description of the furniture industry. \u201cThe employment of  or  workers provides the proprietor with such a small surplus that he has to work alongside of them. . . . The employment of  workers already gives the proprietor enough to enable him to give up manual labour in some measure, to take it easy somewhat, and to engage mainly in the last two business functions\u201d (i.e., purchase of materials and sale of goods). \u201cAs soon as the number of wage-workers reaches  or exceeds this figure, the proprietor not only gives up manual labour but practically ceases to supervise his workers: he appoints a foreman for the purpose. . . . He now becomes a small capitalist, a \u2019born master\u2019\u201d (Isayev, Industries of Moscow Gubernia, I, -). The statistics we have cited graphically confirm this description, showing a decline in the number of family workers with the appearance of a considerable number of wage-workers.\n\nThe general significance of capitalist simple co-operation in the development of capitalist forms of industry is described by the author of Capital as follows:\n\n\u201cHistorically, however, this form is developed in opposition to peasant agriculture and to the carrying on of independent handicrafts whether in guilds or not. . . . Just as the social productive power of labour that is developed by co-operation, appears to be the productive power of capital, so co-operation itself, contrasted with the process of production carried on by isolated independent labourers, or even by small employers, appears to be a specific form of the capitalist process of production. It is the first change experienced by the actual labour-process, when subjected to capital. . . . The simultaneous employment of a large number of wage-labourers, in one and the same process, which is a necessary condition of this change, also forms the starting-point of capitalist production. . . . If then, on the one hand, the capitalist mode of production presents itself to us historically, as a necessary condition to the transformation of the labour-process into a social process, so, on the other hand, this social form of the labour-process presents itself, as a method employed by capital for the more profitable exploitation of labour, by increasing that labour\u2019s productiveness.\n\n\u201cIn the elementary form, under which we have hitherto viewed it, co-operation is a necessary concomitant of all production on a large scale, but it does not, in itself, represent a fixed form characteristic of a particular epoch in the development of the capitalist mode of production. At the most it appears to do so, and that only approximately, in the handicraft-like beginnings of manufacture. . .\u201d (Das Kapital, I, \u2013).[]\n\nWe shall see later how closely small \u201chandicraft\u201d establishments in Russia which employ wage-workers are connected with incomparably more highly developed and more widespread forms of capitalism. As for the role of these establishments in the small peasant industries, the statistics already given show that these establishments create fairly wide capitalist co-operation in place of the previous scattered production and considerably raise the productivity of labour.\n\nOur conclusion as to the tremendous role of capitalist co-operation in the small peasant industries and as to its progressive significance is in sharp contrast to the widespread Narodnik doctrine of the predominance of all sorts of manifestations of the \u201cartel principle\u201d in the small peasant industries. As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case; the distinguishing feature of small industry (and handicrafts) is the extremely scattered nature of the individual producers. In support of the contrary view Narodnik literature could advance nothing more than a collection of individual examples, the overwhelming majority of which do not apply to co-operation at all, but to temporary, miniature associations of masters, big and small, for the common purchase of raw materials, for the building of a common workshop, etc. Such artels do not in the least affect the predominant significance of capitalist co-operation.[] To obtain an exact idea of how widely the \u201cartel principle\u201d is actually applied it is not enough to cite examples taken at random here and there; it is necessary to take the data for some area which has been thoroughly investigated, and to examine the relative incidence and significance of the various forms of co-operation. Such, for example, are the data of the Perm \u201chandicrafts\u201d census of -; and we have shown elsewhere (Studies, pp. -[]) what an amazing dispersion of small industrialists was revealed by the census, and what importance attaches to the very few big establishments. The conclusion we have drawn as to the role of capitalist co-operation is based not on isolated examples, but on the precise data of the house-to-house censuses, which embrace scores of the most diverse industries in different localities.\n\nNotes\n[] For example, concerning the metal-beaters[] of Vladimir Gubernia, we read: \u201cWith the employment of a larger number of workers a considerable reduction in expenditure may be effected; this concerns expenditure on light, blocks, anvil-stone and casing\u201d (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, ). In the copper-beating industry of Perm Gubernia a one-man establishment needs a complete set of tools ( items); for two workers \u201ca very small addition\u201d is required. \u201cFor workshops employing  or  persons three or four sets of tools are required. . . . Only one lathe is kept even in a workshop employing  men\u201d (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, X, ). The fixed capital of a big workshop is estimated at  rubles, of a medium workshop at  rubles, and of a small one at  rubles; and the total output at , rubles, , rubles, and  rubles respectively. That is to say, in the small workshops the output is  times the amount of the fixed capital, in the medium ones  times, and in the big ones  times.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] We do not think it worth our while to support the statement made in the text with examples, a host of which may be found in Mr V. V.\u2019s The Artel in Handicraft Industry (St. Petersburg, ). Mr. Volgin has dealt with the true significance of the examples cited by Mr. V. V. (op. cit., p.  and foll.) and has shown the very negligible part played by the \u201cartel principle\u201d in our \u201chandicraft\u201d industry. Let us merely note the following assertion by Mr. V. V.: \u201c. . . the amalgamation of several independent handicraftsmen into one production unit . . . is not imperatively dictated by competition, as is proved by the absence in the majority of industries of workshops of any size employing wage-workers\u201d (). To advance such a bald and sweeping thesis is, of course, much easier than to analyse the house-to-house census data available on this question.\u2014Lenin\n\nVI. Merchant\u2019s Capital in the Small Industries\nAs we know, the small peasant industries in many cases give rise to special buyers-up, who are particularly engaged in the commercial operations of marketing products and purchasing raw materials, and who usually in one way or another subject the small tradesmen to themselves. Let us see what connection this phenomenon has with the general system of small peasant industries and what its significance is.\n\nThe principal economic operation of the buyer-up is to buy goods (finished products or raw materials) in order to resell them. In other words, the buyer-up is a representative of merchant\u2019s capital. The starting-point of all capital\u2014both industrial and merchant\u2019s\u2014is the accumulation of free money in the hands of individuals (by free money we mean that money which is not needed for personal consumption, etc.). How this property differentiation takes place in our rural districts has been shown in detail above by the data on the differentiation of the agricultural and the industrial peasantry. These data revealed one of the conditions giving rise to the appearance of the buyer-up, namely: the scattered nature, the isolation of the small producers, the existence of economic conflict and strife among them. Another condition relates to the character of the functions performed by merchant\u2019s capital, i.e., to the marketing of wares and to the purchase of raw materials. Where the development of commodity production is slight, the small producer limits himself to disposing of his wares in the small local market, sometimes even to disposing of them directly to the consumer. This is the lowest stage of the development of commodity production, hardly to be distinguished from artisan production. As the market expands, this petty, scattered marketing (which fully conforms to petty, scattered production) becomes impossible. In the big market, selling must he on a big, on a mass scale. And so the petty character of production proves to be in irreconcilable contradiction with the need for big, wholesale marketing. Under the existing social and economic conditions, with the isolation of the small producers and their differentiation, this contradiction could only be resolved by the well-to-do minority taking charge of marketing, concentrating it in their hands. By buying-up goods (or raw materials) on a large scale, the buyers-up thus cheapened marketing costs and transformed marketing from a petty, casual and irregular operation into a large and regular one; and this purely economic advantage of large-scale marketing inevitably led to the small producer finding himself cut off from the market and defenceless in face of the power of merchant\u2019s capital. Thus, under commodity economy, the small producer inevitably falls into dependence upon merchant\u2019s capital by virtue of the purely economic superiority of large, mass-scale marketing over scattered, petty marketing.[] It goes without saying that actually the profits of the buyers-up are often far from limited to the difference between the returns of mass sales and those of petty sales, just as the profits of the industrial capitalists often consist of deductions from normal wages. Nevertheless, to explain the profits of the industrial capitalists we must assume that labour-power is sold at its real value. Similarly, to explain the role of the buyer-up we must assume that he buys and sells goods in accordance with the general laws of commodity exchange. Only these economic causes of the domination of merchant\u2019s capital can provide the key to an understanding of the variety of forms which it assumes in real life, and among which we constantly meet (there can be no doubt of that) the plainest fraud. To proceed otherwise, as the Narodniks usually do, that is, to confine oneself to enumerating the various tricks of the \u201ckulaks,\u201d and on these grounds completely to brush aside the economic nature of the phenomenon would be to adopt the viewpoint of vulgar economics.[]\n\nTo substantiate our thesis concerning a necessary causal relation between small production for the market and the domination of merchant\u2019s capital, lot us deal in greater detail with one of the best descriptions of how the buyer-up appears and of the part he plays. We have in mind the investigation of the lace industry in Moscow Gubernia (Industries of Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VI, Pt. II). The \u201ctradeswomen\u201d came into being in the following way. In the s, when this industry first developed, and later, when the number of lace-makers was still small, the principal buyers were the landlords, the \u201cgentry\u201d. The consumer was in the neighbourhood of the producer. As the industry spread, the peasants began to send their lace to Moscow \u201cas chance offered,\u201d for example, through comb-makers. The inconvenience of this primitive form of marketing very soon made itself felt: \u201chow can a muzhik not engaged in this business go from house to house?\u201d The sale of the lace was entrusted to one of the lace-makers, who was compensated for the time she lost. \u201cShe also brought back thread for the lace.\u201d Thus the inconveniences of isolated marketing led to turning trade into a special function performed by one person who gathered the wares from many lace-makers. The patriarchal proximity of these women workers one to the other (relatives, neighbours, fellow-villagers, etc.) at first gave rise to attempts at the co-operative organisation of sales, to attempts at entrusting this function to one of the women workers. But money economy at once causes a breach in the age-old patriarchal relations, at once gives rise to the phenomena we noted above when examining the mass-scale data on the differentiation of the peasantry. Production for sale teaches that time is money. It becomes necessary to compensate the intermediary for her lost time and labour; she becomes accustomed to this occupation and begins to make it her profession. \u201cJourneys of this kind, repeated several times, gave rise to the tradeswoman type\u201d (loc. cit., ). The woman who has been to Moscow several times establishes the permanent connections which are so necessary for proper marketing. \u201cThus the need and habit of living on earnings from commission operations develops.\u201d In addition to commission earnings, the tradeswoman \u201cdoes what she can to advance the price of materials, paper, thread\u201d; she sells the lace above the set price and pockets the difference; the tradeswomen declare that the price received was less than the one agreed on: \u201ctake it or leave it,\u201d they say. \u201cThe tradeswomen begin . . . to bring goods from the towns and make a considerable profit.\u201d The commission agent thus becomes an independent trader who now begins to monopolise sales and to take advantage of her monopoly to subjugate the lace-makers completely. Usurious operations appear alongside commercial operations\u2014the lending of money to the lace-makers, the taking of goods from them at reduced prices, etc. \u201cThe girls . . . pay  kopeks per ruble as a commission for sales. . . . They know very well that the tradeswoman makes even more out of them by selling the lace at a higher price. But they simply do not knowhow to arrange things differently. When I suggested that they should take turns in going to Moscow, they replied that this would be worse, because they did not know where to sell the lace, whereas the tradeswoman already knew all the places. She sells the finished lace for them and brings back orders, materials, patterns, etc.; she always gives them money in advance, or on loan, and one can even sell her a piece of lace outright, should the need arise. Thus, on the one hand, the tradeswoman becomes a most needed, indispensable person; on the other, she gradually develops into a person who cruelly exploits the labour of others\u2014a woman kulak\u201d (). To this it should be added that such types develop from among the small producers themselves: \u201cHowever many enquiries we made, we found that all the tradeswomen had formerly been lace-makers themselves, and consequently, were familiar with the trade; they came from the ranks of these same lace-makers; they had had no capital to start with, and had only gradually begun to trade in calico and other goods, as they made money out of their commissions\u201d ().[] There can, therefore, be no doubt that under commodity economy, not only prosperous industrialists in general, but also, and particularly, representatives of merchant\u2019s capital emerge from among the small producers.[] And once they have emerged, the elimination of small, scattered marketing by large-scale, wholesale marketing becomes inevitable.[] Here are a few examples of how marketing is organised by the bigger \u201chandicraft\u201d proprietors who are at the same time buyers-up. The marketing of abacuses by craftsmen of Moscow Gubernia (see the statistics relating to them in our table; Appendix I) is done mainly at fairs all over Russia. To do business oneself at a fair one must have, firstly, a considerable amount of capital, as only wholesale trade is conducted at the fairs; and, secondly, one must have an agent to buy up wares where they are made, and to send them on to the merchant. These requirements are met \u201cby the one merchant-peasant,\u201d who is also a \u201ccraftsman,\u201d possesses a considerable amount of capital and engages in finishing the abacuses (i.e., fitting the frames and beads) and marketing them; his six sons are \u201cengaged exclusively in commerce,\u201d so that two persons have to be hired to cultivate the allotment. \u201cIt is not surprising,\u201d observes the investigator, \u201cthat he is able to sell his wares . . . at all the fairs, whereas the smaller traders usually sell theirs at nearby markets\u201d (Industries of Moscow Gubernia, VII, Pt. I, Sec. , p. ). In this case the representative of merchant\u2019s capital was still so little differentiated from the general mass of \u201cmuzhik cultivators\u201d that he even continued to retain his allotment farm and his large patriarchal family. The spectacle-frame makers of Moscow Gubernia are entirely dependent upon the industrialists to whom they sell their wares. These buyers-up are at the same time \u201ccraftsmen\u201d possessing their own workshops; they lend raw materials to the poor on condition that the finished articles are delivered to them, the \u201cmasters,\u201d etc. The small industrialists made an attempt to sell their wares in Moscow themselves, but failed; it did not pay to sell goods in small quantities amounting to a matter of  or  rubles (ibid., ). In the lace industry of Ryazan Gubernia the tradeswomen make profits amounting to  to % of the lace-makers\u2019 earnings. The \u201csubstantial\u201d tradeswomen have established regular-connections with marketing centres and send goods by mail, which saves travelling expenses. How necessary wholesale marketing is can be seen from the fact that the traders consider that even sales amounting to  and  rubles do not cover marketing expenses (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, VII, ). The marketing of Belyov lace is organised as follows. In the town of Belyov there are three grades of tradeswomen: ) The distributor, who hands out small orders, makes the round of the lace-makers herself and delivers the finished article to the bigger tradeswomen. ) The subcontractor, who places orders herself, or buys up goods from the distributors and delivers them to the big cities, etc. ) The big tradeswomen ( or  \u201cfirms\u201d), who do business with commission agents, to whom they send lace and from whom they receive big orders. It is \u201cpractically impossible\u201d for the provincial trades women to sell their goods to the big shops: \u201cthe shops prefer to do business with the wholesale buyers-up who deliver the wares in big quantities . . . of the most diverse patterns\u201d; the tradeswomen are obliged to sell to these \u201csuppliers\u201d; \u201cit is from them that they learn all the requirements of the market; it is they who fix prices; in short, but for them, there is no way out\u201d (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, X, pp. -). Numerous such examples could be given. But those given are quite sufficient to show how utterly impossible is small, scattered marketing where production is for big markets. In view of the scattered state of the small producers and of their complete differentiation[] large-scale marketing can only be organised by large capital, which, by virtue of this, reduces the handicraftsmen to a position of utter helplessness and dependence. One can therefore judge how absurd are the current Narodnik theories which recommend helping the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d by \u201corganising marketing.\u201d From the purely theoretical aspect such theories belong to the category of petty-bourgeois utopias, based on a failure to understand the indissoluble connection between commodity production and capitalist marketing.[] As for the facts of Russian reality, the authors of such theories simply ignore them: they ignore the scattered state of the small commodity-producers and their utter differentiation; they ignore the fact that it is from their very midst that \u201cbuyers-up\u201d have emerged and continue to emerge; that in capitalist society marketing can only be organised by big capital. It is natural that if one leaves out of account all these features of the unpleasant but undoubted reality, it is not difficult to conjure up phantasies[] ins Blaue hinein.[]\n\nWe are unable here to go into descriptive details showing exactly how merchant\u2019s capital manifests itself in our \u201chandicraft\u201d industries, and how helpless and wretched is the position in which it places the small industrialist. Moreover, in the next chapter we shall have to describe the dominance of merchant\u2019s capital at a higher stage of development, where (as an adjunct of manufacture) it organises capitalist domestic industry on a mass scale. Here let us confine ourselves to indicating the main forms assumed by merchant\u2019s capital in the small industries. The first and simplest form is the purchase of wares by the merchant (or owner of a big workshop) from the small commodity producers. Where buying-up is poorly developed, or where there are numerous competing buyers-up, the sale of goods to the merchant may not differ from any other sale; but in the vast majority of cases the local buyer-up is the only person to whom the peasant can regularly dispose of his wares, and then the buyer-up takes advantage of his monopoly position to force the price he pays to the producer down to rock bottom. The second form of merchant\u2019s capital consists in its combination with usury: the peasant, who is constantly in need of money, borrows it from the buyer-up and repays the debt with his goods. The sale of his goods in this case (which is very widespread) always takes place at artificially reduced prices, which often do not leave the handicraftsman as much as a wage-worker could get. Moreover, the relations of the creditor to the debtor inevitably lead to the personal dependence of the latter, to bondage, to the creditor taking advantage of specific occasions of the debtor\u2019s need, etc. The third form of merchant\u2019s capital is payment for wares with goods, a common practice among village buyers-up. The specific feature of this form is that it is typical not only of the small industries but of absolutely all undeveloped stages of commodity production and capitalism. Only large-scale machine industry, which has socialised labour and broken radically with all patriarchal usages, has eliminated this form of bondage by causing it to be legally prohibited in large industrial establishments. The fourth form of merchant\u2019s capital is payment by the merchant with the particular kinds of goods that are needed by the \u201chandicraftsman\u201d for production (raw or auxiliary materials, etc.). The sale of materials of production to the small industrialist may also be an independent operation of merchant\u2019s capital, quite analogous to the operation of buying-up finished goods. When, however, the buyer-up of finished goods begins to pay for them with the raw materials needed by the \u201chandicraftsman,\u201d this marks a very big step in the development of capitalist relations. Having cut off the small industrialist from the finished-goods market, the buyer-up now cuts him off from the raw-materials market, and thereby brings him completely under his sway. It is only one step from this form to that higher form of merchant\u2019s capital under which the buyer-up directly hands out materials to the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d to be worked up for a definite payment. The handicraftsman becomes de facto a wage-worker, working at home for the capitalist; the merchant\u2019s capital of the buyer-up is here transformed into industrial capital.[] Capitalist domestic industry arises. In the small industries it is met with more or less sporadically; its introduction on a mass scale, however, relates to the next and higher stage of capitalist development.\n\nNotes\n[] Regarding the significance of trading, merchant\u2019s capital in the development of capitalism in general we would refer the reader to Capital, Vol. III.

(Russ. trans., ) and S. - (Russ. trans., -), on the historical role of merchant\u2019s capital as necessary \u201cpremises for the development of capitalist production.\u201d[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The preconceived viewpoint of the Narodniks, who have idealised the \u201chandicraft\u201d industries and pictured merchant\u2019s capital as a sort of deplorable deviation and not as a necessary accessory to small production for the market is unfortunately reflected in statistical investigations. Thus, we have a number of house-to-house censuses of handicraftsmen (for Moscow, Vladimir and Perm Gubernias) which carefully investigated the business of each small industrialist, but ignored the business of the buyers-up, did not investigate how his capital is built up and what determines its magnitude, what are the sales\u2019 receipts and purchase costs of the buyer-up etc. Cf. our Studies, p.  (See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia.\u2014Ed.).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The emergence of buyers-up from among the small producers themselves is a common thing noted by investigators almost everywhere as soon as they touch upon this question. See, for example, the same remark about \u201cdistributors\u201d in the kid-glove industry (Industries of Moscow Gubernia, Vol. VII, Pt. II, pp. -), about the buyers-up in the Pavlovo industry (Grigoryev, loc. cit., ), and many others.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Korsak (Forms of Industry ) in his day quite rightly noted the connection between the unprofitableness of small-scale marketing (and of small-scale buying of raw materials) and the \u201cgeneral character of small scattered production\u201d (pp.  and ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Very often the big handicraft proprietors whom we discussed in detail above are also in some measure buyers-up. For instance, the purchase of the wares of small industrialists by big ones is a very widespread practice.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. V. V. asserts that the handicraftsman who is under the sway of merchant\u2019s capital \u201csuffers losses that are fundamentally quite superfluous\u201d (Essays on Handicraft Industry, ). Maybe Mr. V. V. imagines that the differentiation of the small producers is \u201cfundamentally\u201d a \u201cquite superfluous\u201d phenomenon, i.e., fundamentally as regards the commodity economy under which the small producer lives?\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cIt is not a matter of the kulak, but of the shortage of capital among the handicraftsmen,\u201d say the Perm Narodniks (A Sketch of the Condition of Handicraft Industry in Perm Gubernia, p. ). But what is a kulak if not a handicraftsman with capital? The trouble is just that the Narodniks refuse to investigate the process of differentiation of the small producers which yields entrepreneurs and \u201ckulaks\u201d from their ranks.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Among the quasi-economic arguments advanced in support of the Narodnik theories is the one about the small amount of \u201cfixed\u201d and \u201ccirculating\u201d capital needed by the \u201cindependent handicraftsman.\u201d The line of this extremely widespread argument is as follows: handicraft industries greatly benefit the peasant and therefore should be implanted. (We do not dwell on the amusing notion that the mass of the peasantry which is being steadily ruined can be helped by turning some of their number into small commodity-producers.) And in order to implant these industries one must know how much \u201ccapital\u201d the handicraftsman needs to carry on his business. Here is one of numerous calculations of this sort. The Pavlovo handicraftsman, says Mr. Grigoryev for our edification, needs a fixed \u201ccapital\u201d of  to  rubles, -- rubles, etc., counting cost of implements, and a circulating \u201ccapital\u201d of  to  rubles, counting weekly expenditure on food and raw materials. \u201cThus, the amount of the fixed and circulating capital (sic !) in Pavlovo District is so small that it is very easy to acquire the tools and materials needed for independent (sic !!) production\u201d (loc. cit., ). And indeed, what could be \u201ceasier\u201d than such an argument? With a stroke of the pen the Pavlovo proletarian is turned into a \u201ccapitalist\u201d; all that was needed was to call his weekly keep and miserably cheap tools \u201ccapital.\u201d But the real capital of the big buyers-up who have monopolised sales, who alone are able to be \u201cindependent\u201d de facto, and who handle capital running into the thousands this real capital the author simply passes over! Queer people, indeed, these well-to-do Pavlovians: for generations they have used, and continue to use, every foul means to pile up thousands of rubles of capital, whereas according to the latest discoveries it seems that a \u201ccapital\u201d of a few dozen rubles is sufficient to make one \u201cindependent\u201d!\u2014Lenin\n\nVII. \u201cIndustry And Agriculture\u201d\nSuch is the usual heading of special sections in descriptions of peasant industries. In view of the fact that at the initial stage of capitalism which we are examining the industrialist has hardly yet become differentiated from the peasant, his connection with the land is something indeed highly characteristic and requires special examination.\n\nLet us begin with the data given in our table (see Appendix I). To characterise the farms of the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d there are given here, firstly, data on the average number of horses owned by the industrialists of each grade. By combining the  industries for which such data are available we get an all-round average per industrialist (master or petty master) of . horses, and for the grades: I) .; II) . and III) .. Thus the higher the proprietor\u2019s position in respect to the size of his industrial establishment, the higher his position as an agriculturist. The biggest industrialists have almost twice as many draught animals as the small ones. But with regard to their farms even the smallest industrialists (grade I) are above the middle peasantry, for the general average for Moscow Gubernia in  was . horses per peasant household.[] Thus it is only the relatively prosperous peasants who become master and petty-master industrialists. The poor peasants, on the other hand, do not, in the main, provide master industrialists but worker industrialists (wage-workers employed by \u201chandicraftsmen,\u201d migratory workers, etc.). Unfortunately, for the overwhelming majority of Moscow industries no data are available on the farms of the wage-workers engaged in small industries. An exception is the hat industry (see general data on it in our table, Appendix I). Here are exceedingly instructive data on the farms of master hat-makers and worker hat-makers.\n\nMaster hat-makers and worker hat-makers.\nThus, the master industrialists belong to the category of very \u201csound\u201d farmers, i.e., are members of the peasant bourgeoisie, whereas the wage-workers are recruited from the mass of ruined peasants.[] Still more important for characterising the relations described are the data on the methods by which the master industrialists cultivate their land. The Moscow investigators distinguished three methods of cultivating the soil: ) by means of the personal labour of the householder; ) by \u201chiring,\u201d i.e., by hiring some neighbour who tills the land of the \u201cdistressed\u201d householder with his own implements. This method of cultivation is characteristic of the poor peasant who is being steadily ruined. Of opposite significance is the third method, namely, cultivation with the aid of a \u201clabourer,\u201d i.e., the hire of agricultural (\u201cland\u201d) labourers by the farmer. These workers are usually hired for the whole summer; and, particularly in the busy season, the master usually reinforces them with employees from his workshop. \u201cThus, the method of cultivating the soil with the aid of the \u2019land\u2019 labourer is quite a profitable one\u201d (Industries of Moscow Gubernia, VI, I, ). In our table we have assembled the data on this method of cultivation for  industries, in  of which there are no masters who hire \u201cland labourers.\u201d In all these  industries the master industrialists who hire rural labourers constitute % of the total, and by grades: I) .%; II) .% and III) .%. The better off the industrialists are, the more often we find rural entrepreneurs among them. The analysis of the data on the industrial peasantry consequently reveals the same picture of parallel differentiation in both industry and agriculture that we observed in Chapter II on the basis of the data on the agricultural peasantry.\n\nThe hiring of \u201cland labourers\u201d by \u201chandicraft\u201d masters is very widespread in all the industrial gubernias. We meet, for example, with references to the hiring of agricultural labourers by the rich bast-matting makers of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia. The furriers of the same gubernia hire agricultural labourers, who usually come from the purely agricultural surrounding villages. The \u201cvillage-community peasants of Kimry Volost engaged in the boot industry find it profitable to hire for the cultivation of their fields men and women labourers who come to Kimry in large numbers from Tver Uyezd and neighbouring . . . localities.\u201d The pottery decorators of Kostroma Gubernia send their wage-workers, when not occupied at their regular jobs, to work in the fields.[] \u201cThe independent masters\u201d (metal-beaters of Vladimir Gubernia) \u201ckeep special field workers\u201d; that is why their fields are well cultivated, although they themselves \u201cquite often can neither plough nor mow.\u201d[] In Moscow Gubernia, the hiring of \u201cland labourers\u201d is resorted to by many industrialists apart from those about whom data are given in our table; for example, pin-makers, felt-makers and toy-makers send their workers to jobs in the fields too; the glass-bead-makers, metal-beaters, button makers, cap-makers and harness-makers employ agricultural labourers, etc.[] The significance of this fact\u2014the hiring of agricultural workers by peasant industrialists\u2014is very great. It shows that even in the small peasant industries the phenomenon characteristic of all capitalist countries is beginning to be manifested, and that goes to confirm the progressive historical role of capitalism, namely, a rise in the standard of living of the population, an increase in its requirements. The industrialist is beginning to look down upon the \u201craw\u201d agriculturist with his coarse patriarchal manners and is trying to rid himself of the hardest and worst-paid agricultural jobs. In the small industries, in which capitalism is least developed, this is to be observed very slightly as yet; the industrial worker is only just beginning to be differentiated from the agricultural worker. In the succeeding stages of development of capitalist industry this phenomenon, as we shall see, is to be observed on a mass scale.\n\nThe importance of the \u201ctie between agriculture and industry\u201d compels us to review in greater detail the data relating to other gubernias besides Moscow.\n\nNizhni-Novgorod Gubernia. Among the mass of bast-matting makers agriculture is on the decline, and they are neglecting the land; about / of the winter-crop area and / of the spring-crop area are \u201cwasteland.\u201d For the \u201cwell to-do muzhiks,\u201d however, \u201cthe land is no longer a wicked stepmother, but a mother bountiful\u201d: they have enough animals, they have manure, they rent land, they try to keep their strips out of the periodical redistribution and tend them better. \u201cNow the wealthy muzhik has become a landlord while the other muzhik, the poor one, is in serf dependence name=fnp> upon him\u201d (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, III, ). The furriers \u201care bad farmers,\u201d but here too we must single out the bigger proprietors who \u201crent land from their poor fellow-villagers,\u201d etc. The following is a summary of typical budgets of furriers of different groups:\n\nTypical budgets of furriers of different groups.\n[]\n\n[]\n\nThe parallel process of differentiation of the agriculturists and industrialists stands out here in bold relief. Concerning the blacksmiths, the investigator says that \u201cindustry is more important than agriculture\u201d for the rich masters, on the one hand, and for the \u201clandless\u201d labourers, on the other (ibid., IV, ).\n\nIn Industries of Vladimir Gubernia the question of the relation between industry and agriculture is dealt with much more thoroughly than in any other work of investigation. For a whole number of industries precise data are given on the farms, not only of \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d in general (such \u201caverage\u201d figures, as is clear from all the aforesaid, are quite fictitious), but of the various grades and groups of \u201chandicraftsmen,\u201d such as: big masters, small masters, wage-workers; workroom owners and weavers; master industrialists and the rest of the peasantry; households engaged in local and in outside industries, etc. The general conclusion drawn by Mr. Kharizomenov from these data is that if the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d are divided into three categories, viz.\u2014) big industrialists; ) small and medium industrialists; ) wage-workers, there is to be observed a deterioration of agriculture as from the first category to the third, a diminution in the amount of land and animals, an increase in the proportion of \u201cdistressed\u201d farms, etc.[] Unfortunately, Mr. Kharizomenov examined these data too restrictedly and one-sidedly, and paid no attention to the parallel and independent process of the differentiation of the peasant agriculturists. That is why he failed to draw from these data the conclusion that inevitably follows from them, namely, that the peasantry both in agriculture and in industry are splitting up into a petty bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat.[] That is why, in describing the different industries, he quite often sinks to the traditional Narodnik arguments about the influence of \u201cindustry\u201d in general over \u201cagriculture\u201d in general (see, for example, Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, II, ; III, ), i.e., to the ignoring of the profound contradictions in the very system of both industry and agriculture, the existence of which he himself was obliged to admit. Another investigator of the industries of Vladimir Gubernia, Mr. V. Prugavin, is a typical spokesman of the Narodnik views on this subject. Here is a sample of his reasoning. The cotton-weaving industry in Pokrov Uyezd \u201ccannot be regarded at all as a harmful factor (sic !!) in the agricultural life of the weavers\u201d (IV, ). The data testify to the poor farms of the mass of weavers, and to the fact that among the workroom owners, farming is conducted at a level far above the general (ibid.); from the tables it is evident that some workroom owners hire agricultural labourers too. Conclusion: \u201cindustry and agriculture march hand in hand, conditioning each other\u2019s development and prosperity\u201d (). A fine specimen of the phrases used to obscure the fact that the development and prosperity of the peasant bourgeoisie go hand in hand both in industry and in agriculture.[]\n\nThe data of the Perm handicraft census of - revealed the same thing: it is among the small commodity-producers (masters and petty masters) that the level of agriculture is highest and rural labourers are met with; among the artisans agriculture is on a lower level, while among the craftsmen who work for buyers-up the condition of agriculture is worst (as to the agriculture of the wage-workers and of various groups of masters, no data, unfortunate]y, have been gathered). The census also revealed that the \u201chandicraftsmen\u201d who do not engage in agriculture differ from those who do in that ) their labour productivity is higher, ) their net incomes from industry are incomparably higher, and ) their level of culture and literacy is higher. All these are evidences which confirm the conclusion drawn above, namely, that even the initial stage of capitalism manifests the tendency of industry to raise the population\u2019s standard of living (see Studies, p.  and foll.).[]\n\nLastly, the following point is connected with the question of the relation of industry to agriculture. The larger establishments usually have a longer working period. For example, in the furniture industry of Moscow Gubernia, the working period of those working in plain wood equals  months (the average workshop staff here is . workers); for the bent-wood establishments it is  months (. workers per establishment), and in the heavy-furniture trade it is  months (. workers per establishment). In the shoe industry of Vladimir Gubernia the working period in  small workshops equals  weeks, and that in  large ones (. workers per establishment, as against . in the small workshops)  weeks, etc.[] Naturally, this fact is connected with the large number of workers (family, hired industrial and hired agricultural) in the big establishments and explains the great stability of these establishments and their tendency to specialise in industrial activities.\n\nLet us now sum up the data given above on \u201cindustry and agriculture.\u201d It is usual at the lower stage of capitalism which we are reviewing for the industrialist still to be scarcely differentiated from the peasant. The combination of industry with agriculture plays an extremely important part in aggravating and accentuating the differentiation of the peasantry: the prosperous and the well-off peasants open workshops, hire workers from among the rural proletariat, and accumulate money for commercial and usurious transactions. The peasant poor, on the other hand, provide the wage-workers, the handicraftsmen who work for buyers-up, and the bottom groups of petty-master handicraftsmen, those most crushed by the power of merchant\u2019s capital. Thus, the combination of industry with agriculture consolidates and develops capitalist relations, spreading them from industry to agriculture and vice versa.[] That characteristic feature of capitalist society, the separation of industry from agriculture, manifests itself at this stage in the most rudimentary form, but it does manifest itself and\u2014what is particularly important\u2014in a way totally different from what the Narodniks imagine. When the Narodnik says that industry does no \u201cdamage\u201d to agriculture, he discerns damage in the abandonment of agriculture for profitable industry. But such a notion is an invention (and not a deduction from the facts), and a bad invention at that, for it ignores the contradictions which permeate the entire economic system of the peasantry. The separation of industry from agriculture takes place in connection with the differentiation of the peasantry, and does so by different paths at the two poles of the countryside: the well-to-do minority open industrial establishments, enlarge them, improve their farming methods, hire farm labourers to till the land, devote an increasing part of the year to industry, and\u2014at a certain stage of the development of the industry\u2014find it more convenient to separate their industrial from their agricultural undertakings, i.e., to hand over the farm to other members of the family, or to sell farm buildings, animals, etc., and adopt the status of burghers, of merchants.[] The separation of industry from agriculture is preceded in this case by the formation of entrepreneur relations in agriculture. At the other pole of the countryside the separation of industry from agriculture consists in the fact that the poor peasants are being ruined and turned into wage-workers (industrial and agricultural). At this pole of the countryside it is not the profitableness of industry, but need and ruin, that compels the peasant to abandon the land, and not only the land but also independent industrial labour; here the process of the separation of industry from agriculture is one of the expropriation of the small producer.\n\nNotes\n[] See Combined Statistical Material on the Economic Position of the Rural Population, published by the Committee of Ministers, Appendix I: Data of Zemstvo house-to-house investigations, pp. -.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It is characteristic that the author of the description of the hat industry \u201cdid not observe\u201d even here the differentiation of the peasantry both in agriculture and in industry. Like all Narodniks, he limited himself in his conclusions to the absolutely vapid banality that \u201cindustry does not prevent one from engaging in agriculture\u201d (Industries of Moscow Gubernia, VI, I, p. ) The social and economic contradictions both in the system of industry and in the system of agriculture were thus safely passed over.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, III, , ; VIII, ; IX, , , .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, III, , .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Industries of Moscow Gubernia, loc. cit.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Transactions of the Handicraft Commission, III, , and foll. The figures are approximate and have been arrived at on the author\u2019s estimate as to how long the family\u2019s own grain suffices.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \"*\" DUPLICATE (see above footnote).\n\n[] See Yuridichesky Vestnik [The Legal Messenger ], , Vol. XIV, Nos.  and .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] How near Mr. Kharizomonov was to drawing such a conclusion may be seen from the following description of post-Reform economic development which he gives in speaking of the silk trade: \u201cSerfdom evened out the economic level of the peasantry: it tied the hands of the rich peasant, sustained the poor peasant and prevented the family division of property. Natural economy narrowed too much the arena for commercial and industrial activity. The local market did not provide sufficiently wide scope for enterprise. The peasant merchant or industrialist accumulated money\u2014without risk, it is true, but very slowly\u2014accumulated it and put it away in his chest. Beginning with the s conditions change. Serfdom comes to an and, credit and the railways, by creating an extensive and distant market, provide scope for the enterprising peasant merchant and industrialist. All those who have been above the average economic level quickly get on their feet, develop trade and industry and extend their exploiting activities quantitatively and qualitatively. All those who have been below that level fall, sink, drop into the ranks of the landless, the non-farming, the horseless. The peasantry split up into the groups of kulaks, semi-prosperous peasants and farmless proletariat. The kulak element of the peasantry rapidly copy all the habits of a cultured milieu;name=p> they live in grand style, and from them a huge class is formed of the semi-cultured sections of Russian society\u201d (III, , ).[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. V. V. confines himself to the same sort of phrases in dealing with this subject in Chapter VIII of his Essays on Handicraft Industry. \u201cFarming . . . is sustained by industry\u201d (). \u201cHandicraft industries are one of the most reliable mainstays of agriculture in the industrial gubernias\u201d (). Proof? Any amount: take, for example, the master tanners, starch-makers, oil-millers (ibid., ), etc, and you will find that their farming is on a higher level than that of the masses!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See present edition, Vol. , The Handicraft Census of - in Perm Gubernia.\u2014Ed.\n\n[] Sources are indicated above. The same thing is revealed by the household censuses of the basket-makers, guitar-makers and starch-makers in Moscow Gubernia. The Perm handicraft census also mentions the longer working period of the large workshops (see Sketch of Handicraft Industry in Perm Gubernia, p. . No precise data, unfortunately, are given).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For instance, in the woollen trade of Vladimir Gubernia the big \u201cfactory owners\u201d and subcontractors are distinguished by the fact of their farming being on the highest level. \u201cDuring periods of stagnation in production the subcontractors try to buy estates, to engage in farming, and to give up industry altogether\u201d (Industries of Vladimir Gubernia, II, ). This instance is worth noting, since facts of this kind sometimes lead the Narodniks to conclude that \u201cthe peasants are going back to agriculture,\u201d that the \u201cexiles from the soil must be restored to the land\u201d (Mr. V. V. in Vestnik Yevropy, No. , ).\u2014Lenin\n\nVIII. \u201cThe Combination Of Industry With Agriculture\u201d\nSuch is the favourite Narodnik formula with the aid of which Messrs. V. V., N.-on and Co. hope to solve the problem of capitalism in Russia. \u201cCapitalism\u201d separates industry from agriculture; \u201cpeople\u2019s production\u201d combines them in the typical and normal peasant farm\u2014in this ingenuous contra-position lies a good part of their theory. We are now in a position to sum up as regards the question of how in reality our peasantry \u201ccombine industry with agriculture,\u201d since a detailed examination has been made above of the typical relations existing among the agricultural and among the industrial peasantry. Let us enumerate the diverse forms of the \u201ccombination of industry with agriculture\u201d to be observed in the economics of Russian peasant farming.\n\n) Patriarchal (natural) agriculture is combined with domestic industries (i.e., with the working up of raw materials for home consumption) and with corv\u00e9e service for the landowner.\n\nThis form of combining peasant \u201cindustries\u201d with agriculture is most typical of the medieval economic regime, of which it is an essential component.[] In post-Reform Russia all that is left of such patriarchal economy\u2014in which there is as yet absolutely no capitalism, commodity production, or commodity circulation\u2014is vestiges in the shape of the domestic industries of the peasants and labour-service.\n\n) Patriarchal agriculture is combined with industry in the form of artisan production.\n\nThis form of combination is still very close to the preceding one, differing from it only in that here commodity circulation manifests itself\u2014when the artisan is paid in money and appears on the market to purchase tools, raw materials, etc.\n\n) Patriarchal agriculture is combined with the small-scale production of industrial products for the market, i.e., with commodity production in industry. The patriarchal peasant is transformed into a small commodity-producer, who, as we have shown, tends to the employment of wage-labour, i.e., to capitalist production. A condition for this transformation is now a certain degree of differentiation among the peasantry: we have seen that the small masters and petty masters in industry belong, in the majority of cases, to the prosperous or to the well-off group of peasants. In its turn, the development of small commodity production in industry gives a further impetus to the differentiation of the peasant agriculturists.\n\n) Patriarchal agriculture is combined with work for hire in industry (and also in agriculture).[]\n\nThis form is a necessary addition to the preceding one: there it is the product that becomes a commodity, here it is labour-power. Small-scale commodity production in industry is necessarily accompanied, as we have seen, by the appearance of wage-workers and of handicraftsmen who work for buyers-up. This form of the \u201ccombination of agriculture with industry\u201d is characteristic of all capitalist countries, and one of the most striking features of the post-Reform history of Russia is the extremely rapid and extremely wide incidence of this form.\n\n) Petty-bourgeois (commercial) agriculture is combined with petty-bourgeois industries (small commodity production in industry, petty trade, etc.).\n\nThe difference between this form and the third is that here petty-bourgeois relations embrace not only industry but also agriculture. Being the most typical form of the combination of industry with agriculture in the economy of the small rural bourgeoisie, this form is therefore characteristic of all capitalist countries. The honour of discovering a capitalism without a petty bourgeoisie fell to the Russian Narodnik economists alone.\n\n) Wage-labour in agriculture is combined with wage-labour in industry. We have already discussed how such a combination of industry and agriculture manifests itself and what it signifies.\n\nThus, the forms of the \u201ccombination of agriculture with industry\u201d among our peasantry are extremely varied: there are those which express the most primitive economic system with the dominance of natural economy; there are those which express a high development of capitalism; there are a whole number of transitional stages between the former and the latter. By confining oneself to general formulas such as: the \u201ccombination of industry with agriculture,\u201d or the \u201cseparation of industry from agriculture\u201d), one can not advance a single step in explaining the actual process of development of capitalism.\n\nNotes\n[] Korsak, in Chapter IV of the book mentioned above, cites historical evidence of the following nature, for example: \u201cthe abbot gave out (in the village) flax for spinning\u201d; the peasants were bound to yield to the landowner \u201cwork or wares,\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] As has been shown above, such confusion of terminology prevails in our economic literature and economic statistics that the category peasants\u2019 \u201cindustries\u201d is used to cover domestic industry, labour-service, handicrafts, small commodity production, trading, work for hire in industry, work for hire in agriculture, etc. Here is an example of how the Narodniks take advantage of this confusion. Mr. V. V., singing the praises of the \u201ccombination of industry with agriculture,\u201d points, in illustration, to the \u201ctimber industry\u201d and \u201cunskilled labour\u201d: \u201cHe (the peasant) is strong and accustomed to hard work; that is why he can do all kinds of unskilled labour\u201d (Essays on Handicraft Industry, ). And this sort of fact figures among a heap of others to back the conclusion that: \u201cWe observe a protest against the splitting-up of occupations,\u201d \u201cthe durability of the organisation of production that arose when natural economy still predominated\u201d (). Thus, even the conversion of the peasant into a lumberworker and unskilled labourer was passed off, among other things, as evidence of the durability of natural economy!\u2014Lenin\n\nIX. Some Remarks on the Pre-Capitalist Economy of Our Countryside\nThe essence of the problem of \u201cthe destiny of capitalism in Russia\u201d is often presented as though prime importance attaches to the question: how fast ? (i.e., how fast is capitalism developing?). Actually, however, far greater importance attaches to the question: how exactly ? and to the question: where from ? (i.e., what was the nature of the pre-capitalist economic system in Russia?). The principal errors of Narodnik economics are the false replies given to precisely these two questions, i.e., in a wrong presentation of exactly how capitalism is developing in Russia, in a false idealisation of the pre-capitalist order. In Chapter II (and partly in Chapter III) and in the present one we have examined the most primitive stages of capitalism in small-scale agriculture and in the small peasant industries; in doing so we could not avoid many references to the features of the pre-capitalist order. If we now try to summarise these features we shall arrive at the conclusion that the pre-capitalist countryside constituted (from the economic point of view) a network of small local markets which linked up tiny groups of small producers, severed from each other by their separate farms, by the innumerable medieval barriers between them, and by the remnants of medieval dependence.\n\nAs to the scattered nature of the small producers, it stands out in boldest relief in their differentiation both in agriculture and in industry, which we established above. But their fragmentation is far from being confined to this. Although united by the village community into tiny administrative, fiscal and land-holding associations, the peasants are split up by a mass of diverse divisions into grades, into categories according to size of allotment, amount of payments, etc. Let us take, for example, the Zemstvo statistical returns for Saratov Gubernia; there the peasants are divided into the following grades: gift-land, owner, full owner and state peasants, state peasants with community holdings, state peasants with quarter holdings,[] state peasants that formerly belonged to landlords, appanage, state-land tenant, and landless peasants, owners who were formerly landlords\u2019 peasants, peasants whose farmsteads have been redeemed, owners who are former appanage peasants, colonist freeholder, settler, gift-land peasants who formerly belonged to landlords, owners who were former state peasants, manumitted, those who did not pay quitrent, free tiller,[] temporarily bound, former factory-bound, etc.; further, there are registered peasants, migrant, etc. All these grades differ in the history of their agrarian relations, in size of allotments, amount of payments, etc., etc. And within the grades there are innumerable differences of a similar kind: sometimes even the peasants of one and the same village are divided into two quite distinct categories: \u201cMr. X\u2019s former peasants\u201d and \u201cMrs. Y\u2019s former peasants.\u201d All this diversity was natural and necessary in the Middle Ages, in the remote past; at the present time, however, the preservation of the social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant communities is a crying anachronism and greatly worsens the conditions of the toiling masses, while at the same time not in the least safeguarding them against the burdens of the new, capitalist era. The Narodniks usually shut their eyes to this fragmentation, and when the Marxists express the view that the splitting up of the peasantry is progressive, the Narodniks confine themselves to hackneyed outcries against \u201csupporters of land dispossession,\u201d thereby covering up the utter fallacy of their views about the pre-capitalist countryside. One has only to picture to oneself the amazing fragmentation of the small producers, an inevitable consequence of patriarchal agriculture, to become convinced of the progressiveness of capitalism, which is shattering to the very foundations the ancient forms of economy and life, with their age-old immobility and routine, destroying the settled life of the peasants who vegetated behind their medieval partitions, and creating new social classes striving of necessity towards contact, unification, and active participation in the whole of the economic (and not only economic) life of the country, and of the whole world.\n\nIf we take the peasants who are handicraftsmen or small industrialists we shall find the same thing. Their interests do not transcend the bounds of the small area of surrounding villages. Owing to the insignificant area covered by the local market they do not come into contact with the industrialists of other districts; they are in mortal terror of \u201ccompetition,\u201d which ruthlessly destroys the patriarchal paradise of the small handicraftsmen and industrialists, who live lives of stagnant routine undisturbed by anybody or anything. With respect to these small industrialists, competition and capitalism perform a useful historical function by dragging them out of their backwoods and confronting them with all the issues that already face the more developed strata of the population.\n\nA necessary attribute of the small local markets is, apart from primitive forms of artisan production, primitive forms of merchant\u2019s and usury capital. The more remote a village is, the further away it is from the influence of the new capitalist order, from railways, big factories and large-scale capitalist agriculture, the greater the monopoly of the local merchants and usurers, the more they subjugate the surrounding peasantry, and the cruder the forms of this subjugation. The number of these small leeches is enormous (when compared with the meagre produce of the peasants), and there is a rich variety of local names to designate them. Recall all these \u201cprasols,\u201d \u201cshibais,\u201d \u201cshchetinniks,\u201d \u201cmayaks,\u201d \u201civashes,\u201d \u201cbulinyas,\u201d etc., etc. The predominance of natural economy, which accounts for the scarcity and dearness of money in the countryside, results in the assumption of an importance by all these \u201ckulaks\u201d out of all proportion to the size of their capital. The dependence of the peasants on the money owners inevitably acquires the form of bondage. Just as one cannot conceive of developed capitalism without large-scale merchant\u2019s capital in the form of commodities or money so the pre-capitalist village is inconceivable without small traders and buyers-up, who are the \u201cmasters\u201d of the small local markets. Capitalism draws these markets together, combines them into a big national market, and then into a world market, destroys the primitive forms of bondage and personal dependence, develops in depth and in breadth the contradictions which in a rudimentary form are also to be observed among the community peasantry\u2014and thus paves the way for their resolution.\n[] State peasants with quarter holdings \u2013 the name given in tsarist Russia to the category of former state peasants, descendants of lower-rank servicemen who in the th to th centuries were settled in the border lands of the state of Muscovy. For their services in guarding the state frontiers the settlers (Cossacks musketeers, soldiers) were given the use of small plots of land either temporarily or in perpetuity. The area of such a plot amounted to a so-called quarter [. acres]. From the year  such settlers were called odnodvortsi [i.e., those possessing only their own farmsteads and no community land]. Formerly they enjoyed various kinds of privileges and had the right to own peasants, but during the th century were gradually deprived of these rights and reduced to the status of ordinary peasants. By a regulation of  the quarter lots were recognised as the private property of the former quarter-lot peasants and their descendants. [p.]\n\n[] Free tillers \u2013 the category of peasants freed from serf dependence by the law of February , . This law permitted landlords themselves to decide the terms on which they freed the peasants from the land. [p.]\n\n",
    "1895-1899": " Referring, in Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. , , to a comment by Mr. Minsky on the \u201cdialectical materialists,\u201d Mr. Mikhailovsky says: \u201cHe\u201d (Mr. Minsky) \u201cmust know that these people do not acknowledge any continuity with the past and emphatically renounce the heritage\u201d (p. ) \u2014 that is, the \u201cheritage of the -s,\u201d which Mr. V. Rozanov solemnly renounced in  in Moskovskiye Vedomosti (p. ).\n\nMr. Mikhailovsky\u2019s statement about the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d is a falsehood. True, he is not the only, and not the independent, author of the falsehood that \u201cthe Russian disciples renounce the heritage\u201d\u2014it has been reiterated for quite a longtime now by practically all the representatives of the liberal-Narodnik press when fighting the \u201cdisciples.\u201d As far as we remember, when Mr. Mikhailovsky began his fierce war on the \u201cdisciples\u201d he had not yet invented this falsehood but others had done so before him. Later he, too, chose to seize upon it. The further the \u201cdisciples\u201d developed their views in Russian literature, the more minutely and thoroughly they set forth their opinions on a number of issues, both theoretical and practical, the more rarely did one find the hostile press objecting in substance to the fundamental tenets of the new trend, to the view that Russian capitalism is progressive, that the Narodnik idealisation of the small producer is absurd, that the explanation of trends of social thought and of legal and political institutions must be sought in the material interests of the various classes of Russian society. These fundamental tenets were hushed up, it was\u2014and still is\u2014thought best to say nothing about them, but fabrications to discredit the new trend were con-coded with all the greater fertility. One of these fabrications\u2014\u201dshabby fabrications\u201d\u2014-is the modish phrase that \u201cthe Russian disciples renounce the heritage,\u201d that they have broken with the best traditions of the best, the most progressive section of Russian society, that they have severed the democratic thread, etc., etc., and all the many other ways in which this is expressed. The fact that such phrases are so widely used prompts us to undertake a detailed examination and refutation of them. In order that our exposition may not appear unsupported, we shall begin by drawing an historico-literary parallel between two \u201cessayists of the countryside,\u201d chosen in order to describe the \u201cheritage.\u201d Let us say in advance that we shall confine ourselves exclusively to economic and social questions, that of the \u2018heritage,\u201d we shall examine only these, leaving aside philosophical, literary, aesthetic and other problems.\n\nI\nOne Representative Of The \u201cHeritage\u201d\nThirty years ago, in , Otechestvenniye Zapiski[] began publishing a series of essays by Skaldin, under the title In the Backwoods and in the Capital. The essays appeared over a period of three years, -. In  the author gathered them together in a single volume bearing the same title.[] A perusal of this book, now almost forgotten, is extremely instructive from the angle of the subject under discussion, i.e., the relation in which the representatives of the \u201cheritage\u201d stand to the Narodniks and the \u201cRussian disciples.\u201d The title of the book is inaccurate. The author himself was conscious of this, and he explains in a foreword that his theme is the attitude of the \u201ccapital\u201d to the \u201ccountryside,\u201d in other words, that his book is a series of social essays on rural conditions, and that he does not propose to speak of the capital specifically. Or rather, he might have proposed to do so, but does not find it expedient: \u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc (for I will not write as I may, and may not write as I will), Skaldin says, borrowing the words of a Greek writer to explain the inexpediency.\n\nLet us give a brief exposition of Skaldin\u2019s views.\n\nWe shall begin with the peasant Reform[]\u2014that initial point from which all who wish to expound their general views on economic and social problems must, even to this day, inevitably begin. Very much space is devoted to the peasant Reform in Skaldin\u2019s book. He was perhaps the first writer who\u2014on a broad basis of fact and a detailed examination of all aspects of life in the countryside\u2014systematically showed the poverty-stricken state of the peasants after the Reform, the deterioration of their conditions, the new forms of their subjection, economic, legal and in daily life\u2014the first, in a word, to show all that has since been elucidated and demonstrated in such detail and thoroughness in numerous investigations and surveys. Today all these truths are no longer new. At that time they were not only new, but aroused distrust in liberal society, which feared that behind these references to the so-called \u201cdefects of the Reform\u201d lurked a condemnation of it and concealed support for serfdom. Skaldin\u2019s views are the more interesting because he was a contemporary of the Reform (and even perhaps had a hand in it. We have no historical or literary information or biographical data about him at our disposal). Consequently, his views are based on direct observation both of the \u201ccapital\u201d and the \u201ccountryside\u201d of the time, and not on an armchair study of printed material.\n\nWhat first of all strikes the contemporary reader, who is accustomed to the Narodniks\u2019 sickly gushing over the peasant Reform, is the extreme sobriety of Skaldin\u2019s views on the subject. He looks at the Reform without any illusions or idealisation; he sees it as a transaction between two parties, the landlords and the peasants, who until then had used the land in common on definite terms and now had divided it, the division being accompanied by a change in the legal status of both parties. The factor which determined the mode of division and the size of the share of each party was their respective interests. These interests determined the ambitions of both parties, while the fact that one of them was able to have a direct hand in the Reform itself, and in the practical working-out of the various questions connected with its implementation, determined, among other things, that party\u2019s dominant position. That is how Skaldin understands the Reform. He dwells in particular detail on the principal question of the Reform, the allotments and land redemption payments, reverting to it time and again in the course of his essays. (Skaldin\u2019s book is divided into eleven essays, each of them self-contained, their form reminding one of letters from the countryside. The first essay is dated , and the last, .) It goes without saying that on the subject of the so-called \u2018land-poor\u201d peasants, there is nothing in Skaldin\u2019s book that is new to the contemporary reader, but at the end of the sixties his testimony was both new and valuable. We shall not, of course, recapitulate it, but shall only remark on that feature of his description of the facts which distinguishes him\u2014to his advantage\u2014from the Narodniks. Skaldin does not talk about \u201cland poverty,\u201d but about the \u201cexcessive amount of land cut off from the peasants\u2019 allotments\u201d (p. , also p.  and many other places; cf. title of the third essay), and says that the largest allotments established by the Regulations[] proved to be smaller than those they had before (p. ), incidentally citing some extremely characteristic and typical opinions of peasants on this aspect of the Reform.[] Skaldin\u2019s explanations and proofs of this fact are very circumstantial, forceful and even vehement for a writer who as a rule is extremely moderate and temperate, and whose general outlook is undoubtedly bourgeois. The fact, then, must have been too starkly evident, if such a writer as Skaldin speaks of it so emphatically. Skaldin also speaks very emphatically and circumstantially of the severe burden of the payments, and supports his statements with many facts. \u201cInordinate taxation,\u201d reads a sub-title to the third essay (), \u201cis the chief cause of their\u201d (the peasants\u2019) \u201cpoverty,\u201d and Skaldin shows that taxation is higher than the peasants returns from the land, and he cites from the Proceedings of the Commission on Taxation data relative to the incidence of taxation of the upper and lower classes in Russia which show that % of the taxation falls on the lower classes and % on the upper, whereas in Western Europe the correlation is everywhere incomparably more favourable to the lower classes. A sub-title to the seventh essay () reads, \u201cExcessive money dues are one of the chief causes of poverty among the peasants,\u201d and the author shows that the new conditions of life at once demanded money, money and more money of the peasant, that the Regulation made it a principle to compensate the landlords for the abolition of serfdom as well (), and that the amount of the quit-rent was based \u201con sworn information supplied by the landlords, their stewards and village elders, that is, on absolutely arbitrary data not deserving of the slightest credence\u201d (), in consequence of which the average quit-rents computed by the commissions were higher than the existing average quit-rents. \u201cAdded to the burden of quit-rent borne by the Peasants was the loss of land which they had used for centuries\u201d (). \u201cHad the redemption price of the land not been assessed on the basis of the capitalised amount of the quit-rents, but on the basis of its actual value at the time of the emancipation, the redemption could have been paid off very easily and would not even have required the assistance of the government, or the issue of credit certificates\u201d (). \u201cRedemption, which was designed by the Regulation of February  to make things easier for the peasants and to consummate the work of improving their conditions, in reality often has the effect of putting them into even more straitened circumstances\u201d (). We cite these excerpts\u2014which, in themselves, are of little interest and are in part out-of-date\u2014in order to show how energetically the peasants\u2019 interests were defended by a writer who was hostile to the village community and whose opinions on a whole number of questions were those of a true member of the Manchester School. It is very instructive to note that nearly all the useful and non-reactionary precepts of Narodism fully coincide with those of this Mancunian. It goes without saying that, such being Skaldin\u2019s opinion of the Reform, he could not possibly sentimentally idealise it in the way the Narodniks did, and still do, when they say that it sanctioned people\u2019s production, that it was superior to the West-European peasant reforms, that it made a tabula rasa of Russia, and so on. Skaldin did not and could not say anything of the kind; further, he said plainly that in our country peasant Reform was less advantageous, less beneficial to the peasants than in the West. \u201cThe question will be put plainly,\u201d he wrote, \u201cif we ask ourselves why the beneficial consequences of the emancipation in our country are not growing with the steady speed with which they did, say, in Prussia or Saxony in the first quarter of the present century\u201d (). \u201cIn Prussia, and throughout Germany, the peasants paid not for the redemption of their allotments, which had long been recognised as their property by law, but for the redemption of their compulsory services to the landlords\u201d().\n\nLet us now pass from the economic to the legal aspect of the Reform, as Skaldin sees it. Skaldin is a bitter foe of collective responsibility, of the passport system, and of the patriarchal power of the peasant \u201ccommunity\u201d (and of the urban community) over its members. In the third essay () he insists on the abolition of collective responsibility, the poll tax and the passport system, on the necessity for an equitable property tax, and on the replacement of passports by free and permanent certificates. \u201cIn no other civilised country is there a tax on internal passports\u201d (). We know that this tax was only abolished in . In the title to the fourth essay, we read: \u201carbitrary actions of village communities and urban dumas in sending out passports and levying taxes on absentee payers.\u201d... \u201cCollective responsibility is a heavy burden which efficient and industrious husbandmen have to bear on account of idlers and wastrels\u201d (). Skaldin is disposed to attribute the differentiation of the peasantry, which was already to be observed at that time, to the personal qualities of those who get on or go under. He describes in detail the difficulties peasants living in St. Petersburg experience in obtaining or prolonging passports, and repudiates those who would retort that \u201cthank God, all this multitude of landless peasants have not been registered in the towns, have not increased the numbers of propertyless town-dwellers\u201d ().... \u201cThis barbarous collective responsibility (). ... \u201cCan people placed in such a position be called free citizens? Are they not the same old glebae adscripti?[] \u201d (). The peasant Reform is blamed. \u201cBut is the peasant Reform to blame for the fact that the law, having released the peasant from his bond to the landlord has devised nothing to deliver him from his bond to his community and place of registration?... Where are the attributes of civil liberty, if the peasant is not free to decide either his place of domicile or manner of occupation?\u201d (). Skaldin very accurately and aptly calls our peasant a \u201csettled proletarian\u201d ().[] In the heading to the eighth essay () we read: \u201cthe fact that the peasants are tied to their communities and allotments prevents improvement of their conditions.... It is. an obstacle to the development of outside industries.\u201d \u201cApart from the ignorance of the peasants and the burden of progressively mounting taxation, one of the causes retarding the development of peasant labour and, consequently, of peasant prosperity, is the fact that they are tied to their communities and allotments. The tying of the labourer to one place and the shackling of the rural community in unbreakable fetters\u2014this in itself is an extremely unfavourable condition for the development of labour, private enterprise and small landed property\u201d (). \u201cBound to their allotments and communities, and unable to apply their labour where it would be more productive and of greater advantage to themselves, the peasants are, as it were, frozen in that congested, herdlike, unproductive form of life in which they emerged from serfdom\u201d (). Skaldin, consequently, regards these aspects of peasant life from the purely bourgeois standpoint, but in spite of that (and, perhaps, because of it), his assessment of the harm caused to all social development and to the peasants themselves by the fact that the latter are tied down is very accurate. And it causes particular harm (let us add) to the lowest sections of the peasantry, the rural proletariat. Skaldin says very aptly: \u201cthe concern of the law that the peasants shall not remain without land is admirable; but it should not be forgotten that the concern of the peasants themselves on this score is incomparably greater than that of any legislator\u201d (). \u201cApart from the fact that the peasant is bound to his allotment and his community, even his temporary departure to earn something elsewhere involves considerable difficulty and expense, owing to collective responsibility and the passport system\u201d (S). \u201cFor many peasants, in my opinion, a way out of their difficult situation would be opened if ... measures were taken to make it easier for peasants to give up their land\u201d (). Here Skaldin is expressing a wish that runs sharply counter to the Narodnik projects, which all tend in the very opposite direction, namely, to perpetuate the village community, to make the allotments inalienable, etc. There has been ample evidence since then to show that Skaldin was perfectly right: the fact that the peasant remains tied to the land, and that the peasant community is an exclusive social estate only worsens the position of the rural proletariat and retards the country\u2019s economic development, while being unable in any degree to protect the \u201csettled proletarian\u201d from the worst forms of bondage and subjection, or from the decline of his wages and living standards to the very lowest level.\n\nThe reader may have already seen from the above-quoted excerpts that Skaldin is a foe of the village community. He objects to the community and to land redistribution because he favours private property, enterprise and so on (P. , et seq.). To the defenders of the village community Skaldin retorts that \u201cthe ancient common law\u201d has outlived its day. \u201cIn all countries,\u201d he writes, \u201cas the rural dwellers came into contact with a civilised environment, their common law lost its primeval purity and became subject to corruption and distortion. The same is to be observed in our country: the power of the community is gradually being turned into the power of the village exploiters and rural clerks and, instead of protecting the person of the peasant, is a heavy burden upon him\u201d ()\u2014a very true observation, corroborated by endless facts in these thirty years. In Skaldin\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe patriarchal family, communal ownership of the land and common law\u201d have been irrevocably condemned by history. \u201cThose who would preserve these venerable monuments of past centuries for us in perpetuity, show thereby that they are more capable of being carried away by an idea than of penetrating into realities and grasping the irresistible march of history\u201d (), and to. this correct observation Skaldin adds hot Manchester School philippics. \u201cCommunity land tenure,\u201d he says elsewhere, \u201cplaces every peasant in slavish subjection to the whole community\u201d (). Therefore, Skaldin\u2019s unreserved hostility to the village community from the purely bourgeois standpoint is combined with his consistent defence of the peasants\u2019 interests. Hostile though he is to the village community, Skaldin does not advance foolish projects for forcibly abolishing the community and forcibly introducing some other, similar system of land ownership, such as are usually concocted by the present-day opponents of the village community, who favour gross interferences in the peasants\u2019 life and attack the village community from anything but the standpoint of the peasants\u2019 interests. Skaldin, on the contrary, strongly protests against being classed with the believers in \u201cforcible abolition of communal Land tenure\u201d (). \u201cThe Regulation of February ,\u201d he says, \u201cvery wisely left it to the peasants themselves ... to pass ... from communal to family tenure. Indeed, none but the peasants themselves can properly decide the best time for such passage.\u201d Consequently, Skaldin is opposed to the village community only for the reason that it hampers economic development, prevents the peasant from withdrawing from the community and giving up his land, that is, for the same reason that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d are opposed to it today; this hostility has nothing in common with defence of the selfish interests of the landlords, with defence of the survivals and the spirit of serfdom, with advocacy of interference in the life of the peasants. It is very important to note this difference, because the present-day. Narodniks, who are accustomed to seeing enemies of the village community only in the camp of Moskovskiye Vedomosti and the like, very willingly pretend to be oblivious to any other kind of hostility to the village community.\n\nSkaldin\u2019s general opinion about the causes of the peasants\u2019 distressed condition is that they are all survivals of serfdom. Describing the famine of , he remarks that the serf-owners pointed to it with malicious glee, ascribing it to the dissoluteness of the peasants, to the abolition of the landlords\u2019 tutelage, and so on. Skaldin heatedly refutes these views. \u201cThe causes of the impoverishment of the peasants,\u201d he says, \u201cwere inherited from serfdom (), and are not the result of its abolition; they are the general causes which keep the majority of our peasants at a level bordering on that of the proletariat\u201d\u2014and he repeats the above-quoted opinions of the Reform. It is absurd to attack the family division of the land: \u201cEven if divisions do injure the peasants\u2019 material interests for a while, they save their personal freedom and the moral dignity of the peasant family, that is, those higher human blessings without which no civil progress is possible\u201d (), and Skaldin rightly points to the real reasons for the campaign against land divisions: \u201cmany landlords highly exaggerate the harm caused by divisions, blaming them, as well as drunkenness, for all the consequences of the various causes of the peasants\u2019 poverty, which the landlords are so unwilling to recognise\u201d (). To those who say that much is being written today about the peasants\u2019 poverty, but that formerly it was not so and that therefore the peasants\u2019 conditions must have deteriorated, Skaldin replies that: \u201cIn order to form a judgement of the results of the peasants\u2019 emancipation from the landlords\u2019 power, by comparing the peasants\u2019 present with their former condition, it would have been necessary, while serfdom still prevailed, to trim down the peasants\u2019 allotments as they have been now trimmed down, and to tax the peasants with all the duties which have appeared since the emancipation, and then see how the peasant serfs would have borne such conditions\u201d (). It is a supremely characteristic and important feature of Skaldin\u2019s views that\u2019 he reduces all the causes of the deterioration in the peasants\u2019 condition to survivals of serfdom, to its legacy of labour service, quit-rent, cut-off land, and the peasants\u2019 lack of rights, and immobility. Skaldin not only does not see that the causes of the peasants\u2019 impoverishment might be found in the very structure of the new socio-economic relations, in the very structure of the post-Reform economy; he absolutely refuses to entertain the thought, being profoundly convinced that the complete abolition of all these survivals of serfdom would usher in an era of universal well-being. His views, in fact, are negative: remove the obstacles to the free development of the peasantry, remove the shackles bequeathed by serfdom, and everything will be for the best in this best of possible worlds. Skaldin writes: \u201cHere\u201d (i. e., in relation to the peasantry) \u201cthere is only one course the government can follow: to eliminate steadily and unflaggingly the causes which have reduced our peasants to their present state of dullness and poverty and which do not allow them to rise to their feet\u201d (, my italics). Highly characteristic in this respect is the reply given by Skaldin to those who defend the \u201ccommunity\u201d (that is, binding the peasants to the village communities and allotments) on the ground that, without it, \u201ca rural proletariat will emerge.\u201d \u201cThis objection,\u201d Skaldin says, \u201cfalls to the ground when we remember what boundless tracts of land lie idle in our country from lack of hands to cultivate them. If the law did not hamper the natural distribution of manpower, the only people who would be real proletarians in Russia would be the professional beggars or the incorrigibly vicious and dissipated\u201d ()\u2014the typical view of the eighteenth-century economists and \u201cenlighteners,\u201d who believed that abolition of serfdom and all its survivals would usher in a reign of universal well-being on earth. The Narodnik would no doubt look down on Skaldin with disdain and say that he was simply a bourgeois. Yes, of course, Skaldin was a bourgeois, but he was a representative of the progressive bourgeois ideology which the Narodniks have replaced by one that is petty-bourgeois and, on a whole number of points, reactionary. And this \u201cbourgeois\u201d had a better idea than the Narodnik of how to defend those practical and real interests of the peasants which coincided, and coincide now, with the requirements of social development generally![]\nTo complete our account of Skaldin\u2019s views, let us add that he is opposed to the system of social estates, advocates a single court of justice for all of them, sympathises \u201ctheoretically\u201d with the idea that the volost authorities should not be constituted on the basis of social estates, is an ardent advocate of public education, especially general education, favours local self-government and Zemstvo institutions, and believes that land credits, especially small, should be widely available, for there is a strong desire among the peasants to buy land. Here, too, Skaldin is a true \u201cMancunian\u201d: he says, for instance, that Zemstvo and municipal banks are \u201ca patriarchal or primitive form of bank\u201d and should give way to private banks, which are \u201cvastly superior\u201d (). The land might be endowed with value \u201cthrough the stimulation of industrial and commercial activity in our provinces\u201d (), and so on.\n\nTo sum up. In outlook, Skaldin may be called a bourgeois enlightener. His views are very reminiscent of those of the eighteenth-century economists (correspondingly refracted, of course, in the prism of Russian conditions), and he reflected the general \u201cenlightenment\u201d character of the \u201cheritage\u201d of the sixties quite vividly. Like the West-European enlighteners and the majority of the literary representatives of the sixties, Skaldin was imbued with a violent hostility to serfdom and all its economic, social and legal products. That was the first characteristic feature of the \u201cenlightener.\u201d The second characteristic feature common to all the Russian enlighteners was ardent advocacy of education, self-government, liberty, European forms of life and all-round Europeanisation of Russia generally. And the third characteristic feature of the \u201cenlightener\u201d was his defence of the interests of the masses, chiefly of the peasants (who, in the days of the enlighteners, were not yet fully emancipated or only in process of being emancipated), the sincere belief that abolition of serfdom and its survivals would be followed by universal well-being, and a sincere desire to help bring this about. These three features constitute the essence of what In our country is called \u201cthe heritage of the sixties,\u201d and it is important to emphasise that there is nothing whatsoever of Narodism in this heritage. There are quite a number of Russian writers whose views are characterised by these features and who have never had anything in common with Narodism. Where the outlook of a writer bears these features, he is always recognised by everyone as having \u201cpreserved the traditions of the sixties,\u201d quite irrespective of what his attitude to Narodism may be. Nobody, of course, would think of saying that Mr. M. Stasyulevich, for instance, whose jubilee was recently celebrated, had \u201crenounced the heritage\u201d \u2014merely because he was an opponent of Narodism or was indifferent to the questions advanced by Narodism. We have taken Skaldin[] as an example precisely because, while he was undoubtedly a representative of the \u201cheritage,\u201d he was at the same time a confirmed enemy of those ancient institutions which the Narodniks have taken under their protection.\n\nWe have said that Skaldin was a bourgeois. Ample proof of this description has been given above, but it must be observed that this word is often understood very incorrectly, narrowly and unhistorically, it being associated (without distinction of historical period) with a selfish defence of the interests of a minority. It must not be forgotten that at the time when the eighteenth-century enlighteners (who are by general consent included among the leaders of the bourgeoisie) wrote, and at the time when our enlighteners of the forties and sixties wrote, all social problems amounted to the struggle against serfdom and its survivals. At that time the new socio-economic relations and their contradictions were still in embryo. No selfishness was therefore displayed at that time by the ideologists of the bourgeoisie; on the contrary, both in the West and in Russia, they quite sincerely believed in universal well-being and sincerely desired it, they sincerely did not see (partly could not yet see) the contradictions in the system which was growing out of serfdom. It is not for nothing that Skaldin in one part of his book quotes Adam Smith: we have seen that both his views and the character of his arguments in many respects repeat the theses of that great ideologist of the progressive bourgeoisie.\n\nAnd so, if we compare Skaldin\u2019s practical suggestions with the views of the present-day Narodniks, on the one hand, and with the attitude to them of the \u201cRussian disciples,\u201d on the other, we shall find that the \u201cdisciples\u201d will always support Skaldin\u2019s suggestions, since the latter reflect the interests of the progressive social classes, and the vital interests of social development generally along the present, i. e., capitalist, path. The things that the Narodniks have changed in Skaldin\u2019s practical wishes, or in his presentation of problems, are a change for the worse, and are rejected by the \u201cdisciples.\u201d It is not against the \u201cheritage\u201d that the disciples \u201churl themselves\u201d (that is an absurd fabrication), but against the romantic and petty-bourgeois additions to the heritage made by the Narodniks. To these additions we shall now pass.\n\nII\nNarodism\u2019s Addition to the \u201cHeritage\u201d\nFrom Skaldin, let us pass to Engelhardt. His Letters from the Countryside are likewise essays on the social aspects of rural life, so that in substance and even in form his book very much resembles that of Skaldin\u2019s. Engelhardt is much more talented than Skaldin, and his letters from the country are incomparably more lively and imaginative. The lengthy disquisitions of the serious author of In the Backwoods and in the Capital are not to be found in Engelhardt\u2019s book, which, for its part, is replete with deft delineation and imagery. It is not surprising that Engelhardt\u2019s book enjoys the steady sympathy of the reading public, and only recently appeared in a fresh edition, while Skaldin\u2019s book is almost completely forgotten, although it was only two years after its publication that Otechestvenniye Zapiski began printing Engelhardt\u2019s letters. There is therefore no need for us to acquaint the reader with the contents of Engelhardt\u2019s book, and we shall confine ourselves to a brief exposition of two aspects of his views: first, views that are characteristic of the \u201cheritage\u201d in general, and common to Engelhardt and Skaldin in particular; and, second, views that are specifically Narodnik. Engelhardt is already a Narodnik, but his views still contain so much that is common to all the enlighteners, so much that has been discarded or altered by contemporary Narodism, that one is at a loss how to class him\u2014with the representatives of the \u201cheritage\u201d in general, without the Narodnik tinge, or with the Narodniks.\n\nWhat makes Engelhardt akin to the former is, primarily, the remarkable sobriety of his views, his plain and direct descriptions of realities, his relentless exposure of all the bad sides of the \u201cfoundations\u201d in general, and of the peasantry in particular\u2014of those very \u201cfoundations,\u201d the false idealisation and embellishment of which is an essential component of Narodism. Engelhardt\u2019s very feebly and timidly expressed Narodism is therefore in direct and crying contradiction to the picture of rural realities that he paints with such talent, and if some economist or sociologist were to base his opinions of the countryside on Engelhardt\u2019s facts and observations,[] he would find it impossible to draw Narodnik conclusions from such material. Idealisation of the peasant and his village community is one of the essential components of Narodism, and Narodniks of all shades, from Mr. V. V. to Mr. Mikhailovsky, have given full rein to this effort to idealise and embellish the \u201ccommunity.\u201d There is not the slightest trace of such embellishment in Engelhardt. As against the fashionable talk about the communal spirit of our peasantry, the current contrasting of this \u201ccommunal spirit\u201d to the individualism of the town, the competition of capitalist economy, etc., Engelhardt is absolutely relentless in exposing the amazing individualism of the small farmer. He shows at length that our \u201cpeasants in matter of ownership have the keenest possible sense of property\u201d (p. ,  ed.), that they cannot tolerate \u201cgang work,\u201d hate it from narrowly selfish and egoistic motives: in gang work each is \u201cafraid of doing more than the others\u201d (p. ). This fear of doing more work than others goes to comical (or, rather, tragicomical) extremes; the author, for instance tells of women living under one roof and bound by ties of common residence and kinship, each of whom washes only her particular part of the table at which they eat, or who milk the cows in turn, each getting milk for her own child (for fear that others may hide some of the milk) and preparing porridge for her own child separately (p. ). Engelhardt brings out these features in such detail, and corroborates them with such a mass of examples, that there can be no question of their being exceptional instances. One or the other: either Engelhardt is a worthless observer who deserves no credence, or the tale about the communal spirit and communal virtues of our muzhik are sheer imagination, which transfers to economic practice features abstracted from the form of land tenure (and from this form of landholding there are additionally abstracted all the fiscal and administrative aspects). Engelhardt shows that in his economic activity the muzhik aims at becoming a kulak. \u201cThere is a definite dose of the kulak in every peasant,\u201d he says (p. ), \u201ckulak ideals prevail among the peasants.\u201d... \u201cI have said time and again that individualism, egoism, the urge to exploit are strongly developed among the peasants.\u201d... \u201cEach prides himself on being a pike and strives to swallow the tiddler.\u201d Engelhardt demonstrates superbly that the trend among the peasantry is not towards the \u201ccommunal\u201d system, not towards \u201cpeople\u2019s production,\u201d but towards the most ordinary petty-bourgeois system inherent in all capitalist societies. He describes and proves incontrovertibly the tendency of the well-to-do peasant to launch into trade (), to loan grain in return for work, to buy the labour of the poor muzhik (pp. , , etc.)\u2014or, in economic language, the conversion of enterprising muzhiks into a rural bourgeoisie. \u201cIf,\u201d says Engelhardt, \u201cthe peasants do not adopt the artel form of economy and each continues to conduct his own farm in isolation, then, even if there is an abundance of land, there will be both landless peasants and farm labourers among the peasant tillers. Further, I believe that the difference in status among the peasants will be even wider than it now is. Despite communal ownership of the land, side by side with the rich,\u2019 there will be many virtually landless farm labourers. \u201cWhat benefit is it to me or my children if I have the right to land, but neither the capital nor the implements with which to cultivate it? It is like giving a blind man land and saying\u2014eat it!\u201d (p. ). With a sort of melancholy irony, the \u201cartel form of economy\u2019 figures forlornly in this passage as a pious and innocent wish which, far from following from the facts about the peasantry, is directly repudiated and ruled out by them.\n\nAnother feature which makes Engelhardt akin to the representatives of the heritage without any Narodnik tinge is his belief that the chief and fundamental cause of the distressed condition of the peasantry is the survivals of serfdom and the reglementation characteristic of it. Do away with these survivals and this reglementation, and all will be well. Engelhardt\u2019s absolute hostility to reglementation and his caustic scoffing at all attempts to confer happiness on the muzhik through reglementation from above, are in the sharpest contrast to the Narodniks\u2019 faith in \u201cthe reason and conscience, the knowledge and patriotism of the ruling classes\u201d (the words of Mr. Yuzhakov, in Russkoye Bogatstvo, , No. , p. ), to their fantastic projects for \u201corganising production,\u201d etc. Let us recall Engelhardt\u2019s sarcastic denunciation of the rule that vodka should not be sold at flour-mills, a rule intended for the muzhik\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d; or the disgust with which he speaks of the obligatory order issued by several Zemstvos in  forbid. ding the sowing of rye before August , of that gross interference by armchair scientists\u201d\u2014also actuated by consideration for the muzhik\u2019s good\u2014in the farming of \u201cmillions of peasant proprietors\u201d (). Referring to such rules and orders as those forbidding smoking in pine forests, pike fishing in spring, cutting birch for the May festival, bird-nest pillaging and so on, Engelhardt sarcastically remarks: solicitude for the muzhik is and always has been the principal concern of intellectual minds. Who lives for himself? Everybody lives for the muzhik!... The muzhik is stupid, he cannot manage his own affairs. If nobody looks after him, he will burn down all the forests, kill off all the birds, denude the rivers of fish, ruin the land, and himself die out\u201d (). Do you think, reader, that this writer could have had any sympathy for laws so dear to the hearts of the Narodniks, as, say, those forbidding alienation of allotments? Could his pen have written anything like the phrase of one of the pillars of Russkoye Bogatstvo quoted above? Could he have shared the view of Mr. N. Karyshev, another pillar of the same journal, who flung the reproach at our gubernia Zemstvos (in the nineties!) that they \u201cfind no room\u201d \u201cfor regular large and substantial expenditure on the organisation of agricultural labour\u201d?[]\n\nLet us mention another feature which makes Engelhardt akin to Skaldin: his unconscious attitude to many purely bourgeois aspirations and measures. Not that Engelhardt tries to gild the petty bourgeois or to concoct excuses (& la Mr. V. V.) for not applying this designation to any particular entrepreneur\u2014far from it. As a practical farmer, Engelhardt is simply infatuated with every progressive innovation, every improvement in farming methods, and completely fails to realise that the social form of these improvements is the most effective refutation of his own theory that capitalism is impossible in our country. Let us recall, for instance, how delighted We was with the success he achieved on his farm thanks to the introduction of the piece-rate system o! paying his workers (for flax scutching, threshing, etc.). Engelhardt does not even suspect that the substitution of piece rates for time rates is one of the most widespread methods by which a developing capitalist economy heightens the intensification of labour and increases the rate of surplus-value. Another example. Engelhardt scoffs at the programme of Zemledelcheskaya Gazeta[]: \u201cdiscontinuation of leasing fields for cycle cultivation[]; farming based on employment of labourers; introduction of improved machines, implements and cattle breeds and of multi-field system; improvement of meadows and pastures, etc., etc.\u201d \u201cAll this, however, is nothing but general talk!\u201d Engelhardt exclaims (). Yet it was this programme that Engelhardt adopted in his own practical farming; he achieved technical progress on his own farm precisely by basing it on the employment of farm labourers. Or again: we know how frankly and faithfully Engelhardt exposed the real tendencies of the enterprising muzhik; but that did not prevent him from asserting that \u201cit is not factories that are needed, but small\u201d (Engelhardt\u2019s italics) \u201crural distilleries, oil mills,\u201d etc. (p. ), that is, what is \u201cneeded\u201d is that the rural bourgeoisie should go in for agricultural industries\u2014which has always and everywhere been one of the major indications of agricultural capitalism. Here we have the influence of the fact that Engelhardt was not a theoretician but a practical farmer. It is one thing\u2019 to argue that progress is possible without capitalism, and another thing to farm yourself. Having set himself the aim of conducting his farm on rational lines, Engelhardt was compelled, by virtue of surrounding circumstances, to strive for this by purely capitalistic methods and to leave aside all his theoretical and abstract misgivings concerning the \u201cemployment of farm labourers.\u201d In the field of theory Skaldin argued like a typical member of the Manchester School, completely failing to realise both that his arguments were of just this character, and that they corresponded to the needs of Russia\u2019s capitalist evolution. In the field of practice Engelhardt was compelled to act as a typical Mancunian, despite his theoretical protest against capitalism and his desire to believe that his fatherland was following a path of its own.\n\nEngelhardt did believe this, and it is this that induces us to call him a Narodnik. He had already clearly perceived the real trend of economic development in Russia, and sought to explain away the contradictions of this development. He endeavoured to prove that agricultural capitalism was impossible in Russia, that \u201cthere is no Knecht in our country\u201d (p. )\u2014though he himself refuted in the greatest detail the story that our workers are expensive, and himself showed how miserably he paid his cattleman, Pyotr, who with his family, after their keep, had only  rubles a year Left \u201cwith which to buy salt, vegetable oil, clothing\u201d (p. ). \u201cYet even he is envied, and if I turned him off, fifty others would immediately be found eager to take his place\u201d (p. ). Speaking of the success of his farm, and of the skilful way his workers handle the plough, Engelhardt triumphantly exclaims: \u201cAnd who are these ploughmen? Ignorant, unconscientious Russian peasants\u201d (p. ).\n\nThough his own farming experience and his exposure of the peasant\u2019s individualism refuted all illusions concerning the \u201ccommunity spirit,\u201d Engelhardt not only \u201cbelieved\u201d that the peasants could adopt an artel form of economy, but expressed the \u201cconviction\u201d that such would indeed be the case, and that we, the Russians, would accomplish this great feat and introduce a new mode of farming. \u201cIt is this that constitutes the exceptional character, the specific nature of our economy\u201d (p. ). Engelhardt the realist turns into Engelhardt the romanticist, who replaces the complete lack of \u201cexceptional character\u201d in his own methods of farming, and in the peasants\u2019 farming methods as he observed them by \u201cfaith\u201d in a future \u201cexceptional character\u201d! From this faith it is only a stone\u2019s throw to the ultra-Narodnik features which\u2014though very few\u2014one finds in Engelhardt, to a narrow nationalism bordering on chauvinism (\u201cWe\u2019ll give Europe a drubbing,\u201dand \u201cin Europe, too, the muzhik will be on our side\u201d (p. )\u2014said Engelhardt to a landlord with whom he was discussing the prospect of war), and even to idealisation of labour service! Yes, this selfsame Engelhardt who devoted so many superb. pages of his book to describing the downtrodden and degraded condition of the peasant who has taken a loan of money or grain to be paid off in work and is compelled to toil almost for nothing in the very worst conditions of personal dependence[] \u2014this selfsame Engelhardt goes to the length of saying that \u201cit would be a good thing if the doctor\u201d (he was talking of the benefit of and need for doctors in the countryside. V. I.) \u201chad a farm of his own, so that the muzhik could pay for the treatment with his labour\u201d (p. ). Comment is superfluous.\n\n\u2014All in all, comparing the above-enumerated good features of Engelhardt\u2019s outlook (i.e., those he has in common with the representatives of the \u201cheritage\u201d without any Narodnik tinge) with the bad (i.e., the Narodnik features), we have to admit that the former unquestionably predominate in the author of Letters from the Countryside, while the latter are an extraneous and accidental admixture, as it were, which has drifted in from without and is at odds with the general tone of his book.\n\nIII\nHas the \u201cHeritage\u201d Gained From Association With Narodism?\n\u201cBut what do you understand by Narodism?\u201d the reader will probably ask. \u201cThe meaning attached to the concept \u2018heritage\u2019 was defined above, but no definition of the concept \u2018Narodism\u2019 has been given.\u201d\n\nBy Narodism we mean a system of views which comprises the following three features: ) Belief that capitalism in Russia represents a deterioration, a retrogression. Hence the urge and desire to \u201cretard,\u201d \u201chalt,\u201d \u201cstop the break-up\u201d of the age-old foundations by capitalism, and similar reactionary cries. ) Belief in the exceptional character of the Russian economic system in general, and of the peasantry, with its village community, artel, etc., in particular. It is not considered necessary to apply to Russian economic relationships the concepts elaborated by modern science concerning the different social classes and their conflicts. The village\u2014 community peasantry is regarded as something higher and better than capitalism; there is a disposition to idealise the \u201cfoundations.\u201d The existence among the peasantry of contradictions characteristic of every commodity and capitalist economy is denied or slurred over; it is denied that any connection exists between these contradictions and their more developed form in capitalist industry and capitalist agriculture. ) Disregard of the connection between the \u201cintelligentsia\u201d and the country\u2019s legal and political institutions, on the one hand, arid the material interests of definite social classes, on the other. Denial of this connection, lack of a materialist explanation of these social factors, induces the belief that they represent a force capable of \u201cdragging history along another line\u201d (Mr. V. V.), of \u201cdiversion from the path\u201d (Mr. N. \u2014on, Mr. Yuzhakov, etc.), and so on.\n\nThat is what we mean by \u201cNarodism.\u201d The reader will consequently see that we use this term in its broad sense, just as all the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d use it when opposing a whole system of views, and not individual representatives of this system. Among these individual representatives there arc differences, of course, and sometimes important ones. Nobody ignores these differences. But the aforementioned views are common to all the most diverse representatives of Narodism, from\u2014well, Mr. Yuzov, let us say, to Mr. Mikhailovsky. To these objectionable features of their views, the Yuzovs, Sazonovs, V. V., etc., add others, which are not shared, for instance, either by Mr. Mikhailovsky or by other contributors to the present-day Russkoye Bogatstvo. To deny these differences between the Narodniks in the narrow sense and the Narodniks in general would, of course, be wrong; but it would be wronger still to ignore the fact that the fundamental socio-economic views of all Narodniks coincide on the aforementioned major points. And since it is these fundamental views that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d reject, and not only \u201cdeplorable deviations\u201d from them in a worse direction, they are obviously fully entitled to employ the term \u201cNarodism\u201d in its wider meaning. Not only are they entitled to do so; they cannot do otherwise.\n\nTurning to the fundamental views of Narodism outlined above, the first thing we must note is that the \u201cheritage\u201d has absolutely no part in them. There are a whole number of undeniable representatives and guardians of the \u201cheritage\u201d who have nothing in common with Narodism, who do not pose the question of capitalism at all, who do not believe in the exceptional character of Russia, the peasant community, etc., and who do not regard the intelligentsia and our legal and political institutions as a factor capable of \u201cdiversion from the path.\u201d Above we named in illustration the editor and publisher of Vestnik Yevropy,[] who might be accused of anything save violation of the traditions of the heritage. On the other hand, there are people whose views resemble the aforementioned fundamental principles of Narodism, yet who plainly and frankly \u201crenounce the heritage\u201d\u2014we might mention, for example, the same Mr. Y. Abramov to whom Mr. Mikhailovsky refers, or Mr. Yuzov. The Narodism which the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d battle against did not even exist when the heritage was (to use a legal term) \u201cbequeathed,\u201d that is, in the sixties. Germs, rudiments of Narodism existed, of course, not only in the sixties, but in the forties and even earlier[] \u2014but it is not the history of Narodism that concerns us here. We repeat, what is important for us is to establish that the \u201cheritage\u201d of the sixties, in the sense outlined above, has nothing in common with Narodism, i.e., that there is nothing in common in the substance of their views, that they pose different problems. There are guardians of the \u201cheritage\u201d who are not Narodniks, and there are Narodniks who \u201chave renounced the heritage.\u201d Of course, there are also Narodniks who guard the \u201cheritage,\u201d or who pretend to do so. That is why we speak of a connection between the heritage and Narodism. Let us see what has been the effect of this connection.\n\nFirst, Narodism made a big step forward compared with the heritage by posing for the attention of society problems which the guardians of the heritage were partly (in their time) not yet able to pose, or partly did not, and do not, pose because of their inherent narrowness of outlook. In posing these problems the Narodniks performed a great historical service, and it is quite natural and understandable, that, having offered a solution (whatever it maybe worth) for these problems, Narodism thereby occupied a foremost place among the progressive trends of Russian social thought.\n\nBut the solution of these problems proposed by Narodism proved to be worthless, to be based on backward theories, long ago discarded in Western Europe, on a romantic and petty-bourgeois criticism of capitalism, on a disregard for the cardinal facts of Russian history and reality. So long as the development of capitalism in Russia and of its inherent contradictions was still very weak, this primitive criticism of capitalism could hold its ground. But Narodism is absolutely incapable of measuring up to the contemporary development of capitalism in Russia, the contemporary state of our knowledge of Russian economic history and reality, the contemporary demands made on sociological theory. Once progressive, as the first to pose the problem of capitalism, nowadays Narodism is a reactionary and harmful theory which misleads social thought and plays into the hands of stagnation and Asiatic backwardness. Today the reactionary character of its criticism of capitalism has even lent Narodism features that make it inferior to the outlook which confines itself to faithful guardianship of the heritage.[] That this is so we shall now endeavour to prove by analysing each of the three basic features of the Narodnik outlook mentioned above.\n\nThe first feature\u2014the belief that in Russia capitalism represents a deterioration, a retrogression. Very soon after the problem of capitalism in Russia had been posed, it became clear that our economic development was capitalistic, and the Narodniks proclaimed this development a retrogression, a mistake, a deviation from the path supposedly prescribed by the whole history of the nation\u2019s life, from the path supposedly hallowed by age-old foundations, and so on and so forth. The enlighteners\u2019 ardent faith in this course of social development was replaced by distrust of it; historical optimism and cheerfulness were replaced by pessimism and dejection founded on the fact that the farther matters proceeded as they were proceeding, the harder and more difficult would it be to solve the problems raised by the new development; appeals were made to \u201cretard\u201d and \u201chalt\u201d this development; the theory was advanced that Russia\u2019s backwardness was her good fortune, and so forth. All these features of the Narodnik outlook, far from having anything in common with the \u201cheritage,\u201d flatly contradict it. The belief that Russian. capitalism represents a \u201cdeviation from the path,\u201d a deterioration, etc., leads to a misrepresentation of Russia\u2019s whole economic evolution, to a misrepresentation of that \u201cchange-over\u201d which is taking place before our eyes. Carried away by their desire to retard and stop the break-up of the age-old foundations by capitalism, the Narodniks display an amazing lack of historical tact, they forget that antecedent to this capitalism there was nothing but the same exploitation combined with countless forms of bondage and personal dependence, which burdened the position of the labourer, nothing but routine and stagnation in social production and, hence, in all spheres of social life. Contending against capitalism from their romantic, petty-bourgeois angle, the Narodniks throw all historical realism overboard and always compare the reality of capitalism with a fiction of the pre-capitalist order. The \u201cheritage\u201d of the sixties with their ardent faith in the progressive character of the existing course of social development, their relentless enmity directed wholly and exclusively against the relics of the past, their conviction that these relics had only to be swept clean away and everything would go splendidly\u2014this \u2019heritage,\u201d far from having any part in the aforementioned views of Narodism, runs directly counter to them.\n\nThe second feature of Narodism is belief in Russia\u2019s exceptionalism, idealisation of the peasantry, the village community, etc. The doctrine of Russia\u2019s exceptionalism induced the Narodniks to seize upon out-dated West-European theories, prompted them to regard many of the achievements of West-European culture with amazing levity: the Narodniks reassured themselves with the thought that, if we lacked some of the features of civilised humanity, \u201cwe are destined,\u201d on the other hand, to show the world new modes of economy, etc. Not only was the analysis of capitalism and all its manifestations given by progressive West-European thought not accepted in relation to Holy Russia; every effort was made to invent excuses for not drawing the same conclusions about Russian capitalism as were made regarding European capitalism. The Narodniks bowed and scraped to the authors of this analysis and\u2014calmly continued to remain romanticists of the same sort as these authors had all their lives contended against. Again, this doctrine of Russia\u2019s exceptionalism, which is shared by all the Narodniks, far from having anything in common with the \u201cheritage,\u201d runs directly counter to it. The \u201csixties,\u201d on the contrary, desired to Europeanise Russia, believed that she should adopt the general European culture, were concerned to have the institutions of this culture transferred to our anything but exceptional soil. Any doctrine that teaches that Russia is exceptional is completely at variance with the spirit and the tradition of the sixties. Even more at variance with this tradition is Narodism\u2019s idealisation and over-embellishment of the countryside. This false idealisation, which desired at all costs to see something specific in our rural system, something quite unlike the rural system in every other country in the period of pre-capitalist relations, is in naked contradiction to the traditions of the sober and realistic heritage. The wider and more deeply capitalism developed, the more distinctly did the countryside display the contradictions common to every commodity-capitalist society, the more and more glaringly did the antithesis stand out between the Narodniks\u2019 honeyed talk about the peasant\u2019s \u201ccommunity spirit,\u201d \u201cartel spirit,\u201d etc., on the one hand, and the actual division of the peasantry into a rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat on the other; and the more rapidly did the Narodniks, who continued to look upon things with the eyes of the peasant, change from sentimental romanticists into ideologists of the petty bourgeoisie, because in modern society the small producer changes into a commodity producer. Their false idealisation of the countryside and romantic dreams about the \u201ccommunity spirit\u201d led the Narodniks to adopt an extremely frivolous attitude towards the peasants\u2019 real needs arising from the existing course of economic development. In theory one might talk to one\u2019s heart\u2019s content about the strength of the foundations, but in practice every Narodnik sensed very well that the elimination of the relics of the past, the survivals of the pre-Reform system, which to this day bind our peasantry from head to foot, would open the way to precisely the capitalist course of development, and no other. Better stagnation than capitalist progress\u2014this, essentially, is every Narodnik\u2019s attitude to the countryside, although of course not every Narodnik would venture to say so frankly and bluntly, with the same forthrightness of a Mr. V. V. \u201cTied to their allotments and communities, and unable to apply their labour where it. would be more productive and of greater advantage to themselves, the peasants are, as it were, frozen in that congested, herd-like, unproductive form of life in which they emerged from serfdom.\u201d That is how one of the representatives of the \u201cheritage\u201d saw it from his characteristic \u201cenlightener\u2019s\u201d standpoint.[] \u201cBetter that the peasants remain frozen in their routine, patriarchal form of life, than clear the way for capitalism in the countryside\u201d\u2014 that, essentially, is how every Narodnik sees it. Indeed, probably not a single Narodnik would venture to deny that social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant community, with its collective responsibility and its ban on the sale of land and on the right to refuse an allotment, stands in the sharpest contradiction to contemporary economic realities, to contemporary commodity-capitalist relations and their development. To deny this contradiction is impossible, but the whole point is that the Narodniks are mortally afraid of this presentation of the question, of this contrasting of the legal status of the peasantry with economic realities and the present course of economic development. The Narodnik is stubbornly determined to believe in a non-existent non-capitalist development which is a figment of his romantic imagination, and therefore ... and therefore he is prepared to retard the present development, which is proceeding along capitalist lines. The Narodnik\u2019s attitude to such problems as the social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant community, collective responsibility, and the peasant\u2019s right to sell and give up his allotment, is not only one of extreme caution and fear for the fate of the \u201cfoundations\u201d (the foundations of routine and stagnation); more than this, the Narodnik falls so low that he even welcomes the police rule forbidding the peasants to sell land. To such a Narodnik, one might retort in the words of Engelhardt: \u201cThe muzhik is stupid, he cannot manage his own affairs. If nobody looks after him, he will burn down all the forests, kill off all the birds, denude the rivers of fish, ruin the land and himself die out.\u201d Here the Narodnik quite definitely \u201crenounces the heritage,\u201d becomes a reactionary. And note that with the progress of economic development, this destruction. But what about the foreign market? Do we deny that capitalism needs a foreign market? Of course not. But the question of a foreign market has absolutely nothing to do with the question of realisation, and the attempt to link them into one whole merely expresses the romantic wish to \u201cretard\u201d capitalism, and the romantic inability to think logically. The theory which has explained the question of realisation has proved this up to the hilt. The romanticist says: the capitalists cast allotment and community is an enormous restriction on his economic activity, makes it impossible for him to find a better employer, and compels him to sell his labour-power only to local purchasers, who invariably pay less and seek all sorts of ways and means of reducing him to bondage. Having surrendered to the sway of romantic dreaming and set himself the aim of maintaining and preserving the foundations despite the course of economic development, the Narodnik, without himself observing it, bad slipped down this inclined plane until he found himself side by side with the agrarian, who yearns with all his heart and soul for the preservation and consolidation of the \u201cpeasant\u2019s tie with the land.\u201d It is worth recalling, for example, that this social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant community has bred specific methods of hiring workers: factory and farm owners send out agents to the villages, especially those heavily in arrears, to hire labourers on the most advantageous terms. Fortunately, the development of agricultural capitalism, by breaking down the \u201csettled state\u201d of the proletarian (such is the effect of the so-called agricultural outside employments), is gradually substituting free hire for this form of bondage.\n\nAnother, and perhaps no less striking corroboration of our contention that the present-day Narodnik theories are pernicious, is to be found in the common tendency among the Narodniks to idealise labour services. We have already given an example of how Engelhardt, consummating his Narodnik fall from grace, went so far as to say that \u201cit would be a good thing\u201d to develop labour services in the countryside! We find the same thing in Mr. Yuzhakov\u2019s famous project for agricultural gymnasia (Russkoye Bogatstvo, , No. ).[] In serious economic articles in the same journal, a fellow contributor of Engelhardt\u2019s, Mr. V. V., indulged in similar idealisation when he declared that the peasant had scored a victory over the landlord, who had supposedly wanted to introduce capitalism; but the whole trouble was that the peasant undertook to cultivate the landlord\u2019s land in return for land received from him \u201con lease\u201d\u2014in other words, was restoring the very same mode of economy as existed under serfdom. These are some of the most glaring illustrations of the Narodniks\u2019 reactionary attitude to problems concerning our agriculture. In less glaring form, you will find this idea advocated by every Narodnik. Every Narodnik says that capitalism in our agriculture is pernicious and dangerous, because capitalism, you see, substitutes the farm labourer for the independent peasant. The reality of capitalism (the \u201cfarm labourer\u201d) is contrasted to the fiction of the \u201cindependent\u201d peasant: and this fiction is based on the peasant ownership of means of production in the pre-capitalist era, the fact being modestly ignored that the peasant has to pay double their value for these means of production; that these means of production serve for the performance of labour service; that the living standard of this \u201cindependent\u201d peasant is so low that in any capitalist country he would be classed as a pauper; and that added to the hopeless poverty and intellectual inertness of this \u201cindependent\u201d peasant is the personal dependence that inevitably accompanies pre-capitalist forms of economy.\n\nThe third characteristic feature of Narodism\u2014disregard of the connection between the \u201cintelligentsia\u201d and the country\u2019s legal and political institutions, on the one hand, and the material interests of definite social classes, on the other\u2014is bound up indissolubly with the previous ones: only this unrealistic attitude to sociological problems could have bred the doctrine that Russian capitalism is a \u201cmistake,\u201d and that \u201cdiversion from the path\u201d is possible. This Narodnik view, too, bears no relation to the \u201cheritage\u201d and traditions of the sixties; on the contrary, it runs directly counter to these traditions. A natural corollary to this view is the Narodniks\u2019 attitude to the numerous survivals of the pre-Reform reglementation of Russian life, an attitude which the representatives of the \u201cheritage\u201d could not possibly have shared. To illustrate this attitude, we shall take the liberty of borrowing the excellent remarks of Mr. V. Ivanov in his article \u201cA Shabby Fabrication\u201d (Novoye Slovo, September ). The author refers to Mr. Boborykin\u2019s novel A Different Way, and exposes his misconception of the dispute between the Narodniks and the \u201cdisciples.\u201d Mr. Boborykin makes his hero, a Narodnik, reproach the \u201cdisciples\u201d for supposedly dreaming of \u201ca barrack regime with the intolerable despotism of reglementation.\u201d Mr. V. Ivanov observes in this connection that:\n\n\u201cFar from saying that the \u2018dream\u2019 of their opponents was the intolerable despotism of \u2018reglementation,\u2019 they\u201d (the Narodniks) \u201ccannot and will not say so as long as they remain Narodniks. The substance of their dispute with the \u2018economic materialists\u2019 in this respect is that, in the opinion of the Narodniks, the remaining survivals of the old reglementation may serve as the basis for its further development. The intolerableness of the old reglementation is veiled from their eyes, on the one hand, by their conviction that the very \u2018peasant soul (single and indivisible) is evolving\u2019 towards reglementation, and, on the other, by their belief in the existing or coming moral beauty of the \u2018intelligentsia,\u2019 \u2018society,\u2019 or the \u2018leading classes\u2019 generally. They accuse the economic materialists of being infatuated not with \u2018reglementation,\u2019 but, on the contrary, with the West-European system, which is based on freedom from reglementation. And the economic materialists really do assen that the survivals of the old reglementation, which sprang from a natural form of economy, are daily becoming more \u2018intolerable\u2019 in a country that has passed over to a money economy, entailing countless changes both in the actual status and in the menial and moral complexion of the various sections of its population. They are therefore convinced that the conditions necessary for the rise of a new and beneficial \u2018reglementation\u2019 of the country\u2019s economic life cannot develop out of the survivals of a reglementation which was adapted to a natural economy and serfdom, and can only evolve in such an atmosphere of wide and comprehensive freedom from the old reglementation as exists in the advanced countries of Western Europe and America. That is how matters stand with the question of \u2018reglementation\u2019 in the dispute between the Narodniks and their opponents\u201d (pp. -, loc. cit.). This attitude of the Narodniks to \u201cthe survivals of the old reglementation is, perhaps, their most flagrant departure from the traditions of the \u201cheritage.\u201d The representatives of this heritage were, as we have seen, distinguished by their ineradicable and fierce aversion for every survival of the old reglementation. Consequently, in this respect the \u201cdisciples\u201d are incomparably closer to the \u201ctraditions\u201d and \u201cheritage\u201d of the sixties than the Narodniks are.\n\nIn addition to the highly important error of the Narodniks mentioned above, their lack of sociological realism impels them to a specific manner of thinking and reasoning about social affairs and problems which might be called narrow intellectual self-conceit or, perhaps, the bureaucratic mentality. The Narodnik is always dilating on the path \u201cwe\u201d should choose for our country, the misfortunes that would arise if \u201cwe\u201d directed the country along such-and-such a path, the prospects \u201cwe\u201d could ensure ourselves if we avoided the dangers of the path old Europe has taken, if- we \u201ctake what is good\u201d both from Europe and from our ancient village-community system, and so on and so forth. Hence the Narodnik\u2019s complete distrust and contempt for the independent trends of the various social classes which are shaping history in accordance with their own interests. Hence the amazing levity with which the Narodnik (forgetting the conditions surrounding him) advances all sorts of social projects, from the \u201corganisation of agricultural labour\u201d to the \u201ccommunalisation of production\u201d through the good offices of our \u201csociety.\u201d \u201cMit der Gr\u00fcndlichkeit der geschichtlichen Action wird also der Umfang der Masse zunehmen, deren Action sie ist\u201d[] \u2014these words express one of the profoundest and most important precepts of that historico-philosophical theory which our Narodniks will not and cannot understand. As man\u2019s history-making activity grows broader and deeper, the size of that mass of the population which is the conscious maker of history is bound to increase. The Narodnik, however, always regarded the population in general, and the working population in particular, as the object of this or that more or less sensible measure, as something to be directed along this or that path, and never regarded the various classes of the population as independent history-makers on the existing path, never asked which conditions of the present path might stimulate (or, on the contrary, paralyse) the independent and conscious activity of these history-makers.\n\nAnd so, although Narodism, by posing the question of capitalism in Russia, made a big step forward compared with the \u201cheritage\u201d of the enlighteners, the solution of the question it offered has proved so unsatisfactory, because of its petty-bourgeois outlook and sentimental criticism of capitalism, that on a number of cardinal questions of social life it lags behind the \u201cenlighteners.\u201d Narodism\u2019s association with the heritage and traditions of our enlighteners has proved in the end to be a drawback: the new questions with which Russian social thought has been confronted by Russia\u2019s post-Reform economic development, Narodism has not solved, confining itself to sentimental and reactionary lamentations over them; while Narodnik romanticism has obscured the old questions already posed by the enlighteners, thus retarding their full solution.\n\nIV\nThe \u201cEnlighteners,\u201d the Narodniks, and the \u201cDisciples\u201d\nWe may now sum up the results of our comparisons. Let us endeavour to give a brief description of the relationship in which each of the trends of social thought enumerated in the sub-title stands to the others.\n\nThe enlightener believes in the present course of social development, because he fails to observe its inherent contradictions. The Narodnik fears the present course of social development, because he is already aware of these contradictions. The \u201cdisciple\u201d believes in the present course of social development, because he sees the only earnest of a better future in the full development of these contradictions. The first and last trends therefore strive to support, accelerate, facilitate development along the present path, to remove all obstacles which hamper this development and retard it. Narodism, on the contrary, strives to retard and halt this development, is afraid of abolishing certain obstacles to the development of capitalism. The first and last trends are distinguished by what may be called historical optimism: the farther and the quicker things go as they are, the better it will be. Narodism, on the contrary, naturally tends to historical pessimism: the farther things go as they are, the worse it will be. The \u201cenlighteners\u201d never posed questions concerning the character of post-Reform development and confined themselves exclusively to warring against the survivals of the pre-Reform system, to the negative task of clearing the way for a European type of development in Russia. Narodism posed the question of capitalism in Russia, but answered it in the sense that capitalism is reactionary, and therefore could not wholly accept the heritage of the enlighteners: the Narodniks always warred against people who in general strove to Europeanise Russia from the standpoint of a \u201csingle civilisation\u201d; warred against them not only because they, the Narodniks, could not confine themselves to these people\u2019s ideals (such a war would have been lust), but because they did not want to go so far in the development of this, i.e., capitalist, civilisation. The \u2018disciples\u201d answer the question of capitalism in Russia in the sense that it is progressive, and they therefore not only can, but must, accept the heritage of the enlighteners in its entirety, supplementing it with an analysis of the contradictions of capitalism from the standpoint of the property-less producers. The enlighteners did not single out any one class of the population for special attention; they not only spoke of the people in general, but even of the nation in general. The Narodniks were desirous of representing the interests of labour, but they did not point to any definite groups in the contemporary economic system; actually, they always took the standpoint of the small producer, whom capitalism converts into a commodity producer. The \u201cdisciples\u201d not only take the interests of labour as their criterion, but in doing so point to quite definite economic groups in the capitalist economy, namely, the propertyless producers. By the nature of their aims, the first and last trends correspond to the interests of the classes which are created and developed by capitalism; Narodism, by its nature, corresponds to the interests of the class of small producers, the petty bourgeoisie, which occupies an intermediate position among the classes of contemporary society. Consequently, Narodism\u2019s contradictory attitude to the \u201cheritage\u201d is not accidental, but is a necessary result of the very nature of the Narodnik views: we have seen that one of the basic features of the enlighteners\u2019 views was the ardent desire to Europeanise Russia, but the Narodniks cannot possibly share this desire fully without ceasing to be Narodniks.\n\nWe have in the end arrived at the conclusion which we have repeatedly indicated above in particular instances namely, that the disciples are much more consistent and faithful guardians of the heritage than the Narodniks As far from renouncing the heritage, they consider it one of their principal duties to refute the romantic and petty-bourgeois fears which induce the Narodniks on very many and very important points to reject the European ideals of the enlighteners. But it goes without saying that the \u201cdisciples\u201d do not guard the heritage in the way an archivist guards an old document. Guarding the heritage does not mean confining oneself to the heritage, and the \u2018disciples\u201d add to their defence of the general ideals of Europeanism an analysis of the contradictions implicit in our capitalist development, and an assessment of this development from the specific standpoint indicated above.\n\nV\nMr. Mikhailovsky on the \u201cDisciples\u201d\u2019 Renunciation of the Heritage\nLet us, in conclusion, return to Mr. Mikhailovsky and examine his statements on the subject under consideration. Not only does Mr. Mikhailovsky declare that these people (the disciples) \u201cdo not acknowledge any continuity with the past and emphatically renounce the heritage\u201d (loc. cit., ); he also affirms that \u201cthey\u201d (together with other persons of the most diverse trends, up to and including Mr. Abramov, Mr. Volynsky and Mr. Rozanov) \u201churl themselves against the heritage with the greatest fury\u201d (). To which heritage is Mr. Mikhailovsky referring? To the heritage of the sixties and seventies, the heritage which Moskovskiye Vedomosti solemnly renounced and renounces ().\n\nWe have already said that if it is a question of the \u201cheritage\u201d that has fallen to the people of today, then one must distinguish between two heritages: one is the heritage of the enlighteners in general, of the people who were absolutely hostile to the whole pre-Reform order, who stood for European ideals and for the interests of the broad mass of the population. The other heritage is Narodism. We have already shown that to confuse these two different things would be a gross error, for everyone knows that there have been, and still are, people who guard the \u201ctraditions of the sixties\u201d but have nothing in common with Narodism. All Mr. Mikhailovsky\u2019s observations are founded wholly and exclusively upon a confusion of these totally different heritages. And since Mr. Mikhailovsky must be aware of this difference, his sally is not only absurd, but definitely slanderous. Did Moskovskiye Vedomosti hurl itself against Narodism specifically? Not at all: it hurled itself no less, if not more, against the enlighteners in general, and Vestnik Yevropy, which absolutely abhors Narodism, is in its eyes no less an enemy than the Narodnik Russkoye Bogatstvo. Moskovskiye Vedomosti would, of course, disagree on many points with the Narodniks who most emphatically renounce the heritage\u2014Yuzov, for example\u2014but it would hardly hurl itself against him with fury, and in any case, it would praise him for that which distinguishes him from the Narodniks who desire to guard the heritage. Did Mr. Abramov or Mr. Volynsky hurl himself against Narodism? Not at all. The former is himself a Narodnik; and both hurled themselves against the enlighteners in general. Did the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d hurl themselves against the Russian enlighteners? Did they ever renounce the heritage which enjoins unreserved hostility to the pre-Reform way of life and its survivals? Far from hurling themselves against it, they denounced the Narodniks for desiring to maintain some of these survivals out of a petty-bourgeois fear of capitalism. Did they ever hurl themselves against the heritage which enjoins European ideals generally? Far from hurling themselves against it, they denounced the Narodniks because on many very important issues, instead of espousing general European ideals, they concoct the most arrant nonsense about Russia\u2019s exceptional character. Did they ever hurl themselves against the heritage which enjoins concern for the interests of the labouring masses of the population? Far from hurling themselves against it, they denounced the Narodniks because their concern for these interests is inconsistent (owing to their confirmed tendency to lump together the peasant bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat); because the value of their concern is diminished by their habit of dreaming of what might be, instead of turning their attention to what is; because their concern is extremely circumscribed, since they have never been able properly to appraise the conditions (economic and other) which make it easier or harder for these people to care for their own interests themselves.\n\nMr. Mikhailovsky may not agree with these denunciations\u2014being a Narodnik, he certainly will not agree with them\u2014 but to assert that certain people \u201cfuriously\u201d attack the \u2018heritage of the sixties and the seventies,\u201d when, actually, they \u201cfuriously\u201d attack only Narodism, and attack it for having failed to solve the new problems posed by post-Reform history in the spirit of this heritage and without contradicting it\u2014such an assertion is a direct misrepresentation of the truth.\n\nMr. Mikhailovsky most amusingly complains that the \u201cdisciples\u201d readily confuse \u201cus\u201d (i.e., the Russkoye Bogatstvo writers) with the \u201cNarodniks\u201d and other persons who have no connection with Russkoye Bogatstvo\u2019 (p. ). This curious attempt at dissociation from the \u201cNarodniks,\u201d while at the same time preserving all the basic views of Narodism, can evoke nothing but laughter. Everyone knows that all the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d employ the words \u201cNarodnik\u201d and \u201cNarodism\u201d in the broad sense. That there are quite a number of different shades among the Narodniks has not been forgotten or denied by anybody: in their books neither P. Struve nor N. Beltov, for instance, \u201cconfused\u201d Mr. N. Mikhailovsky with Mr. V. V., or even for that matter with Mr. Yuzhakov; that is, they did not gloss over the differences between them, or ascribe the views of one to the other. P. B. Struve even expressly drew attention to the difference between Mr. Yuzhakov\u2019s views and those of Mr. Mikhailovsky. It is one thing to confuse different views; it is another to generalise and class in one category writers who, despite their differences on many questions, are at one on the fundamental and principal points, points which the \u201cdisciples\u201d oppose. What is important for the \u201cdisciple\u201d is not to show the worthlessness of the views which distinguish, for instance, a Mr. Yuzov from the other Narodniks, but to refute the views common to Mr. Yuzov and Mr. Mikhailovsky and all the Narodniks in general\u2014that is, their attitude to Russia\u2019s capitalist evolution, their discussion of economic and social problems from the standpoint of the small producer, their failure to understand social (or historical) materialism. These features are the common property of a whole trend of social thought which has played a big historical role. This broad trend contains the most varied shades: right and left flanks, people who have sunk to nationalism and anti-semitism, etc., and people who are not guilty of these things; people who have been contemptuous of many of the behests of the \u201cheritage,\u201d and people who have striven their utmost (that is, the utmost possible to a Narodnik) to guard these behests. Not one of the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d has denied these differences of shade; not one of them has Mr. Mikhailovsky been able to convict of ascribing the views of a Narodnik of one shade to a Narodnik of another shade. But since we oppose the fundamental views common to all these different shades, why should we be expected to speak of partial differences within the general trend? That, surely, is an absolutely senseless demand! Long before the appearance of the \u201cdisciples,\u201d our literature had noted many times that writers who were far from unanimous on everything held common views on Russia\u2019n capitalism, the peasant \u201ccommunity,\u201d the almighty power of so-called \u201csociety,\u201d and not only noted it, but praised it as a happy peculiarity of Russia. Again, in its broad sense, the term \u201cNarodism\u201d was employed in our literature long before the appearance of the \u201cdisciples.\u201d Not only did Mr. Mikhailovsky contribute for many years to a journal along with the \u201cNarodnik\u201d (in the narrow sense) Mr. V. V., but the outlook of both bore the same fundamental features mentioned above. Though, both in the eighties and the nineties, he objected to some of Mr. V. V.\u2019s conclusions, and denied the correctness of his excursions into the field of abstract sociology, Mr. Mikhailovsky, both in the eighties and the nineties, made the reservation that his criticism was not directed against Mr. V. V.\u2019s economic works, that he was at one with his basic views on Russian capitalism. Consequently, if the pillars of Russkoye Bogatstvo, who have done so much to develop, reinforce and disseminate the views of Narodism (in the broad sense), now think that they can escape the criticism of the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d simply by declaring that they are not \u201cNarodniks\u201d (in the narrow sense), that they constitute a quite specific \u201cethico-social school\u201d\u2014such subterfuges, of course, can only expose to justified ridicule people who are so brave and at the same time so diplomatic.\n\nOn p.  of his article, Mr. Mikhailovsky also levels the following phenomenal argument against the \u201cdisciples.\u201d Mr. Kamensky venomously attacks the Narodniks[]; that, you see, \u201cindicates that he is angry, which he is not entitled (sic!!) to be. We, the \u2018subjective oldsters,\u2019 as well as the \u2018subjective youngsters, can permit ourselves this weakness without being guilty of self-contradiction, But the representatives of a doctrine which \u2018prides itself on its inexorable objectivity\u2019 \u201c (the expression of one of the \u201cdisciples\u201d) \u201care in a different position.\u201d\n\nWhat is this?! If people insist that views on social phenomena must be based upon an inexorably objective analysis of realities and the real course of development, then it follows that they are not entitled to be angry?! Why, this is utter twaddle, the sheer gibberish! Have you not heard, Mr. Mikhailovsky, that the famous work on Capital is considered to be one of the finest specimens of inexorable objectivity in the investigation of social phenomena? It is precisely the inexorable objectivity of the work that is regarded by many scientists and economists as its principal and basic defect. Yet rarely will you find in a scientific work so much \u201cfeeling,\u201d so much heated and passionate polemical attacks on representatives of backward views, on representatives of the social classes which, in the author\u2019s convinced opinion, are hampering social development. A writer who shows with inexorable objectivity that the opinions of Proudhon, say, are a natural, understandable and inevitable reflexion of the views and sentiments of the French petit bourgeois, nevertheless \u201churls himself\u201d against that ideologist of the petty bourgeoisie with tremendous passion and fiery wrath. Does Mr. Mikhailovsky believe that Marx is here guilty of \u201cself-contradiction\u201d? If a certain doctrine demands of everyone taking part in public life an inexorably objective analysis of realities and of the relationships between the various classes arising from these realities, by what miracle can the conclusion be drawn from this that they must not sympathise, are \u201cnot entitled\u201d to sympathise with one or another class? It is ridiculous in this connection even to talk of duty, for no living person can help taking the side of one class or another (once he has understood their interrelationships), can help rejoicing at the successes of that class and being disappointed by its failures, can help being angered by those who are hostile to that class, who hamper its development by disseminating backward views, and so on and so forth. Mr. Mikhailovsky\u2019s nonsensical sally only shows that he still fails to grasp the very elementary distinction between determinism and fatalism.\n\n\u201c\u2018Capital is coming\u2019!\u2014that is certain,\u201d writes Mr. Mikhailovsky,\u2014\u201dbut (sic) the question is, how shall we greet it\u201d (p. ).\n\nMr. Mikhailovsky makes a great discovery, points to a \u201cquestion\u201d to which the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d have evidently given no thought whatever! As though it were not on this question that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d have parted ways with the Narodniks! One can \u201cgreet\u201d the capitalism developing in Russia only in two ways: one can regard it either as progressive, or as retrogressive; either as a step forward on the right road, or as a deviation from the true path; one can assess it either from the standpoint of the class of small producers which capitalism destroys, or from the standpoint of the class of propertyless producers which capitalism creates. There is no middle way.[] Consequently, if Mr. Mikhailovsky denies the correctness of the attitude to capitalism which the \u201cdisciples\u201d insist on, it means that he accepts the Narodnik attitude which he has many a time expressed quite definitely in his earlier articles. He has not made any additions or amendments to his old views on this subject, and continues to remain a Narodnik. But nothing of the kind! He is not a Narodnik, heaven forbid He is a representative of an \u201cethico-sociological school.\u201d...\n\n\u201cLet no one talk,\u201d Mr. Mikhailovsky continues, \u201cof those future (??) benefits which the further development of capitalism will (?) bring.\u201d\n\nMr. Mikhailovsky is no Narodnik. He only reiterates all the Narodniks\u2019 errors and fallacious methods of argument. How many times have the Narodniks been told that this talk of the \u201cfuture\u201d is wrong, that it is not a question of \u201cfuture,\u201d but of actual progressive changes already taking place in the pre-capitalist relationships\u2014changes which the development of capitalism in Russia is bringing (not, will bring). By transplanting the question to the \u201cfuture,\u201d Mr. Mikhailovsky in point of fact takes for granted the very assertions which the \u2018disciples\u201d contest. He takes it for granted that in reality, in what is taking place under our eyes, the development of capitalism is not bringing any progressive changes into the old socio-economic relations. This is what constitutes the Narodnik view, and it is against this that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d argue and demonstrate that the contrary is true. There is not a book put out by the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d which does not affirm and demonstrate that the replacement of labour service by wage-labour in agriculture, and the replacement of what is called \u201chandicraft\u201d industry by factory industry, is a real phenomenon which is taking place (and, moreover, at a tremendous speed) now, under our eyes, and not merely \u201cin the future\u201d; that this change is in all respects progressive, that it is breaking down routine, disunited, small-scale hand production which has been immobile and stagnant for ages; that it is increasing the productivity of social labour, and thereby creating the possibility of higher living standards for the working man; that it is also creating the conditions which convert this possibility into a necessity\u2014namely, by converting the \u201csettled proletarian\u201d lost in the \u201cbackwoods,\u201d settled physically and morally, into a mobile proletarian, and by converting Asiatic forms of labour, with their infinitely developed bondage and diverse forms of personal dependence, into European forms of labour; that \u201cthe European manner of thought and feeling is no less necessary (note, necessary. V. I.) for the effective utilisation of machines than steam, coal, techniques,\u201d[] etc. All this, we repeat, is affirmed and demonstrated by every \u201cdisciple,\u201d but, presumably, does not apply to Mr. Mikhailovsky \u201cand company\u201d; all this is only written against \u201cNarodniks\u201d who are \u201cnot connected\u201d with Russkoye Bogatstvo. Russkoye Bogatstvo, you see, is an \u201cethico-sociological school,\u201d whose essence is that it serves up the old rubbish under a new guise.\n\nAs we observed above, the purpose of this article is to refute the allegation so widespread \u2018in the liberal-Narodnik press that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d abjure the \u201cheritage,\u201d break with the best traditions of the best section of Russian society, and so forth. It is not without interest to observe that, in reiterating these hackneyed phrases, Mr. Mikhailovsky in point of fact says exactly the same thing as was said much earlier and much more emphatically by a \u201cNarodnik\u201d \u201cnot connected\u201d with Russkoye Bogatstvo\u2014Mr. V. V. Are you familiar, dear reader, with the articles which this writer contributed to Nedelya[] three years ago, at the close of , in reply to P. B. Struve\u2019s book? If you are not, I must confess that, in my opinion, you have lost absolutely nothing. The basic idea of these articles, is that the \u201cRussian disciples\u201d are breaking the democratic thread which runs through all the progressive trends of Russian social thought. Is this not exactly what Mr. Mikhailovsky says, only in somewhat different terms, when he accuses the \u201cdisciples\u201d of renouncing the \u201cheritage,\u201d against which Moskovskiye Vedomosti hurls itself with fury? Actually, as we have seen, the inventors of this allegation blame others for their own sins when they assert that the \u201cdisciples\u201d\u2019 irrevocable break with Narodism signifies a break with the best traditions of the best section of Russian society. Is it not the other way round, sirs? Does not such a break signify that these best traditions are being purged of Narodism? Chapter VIII. The Formation of the Home Market\nWe now have to sum up the data examined in the preceding chapters and to try to give an idea of the interdependence of the various spheres of the national economy in their capitalist development.\n\nI. The Growth of Commodity Circulation\nIt is well known that commodity circulation precedes commodity production and constitutes one of the conditions (but not the sole condition) of the rise of the latter. In the present work we have confined ourselves to an examination of data on commodity and capitalist production, and for that reason do not intend to deal in detail with the important problem of the growth of commodity circulation in post-Reform Russia. In order to give a general idea of how rapidly the home market has grown, the following brief data will suffice.\n\nThe length of the Russian railway system increased from , kilometres in  to , km. in ,[] i.e., more than -fold. Similar progress was made by Britain in a longer period (\u2013, km.; \u2013, km., a -fold increase), by Germany in a shorter period (\u2013 , km.; \u2013, km., a -fold increase). The length of new railway opened per year differed considerably in different periods; for example, in the  years - , versts of new railway were opened and in the  years -, only ,.[] The extent of this fluctuation enables us to judge what an enormous reserve army of unemployed is required by capitalism, which now expands, and then contracts the demand for labour. There have been two boom periods in railway development in Russia: the end of the s (and the beginning of the s), and the latter half of the s. From  to , the average annual increase in the length of the Russian railway system was , kilometres, and from  to , about , kilometres.\n\nThe amount of railway freight carried was as follows: \u2013 million poods; \u2014, million poods; \u2014, million poods; \u2014, million poods; \u2014, million poods; \u2014 , million poods. No less rapid has been the growth of passenger traffic: \u2014. million passengers; \u2013.; \u2013.; \u2014.; \u2014 .; \u2014. million.[]\n\nThe development of water transport is as follows (data for the whole of Russia):[]\n\nDevelopment of water transport\nThe amount of freight carried on inland waterways in European Russia in  was . million poods; in \u2014,. million poods; in \u2014, million poods. The value of these freights was . million rubles; . million rubles;  million rubles.\n\nRussia\u2019s merchant marine in  consisted of  steamers with a capacity of , lasts,[] and of  sailing ships with a capacity of , lasts; and in  of  steamers with a capacity of , lasts.[]\n\nThe development of mercantile shipping at all ports on the outer seas was as follows: during the five years - the number of homeward plus outward bound vessels averaged ,, with a total capacity of ,, tons; for the period - it averaged , vessels (+%) with a total capacity of ,, tons (+%). Capacity, therefore, increased  / times. In  years (from  to ) capacity grew .-fold, and if we take Russian and foreign vessels separately, it is seen that during these  years the number of the former grew .-fold (from  to ,), while their capacity grew .-fold (from , tons to ,, tons), whereas the number of the latter grew by % (from , to ,) and their capacity .-fold (from ,, tons to ,, tons).[] Let us remark that the capacity of homeward and outward bound vessels also fluctuates very considerably from year to year (e.g., \u2014 million tons; \u2014. million tons), and these fluctuations enable us to gauge in part the fluctuations in the demand for unskilled labourers, dockers, etc. Here, too, capitalism requires the existence of a mass of people always in want of work and ready at the first call to accept it, however casual it may be.\n\nThe development of foreign trade can be seen from the following data:[]\n\nDevelopment of foreign trade\nThe following data give a general idea of the volume of bank turnover and capital accumulation. Total withdrawals from the State Bank rose from  million rubles in - ( million rubles in -) to  million rubles in -, and total deposits on current account from  million rubles in - to , million rubles in \u2013.[] The turnover of loan and savings societies and banks (rural and industrial) grew from  / million rubles in  (. million rubles in ) to . million rubles in ., and . million rubles in .[] Mortgages increased from  to  as follows: the assessment of mortgaged land rose from , million rubles to , million rubles, and total loans from  million rubles to , million rubles.[] The operations of savings banks grew particularly in the s and s. In  there were  savings banks, in \u2014, (of which , were post-office banks). In , deposits amounted to . million rubles, in  to . million rubles. Balance on account at the end of the year totalled . million rubles in , and . million rubles in . The annual capital increase is particularly striking in the famine years  and  (. and . million rubles), and in the last two years (\u2014. million rubles; \u2014. mil lion rubles).[]\n\nThe latest statistics show an even greater development of the savings banks. In , over the whole of Russia there were , savings banks with . million depositors and total deposits of ,. million rubles. Incidentally, in this country both the old Narodniks and the new opportunists in the socialist movement have frequently been very na\\\"ive (to put it mildly) in talking about the increase in the number of savings banks constituting a sign of the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d well-being. It will perhaps not be out of place, therefore, to compare the distribution of savings-bank deposits in Russia () with that of France (. Information from Bulletin de l\u2019Office du travail, , No. ).\n\nDeposits\nWhat a wealth of material there is here for Narodnik-Revisionist-Cadet apologists! It is interesting, in passing, to note that in Russia deposits are also divided into  groups according to the occupations and professions of depositors. It appears that the largest sum of deposits\u2014. million rubles\u2014is that of persons engaged in agriculture and rural industries, and these deposits are growing with particular rapidity. The village is becoming civilised, and to make the muzhik\u2019s ruin a source of business is becoming increasingly profitable.\n\nBut let us return to our immediate theme. As we see, the data indicate an enormous growth of commodity circulation and capital accumulation. How the field for the employment of capital in all branches of the national economy was created and how merchant\u2019s capital was transformed into industrial capital, i.e., was directed into production and created capitalist relationships between those taking part in production, has been shown above.\n\nNotes\n[] Uebersichten der Weltwirtschaft (Surveys of World Economy. \u2013Ed.), loc. cit.

The Growth of the Commercial and Industrial Population\nWe have stated above that the growth of the industrial population at the expense of the agricultural is a requisite phenomenon of every capitalist society. In what way the separation of industry from agriculture steadily takes place has also been examined, and now all that remains is to sum up on this question.\n\n) The Growth of the Towns\nThe most striking expression of the process under examination is the growth of the towns. Here are data on this growth in European Russia ( gubernias) in the post Reform period[]:\n\nPopulation\nV. I. Lenin\u2019s grouping of towns in European Russia according to the population census of \nThus, the percentage of urban population is constantly growing, that is, the population is being diverted from agriculture into commercial and industrial occupations.[] The population of the towns is growing twice as fast as that of the rest of the country: from  to  the total population increased .%, the rural .%, while the urban increased %. Over a period of  years (-) \u201cthe influx, at a minimum, of the rural population into the towns\u201d was  / million persons, according to Mr. V. Mikhailovsky\u2019s estimate,[] i.e., more than , per annum.\n\nThe population of towns that are important industrial and commercial centres is growing much more rapidly than the urban population generally. The number of towns with , and more inhabitants more than trebled between  and  ( and ). In , of the total urban population only about % (. million out of .) were concentrated in such large centres; in  it was nearly % (. million out of .),[] and in  it was already more than half, about % (. million out of  million). In the s, therefore, the smaller towns provided the general pattern of the urban population, but in the s they were completely outweighed by the big cities. The population of the  towns that had been the biggest in  increased from . million inhabitants to . million, i.e., by %, whereas the overall urban population increased by only % . Hence, the enormous growth of large industrial centres and the emergence of a large number of new centres is one of the most characteristic features of the post-Reform period.\n\n) The Significance of Home Colonisation\nAs we have pointed out above (Chapter I, \u00a7 II, p. ), theory deduces the law that the industrial population grows at the expense of the agricultural from the fact that in industry variable capital increases absolutely (the growth of variable capital means a growth of the number of industrial workers and a growth of the total commercial and industrial population), whereas in agriculture the \u201cvariable capital required for the exploitation of a certain plot of land decreases absolutely.\u201d \u201cIt can thus only increase,\u201d Marx adds, \u201cto the extent that new land is taken into cultivation, but this again requires as a prerequisite a still greater growth of the non-agricultural population.\u201d[] Hence it is clear that the growth of the industrial population is a phenomenon observable in its pure form only when we have before us an already populated territory in which all the land is already occupied. The inhabitants of such a territory, when forced-out of agriculture by capitalism, have no other alternative but to migrate to the industrial centres or to other countries. But the situation is essentially different when we have before us a territory in which not all the land is occupied, and which is not yet fully populated. The inhabitants of such a territory, when forced out of agriculture in a populated area, may remove to an unpopulated part of that territory and set about \u201ctaking new land into cultivation.\u201d The result will be an increase in the agricultural population, and this increase may be (for some time) no less, if not more, rapid than the increase in the industrial population. In that case, we have before us two different processes: ) the development of capitalism in the old, populated country or part of the country; ) the development of capitalism on \u201cnew land.\u201d The first process expresses the further development of established capitalist relationships; the second, the rise of new capitalist relationships on new territory. The first process means the development of capitalism in depth, the second, in breadth. Obviously, to confuse these two processes must inevitably lead to a wrong conception of the process which diverts the population from agriculture to commercial and industrial occupations.\n\nPost-Reform Russia affords us an example of the two processes going on simultaneously. At the beginning of the post-Reform period, in the s, the southern and eastern outer regions of European Russia were largely unpopulated, and there was an enormous influx into those areas of migrants from the central agricultural part of Russia. It was this formation of a new agricultural population on new territory that to some extent obscured the parallel process of the diversion of the population from agriculture to industry. To get a clear picture, from data on the urban population, of the specific feature of Russia here described, we must divide the  gubernias of European Russia into separate groups. We give data on the urban population in  areas of European Russia in  and in  (see p. ).\n\nPopulation\nAs far as the question that interests us is concerned, the greatest importance attaches to three areas: ) the non-agricultural industrial area (the  gubernias in the first two groups, including the  metropolitan gubernias).[] This is an area from which migration to other areas has been very slight. ) The central agricultural area (the  gubernias in group ). Migration from this area has been very consider able, partly to the previous area, but mainly to the next. ) The agricultural outer regions (the  gubernias in group ) constitute an area that has been colonised in the post-Reform period. The percentage of urban population in all these  gubernias differs very little, as the table shows, from the percentage of urban population in European Russia as a whole.\n\nIn the first area, the non-agricultural or industrial, we observe a particularly rapid rise in the percentage of urban population: from .% to .%. The growth of the rural population is here very slight, being little more than half of that for the whole of Russia. The growth of the urban population, on the other hand, is considerably above the average (% as against %). If Russia is to be compared with West-European industrial countries (as is often done here), then these countries should be compared with just this one area, for it alone has conditions approximately similar to those of the industrial capitalist countries.\n\nIn the second, the central agricultural area, we see a different picture. The percentage of urban population here is very low and grows with less than average rapidity. The increase in the population between  and , both urban and rural, was much below the average for Russia. This is to be explained by the vast stream of migrants from this area to the border regions. According to Mr. V. Mikhailovsky\u2019s calculations, between  and  nearly  million people, or more than one-tenth of the population left these parts.[]\n\nIn the third area, the outer regions, we see that the percentage of urban population underwent an increase that was slightly below the average (from .% to .%, i.e., in the proportion of  : , whereas the average is from . to ., i.e., in the proportion of  : ). And yet the absolute growth of the urban population here, far from being less, was considerably above the average (+% as against +%). The diversion of population from agriculture to industry has, consequently, been very intense, but it is hidden by the enormous growth of the agricultural population as a result of influx: in this area the rural population increased by %, as against an average for Russia of .%. In certain gubernias this obscuring of the process of the industrialisation of the population is still more striking. For instance, in Taurida Gubernia the percentage of urban population was the same in  as in  (.%), and in Kherson Gubernia actually declined (from .% to .%), although the growth of the towns in both the gubernias was not far behind that of the metropolitan cities (+%, +%, as against +% in the two metropolitan gubernias). The rise of a new agricultural population on new territory thus leads, in turn, to a still greater growth of the non-agricultural population.\n\n) The Growth of Factory and of Commercial and Industrial Townships and Villages\nIn addition to the towns, the following have the significance of industrial centres: firstly, suburbs, which are not always counted with the towns and which are spreading in an increasing area around the big towns; and secondly, factory townships and villages. Such industrial centres[] are particularly numerous in the industrial gubernias where the percentage of urban population is extremely low.[] The above table containing the data, by areas, of the town population shows that in the  industrial gubernias the percentage in  was .% and in , .%. The fact is that the commercial and industrial population of these gubernias is concentrated mainly, not in towns, but in industrial villages. Among the \u201ctowns\u201d of Vladimir, Kostroma, Nizhni-Novgorod and other gubernias there are not a few with less than ,, , or even , inhabitants, where as there are numerous \u201cvillages\u201d in each of which there are ,, , or , factory workers alone. In the post-Reform period, rightly observes the compiler of the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. II., ),\u201cthe towns have begun to grow still faster, and in addition there has been the growth of settlements of a new type, a type of factory centre midway between the town and the village.\u201d We have cited data showing the enormous growth of these centres and the number of factory workers concentrated in them. We have seen that there are quite a few centres of this kind throughout Russia, not only in the industrial gubernias, but also in the South. In the Urals the percentage of urban population is lowest: in Vyatka and Perm gubernias it was .% in  and .% in . But here is an example of the relative size of the \u201curban\u201d and the industrial populations: in Krasnoufimsk Uyezd, Perm Gubernia, the urban population numbers , (), whereas according to the Zemstvo census of -, the population of the industrial section of the uyezd numbers ,, of whom , do not engage in agriculture at all, and only , obtain their livelihood mainly from the land. In Ekaterinburg Uyezd, according to the Zemstvo census, , inhabitants are landless and , have only meadow land. Hence, the industrial non-urban population of two uyezds alone is larger than the urban population of the whole gubernia (in  it was ,!).\n\nFinally, in addition to factory settlements, the significance of industrial centres attaches to the trading and industrial villages, which are either at the head of large handicraft districts, or have developed rapidly since the Reform, owing to their situation on the banks of rivers, near railway stations, etc. Several examples of such villages were given in Chapter VI, \u00a7 II, and we saw that, like the towns, they attract the rural population, and that they are usually marked by a level of literacy among the population above the average.[] As a further example let us quote data on Voronezh Gubernia in order to show the relative importance of urban and non-urban industrial and commercial centres of population. The Combined Returns for Voronezh Gubernia gives a combined table classifying the villages in  uyezds of the gubernia. In these uyezds there are  towns, with a population of , (in ). Of the villages, on the other hand,  stand out with , households, and with , inhabitants, i.e., they are much bigger than the towns. In  these villages there are  commercial and  industrial establishments. Of the total households, % do not cultivate at all, % cultivate by neighbour-hire or on a half-crop basis, % have neither draught animals nor implements, % buy grain all year round, % engage in industries. By placing the entire population of these centres in the category of commercial and industrial, we not only do not exaggerate, but rather minimise, the size of the latter, for altogether in these  uyezds , households cultivate no land at all. Nevertheless, in the agricultural gubernia we have taken, the commercial and industrial population outside the towns turns out to be not less than that inside the towns.\n\n) Non-Agricultural Outside Employments\nBut even if we add to the towns the factory and commercial and industrial villages and townships we are far from exhausting the total industrial population of Russia. The lack of freedom of movement and the social-estate exclusiveness of the village community fully explain the remarkable characteristic of Russia that we have to include no small part of the rural population in its industrial population, that part which obtains its livelihood by working in industrial centres and spends part of the year in these centres. We refer to the so-called non-agricultural \u201coutside employments.\u201d From the official point of view, these \u201cindustrialists\u201d are peasant farmers who merely have \u201csubsidiary employments,\u201d and the majority of the Narodnik economists have, without further ado, adopted that viewpoint. There is no need, after what has been said above, to prove in detail how unsound it is. At all events, however much opinions on it may vary, there cannot be the slightest doubt that it indicates a diversion of the population from agriculture into commercial and industrial occupations.[] How far this fact changes our idea of the size of the industrial population in the towns may be seen from the following example. In Kaluga Gubernia the percentage of urban population is much lower than the average for Russia (.%, as against .%). Now the Statistical Survey of that gubernia for  calculates, on the basis of passport data, the total number of months during which migratory workers were absent from their homes. It appears that the total is ,, months; divided by  this will give an absent population of , persons, i.e., \u201cnearly % of the total population \u201d (loc. cit., )! Add this number to the urban population (in \u2014,), and the percentage of industrial population will be a very considerable one.\n\nOf course, a certain part of the migratory non-agricultural workers are registered among the existing town population, and are also part of the population of the non-urban industrial centres to which we have already referred. But only a part, for owing to the mobile character of this section of the population, it is difficult to cover them by any local census; furthermore, population censuses are usually taken in the winter, whereas most of these industrial workers leave their homes in the spring. Here are data for some of the principal gubernias of non-agricultural migration.[]\nPercentage distribution of residential permits issued.\nThe number of passports issued reaches the maximum everywhere in the spring. Hence, a large part of the temporarily absent workers are not included in the censuses of the towns.[] But these temporary town-dwellers may also more legitimately be assigned to the urban rather than the rural population. \u201cA family which gets its livelihood throughout the year, or during the greater part of it, in the town has far more reason to regard the town, which provides its subsistence, as its place of domicile than the village, with which it has only family and fiscal ties.\u201d[] The enormous significance these fiscal ties have to this day can be seen from the fact, for instance, that among migratory Kostroma people \u201cit is a rare thing for peasants to get for it [the land] some small part of the taxes to be paid; usually they lease it on the sole condition that the tenants put it to use, the owner himself paying all the taxes\u201d (D. Zhbankov, Women\u2019s Country, Kostroma, , p. ). In the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. II, Yaroslavl, ), we also find repeated references to migratory industrial workers having to purchase their release from their villages and allotments (pp. , , , ,  and others).[]\n\nHow many migratory non-agricultural workers are there? The number of people engaged in all kinds of industries employing migratory workers is not less than from  to  millions. In fact, in , about . million passports and identity cards were issued in European Russia,[] and passport revenue grew between  and  by more than one-third (from . to . million rubles). In  the total number of passports and cards issued in Russia was ,, (of which ,, were issued in the  gubernias of European Russia). In  the number was ,, (European Russia, ,,).[] The number of workers superfluous (as compared with local demand) in European Russia has been estimated by Mr. S. Korolenko at . million. Above we have seen (Chapter III, \u00a7 IX, p. ) that in  agricultural gubernias the number of passports issued exceeded Mr. Korolenko\u2019s estimate ( million as against . million). Now we can add the data for  non-agricultural gubernias: Mr. Korolenko sets the number of superfluous workers in these at ,,, while the number of passports issued was ,,.[] Thus, in  gubernias of European Russia ( black-earth, plus  non-black earth) there are, according to Mr. Korolenko,  million workers who are superfluous (as against the local demand). In the s, however, the number of passports and cards issued in these  gubernias was . million. In , these gubernias provided .% of the total passport revenue. Hence, the number of migratory workers in all probability exceeds  million. Finally, Zemstvo statistical data (most of which are obsolete) led Mr. Uvarov to the conclusion that Mr. Korolenko\u2019s figure was close to the truth, and that the figure of  million migratory workers was \u201cvery highly probable.\u201d[]\n\nThe question now arises: how large is the number of non-agricultural and of agricultural migratory workers? Mr. N.\u2013on very boldly and quite mistakenly asserts that \u201cthe overwhelming majority of peasant outside employments are agricultural\u201d (Sketches, p. ). Chaslavsky, whom Mr. N.\u2013on cites, expresses himself much more cautiously; he cites no data and limits himself to general remarks about the size of the areas which provide workers of one type or another. On the other hand, Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s railway passenger traffic data prove absolutely nothing, for non-agricultural workers also leave their homes mainly in spring and, moreover, use the railways much more than agricultural workers do.[] We presume, on the contrary, that the majority (although not the \u201coverwhelming\u201d majority) of the migratory workers are probably non-agricultural workers. This view is based, firstly, on data concerning the distribution of passport revenue, and, secondly, on Mr. Vesin\u2019s data. Years ago Flerovsky, on the basis of the returns for - showing the distribution of revenue from \u201cmiscellaneous duties\u201d (more than one-third of which was obtained from the issue of passports), drew the conclusion that the greatest movement of peasants in search of work was from the metropolitan and the non-agricultural gubernias.[] If we take the  non-agricultural gubernias which we combined above (part  of this section) into a single area, and which non-agricultural workers leave in large numbers, we shall see that these gubernias in  contained only .% of the population of all European Russia (in \u2014 .%), whereas they accounted for .% of the passport revenue in  (in \u2014.%).[] Non-agricultural workers are provided by very many other gubernias, and we must there fore conclude that agricultural workers constitute less than half of the migrants. Mr. Vesin divides  gubernias of European Russia (which account for % of the departure permits) into groups according to the different types of migration that predominate, and obtains the following results.[]\n\nNumber of departure permits issued.\n\u201cThese figures show that industries employing migratory workers are more prevalent in the first group than in the third. . . . These figures also show that there is a diversity in the duration of absence to secure employment corresponding to the difference in the groups. Where non-agricultural industries employing migratory workers predominate, the length of absence is much greater\u201d (Dyelo, , No. , p. ).\n\nFinally, the statistics given above for excise-paying trades, etc., enable us to classify the residential permits issued in all the  gubernias of European Russia. Making the indicated corrections to Mr. Vesin\u2019s classification, and distributing among these same groups the  gubernias for which figures are lacking for  (Olonets and Pskov gubernias to group I; the  Baltic and North-West gubernias to group II; and Astrakhan Gubernia to group III), we get the following picture:\n\nTotal residential permits issued.\n[]\n\nMigration for work away from home, according to these data, is much more prevalent in group I than in group III.\n\nThus, there can be no doubt that the mobility of the population is far greater in Russia\u2019s non-agricultural zone than in the agricultural. The number of non-agricultural migratory workers must be greater than that of the agricultural, and must be not less than three million.\n\nThe enormous and ever-increasing growth of migration is confirmed by all sources. Passport revenue increased from . million rubles in  (. million rubles in ) to . million rubles in -, i.e., it more than doubled. The number of passports and identity cards issued increased in Moscow Gubernia between  and  by % (males) and % (females); in Tver Gubernia, between  and  by .%, in Kaluga Gubernia, between  and  by % (and the number of months of absence by %); in Smolensk Gubernia, from , in  to , in  and , in ; in Pskov Gubernia, from , in - to , in  and to , in  (males). In Kostroma Gubernia, in , . passports and cards per  males were issued and . per  females, and in \u2014. and .. And so on and so forth.\n\nLike the diversion of the population from agriculture to the towns, non-agricultural migration is a progressive phenomenon. It tears the population out of the neglected, backward, history-forgotten remote spots and draws them into the whirlpool of modern social life. It increases literacy among the population,[] heightens their understanding,[] and gives them civilised habits and requirements.[] The peasants are induced to migrate by \u201cmotives of a higher order,\u201d i.e., by the greater smartness and polish of the Petersburger; they look for places where \u201cthings are better.\u201d \u201cLife and work in Petersburg are considered to be easier than in the country.\u201d[] \u201cAll country-folk are called raw, and the strange thing is that they are not in the least offended at this, but refer to themselves as such and complain that their parents did not send them to St. Petersburg to study. It should be stated, however, that these raw country people are not nearly so raw as those in the purely agricultural districts; they unconsciously copy the outward appearance and the habits of the Petersburgers; the light of the metropolis falls indirectly on them.\u201d[] In Yaroslavl Gubernia (apart from examples of people growing rich) \u201cthere is still another cause which drives everyone from his home. That is\u2014public opinion, which dubs a bumpkin to the end of his days anybody who has not lived in Peters burg, or somewhere else, but engages in agriculture or some handicraft, and such a man finds it hard to get a wife\u201d (Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia, II, ). Migration to the town elevates the peasant as a citizen, releasing him from the host of patriarchal and personal relationships of dependence and social-estate divisions so strongly entrenched in the rural districts....[] \u201cA prime factor that fosters migration is the growing sense of human dignity among the people. Liberation from serf dependence, and the long-standing association of the more active section of the rural population with town life, have long since roused the desire in the Yaroslavl peasant to uphold his \u2018ego,\u2019 to get away from the state of poverty and dependence to which rural life has doomed him, to a state of sufficiency, independence and respect. . . . The peasant who lives on outside earnings feels freer and more on a level of equality with people belonging to other social estates, which is why the rural youth are so eager to go to the town\u201d (Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia, II, -).\n\nMigration to the towns loosens the old patriarchal family ties and places women in a more independent position, on an equal footing with men. \u201cCompared with those in the localities of no migration, the families of Soligalich and Chukhloma\u201d (the uyezds of Kostroma Gubernia where migration is greatest) \u201care much less closely knit, not only in the sense of the patriarchal authority of the older, but even in the relations between parents and children, husband and wife. One cannot, of course, expect strong affection for their parents and attachment to the parental home from sons who are sent to Petersburg from the age of ; unconsciously they become cosmopolitans: \u2018where it is well, there is my country.\u2019\u201d[] \u201cAccustomed to dispense with the authority and assistance of her husband, the Soligalich woman is quite unlike the downtrodden peasant woman of the agricultural zone: she is independent and self-reliant. . . . Wife-beating is a rare exception here. . . . Generally speaking, equality between women and men is to be observed almost everywhere and in all things.\u201d[]\n\nLast but not least,[] non-agricultural migration raises the wages not only of the wage-workers who migrate but also of those who stay behind.\n\nThis fact is most strikingly reflected in the general circumstance that the non-agricultural gubernias where wages are higher than in the agricultural gubernias, attract agricultural workers from the latter.[] Here are some interesting data for Kaluga Gubernia:\n\nMonthly earnings\n\u201cThese figures fully illustrate the phenomena . . . ) that migration for work in industry helps to raise wages in agriculture, and ) that it attracts the best forces of the population.\u201d[] Not only money wages, but real wages also rise. In the group of uyezds from which not fewer than  out of every  working people migrate the average wage of the farm labourer employed by the year is  rubles, or  poods of rye; in the uyezds where from  to % migrate, it is  rubles, or  poods of rye; in the uyezds which supply less than % of the migrants, it is  rubles, or  poods of rye.[] In these same groups of uyezds the percentage of letters of complaint about a shortage of labour steadily drops: %, % and %. In manufacturing industry wages are higher than in agriculture, and \u201cthe industries, according to the statements of numerous correspondents, help to develop new requirements (tea, calico, boots, clocks, etc.) among the peasant population, raise their general standard of living, and in this way bring about a rise in wages.\u201d[] Here is a typical view by a correspondent: \u201cThe shortage [of labour] is always acute, and the reason is that the suburban population is spoilt, it works in the railway workshops and serves on the railways. The nearness of Kaluga and its markets always attract the surrounding inhabitants, who come to sell eggs, milk, etc., and then engage in orgies of drunkenness in the taverns; the reason is that everybody wants to get the highest pay for the least work. To be an agricultural labourer is considered a disgrace : all strive to get to the town, where they swell the ranks of the proletariat and the riff-raff; the countryside, on the other hand, suffers from a shortage of capable and healthy labourers.\u201d[] We would be quite justified in describing this appraisal of industries employing migratory workers as Narodist. Mr. Zhbankov, for instance, while pointing out that those who migrate are not superfluous but \u201cnecessary\u201d workers whose places are taken by entering peasants, considers it \u201cobvious\u201d that \u201csuch mutual replacements are very disadvantageous.\u201d[] For whom, dear Mr. Zhbankov? \u201cLife in the capitals cultivates many civilised habits of the lower order and an inclination to luxury and showiness, and this results in a useless (sic !!) waste of money\u201d[]; the expenditure on this showiness, etc., is largely \u201cunproductive\u201d (!!)[] Mr. Hertzenstein positively howls about the \u201csham culture,\u201d \u201cthe riotous living,\u201d \u201cwild carousing,\u201d \u201corgies of drunkenness and filthy debauchery,\u201d etc.[] From the fact of wholesale migration the Moscow statisticians draw the outright conclusion that it is necessary to take \u201cmeasures that would diminish the need for migratory labour.\u201d[] Mr. Karyshev argues about migratory labour as follows: \u201cOnly an increase in the peasants\u2019 holdings to a size sufficient to provide the main (!) requirements of their families can solve this most serious problem of our national economy.\u201d[]\n\nAnd it does not occur to any of these serene-spirited gentlemen that before talking about \u201csolving most serious problems,\u201d one must see to it that the peasants obtain complete freedom of movement, freedom to give up their land and leave the community, freedom to settle (without having to pay \u201criddance\u201d money) in any community, urban or rural, whatsoever!\n\nAnd so the diversion of the population from agriculture is expressed, in Russia, in the growth of the towns (a growth partly obscured by home colonisation), suburbs, factory and commercial and industrial villages and townships, as well as in non-agricultural migration. All these processes, which have been and are rapidly developing in breadth and depth in the post-Reform period, are necessary components of capitalist development and are profoundly progressive as compared with the old forms of life.\n\nNotes\n[] For  the figures are from the Statistical Chronicle (I, ) and the Military Statistical Abstract. The figures of the urban population of the Orenburg and Ufa gubernias have been corrected according to the tables of towns.

For that reason we limit our comparison to the most general proportions and give the data for the big towns separately.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cThe number of urban settlements of an agricultural character is extremely small and the number of their inhabitants is quite insignificant compared with the total number of town-dwellers.\u201d (Mr Grigoryev in The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices, Vol. II; p. .)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Novoye Slovo, June , p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. Grigoryev gives a table (loc, cit., ) which shows that in  of all towns .% had less than , inhabitants each; % of all town-dwellers were living in them; .% of the towns ( out of ) had less than , inhabitants each, and only .% of all town-dwellers (, out of ,,) were living in them.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] That we are right in combining with the metropolitan gubernias the non-agricultural gubernias taken by us is borne out by the fact that the population of the metropolitan cities is augmented chiefly by migrants from these gubernias. According to the Petersburg census of December ,, there were in that city , members of the peasant and the burgher estates, of these, , (i.e., three fourths) were members of the peasant and the burgher estates from the  gubernias out of which we constituted area No. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Loc. cit., p. . \u201cThis movement has no parallel in the modern history of Western Europe\u201d (-).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See above, Chapter VII, \u00a7 VIII, and Appendix III to Chapter VII.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] On the significance of this circumstance, to which Korsak in his day drew attention, compare the just remarks of Mr. Volgin (loc. cit., pp. -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] How numerous in Russia are villages that constitute very big centres of population may be judged from the following (though obsolete) data of the Military Statistical Abstract : in  gubernias of European Russia there were in the s a total of , villages with over , inhabitants each. Of them,  had from , to , inhabitants,  from , to ,,  from , to , and  over , (p. ). The development of capitalism in all countries, not only in Russia, has led to the rise of new industrial centres not officially classified as towns. \u201cDifferences between town and country are obliterated, near growing industrial towns this takes place due to the removal of industrial enterprises and workers\u2019 dwellings to the suburbs and outskirts of the towns; near declining small towns it takes place due to the merging of the latter with the surrounding villages and also to the development of large industrial villages. . . . Differences between the urban and rural populated areas are eliminated due to numerous transitional formations. Statisticians have recognised this long ago, and instead of the historico-juridical concept of the town have adopted the statistical concept, which distinguishes centres of population solely according to the number of inhabitants\u201d (B\\\"ucher, Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft, T\\\"ubingen, , S. - and -). In this respect also Russian statistics lag far behind European statistics. In Germany and in France (Statesman\u2019s Yearbook, pp. , ) under towns are placed centres of population having more than , inhabitants, and in England \u201cnet urban sanitary districts,\u201d i.e., also factory villages, etc. Hence, Russian data on the \u201curban\u201d population are not at all comparable with European.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. N.\u2013on has not noticed at all in Russia the process of the industrialisation of the population! Mr. V. V. observed it and admitted that the growth of migration expresses a diversion of the population from agriculture (The Destiny of Capitalism, ); however, far from including this process in the sum-total of his views on the \u201cdestiny of capitalism,\u201d he tried to hush it up with lamentations about the point that \u201cthere are people who find all this very natural\u201d (for capitalist society?

As regards Yaroslavl Gubernia, it is estimated that of the migratory industrialists .% are absent all year round: .% in the autumn and winter, and .% in the spring and summer. We would observe that the data for Yaroslavl Gubernia (Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia, Vol. II, Yaroslavl, ) are not comparable with the preceding ones, since they are based on the statements of priests, etc., and not on passport data.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It is known, for instance, that in the suburbs of St. Petersburg the population increases very considerably in the summer.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Statistical Survey of Kaluga Gubernia for , Kaluga, , p. in Sec. II.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cIndustries employing migratory workers . . . are a form that obscures the uninterrupted growth of the towns. . . . Communal land tenure and various peculiarities of the financial and administrative life of Russia do not allow the peasant to become a town-dweller as easily as in the West. . . . Legal threads sustain his (the migratory worker\u2019s) tie with the village, but actually by occupation, habits and tastes he has become completely assimilated with the town and often regards this tie with his village as irksome\u201d (Russkaya Mysl, , No. , p. ). That is very true, but for a publicist is not enough. Why did not the author declare definitely for complete freedom of movement, for the freedom of the peasant to leave the village community? Our liberals are still afraid of our Narodniks. But they have no reason to be.\n\nAnd here, for purposes of comparison, are the views of a sympathiser with Narodism, Mr. Zhbankov: \u201cMigration to the towns is, as it were, a lightning conductor (sic!) against the rapid growth of the capitals and big cities and the increase of the urban and landless proletariat. Both from the sanitary and from the social and economic points of view, this influence of industries employing migratory workers should be regarded as beneficial: so long as the masses of the people are not completely divorced from the land, which provides the migratory workers with some security\u201d (a \u201csecurity\u201d they pay money to break with!), \u201cthese workers cannot become the blind instruments of capitalist production, and the hope remains of organising agricultural-industrial communes\u201d (Yuridichesky Vestnik, , No.  p ). Is not the retention of petty-bourgeois hopes really beneficial? As for \u201cblind instruments,\u201d the experience of Europe and all the facts observed in Russia show that this description is far more applicable to the worker who retains his ties with the land and with patriarchal relationships than to the one who has broken these ties. The figures and facts given by Mr. Zhbankov himself show that the migratory \u201cPetersburger\u201d is more literate, cultured and developed than the settled Kostromer in some \u201cbackwoods\u201d uyezd.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] L.

The Growth of the Employment of Wage-Labour\nIn considering the development of capitalism, perhaps the greatest importance attaches to the extent to which wage-labour is employed. Capitalism is that stage in the development of commodity-production in which labour power, too, becomes a commodity. The main tendency of capitalism is to apply the sum-total of labour-power in the national economy to production only after it has been sold and has been purchased by the employers. Above, we made an attempt to show in detail how this tendency has manifested itself in post-Reform Russia; now, we must draw the necessary conclusions. Firstly, let us compute the data on the number of sellers of labour-power given in the preceding chapters and then (in the next section) describe the purchasers of labour-power.\n\nThe sellers of labour-power are provided by the country\u2019s working population engaged in the production of material values. It is estimated that this population numbers about . million adult male workers.[] In Chapter II we showed that the bottom group of the peasantry is nothing else than a rural proletariat; and we stated (p. , footnote) that the forms in which this proletariat sells its labour-power would be examined later. Let us now combine the categories of wage-workers previously enumerated: ) agricultural wage-workers. These number about  / million (in European Russia). ) Factory, mining and railway workers\u2014about  / million. Total, five million professional wage-workers. Further: ) building workers\u2014about  million. ) Lumber workers (tree-fellers, log trimmers, rafters, etc.), navvies, railway builders, goods loaders and unloaders, and in general all kinds of \u201cunskilled\u201d labourers in industrial centres. These number about  million.[] ) Workers occupied at home for capitalists, and also those working for wages in the manufacturing industries not included in \u201cfactory industry.\u201d These number about  million.\n\nTotal\u2014about ten million wage-workers. If we deduct the women and children, say one-fourth,[] we get  / million adult male wage-workers, i.e., about half the total adult male population that is engaged in the production of material values[] in the country. Part of this vast mass of wage-workers have completely broken with the land, and live entirely by the sale of their labour-power. They include the great majority of factory (undoubtedly also of mining and railway) workers, then a section of the building and shipbuilding workers, and unskilled labourers; finally, a fairly large section of the workers employed in capitalist manufactories and the inhabitants of non-agricultural centres engaged in home work for capitalists. The other, and larger, section has not yet broken with the land, covers its expenditures in part with the produce that comes from farming tiny plots of land, and, consequently, forms the type of allotment-holding wage-worker which we attempted to describe in detail in Chapter II. In earlier remarks it was shown that this vast mass of wage-workers has been formed mainly in the post-Reform period and that it continues to grow rapidly.\n\nIt is important to note the significance of our conclusion regarding the relative surplus-population (or reserve army of unemployed) created by capitalism. The data regarding the total number of wage-workers in all branches of the national economy bring out very clearly the basic error committed by the Narodnik economists on this point. As we have had occasion to observe elsewhere (Studies, pp. \u2013),[] this error lies in the fact that the Narodnik economists (Messrs. V. V., N.\u2013on and others), who have talked a great deal about capitalism \u201cfreeing\u201d the workers, have not thought of investigating the concrete forms of capitalist over-population in Russia; as well as in the fact that they failed completely to understand that the very existence and development of capitalism in this country require an enormous mass of reserve workers. By means of paltry phrases and curious calculations as to the number of \u201cfactory\u201d workers,[] they have transformed one of the basic conditions for the development of capitalism into proof that capitalism is impossible, is an error, is devoid of foundation, etc. Actually, however, Russian capitalism could never have developed to its present level, could not have survived a single year, had the expropriation of the small producers not created an army of many millions of wage-workers ready at the first call to satisfy the maximum demand of the employers in agriculture, lumbering, building, commerce and in the manufacturing, mining, and transport industries, etc. We say the maximum demand, because capitalism can only develop spasmodically, and consequently, the number of producers who need to sell their labour-power must always exceed capitalism\u2019s average demand for workers. We have now estimated the total number of the various categories of wage-workers, but in doing so do not wish to say that capitalism is in a position to give regular employment to them all. There is not, nor can there be, such regularity of employment in capitalist society, whichever category of wage-worker we take. Of the millions of migratory and resident workers a certain section is constantly in the reserve army of unemployed, and this reserve army now swells to enormous dimensions\u2014in years of crisis, or if there is a slump in some industry in a particular district, or if there is a particularly rapid extension of machine production, which displaces workers\u2014 and now shrinks to a minimum, even causing that \u201cshortage\u201d of labour which is often the subject of complaint by employers in some industries, in some years, in some parts of the country. It is impossible to determine even approximately the number of unemployed in an average year, owing to the complete absence of anything like reliable statistics; but there is no doubt that the number must be a very large one, as is evidenced by both the tremendous fluctuations in capitalist industry, trade and agriculture, to which repeated reference was made above, and by the usual deficits in the budgets of the bottom-group peasants recorded by Zemstvo statistics. The increase in the number of peasants thrown into the ranks of the industrial and rural proletariat, and the increase in the demand for wage-labour, are two sides of one medal. As for the forms of wage-labour, they are extremely diverse in n capitalist society still everywhere enmeshed in survivals and institutions of the pre-capitalist regime. It is a profound error to ignore this diversity of forms, and that is the error of those who, like Mr. V. V., argue that capitalism has \u201cfenced off a corner for itself with some one to one-and-a-half million workers and never emerges from it.\u201d[] Here we have large-scale machine industry instead of capitalism. But how arbitrarily and how artificially are these million and a half workers fenced off into a special \u201ccorner\u201d that is supposedly in no way connected with the remaining spheres of wage-labour! As a matter of fact, the connection is a very close one, and it will be sufficient, in order to characterise it, to mention two basic features of the present economic system. Firstly, this system is based on money economy. The \u201cpower of money\u201d manifests itself in full force in both industry and agriculture, in both town and country, but it reaches its full development, completely eliminates the remnants of patriarchal economy, is concentrated in a few gigantic institutions (banks) and is directly connected with large-scale social production only in the sphere of large-scale machine industry. Secondly, the economic system of today is based on the purchase and sale of labour-power. If we take even the smallest producers in agriculture or in industry, we will find that the one who does not hire himself out, or himself hire others, is the exception. But here again, these relationships reach full development and become completely separated from previous forms of economy only in large scale machine industry. Hence, the \u201ccorner\u201d which seems so small to some Narodnik actually embodies the quintessence of modern social relationships, and the population of this \u201ccorner,\u201d i.e., the proletariat, is, in the literal sense of the word, the vanguard of the whole mass of toilers and exploited.[] Therefore, only by examining the whole of the present economic system from the angle of the relationships that have grown up in this \u201ccorner\u201d can one become clear about the main relations between the various groups of persons taking part in production, and, consequently, trace the system\u2019s main trend of development. On the other hand, whoever turns his back on this \u201ccorner\u201d and examines economic phenomena from the angle of petty patriarchal production, is turned by the march of history into either an innocent dreamer or an ideologist of the petty bourgeoisie and the agrarians.\n\nNotes\n[] The figure given in the Combined Statistical Material, etc. (published by Chancellory of the Committee of Ministers, ), is ,,. This figure was reached in the following way. The urban population was taken as equal to the population not participating in the production of material values. The adult male peasant population was reduced by % (.% on military service and .% in civilian service).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Above we saw that lumber workers alone are estimated at about  million. The number of workers employed in the last two groups of occupations we have indicated should be larger than the total number of non-agricultural migratory workers, for part of the building workers, unskilled labourers, particularly lumber workers are local and not migratory workers. And we have seen that the number of non-agricultural migratory workers is not less than  million.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In factory industry, as we have seen, women and children constitute a little over / of the total number of workers. In the mining, building and lumber industries, etc., few women and children are employed. In capitalist domestic industry, on the other hand, they are probably more numerous than men.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] To avoid misunderstanding, let us make the reservation that we do not claim these figures to be statistically exact. We merely wish to show approximately the diversity of the forms of wage-labour and the numbers of those engaged in it.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. present edition, Vol. , \u201cA Characterisation of Economic Romanticism.\u201d\u2014Ed.\n\n[] Let us recall the argument of Mr. N.\u2013on about the \u201chandful\u201d of workers, and also the following, truly classic, calculation by Mr. V. V. (Essays on Theoretical Economics, p. ). In the  gubernias of European Russia there are ,, adult male workers belonging to the peasant estate; of these, ,, (, in factory industry + , railway workers) are \u201cunited by capital\u201d; the rest are the \u201cagricultural population.\u201d With the \u201ccomplete capitalisation of the manufacturing industries\u201d \u201ccapitalist factory industry\u201d will employ twice as many hands (.% in place of .%, while the remaining .% of the population \u201cwill remain on the land and be idle during half the year\u201d). Obviously, comment could only spoil the impression created by this wonderful specimen of economic science and economic statistics.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Novoye Slovo, , No. , p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mutatis mutandis, the same may be said of the relation between wage-workers in large-scale machine industry and the rest of the wage-workers as the Webbs say of the relation between trade unionists in Britain and non-unionists: \u201cThe trade unionists number about  per cent of the total population . . . the trade unionists number about  per cent of the adult male manual working class.\u201d But \u201cDie Gewerkschaftler . . . zahlen . . . in der Regel die Elite des Gewerbes in ihren Reihen.

Webb: The History of Trade Unionism, London, , pp. , , ). \u2013Ed.]\u2014Lenin\n\nIV. The Formation of a Home Market for Labour-Power\nTo sum up the data given earlier on this problem we shall confine ourselves to the picture of the movement of workers over the territory of European Russia. Such a picture is supplied by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s publication[] based on statements by employers. The picture of the movement of workers will give a general idea of how the home market for labour-power is being formed; using the material of the publication mentioned, we have only tried to draw a distinction between the movement of agricultural and non-agricultural workers, although the map appended to the publication and illustrating the movement of the workers does not show this distinction.\n\nThe main movements of agricultural workers are the following: ) From the central agricultural gubernias to the southern and eastern outer regions. ) From the northern black-earth gubernias to the southern black-earth gubernias, from which, in turn, the workers go to the border regions (cf. Chapter III, \u00a7 IX, pp. - and \u00a7 X, pp. -). ) From the central agricultural gubernias to the industrial gubernias (cf. Chapter IV, \u00a7 IV, pp. -). ) From the central and the south-western agricultural gubernias to the area of sugar-beet plantations (workers come in part to these places even from Galicia).\n\nThe main movements of non-agricultural workers are: ) To the metropolitan cities and the large towns, chiefly from the non-agricultural gubernias, but to a considerable degree also from the agricultural gubernias. ) To the industrial area, to the factories of Vladimir, Yaroslavl and other gubernias from the same localities. ) To new centres of industry or to new branches of industry, to centres of non-factory industry, etc. These include the movement: a) to the beet-sugar refineries of the south-western gubernias; b) to the southern mining area; c) to jobs at the docks (Odessa, Rostov-on-Don, Riga, etc.); d) to the peat beds in Vladimir and other gubernias; e) to the mining and metallurgical area of the Urals; f) to the fisheries (Astrakhan, the Black Sea, Azov Sea, etc.); g) to shipbuilding, sailoring, lumbering and rafting jobs, etc.; h) to jobs on the railways, etc.\n\nThese are the main movements of the workers which, according to the evidence of employers, more or less materially affect the conditions of labour hire in the various localities. To appreciate more clearly the significance of these movements, let us compare them with the data on wages in the various districts from and to which the workers migrate. Confining ourselves to  gubernias in European Russia, we divide these into  groups according to the character of the movement of workers, and get the following data:[]\nAverage wages and extent of movement of workers.\nThis table clearly shows us the basis of the process that creates the home market for labour-power and, consequently, the home market for capitalism. Two main areas, those most developed capitalistically, attract vast numbers of workers: the area of agricultural capitalism (the southern and the eastern outer regions), and the area of industrial capitalism (the metropolitan and the industrial gubernias). Wages are lowest in the area of departure, the central agricultural gubernias, where capitalism, both in agriculture and in industry, is least developed[]; in the influx areas, on the other hand, wages rise for all types of work, as does also the percentage of money wage to total wage, i.e., money economy gains ground at the expense of natural economy. The intermediary areas, those between the areas of the greatest influx (and of the highest wages) and the area of departure (and of the lowest wages) reveal the mutual replacement of workers to which reference was made above: workers leave in such numbers that in the places of departure a shortage of labour is created which attracts workers from the more \u201cpoorly paid\u201d gubernias.\n\nIn essence, the two-sided process shown in our table\u2014that of the diversion of population from agriculture to industry (industrialisation of the population) and of the development of commercial-industrial, capitalist agriculture (industrialisation of agriculture)\u2014epitomises all that has been said above on the formation of a home market for capitalist society. The home market for capitalism is created by the parallel development of capitalism in agriculture and in industry,[] by the formation of a class of rural and industrial employers, on the one hand, and of a class of rural and industrial wage-workers, on the other. The main streams of the movement of workers show the main forms of this process, but by far not all the forms; in what has gone before we have shown that the forms of this process differ in peasant and in landlord farming, in the different areas of commercial agriculture, in the different stages of the capitalist development of industry, etc.\n\nHow far this process is distorted and confused by the representatives of Narodnik economics is seen most clearly in \u00a7 VI of Part  of Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s Sketches, which bears the significant heading: \u201cThe Influence of the Redistribution of the Social Productive Forces upon the Economic Position of the Agricultural Population.\u201d Here is how Mr. N.\u2013on pictures this \u201credistribution\u201d: \u201c. . . In capitalist . . . society, every increase in the productive power of labour entails the \u2018freeing\u2019 of a corresponding number of workers, who are compelled to seek some other employment; and since this occurs in all branches of production, and this \u2018freeing\u2019 takes place over the whole of capitalist society, the only thing left open to them is to turn to the means of production of which they have not yet been deprived, namely, the land\u201d (p. ). . . . \u201cOur peasants have not been deprived of the land, and that is why they turn their efforts towards it. When they lose their employment in the factory, or are obliged to abandon their subsidiary domestic occupations, they see no other course but to set about the increased exploitation of the soil. All Zemstvo statistical returns note the fact that the area under cultivation is growing. . .\u201d ().\n\nAs you see, Mr. N.\u2013on knows of quite a special sort of capitalism that has never existed anywhere and that no economist could conceive of. Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s capitalism does not divert the population from agriculture to industry, does not divide the agriculturists into opposite classes. Quite the contrary. Capitalism \u201cfrees\u201d the workers from industry and there is nothing left for \u201cthem\u201d to do but to turn to the land, for \u201cour peasants have not been deprived of the land\u201d!! At the bottom of this \u201ctheory,\u201d which originally \u201credistributes\u201d in poetic disorder all the processes of capitalist development, lie the ingenious tricks of all Narodniks which we have examined in detail previously: they lump together the peasant bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat; they ignore the growth of commercial farming; they concoct stories about \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d \u201chandicraft industries\u201d being isolated from \u201ccapitalist\u201d \u201cfactory industry,\u201d instead of analysing the consecutive forms and diverse manifestations of capitalism in industry.\n\nNotes\n[] \u201cAgricultural and statistical information based on material obtained from farmers. Vol. V. Hired Labour on private-landowner farms and the movement of workers, according to a statistical and economic survey of agriculture and industry in European Russia.\u201d Compiled by S. A. Korolenko. Published by Department of Agriculture and Rural Industries, St. Petersburg, .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The other gubernias are omitted in order not to complicate our exposition with data that contribute nothing new to the subject under examination; furthermore, the other gubernias are either untouched by the main, mass, movements of workers (Urals, the North) or have their specific ethnographical, administrative and juridical features (the Baltic gubernias, the gubernias in the Jewish Pale of Settlement, the Byelorussian gubernias, etc.). Data from the publication cited above. Wage figures are the average for the gubernias in the respective groups; the day labourer\u2019s summer wage is the average for three seasons: sowing, haymaking and harvesting. The areas ( to ) include the following gubernias: ) Taurida, Bessarabia and Don; ) Kherson, Ekaterinoslav, Samara, Saratov, Orenburg; ) Simbirsk, Voronezh, Kharkov; ) Kazan, Penza, Tambov, Ryazan, Tula, Orel, Kursk; ) Pskov, Novgorod, Kaluga, Kostroma, Tver, Nizhni-Novgorod; ) St. Petersburg, Moscow, Yaroslavl, Vladimir.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Thus, the peasants flee in mass from the localities where patriarchal economic relationships are most prevalent, where labour-service and primitive forms of industry are preserved to the greatest extent, to localities where the \u201cpillars\u201d are completely decayed. They flee from \u201cpeople\u2019s production\u201d and pay no heed to the chorus of voices from \u201csociety\u201d following in their wake. In this chorus two voices can be clearly distinguished: \u201cThey have little attachment!\u201d comes the menacing bellow of the Black-Hundred Sobakevich.[] \u201cThey have insufficient allotment land!\u201d is the polite correction of the Cadet Manilov.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Theoretical economics established this simple truth long ago. To say nothing of Marx, who pointed directly to the development of capitalism in agriculture as a process that creates a \u201chome market for industrial capital\u201d (Das Kapital, I , S. , Chapter , Sec. ), [] let us refer to Adam Smith. In chapter XI of Book I and Chapter IV of Book III of The Wealth of Nations, he pointed to the most characteristic features of the development of capitalist agriculture and noted the parallelism of this process with the process of the growth of the towns and the development of industry.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Sobakevich\u2013 a character in Gogol\u2019s Dead Souls, the personification of the bullying, tight-fisted landlord. [p. ]\n\n[] Karl Marx, Capital, Vol. I, Moscow, , Chapter  (p. ). [p. ]\n\nV. The Significance of the Border Regions. Home or Foreign Market?\nIn Chapter I we pointed to the erroneous character of the theory that links the problem of a foreign market for capitalism with that of the realisation of the product (pp. - and foll.). Capitalism\u2019s need of a foreign market is by no means to be explained by the impossibility of realising the product on the home market, but by the circumstance that capitalism is in no position to go on repeating the same processes of production on the former scale, under unchanging conditions (as was the case under pre-capitalist regimes), and that it inevitably leads to an unlimited growth of production which overflows the old, narrow limits of earlier economic units. With the unevenness of development inherent in capitalism, one branch of production outstrips the others and strives to transcend the bounds of the old field of economic relations. Let us take, for example, the textile industry at the beginning of the post-Reform period. Being fairly well developed capitalistically (manufacture beginning to pass into factory industry), it had gained complete command of the market of Central Russia. But the big factories, growing so rapidly, could no longer be satisfied with the former dimensions of the market; they began to seek a market further afield, among the new population colonising Novorossia, the south-east Transvolga region, North Caucasus, then Siberia, etc. The efforts of the big factories to reach out beyond the old markets are undoubted. Does it mean that the areas which served as these old markets could not, in general, consume a larger quantity of the products of the textile industry? Does it mean, for example, that the industrial and central agricultural gubernias cannot, in general, absorb a larger quantity of wares? No, it does not. We know that the differentiation of the peasantry, the growth of commercial agriculture and the increase in the industrial population have also expanded, and continue to expand, the home market of this old area. But this expansion of the home market is retarded by many factors (chief among them the retention of obsolete institutions which hinder the development of agricultural capitalism); and the factory owners will not, of course, wait until the capitalist development of other branches of the national economy catches up with that of the textile industry. The mill owners need a market at once, and if the backwardness of other branches of the national economy restricts the market in the old area, they will seek for a market in another area, or in other countries, or in the colonies of the old country.\n\nWhat is a colony in the politico-economic sense? It was stated above that, according to Marx, the main features of this concept are the following: ) the existence of unoccupied, free lands, easily accessible to settlers; ) the existence of an established world division of labour, of a world market, thanks to which the colonies can specialise in the mass production of agricultural produce, receiving in exchange finished industrial goods \u201cwhich they would have to produce themselves under other circumstances\u201d (see above, p. , footnote, Chapter IV, \u00a7 II). Reference has been made elsewhere to the fact that the southern and the eastern border regions of European Russia, which have been settled in the post-Reform period, bear the distinctive features mentioned and constitute, in the economic sense, colonies of Central European Russia.[] The term colony is still more applicable to the other outer regions, for example, the Caucasus. Its economic \u201cconquest\u201d by Russia took place much later than the political conquest; and to this day this economic conquest has not been completed to the full. In the post-Reform period there has been, on the one hand, an intensive colonisation of the Caucasus,[] an extensive ploughing up of the land (particularly in the North Caucasus) by colonists producing wheat, tobacco, etc., for sale, and attracting masses of rural wage-workers from Russia. On the other hand, native age-old \u201chandicraft\u201d industries, which are declining due to the competition of wares from Moscow, are being eliminated. There has been a decline in the ancient gunsmith\u2019s craft due to the competition of imported Tula and Belgian wares, a decline in handicraft iron-work due to the competition of the imported Russian products, as well as in the handicraft processing of copper, gold and silver, clay, fats and soda, leather, etc.[] These products are turned out more cheaply in Russian factories, which supply the Caucasus with their wares. There has been a decline in the making of drinking-horns because of the decay of the feudal system in Georgia and of the steady disappearance of her memorable feasts; there has been a decline in the headgear industry due to the replacement of Asiatic dress by European; there has been a decline in the production of wine-skins and pitchers for local wine, which for the first time is now being sold (giving rise to the barrel-making trade) and has in turn captured the Russian market. Russian capitalism has thus been drawing the Caucasus into the sphere of world commodity circulation, obliterating its local peculiarities\u2014 the remnants of ancient patriarchal isolation\u2014and providing itself with a market for its factories. A country thinly populated at the beginning of the post-Reform period, or populated by mountaineers living outside world economy and even outside history, has been turning into a land of oil industrialists, wine merchants, big wheat and tobacco growers, and Mr. Coupon[] has been ruthlessly divesting the proud mountaineer of his picturesque national costume and dressing him in the livery of a European flunkey (Gleb Uspensky).[] The process of rapid colonisation in the Caucasus and of the rapid growth of its agricultural population has been accompanied by a process (obscured by this growth) of the diversion of the population from agriculture to industry. The urban population of the Caucasus increased from , in  to about , in  (the total population increased between  and  by %). There is no need to add that the same thing has taken place and continues in both Central Asia and Siberia, etc.\n\nThus, the question naturally arises, where is the border line between the home and the foreign market? To take the political boundaries of the state would be too mechanical a solution\u2014and would it be a solution? If Central Asia is the home market and Persia the foreign market, to which category do Khiva and Bokhara belong? If Siberia is the home market and China the foreign market, to which category does Manchuria belong? Such questions are not of great importance. What is important is that capitalism cannot exist and develop without constantly expanding the sphere of its domination, without colonising new countries and drawing old non-capitalist countries into the whirlpool of world economy. And this feature of capitalism has been and continues to be manifested with tremendous force in post-Reform Russia.\n\nHence, the process of the formation of a market for capitalism has two aspects, namely, the development of capitalism in depth, i.e., the further growth of capitalist agriculture and industry in the given, definite and enclosed territory\u2014and the development of capitalism in breadth, i.e., the extension of the sphere of the capitalist domination to new territory. In accordance with the plan of the present work, we have confined ourselves almost exclusively to the first aspect of the process, and for this reason we consider it particular]y necessary to stress the point here that its other aspect is of exceptionally great importance. Anything like a complete study of the process of colonisation of the border regions and of the expansion of Russian territory, from the point of view of capitalist development, would require a special work. Suffice it to mention here that Russia is in a particularly favoured position as compared with other capitalist countries, due to the abundance of free land accessible for colonisation in her border regions.[] To say nothing of Asiatic Russia we have also in European Russia border regions which, because of their exceeding remoteness and bad means of communication, are still very poorly connected economically with central Russia. Let us take, for instance, the \u201cFar North\u201d \u2014Archangel Gubernia; the boundless stretches of territory and their natural resources are still exploited very slightly. One of the principal local products, timber, was until recently exported mainly to England. In this respect, therefore, that part of European Russia was a foreign market for Britain without being a home market for Russia. The Russian entrepreneurs naturally envied the British, and now, with the extension of the railway line to Archangel, they are jubilant at the prospect of \u201celevated moods and business activity in various branches of industry in the region.\u201d[]\n\nNotes\n[] \u201c. . . It was thanks exclusively to them, thanks to these forms of people\u2019s production, and on the basis of them that the whole of South Russia was colonised and settled.\u201d (Mr. N.\u2013on, Sketches, ). How wonderfully broad and comprehensive is the term: \u201cforms of people\u2019s production\u201d! It covers whatever you like: patriarchal peasant farming, labour-service, primitive handicrafts, small commodity-production, and those typically capitalist relations within the peasant community that we saw above in the data on the Taurida and Samara gubernias (Chapter II, etc., etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. articles by Mr. P. Semyonov in Vestnik Finansov, , No. , and by V. Mikhailovsky in Novoye Slovo, June .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See article by K. Khatisov in Vol. II of Reports and Investigations of Handicraft Industry, and by P. Ostryakov in Vol. V. of Transactions of the Handicraft Commission.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The circumstance indicated in the text has another aspect. The development of capitalism in depth in the old, long-inhabited territories is retarded because of the colonisation of the outer regions. The solution of the contradictions inherent in, and produced by, capitalism is temporarily postponed because of the fact that capitalism can easily develop in breadth. Thus, the simultaneous existence of the most advanced forms of industry and of semi-medieval forms of agriculture is undoubtedly a contradiction. If Russian capitalism had possessed no range for expansion beyond the bounds of the territory already occupied at the beginning of the post-Reform period, this contradiction between capitalist large-scale industry and the archaic institutions in rural life (the tying of the peasants to the land, etc.) would have had to lead quickly to the complete abolition of these institutions, to the complete clearing of the path for agricultural capitalism in Russia. But the possibility (for the mill owner) of seeking and finding a market in the outer regions in process of colonisation and the possibility (for the peasant) of moving to new territory, mitigates the acuteness of this contradiction and delays its solution. It goes without saying that such a deceleration of the growth of capitalism is equivalent to preparing its even greater extension in the near future.\u2014Lenin\n\nVI. The \u201cMission\u201d of Capitalism\nWe still have, in conclusion, to sum up on the question which in literature has come to be known as that of the \u201cmission\u201d of capitalism, i.e., of its historical role in the economic development of Russia. Recognition of the progressiveness of this role is quite compatible (as we have tried to show in detail at every stage in our exposition of the facts) with the full recognition of the negative and dark sides of capitalism, with the full recognition of the profound and all-round social contradictions which are inevitably inherent in capitalism, and which reveal the historically transient character of this economic regime. It is the Narodniks\u2014who exert every effort to show that an admission of the historically progressive nature of capitalism means an apology for capitalism\u2014who are at fault in underrating (and some times in even ignoring) the most profound contradictions of Russian capitalism, by glossing over the differentiation of the peasantry, the capitalist character of the evolution of our agriculture, and the rise of a class of rural and industrial allotment-holding wage-labourers, by glossing over the complete predominance of the lowest and worst forms of capitalism in the celebrated \u201chandicraft\u201d industries.\n\nThe progressive historical role of capitalism may be summed up in two brief propositions: increase in the productive forces of social labour, and the socialisation of that labour. But both these facts manifest themselves in extremely diverse processes in different branches of the national economy.\n\nThe development of the productive forces of social labour is to be observed in full relief only in the epoch of large-scale machine industry. Until that highest stage of capitalism was reached, there still remained hand production and primitive technique, which developed quite spontaneously and exceedingly slowly. The post-Reform epoch differs radically in this respect from previous epochs in Russian history. The Russia of the wooden plough and the flail, of the water-mill and the hand-loom, began rapidly to be transformed into the Russia of the iron plough and the threshing machine, of the steam-mill and the power-loom. An equally thorough transformation of technique is seen in every branch of the national economy where capitalist production predominates. This process of transformation must, by the very nature of capitalism, take place in the midst of much that is uneven and disproportionate: periods of prosperity alternate with periods of crisis, the development of one industry leads to the decline of another, there is progress in one aspect of agriculture in one area and in another aspect in another area, the growth of trade and industry outstrips the growth of agriculture, etc. A large number of errors made by Narodnik writers spring from their efforts to prove that this disproportionate, spasmodic, feverish development is not development.[]\n\nAnother feature of the development by capitalism of the social productive forces is that the growth of the means of production (productive consumption) outstrips by far the growth of personal consumption: we have indicated on more than one occasion how this is manifested in agriculture and in industry. This feature springs from the general laws of the realisation of the product in capitalist society, and fully conforms to the antagonistic nature of this society.[]\n\nThe socialisation of labour by capitalism is manifested in the following processes. Firstly, the very growth of commodity-production destroys the scattered condition of small economic units that is characteristic of natural economy and draws together the small local markets into an enormous national (and then world) market. Production for oneself is transformed into production for the whole of society; and the greater the development of capitalism, the stronger becomes the contradiction between this collective character of production and the individual character of appropriation. Secondly, capitalism replaces the former scattered production by an unprecedented concentration both in agriculture and in industry. That is the most striking and outstanding, but not the only, manifestation of the feature of capitalism under review. Thirdly, capitalism eliminates the forms of personal dependence that constituted an inalienable component of preceding systems of economy. In Russia, the progressive character of capitalism in this respect is particularly marked, since the personal dependence of the producer existed in our country (and partly continues to exist to this day), not only in agriculture, but in manufacturing industry (\u201cfactories\u201d employing serf labour), in the mining and metallurgical industries, in the fishing industry, etc.[] Compared with the labour of the dependent or bonded peasant, the labour of the hired worker is progressive in all branches of the national economy. Fourthly, capitalism necessarily creates mobility of the population, something not required by previous systems of social economy and impossible under them on anything like a large scale. Fifthly, capitalism constantly reduces the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture (where the most backward forms of social and economic relationships always prevail), and increases the number of large industrial centres. Sixthly, capitalist society increases the population\u2019s need for association, for organisation, and lends these organisations a character distinct from those of former times. While breaking down the narrow, local, social-estate associations of medieval society and creating fierce competition, capitalism at the same time splits the whole of society into large groups of persons occupying different positions in production, and gives a tremendous impetus to organisation within each such group.[] Seventhly, all the above-mentioned changes effected in the old economic system by capitalism inevitably lead also to a change in the mentality of the population. The spasmodic character of economic development, the rapid transformation of the methods of production and the enormous concentration of production, the disappearance of all forms of personal dependence and patriarchalism in relationships, the mobility of the population, the influence of the big industrial centres, etc.\u2014all this cannot but lead to a profound change in the very character of the producers, and we have had occasion to note the corresponding observations of Russian investigators.\n\nTurning now to Narodnik economics, with whose representatives we have constantly had to polemise, we may sum up the causes of our differences with them as follows. First, we cannot but regard as absolutely wrong the Narodniks\u2019 very conception of the process of capitalist development in Russia, and their notion of the system of economic relationships that preceded capitalism in Russia; and what is particularly important, from our point of view, is their ignoring of the capitalist contradictions in the structure of peasant economy (both agricultural and industrial). Furthermore, whether the development of capitalism in Russia is slow or rapid, depends entirely on what we compare this development with. If we compare the pre-capitalist epoch in Russia with the capitalist (and that is the comparison which is needed for arriving at a correct solution of the problem), the development of social economy under capitalism must be considered as extremely rapid. If, however, we compare the present rapidity of development with that which could be achieved with the general level of technique and culture as it is today, the present rate of development of capitalism in Russia really must be considered as slow. And it cannot but be slow, for in no single capitalist country has there been such an abundant survival of ancient institutions that are incompatible with capitalism, retard its development, and immeasurably worsen the condition of the producers, who \u201csuffer not only from the development of capitalist production, but also from the incompleteness of that development.\u201d[] Finally, perhaps the profoundest cause of disagreement with the Narodniks is the difference in our fundamental views on social and economic processes. When studying the latter, the Narodnik usually draws conclusions that point to some moral; he does not regard the diverse groups of persons taking part in production as creators of various forms of life; he does not set out to present the sum-total of social and economic relationships as the result of the mutual relations between these groups, which have different interests and different historical roles. . . . If the writer of these lines has succeeded in providing some material for clarifying these problems, he may regard his labours as not having been fruitless.\n\nNotes\n[] \u201cLet us see what the further development of capitalism could bring even if we succeeded in sinking Britain to the bottom of the sea and in taking her place\u201d (Mr. N.\u2013on, Sketches, ). The cotton industry of Britain and America, which meets / of the world\u2019s demand, employs only a little over , people all told. \u201cAnd it follows, that even if we got a considerable part of the world market... capitalism would still be unable to exploit the whole mass of labouring people which it is now continuously depriving of employment. What, indeed, are some , British and American workers compared with millions of peasants left for months on end without employment?\u201d ().\n\n\u201cHistory has gone on till now, but goes on no longer.\u201d Till now every step in the development of capitalism in the textile industry has been accompanied by the differentiation of the peasantry, by the growth of commercial agriculture and agricultural capitalism, by the diversion of population from agriculture to industry, by \u201cmillions of peasants\u201d turning to building, lumbering and all sorts of other non-agricultural work for hire, by the migration of masses of people to the outer regions and by the conversion of these regions into a market for capitalism. All this, however, has only gone on till now; nothing of the sort occurs any longer!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] His ignoring of the significance of the means of production and his careless attitude to \u201cstatistics\u201d have led to the following utterly untenable statement by Mr. N.\u2013on: \u201c. . . all (!) capitalist production in the sphere of manufacturing industry at most produces new values to the amount of not more than  to  million rubles\u201d (Sketches, ). Mr. N.\u2013on bases this calculation on the returns of the three-per-cent tax and the extra profits tax, without stopping to think whether such returns can cover \u201call capitalist production in the sphere of manufacturing industry.\u201d Moreover, he takes returns which (on his own admission) do not cover the mining and metallurgical industries, and yet he includes in \u201cnew values\u201d only surplus-value and variable capital. Our theoretician has forgotten that, in those branches of industry which produce goods for personal consumption, constant capital also represents new value for society and is exchanged for the variable capital and surplus-value of those branches of industry which produce means of production (mining and metallurgical industries, building, lumbering, railway construction, etc.). Had Mr. N.\u2013on not confused the number of \u201cfactory\u201d workers with the total number of workers capitalistically employed in manufacturing industry, he would easily have perceived the errors in his calculations.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] For example, in one of the principal centres of the Russian fishing industry, the Murmansk coast, the \u201cage-old\u201d and truly \u201ctime hallowed\u201d form of economic relationships was the \u201cpokrut,\u201d[] which was already fully established in the th century and continued almost without change until recent times. \u201cThe relations between the pokrutmen and their masters are not limited to the time spent at the fisheries: on the contrary, they embrace the whole life of the pokrutmen, who are permanently dependent economically on their masters\u201d (Material on Artels in Russia, Vol. II, St. Petersburg, , p. ). Fortunately, in this branch of industry also, capitalism is apparently marked by a \u201ccontemptuous attitude to its own historical past.\u201d \u201cMonopoly . . . is giving way to . . . the capitalist organisation of the industry with hired labourers\u201d (Productive Forces, V, pp. -).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf Studies, p. , footnote , p. .

The employer usually received two-thirds of the catch, and the workers only one-third. The workers were compelled to sell part of their catch to the employer at a low price, payment being made in goods, which was very much to the disadvantage of the workers. [p. ]\n\n Chapter III. The Landowners\u2019 Transition from Corv\u00e9e to Capitalist Economy\nPage  from the magazine Nachalo.\nFrom peasant economy we must now pass to landlord economy. Our task is to examine, in its main features, the present social-economic system of landlord economy and to describe the nature of the evolution of this system in the post-Reform epoch.\n\nI. The Main Features of Corv\u00e9e Economy\nAs our starting-point in examining the present system of landlord economy we must take the system of that economy which prevailed in the epoch of serfdom. The essence of the economic system of those days was that the entire land of a given unit of agrarian economy, i.e., of a given estate, was divided into the lord\u2019s and the peasants\u2019 land; the latter was distributed in allotments among the peasants, who (receiving other means of production in addition, as for example, timber, sometimes cattle, etc.) cultivated it with their own labour and their own implements, and obtained their livelihood from it. The product of this peasants\u2019 labour constituted the necessary product, to employ the terminology of theoretical political economy; necessary \u2013 for the peasants in providing them with means of subsistence, and for the landlord in providing him with hands; in exactly the same way as the product which replaces the variable part of the value of capital is a necessary product in capitalist society. The peasants\u2019 surplus labour, on the other hand, consisted in their cultivation, with the same implements, of the landlord\u2019s land; the product of that labour went to the landlord. Hence, the surplus labour was separated then in space from the necessary labour: for the landlord they cultivated his land, for themselves their allotments; for the landlord they worked some days of the week and for themselves others. The peasant\u2019s allotment in this economy served, as it were, as wages in kind (to express oneself in modern terms), or as a means of providing the landlord with hands. The peasants\u2019 \u201cown\u201d farming of their allotments was a condition of the landlord economy, and its purpose was to \u201cprovide\u201d not the peasant with means of livelihood but the landlord with hands.[]\n\nIt is this system of economy which we call Corv\u00e9e [Russ.: barshchina] economy. Its prevalence obviously presumes the following necessary conditions: firstly, the predominance of natural economy. The feudal estate had to constitute a self-sufficing, self-contained entity, in very slight contact with the outside world. The production of grain by the landlords for sale, which developed particularly in the latter period of the existence of serfdom, was already a harbinger of the collapse of the old regime. Secondly, such an economy required that the direct producer be allotted the means of production in general, and land in particular; moreover, that he be tied to the land, since otherwise the landlord was not assured of hands. Hence, the methods of obtaining the surplus product under Corv\u00e9e and under capitalist economy are diametrically opposite: the former is based on the producer being provided with land, the latter on the producer being dispossessed of the land.[] Thirdly, a condition for such a system of economy was the personal dependence of the peasant on the landlord. If the landlord had not possessed direct power over the person of the peasant, he could not have compelled a man who had a plot of land and ran his own farm to work for him. Hence, \u201cother than economic pressure,\u201d as Marx says in describing this economic regime, was necessary (and, as has already been indicated above, Marx assigned it to the category of labour-rent ; Das Kapital, III, , ).[] The form and degree of this coercion may be the most varied, ranging from the peasant\u2019s serf status to his lack of rights in the social estates. Fourthly, and finally, a condition and a consequence of the system of economy described was the extremely low and stagnant condition of technique, for farming was in the hands of small peasants, crushed by poverty and degraded by personal dependence and by ignorance.\n\nNotes\n[] An extremely vivid description of this system of economy is given by A. Engelhardt in his Letters from the Countryside (St. Petersburg , pp. -). The author quite rightly points out that feudal economy was a definite, regular and complete system, the director of which was the landlord, who allotted land to the peasants and assigned them to various jobs.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In opposing the view of Henry George, who said that the expropriation of the mass of the population is the great and universal cause of poverty and oppression, Engels wrote in : \u201cThis is not quite correct historically. . . . In the Middle Ages, it was not the expropriation of the people from, but on the contrary, their appropriation to the land which became the source of feudal oppression. The peasant retained his land, but was attached to it as a serf or villein, and made liable to tribute to the lord in labour and in produce\u201d (The Condition of the Working-Class in England in , New York, , Preface, p. III).[]\u2014Lenin\nII. The Combination of the Corv\u00e9e and\nthe Capitalist Systems of Economy\nThe Corv\u00e9e system of economy was undermined by the abolition of serfdom. All the main foundations of this system were undermined: natural economy, the self-contained and the self-sufficient character of the landed estate, the close connection between its various constituents, and the landlord\u2019s power over the peasants. The peasant\u2019s farm was separated from that of the landlord; the peasant was to buy back his land and become the full owner of it; the landlord, to adopt the capitalist system of farming, which, as has just been observed, has a diametrically opposite basis. But such a transition to a totally different system could not, of course, take place at once, and for two different reasons. First, the conditions required for capitalist production did not yet exist. A class of people was required who were accustomed to work for hire; the peasants\u2019 implements had to be replaced by those of the landlord; agriculture had to be organised on the same lines as any other commercial and industrial enterprise and not as the business of the lord. All these conditions could only take shape gradually, and the attempts of some landlords, immediately after the Reform, to import machinery and even workers from abroad could not but end in a fiasco. The other reason why the transition to the capitalist conduct of affairs was not possible at once was that the old Corv\u00e9e system of economy had been undermined, but not yet completely destroyed. The peasants\u2019 farms were not entirely separated from those of the landlords, for the latter retained possession of very essential parts of the peasants\u2019 allotments: the \u201ccut-off lands,\u201d[] the woods, meadows, watering places, pastures, etc. Without these lands (or easement rights) the peasants were absolutely unable to carry on independent farming, so that the landlords were able to continue the old system of economy in the form of labour-service. The possibility of exercising \u201cother than economic pressure\u201d also remained in the shape of the peasants\u2019 temporarily-bound status,[] collective responsibility, corporal punishment, forced labour on public works, etc.\n\nThus, capitalist economy could not emerge at once, and Corv\u00e9e economy could not disappear at once. The only possible system of economy was, accordingly, a transitional one, a system combining the features of both the Corv\u00e9e and the capitalist systems. And indeed, the post-Reform system of farming practised by the landlords bears precisely these features. With all the endless variety of forms characteristic of a transitional epoch, the economic organisation of contemporary landlord farming amounts to two main systems, in the most varied combinations \u2013 the labour-service[] system and the capitalist system. The first consists in the landlord\u2019s land being cultivated with the implements of the neighbouring peasants, the form of payment not altering the essential nature of this system (whether payment is in money, as in the case of job-hire, or in produce, as in the case of half-cropping, or in land or grounds, as in the case of labour-service in the narrow sense of the term). This is a direct survival of Corv\u00e9e economy,[] and the economic characterisation of the latter, given above, is applicable almost entirely to the labour-service system (the only exception being that in one of the forms of the labour-service system one of the conditions of Corv\u00e9e economy disappears, namely, under job-hire, where labour instead of being paid in kind is paid in money). The capitalist farming system consists of the hire of workers (annual, seasonal, day, etc.) who till the land with the owner\u2019s implements. The systems mentioned are actually interwoven in the most varied and fantastic fashion: on a mass of landlord estates there is a combination of the two systems, which are applied to different farming operations.[] It is quite natural that the combination of such dissimilar and even opposite systems of economy leads in practice to a whole number of most profound and complicated conflicts and contradictions, and that the pressure of these contradictions results in a number of the farmers going bankrupt, etc. All these are phenomena characteristic of every transitional period.\n\nIf we raise the question as to the relative incidence of the two systems, we shall have to say, first of all, that no precise statistics are available on the matter, and it is not likely that they could be collected: that would require a registration not only of all estates, but of all economic operations performed on all the estates. Only approximate data are available, in the shape of general descriptions of individual localities as to the predominance of one or another system. Data of this kind are given in a summarised form for the whole of Russia in the above-mentioned publication of the Department of Agriculture, Hired Labour, etc. On the basis of these data, Mr. Annensky has drawn up a very striking chart showing the incidence of these systems (The Influence of Harvests, etc.,[] I, ). Let us summarise these data in a table, and supplement them with figures on the cultivated area on private owners\u2019 lands in - (according to Statistics of the Russian Empire, IV. The average harvest in European Russia in the five years  . St. Petersburg, ).[]\nAverage harvest in European Russia in five years -.\nThus, although the labour-service system predominates in the purely Russian gubernias, the capitalist system of landlord farming must be considered the predominant one at present in European Russia as a whole. Moreover, our table gives a far from complete picture of this predominance, for Group I of the gubernias includes some in which the labour-service system is not applied at all (the Baltic gubernias, for example), whereas Group III includes not a single gubernia, and in all probability not a single farmed estate in which the capitalist system is not applied at least in part. Here is an illustration of this based on Zemstvo statistics (Raspopin; \u201cPrivate-Landowner Farming in Russia According to Zemstvo Statistics,\u201d in Yuridichesky Vestnik [Legal Messenger ], , Nos. -. No. , p. ):\n\nEstates hiring labourers and farm labourers.\nLastly, it must be observed that sometimes the labour-service system passes into the capitalist system and merges with it to such an extent that it becomes almost impossible to distinguish one from the other. For example, a peasant rents a plot of land, undertaking in return to perform a definite number of days\u2019 work (a practice which, as we know, is most widespread; see examples in the next section). How are we to draw a line of demarcation between such a \u201cpeasant\u201d and the West-European or Ostsee \u201cfarm labourer\u201d who receives a plot of land on undertaking to work a definite number of days? Life creates forms that unite in themselves with remarkable gradualness systems of economy whose basic features constitute opposites. It becomes impossible to say where \u201clabour-service\u201d ends and where \u201ccapitalism\u201d begins.\n\nHaving established the fundamental fact that the whole variety of forms of contemporary landlord farming amounts to two systems \u2013 the labour-service and the capitalist systems, in various combinations, we shall now proceed to give an economic description of the two systems and determine which of them is eliminating the other under the influence of the whole course of economic evolution.\n\nNotes\n[] We are now replacing the term \u201cCorv\u00e9e\u201d by the term \u201clabour-service\u201d since the latter expression corresponds in greater measure to post-Reform relations and is by now generally accepted in our literature.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Here is a particularly striking example: \u201cIn the south of Yelets Uyezd (Orel Gubernia),\u201d writes a correspondent of the Department of Agriculture, \u201con the big landlords\u2019 farms, side by side with cultivation with the aid of annual labourers, a considerable part of the land is tilled by peasants in return for land leased to them. The ex-serfs continue to rent land from their former landlords, and in return till their land Such villages continue to bear the name of \u2018Corv\u00e9e\u2019 of such-and-such a landlord\u201d (S. A. Korolenko, Hired Labour, etc, p. ) Here is one more example: \u201cOn my farm,\u201d writes another landlord, \u201call the work is done by my former peasants ( villages with approximately  persons); in return for this they get the use of pastures for their cattle (from , to , dess.); except that seasonal workers do the first ploughing and sow with seed drills\u201d (ibid., p. . From Kaluga Uyezd)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cMost of the estates are managed in the following way: part, although a very small part, of the land is cultivated by the owners with their own implements, with the aid of labourers hired by the year\u201d and other \u201cworkers, but all the rest of the land is leased to peasants for cultivation either on a half-crop basis\u201d or in return for land, or for money (Hired Labour, ibid., ). . . . \u201cOn the majority of estates simultaneous resort is made to nearly all, or at any rate many, forms of hire\u201d (i.e., methods of \u201cproviding the farm with man power\u201d). Agriculture and Forestry in Russia published by the Department of Agriculture for the Chicago Exhibition, St. Petersburg, , p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Of the  gubernias of European Russia the following are excluded: Archangel, Vologda, Olonets, Vyatka, Perm, Orenburg and Astrakhan. In these gubernias the area cultivated in - amounted to , dess. on private owners\u2019 estates out of a total of ,, dess. cultivated on such land in the whole of European Russia. \u2013 Group I includes the following: the  Baltic gubernias, the  Western (Kovno, Vilna, Grodno and Minsk), the  South-Western (Kiev, Volhynia, Podolsk), the  Southern (Kherson, Taurida, Bessarabia, Ekaterinoslav, Don), and  South-Eastern (Saratov); then follow the St. Petersburg, Moscow and Yaroslavl gubernias. Group II includes: Vitebsk, Mogilev, Smolensk, Kaluga, Voronezh, Poltava and Kharkov. Group III includes the rest of the gubernias. \u2013 To be more exact one should deduct from the total area cultivated on private owners\u2019 land the gown area belonging to tenants, but no such statistics are available. We would add that such a correction would hardly alter our conclusion as to the predominance of the capitalist system, since a large part of the landowners\u2019 fields in the black-earth belt is rented, and the labour-service system predominates in the gubernias of this belt.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cCut-off-lands \u201d (otrezki ) \u2013 the pasture lands woods, etc., which the landlords \u201ccut off,\u201d i.e., of which they deprived the peasants when serfdom was abolished in Russia.\n\n[] Temporarily-bound peasants \u2013 serfs who, after the abolition of serfdom in , were obliged to perform certain services for the landlords, i.e., do Corv\u00e9e service or pay quit-rent. The \u201ctemporarily-bound status\u201d continued until the peasants, by agreement with the landlords, had acquired their allotments by the payment of redemption money. The landlords were obliged to accept redemption payments only after the edict of , by which the \u201cobligatory relation\u201d between the peasants and the landlords had to cease as from January , .\n\n[] The two volumes of The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices on Certain Aspects of the Russian National Economy reached Lenin in the village of Shushenskoye in . He made a careful study of them while working on The Development of Capitalism in Russia, as is proved by his numerous marginal comments in the volumes. While he exposed the method which the Narodniks were so fond of employing, the distortion of the actual situation by quoting \u201caverage\u201d statistics which in fact obscured the differentiation of the peasantry, Lenin carefully checked and made use of the concrete material in the volumes. Thus, on page  of Vol.  Lenin drew up a table showing the distribution, in the different gubernias of Russia, of the various forms of economy (capitalist, labour-service, and mixed). This material, along with some additions from other sources, went to make up the table given in the text.\n\nIII. Description of the Labour-Service System\nLabour-service, as has already been observed above, is of exceedingly varied types. Sometimes peasants undertake for a money payment to cultivate with their own implements the fields of the landowner \u2013 so-called \u201cjob-hire,\u201d \u201cdessiatine employments,\u201d[] cultivation of \u201ccycles\u201d[] [] (i.e., one dessiatine of spring crop and one of winter crop), etc. Sometimes the peasant borrows grain or money, under taking to work off either the entire loan or the interest on it.[] Under this form a feature peculiar to the labour-service system in general stands out with great clarity \u2013 the bondage, the usurious character of this sort of hire of labour. In some cases the peasants work \u201cfor trespass\u201d (i.e., undertake to work off the legally established fine for cattle trespass), or work simply \u201cout of respect\u201d (cf. Engelhardt, loc. cit., ), i.e., gratis, or just for a drink, so as not to lose other \u201cemployments\u201d by the landowner. Lastly, labour-service in return for land is very widespread in the shape either of half-cropping or directly of work for land rented, for grounds used, etc.\n\nVery often the payment for rented land assumes the most diverse forms, which sometimes are even combined, so that side by side with money rent we find rent in kind and \u201clabour-service.\u201d Here are a couple of examples: for every dessiatine,  / dess. to be cultivated +  eggs +  chicken +  day\u2019s female labour; for  dess. of spring crop land  rubles per dess., and  dess. of winter-crop land  rubles per dess. in cash + threshing of so many stacks of oats,  stacks of buckwheat and  stacks of rye + manuring of not less than  dessiatines of rented land with manure from own animals, at the rate of  cart-loads per dessiatine (Karyshev, Rentings, p. ). In this case even the peasant\u2019s manure is converted into a constituent part of the private landowner\u2019s farm! The widespread and varied character of labour-service is indicated by the abundance of terms used for it: otrabotki, otbuchi, otbutki, barshchina, basarinka, posobka, panshchina, postupok, viyemka, etc. (ibid., ). Sometimes the peasant pledges himself to perform \u201cwhatever work the owner orders\u201d (ibid., ), or in general to \u201cpay heed,\u201d \u201cgive ear\u201d to him, to \u201chelp out.\u201d Labour-service embraces the \u201cwhole cycle of jobs in rural life. It is as labour-service that all operations relating to field-cultivation and grain and hay harvesting get done, firewood is stocked and loads are carted\u201d (-), roofs and chimneys are repaired (, ), and the delivery-of poultry and eggs is undertaken (ibid.). An investigator of Gdov Uyezd, St. Petersburg Gubernia, quite justly remarks that the types of labour-service to be met with are of the \u201cformer, pre-Reform, Corv\u00e9e character\u201d ().[]\n\nParticularly interesting is the form of labour-service for land, so-called labour-service renting and rent payment in kind.[] In the preceding chapter we have seen how capitalist relations are manifested in peasant renting of land; here we see \u201crenting\u201d which is simply a survival of Corv\u00e9e economy,[] and which sometimes passes imperceptibly into the capitalist system of providing the estate with agricultural workers by alloting patches of land to them. Zemstvo statistics establish beyond doubt this connection between such \u201crenting\u201d and the lessors\u2019 own farming. \u201cWith the development of their own farming on the private landowners\u2019 estates, the owners had to guarantee themselves a supply of workers at the required time. Hence, there develops in many places the tendency among them to distribute land to the peasants on the labour-service basis, or for a part of the crop together with labour-service. . . .\u201d This system of farming \u201c. . . is fairly widespread. The more frequently the lessors do their own farming, the smaller the amount of land available for leasing and the greater the demand for such land, the more widely does this form of land renting develop\u201d (ibid., p. , cf. also ). Thus, we have here renting of a very special kind, under which the landowner does not abandon his own farm, but which expresses the development of private-landowner cultivation, expresses not the consolidation of the peasant farm by the enlargement of area held, but the conversion of the peasant into an agricultural labourer. In the preceding chapter we have seen that on the peasant\u2019s farm the renting of land is of contradictory significance: for some it is a profitable expansion of their farms; for others it is a deal made out of dire need. Now we see that on the landlord\u2019s farm, too, the leasing of land is of contradictory significance: in some cases it is the transfer of the farm to another person for a payment of rent; in others it is a method of conducting one\u2019s own farm, a method of providing one\u2019s estate with manpower.\n\nLet us pass to the question of the payment of labour under labour-service. The data from various sources are at one in testifying to the fact that the payment of labour where it is hired on a labour-service and bonded basis is always lower than under capitalist \u201cfree\u201d hire. Firstly, this is proved by the fact that rent in kind, i.e., on the basis of labour-service and half-cropping (which, as we have just seen, is merely labour-service and bonded hire), is every where, as a general rule, more costly than money rent, very much more costly (ibid., p. ), sometimes twice as much (ibid., , Rzhev Uyezd, Tver Gubernia). Secondly, rent in kind is developed to the greatest degree among the poorest groups of peasants (ibid.,  and foll.). This is renting from dire need, \u201crenting\u201d by the peasant who is no longer able to resist his conversion, in this way, into an agricultural wage-worker. The well-to-do peasants do what they can to rent land for money. \u201cThe tenant takes advantage of every opportunity to pay his rent in money, and thus to reduce the cost of using other people\u2019s land\u201d (ibid., ) \u2013 and we would add, not only to reduce the cost of renting the land, but also to escape bonded hire. In Rostovon-Don Uyezd the remarkable fact was even observed of money rent being abandoned in favour of skopshchina,[] as rents went up, despite a drop in the peasants\u2019 share of the harvest (ibid., p. ). The significance of rent in kind, which utterly ruins the peasant and turns him into a farm labourer, is quite clearly illustrated by this fact.[] Thirdly, a direct comparison between the price of labour in the case of labour-service hire and of capitalist \u201cfree\u201d hire shows the latter to be greater. In the above-quoted publication of the Department of Agriculture, Hired Labour, etc., it is calculated that the average pay for the complete cultivation, with the peasant\u2019s own implements, of a dessiatine of land under winter grain is  rubles (data for the central black-earth belt for the  years, -). If, however, we calculate the cost of the same amount of work on a hired labour basis, we get  rubles  kopeks for the work of the labourer alone, not counting the work of the horse (the pay for the horse\u2019s work cannot be put at less than  rubles  kopeks, loc. cit., ). The compiler rightly considers this to be \u201cabsolutely abnormal\u201d (ibid.). We would merely observe that the fact that payment for labour under purely capitalist hire is greater than under all forms of bondage and under other pre-capitalist relations has been established not only in agriculture, but also in industry, and not only in Russia, but also in other countries. Here are more precise and more detailed Zemstvo statistics on this question (Statistical Returns for Saratov Uyezd, Vol. I, Pt. III, pp. -. Quoted from Mr. Karyshev\u2019s Rentings, p. ). (See Table on p. .)\n\nThus, under labour-service (just as under bonded hire combined with usury) the prices paid for labour are usually less than half those under capitalist hire.[] Since labour Average price paid for cultivating one dessiatine.\nservice can only be undertaken by a local peasant, and one who must be \u201cprovided with an allotment,\u201d the fact of the tremendous drop in pay clearly indicates the importance of the allotment as wages in kind. The allotment, in such cases, continues to this day to serve as a means of \u201cguaranteeing\u201d the landowner a supply of cheap labour. But the difference between free and \u201csemi-free\u201d[] labour is far from exhausted by the difference in pay. Of enormous importance also is the circumstance that the latter form of labour always presupposes the personal dependence of the one hired upon the one who hires him, it always presupposes the greater or lesser retention of \u201cother than economic pressure.\u201d Engelhardt very aptly says that the lending of money for repayment by labour-service is explained by the greater security of such debts: to extract payment from the peasant on a distraint order is a difficult matter, \u201cbut the authorities will compel the peasant to perform the work he has undertaken to do, even if his own grain remains ungathered\u201d (loc. cit., ). \u201cOnly long years of slavery, of serf labour for the lord, have been able to produce the indifference\u201d (only apparent) with which the cultivator leaves his own grain in the rain to go carting somebody else\u2019s sheaves (ibid., ). Without one or other form of binding the population to their domiciles, to the \u201ccommunity,\u201d without a certain lack of civic rights, labour-service as a system would be impossible. It stands to reason that an inevitable consequence of the above-described features of the labour-service system is low productivity of labour: methods of farming based on labour-service can only be the most stereotyped; the labour of the bonded peasant cannot but approximate, in quality, to the labour of the serf.\n\nThe combination of the labour-service and the capitalist systems makes the present system of landlord farming extremely similar in its economic organisation to the system that prevailed in our textile industry before the development of large-scale machine industry. There, part of the operations was done by the merchant with his own implements and with wage-workers (fixing the yarn, dyeing and finishing the fabric, etc.), and part with the implements of peasant handicraftsmen who worked for him, using his material. Here, part of the operations is performed by wage-workers, using the employer\u2019s implements, and another part by the labour and the implements of peasants working on the land of others. There, combined with industrial capital was merchant\u2019s capital, and the handicrafts man, besides being weighed down by capital, was burdened with bondage, the operations of the subcontractor, the truck system, etc. Here, likewise, combined with industrial capital is merchant\u2019s and usurer\u2019s capital accompanied by all forms of pay reduction and intensification of the producer\u2019s personal dependence. There, the transitional system lasted for centuries, being based on a primitive hand-labour technique, and was smashed in some three decades by large-scale machine industry; here, labour-service has continued almost since the rise of Rus (the landowners forced the villeins into bondage as far back as the time of Russkaya Pravda[]), perpetuating routine technique, and has begun rapidly to give way to capitalism only in the post-Reform epoch. In both cases, the old system merely implies stagnation in the forms of production (and, consequently, in all social relations), and the domination of the Asiatic way of life. In both cases, the new, capitalist forms of economy constitute enormous progress, despite all the contradictions inherent in them.\n\nNotes\n[] Statistical Returns for Ryazan Gubernia.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Engelhardt, loc. cit.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. V, Pt , Moscow, l, pp, -. We give these references only as an illustration. A mass of similar information is to be found in all the literature on peasant and private-landowner farming.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It is noteworthy that the enormous variety of forms of labour-service in Russia, and of forms of land renting with all sorts of supplementary payments, etc., are covered in their entirety by the main forms of pre-capitalist relations in agriculture indicated by Marx in Chapter , Vol. III of Capital. In the preceding chapter, we have indicated that there are three main forms: ) labour-rent, ) rent in kind, and ) money rent. It is, therefore quite natural that Marx should want specifically Russian data as illustrations for the section dealing with ground-rent.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] According to Results of Zemstvo Statistical Investigations (Vol. II), of all the land rented by peasants, % is paid for in money;  to % by labour-service,  to % with part of the product and, finally,  to % by a combination of methods.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. examples given in footnote to pp. -. When Corv\u00e9e economy existed, the landlord gave the peasant land so that the peasant might work for him. When land is leased on the labour-service basis, the economic aspect of the matter is obviously the same.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The summary of the latest data on land renting (Mr. Karyshev in the book: The Influence of Harvests, etc., Vol ) has fully confirmed the fact that it is only want that compels peasants to rent land on a half-crop or a labour-service basis, and that the well-to-do peasants prefer to rent land for money (pp. -), as rent in kind is everywhere incomparably more costly for the peasant than in cash (pp. -). All these facts, however, have not prevented Mr. Karyshev from presenting the situation as though \u201cthe poor peasant . . . is better able to satisfy his need for food by slightly extending his crop area to other people\u2019s land on a half-crop basis\u201d (). Such are the fantastic ideas to which a bias in favour of \u201cnatural economy\u201d can lead one! It has been proved that the payment of rent in kind is more costly than payment in cash, that it constitutes a sort of truck-system in agriculture, that the peasant is completely ruined and turned into a farm labourer \u2013 and yet our economist talks of improving \u201cfood\u201d! Half-crop payment for rent, if you please, \u201chelps . . . the needy section of the rural population to obtain\u201d land by renting it (). Our economist here calls it \u201chelp\u201d to obtain land on the worst conditions, on the condition that the peasant is turned into a farm labourer. The question arises: what is the difference between the Russian Narodniks and the Russian agrarians, who always have been and always are ready to render the \u201cneedy section of the rural population\u201d this kind of \u201chelp\u201d? By the way, here is an interesting example. In Khotin Uyezd, Bessarabia Gubernia, the average daily earnings of a half cropper are estimated at  kopeks, and a day labourer in the summer at  to  kopeks. \u201cIt seems that the earnings of a half-cropper are, after all, higher than the wages of a farm labourer \u201d (; Mr. Karyshev\u2019s italics). This \u201cafter all\u201d is very characteristic. But, unlike the farm labourer, the half-cropper has his farm expenses, has he not? He has to have a horse and harness, has he not? Why was no account taken of these expenses? Whereas the average daily wage in the summer in Bessarabia Gubernia is  to  kopeks (- and -) the average wage of a labourer with horse and harness is  to  kopeks (- and -). Does it not rather \u201cseem\u201d that the farm labourer \u201cafter all\u201d earns more than the half-cropper? The average daily wage of a labourer working without a horse of his own (average for a whole year) is estimated at  kopeks for Bessarabia Gubernia in the period - (ibid., )\u2014Lenin\n\n[] After this, what can one do but describe as reactionary the criticism of capitalism made, for instance, by a Narodnik like Prince Vasilchikov? The very word \u201chired,\u201d he exclaims pathetically, is contradictory, for hire presupposes non-independence, and non-independence rules out \u201cfreedom.\u201d This Narodnik-minded landlord forgets, of course, that capitalism substitutes free non-independence for bonded non-independence.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] An expression employed by Mr. Karyshev, loc. cit. It is a pity Mr. Karvshev did not draw the conclusion that half-crop renting \u201chelps\u201d the survival of \u201csemi-free\u201d labour!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cultivation of cycles \u2013 an enslaving form of labour-service rendered to the landlord by the peasant as rental for land obtained from him in post-Reform Russia. The landlord lent the peasant land or made him a loan in cash or kind for which the peasant undertook to cultivate a \u201ccycle,\u201d using his own implements and draught animals; this meant cultivating one dessiatine of spring crops and one of winter crops, occasionally supplemented by reaping a dessiatine of crops.\n\n[] Skopshchina \u2013 the name given in the southern parts of Russia to the payment of land rent in kind, on terms of bondage, the tenant paying the landowner \u201cs kopny\u201d (from the corn-shock) a portion of the harvest (a half, and sometimes more), and usually fulfilling miscellaneous labour services in addition.\n\n[] Villeins \u2013 feudally dependent peasants in ancient Rus (th-th centuries) who performed Corv\u00e9e service for the princes and other temporal and clerical lords and also paid rent in kind. The feudal lords seized the land of the villeins and compelled them to work on the feudal estates.\n\nRusskaya Pravda (Russian Law ) \u2013 the first written codification of laws and princes\u2019 decrees (th-th centuries). The statutes of the Russkaya Pravda protected the lives and property of the feudal lord and are indicative of the bitter class struggle between peasants in feudal bondage and their exploiters.\n\nIV. The Decline of the Labour-Service System\nThe question now arises: in what relation does the labour-service system stand to the post-Reform economy of Russia?\n\nFirst of all, the growth of commodity economy conflicts with the labour-service system, since the latter is based on natural economy, on unchanging technique, on inseparable ties between the landlord and the peasant. That is why this system is totally impracticable in its complete form, and every advance in the development of commodity economy and commercial agriculture undermines the conditions of its practicability.\n\nNext we must take account of the following circumstance. From the foregoing it follows that labour-service, as practised in present-day landlord farming, should be divided into two types: ) labour-service that can only be performed by a peasant farmer who owns draught animals and implements (e. g., cultivation of \u201ccycle dessiatine,\u201d ploughing, etc.), and ) labour-service that can be performed by a rural proletarian who has no implements (for example, reaping, mowing, threshing, etc.). It is obvious that for both peasant and landlord farming, the first and the second type of labour-service are of opposite significance, and that the latter type constitutes a direct transition to capitalism, merging with it by a number of quite imperceptible transitions. In our literature labour-service is usually referred to in general, without this distinction being made. Yet in the process of the elimination of labour-service by capitalism the shifting of the centre of gravity from the first type of labour-service to the second is of enormous importance. Here is an example from Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia : \u201cOn the majority of the estates . . . the cultivation of the fields and the crops, i.e., the jobs on the careful fulfilment of which the harvest depends, are done by regular workers, whereas the harvesting, i.e., the job in the performance of which promptness and speed are the prime consideration, is given to neighbouring peasants to be done in return for money lent, or for the use of pasture and other grounds\u201d (Vol. V, Pt. , p. ). On such farms most of the hands are hired on the labour-service basis, but the capitalist system undoubtedly predominates, and the \u201cneighbouring peasants\u201d are at bottom turned into rural workers, similar to the \u201ccontract day labourers\u201d in Germany, who also have land and also hire themselves out for a definite part of the year (see above, p. , footnote). The enormous drop in the number of horses owned by peasants and the increase in the number of horseless households as a result of the crop failures of the s[] could not but exert great influence in accelerating this process of the elimination of labour-service by the capitalist system.[]\n\nFinally, one of the most important reasons for the decline of the labour-service system should be sought in the differentiation of the peasantry. The connection between labour-service (of the first type) and the middle group of the peasantry is clear and a priori \u2013 as we have already observed above \u2013 and can be proved by Zemstvo statistics. For example, the abstract for Zadonsk Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia, gives returns of the number of farms doing job-work, in the various groups of peasantry. Here are the data in percentages:\n\nNumber of farms doing job work.\nFrom the above it is clear that participation in job-work is less prevalent in the two extreme groups. The largest percentage of households taking job-work is to be found in the middle group of the peasantry. Since job-work is also frequently assigned in Zemstvo statistical abstracts to the category of \u201cemployments\u201d in general, we see here, consequently, an example of the typical \u201cemployments\u201d of the middle peasantry \u2013 exactly as in the preceding chapter we acquainted ourselves with the typical \u201cemployments\u201d of the bottom and top groups of the peasantry. The types of \u201cemployments\u201d examined there express the development of capitalism (commercial and industrial establishments and the sale of labour-power), whereas the type of \u201cemployments\u201d mentioned here, on the contrary, expresses the backwardness of capitalism and the predominance of labour-service (if we assume that in the sum-total of \u201cjob-work\u201d the predominant jobs are such as we have assigned to labour-service of the first type).\n\nThe greater the decline of natural economy and of the middle peasantry, the more vigorously is labour-service bound to be eliminated by capitalism. The well-to-do peasants cannot, naturally, serve as a basis for the labour-service system, for it is only dire need that compels the peasant to undertake the worst-paid jobs, jobs that are ruinous for his own farm. But the rural proletariat are equally unsuitable for the labour-service system, though for another reason: having no farm of his own, or possessing a miserable patch of land, the rural proletarian is not tied down to it to the extent that the \u201cmiddle\u201d peasant is, and, as a consequence, it is far easier for him to go elsewhere and hire himself out on \u201cfree\u201d terms, i.e., for higher pay and without bondage at all. Hence the universal dissatisfaction of our agrarians at the peasants leaving for the towns or for \u201coutside employments\u201d generally, hence their complaints that the peasants have \u201clittle attachment\u201d (see below, p. ). The development of purely capitalist wage-labour saps the very roots of the labour-service system.[]\n\nIt is supremely important to note that this inseparable connection between the differentiation of the peasantry and the elimination of labour-service by capitalism \u2013 a connection so obvious in theory \u2013 has long been noted by agricultural writers who have observed the various methods of farming on the landlord estates. In the preface to his collection of articles on Russian agriculture written between  and , Prof. Stebut points out that . . . \u201cIn community peasant agriculture the farmer-industrialists are becoming differentiated from the farm labourers. The former, who are becoming cultivators on a big scale, are beginning to employ farm labourers and usually cease to take job-work, unless they find it absolutely necessary to enlarge their crop area somewhat, or to obtain the use of pasture land, which in most cases cannot be done except by taking job-work; the latter, on the other hand, cannot take any job-work for lack of horses. Hence the obvious necessity for a transition, and a speedy transition, to farming based on wage-labour, since the peasants who still take job-work by the dessiatine are, due to the feeble state of their horses and to the multitude of jobs they undertake, beginning to turn out work that is bad from the viewpoint both of quality and of promptness of fulfilment\u201d (p. ).\n\nReferences to the fact that the ruin of the peasantry is leading to the elimination of labour-service by capitalism are also made in current Zemstvo statistical material. In Orel Gubernia, for example, it has been observed that the drop in grain prices ruined many tenants and that the land owners were compelled to increase the area cultivated on capitalist lines. \u201cSimultaneously with the expansion of the area cultivated by the landlords, we observe everywhere a tendency to replace job-work by the labour of regular farm hands and to do away with the use of peasants\u2019 implements . . . a tendency to improve the cultivation of the soil by the introduction of up-to-date implements . . . to change the system of farming, to introduce grass crops, to expand and improve livestock farming and to make it profitable\u201d (Agricultural Survey of Orel Gubernia for -, pp. -. Quoted from P. Struve\u2019s Critical Remarks, pp. -). In Poltava Gubernia, in , when grain prices were low, there was observed \u201ca diminution in peasant renting of land . . . throughout the gubernia. . . . Correspondingly, in many places, despite the severe drop in grain prices, there was an increase in the area cultivated by landowners employing regular labour\u201d (The Influence of Harvests, etc., I, ). In Tambov Gubernia, a considerable increase has been observed in the prices paid for work done by horses: for the three years -, these prices were  to % higher than for the three years - (Novoye Slovo, , No. , p. ). This rise in the cost of work done by horses, a natural result of the decline in the number of peasant horses, cannot but entail the ousting of labour-service by the capitalist system.\n\nIt is by no means our intention, of course, to use these separate references in order to prove that labour-service is being eliminated by capitalism: no complete statistics on this subject are available. We are merely using them to illustrate the point that there is a connection between the differentiation of the peasantry and the elimination of labour-service by capitalism. General and mass-scale data, which prove irrefutably that this elimination is going on, relate to the employment of machinery in agriculture and to the employment of labour freely hired. But before passing to these data, we must first deal with the views of the Narodnik economists on contemporary farming by private landowners in Russia.\n\nNotes\n[] The horse census of - in  gubernias revealed a drop of .% in the number of horses possessed by all horse owners, and a drop of , in the number of horse owners. In Tambov, Voronezh, Kursk, Ryazan, Orel, Tula and Nizhni-Novgorod gubernias, the decline in the number of horses between  and  was .%. In seven other gubernias of the black-earth belt the decline between  and  was %. In  gubernias of European Russia in - there were ,  peasant households, of which ,, owned horses; in -, there were in these gubernias ,, households, of which ,, owned horses. Consequently, the number of horse-owning households dropped by ,, while the number of horseless increased by , The percentage of horseless households rose from .% to .% (Statistics of the Russian Empire, XXXVII. St. Petersburg, .) Above we have shown that in  gubernias of European Russia the number of horseless households rose from . million in - to . million in - \u2013 i.e., from .% to .%. In four southern gubernias (Bessarabia, Ekaterinoslav, Taurida, Kherson), the number of horseless households rose from , in  to , in , i.e., from .% to .% (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. also S. A. Korolenko, Hired Labour, etc., pp. -, where, on the basis of the horse censuses of  and , examples are cited of how the drop in the number of horses possessed by peasants is accompanied by an increase in the number of horses possessed by private landowners.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Here is a particularly striking example. Zemstvo statisticians explain the comparative incidence of money renting and renting in kind in various parts of Bakhmut Uyezd, Ekaterinoslav Gubernia, in the following way:\n\n\u201cMoney renting is most widespread . . . in the coal and salt-mining districts, and least widespread in the steppe and purely agricultural area The peasants, in general, are not eager to go out to work for others, and are particularly reluctant to accept irksome and badly paid work on private estates. Work in the coal mines, in ore-mining and in metallurgy generally, is arduous and injurious to the worker\u2019s health, but, generally speaking, it is better paid, and attracts the worker with the prospect of monthly or weekly wages in cash, as he does not usually get money when he works on the landlord\u2019s estate for the reason that there he is either working in payment of the \u2018bit\u2019 of land he has rented, or of straw or grain he has borrowed, or has managed to get his pay in advance to cover his ordinary needs, etc.\n\n\u201cAll this induces the worker to avoid working on estates, and he does avoid doing so when there is an opportunity of earning money in some place other than the landlord\u2019s \u2018estate.\u2019 And this opportunity occurs mostly where there are many mines, at which the workers are paid \u2018good\u2019 money. With the \u2018pence\u2019 the peasant earns in the mines, he can rent land, without having to pledge himself to work on an estate, and in this way renting for money establishes its sway\u201d (quoted from Results of Zemstw Statistical Investigations, Vol. II, p. ). In the steppe, non-industrial divisions of the uyezd, on the other hand, land renting on a skopshchina and a labour-service basis establishes its sway.\n\nThus, to escape labour-service the peasant is ready to flee even to the mines! Prompt payment in cash, the impersonal form of hire and regular working hours \u201cattract\u201d the worker to such an extent that he even prefers the mines underground to agriculture, the agriculture about which our Narodniks wax so idyllic. The whole point is that the peasant knows from bitter experience the real value of the labour-service idealised by the agrarians and the Narodniks, and he knows how much better are purely capitalist relations.\u2014Lenin\n\nV. The Narodnik Attitude to the Problem\nThe point that the labour-service system is simply a survival of Corv\u00e9e economy is not denied even by the Narodniks. On the contrary, it is admitted \u2013 although in an insufficiently general form \u2013 by Mr. N.\u2013on (Sketches, \u00a7 IX) and by Mr. V. V. (particularly explicitly in his article \u201cOur Peasant Farming and Agronomy,\u201d in Otechestvenniye Zapiski, , No. -). The more astonishing is it that the Narodniks do their utmost to avoid admitting the clear and simple fact that the present system of private-landowner farming is a combination of the labour-service and the capitalist systems, and that, consequently, the more developed the former, the weaker the latter, and vice versa. They avoid analysing the relation of each of these systems to the productivity of labour, to the payment of the worker\u2019s labour, to the basic features of the post-Reform economy of Russia, etc. To put the question on this basis, on the basis of recognising the \u201cchange\u201d actually taking place, meant to admit the inevitability of the progressive elimination of labour-service by capitalism. To avoid drawing that conclusion, the Narodniks did not stop even at idealising the labour-service system. This monstrous idealisation is the basic feature of the Narodnik views on the evolution of landlord economy. Mr. V. V. even went so far as to write that \u201cthe people . . . are the victors in the struggle for the form of agricultural technique, although their victory has resulted in their greater ruin\u201d (The Destiny of Capitalism, p. ). To admit such a \u201cvictory\u201d is more eloquent than to admit defeat! Mr. N.\u2013on discerned in the allotment of land to the peasants under Corv\u00e9e and under labour-service economy the \u201cprinciple\u201d \u201cof linking the producer and the means of production,\u201d but he forgot the tiny circumstance that this allotting of land served as a means of guaranteeing a supply of labour for the landlords. As we have indicated, Marx, in describing pre-capitalist systems of agriculture, analysed all the forms of economic relations that, in general, exist in Russia, and clearly emphasised the necessity of small-scale production and of a tie between the peasant and the land in the case of both labour-rent, rent in kind and money rent. But could it ever have entered his head to elevate this allotting of land to the dependent peasant into a \u201cprinciple\u201d of an eternal tie between the producer and the means of production? Did he forget even for a moment that this tie between the producer and the means of production was the source of, and condition for, medieval exploitation, constituted the basis for technical and social stagnation and necessarily required all sorts of \u201cother than economic, pressure\u201d?\n\nAn exactly similar idealisation of labour-service and of bondage is displayed by Messrs. Orlov and Kablukov in Moscow Zemstvo Returns when they quote as a model the farm of a certain Mme. Kostinskaya in Podolsk Uyezd (see Vol. V, Pt. I, pp. -, and Vol. II, pp. -, Sect. II). In Mr. Kablukov\u2019s opinion, this farm proves \u201cthat it is possible to arrange matters in such a way as to preclude (sic !!) such an antagonism\u201d (i.e., antagonism of interests between landlord and peasant farming) \u201cand assist in achieving a flourishing (sic !) condition of both peasant and private farming\u201d (Vol. V, Pt. I, pp. -). It seems, then, that the flourishing condition of the peasants consists in labour-service and bondage. They have no pastures or cattle runs (Vol. II, pp. -), \u2013 which does not prevent Messrs. the Narodniks from regarding them as \u201csound\u201d peasants \u2013 and rent these grounds, for which they pay the proprietress in work, performing \u201call the jobs on her estate ... thoroughly, punctually and promptly.\u201d[]\n\nThat is the limit in idealising an economic system which is a direct survival of Corv\u00e9e service!\n\nThe methods employed in all such Narodnik reasoning are very simple; we have only to forget that the allotment of land to the peasant is one of the conditions of Corv\u00e9e or labour-service economy, we have only to omit the circumstance that this allegedly \u201cindependent\u201d cultivator must render labour-rent, rent in kind or money rent, \u2013 and we get the \u201cpure\u201d idea of \u201cthe tie between the producer and the means of production.\u201d But the actual relation between capitalism and pre-capitalist forms of exploitation does not change in the least from the fact of simply omitting these forms.[]\n\nLet us deal somewhat with another, very curious, argument of Mr. Kablukov. We have seen that he idealises labour-service; but it is remarkable that when he, as a statistician, describes real types of purely capitalist farms in Moscow Gubernia, his description, in spite of himself, and in a distorted way, is a reflection of the very facts that prove the progressive nature of capitalism in Russian agriculture. We beg the reader\u2019s attention, and apologise in advance for our rather lengthy quotations.\n\nBesides the old types of farms employing hired labour, there is to be found in Moscow Gubernia\n\n\u201ca new, recent, emergent type of farm that has totally broken with all tradition and regards things simply, in the way people regard every industry that is to serve as a source of income. Agriculture in this case is not regarded as . . . a lord\u2019s hobby, as an occupation anybody may engage in. . . . No, here the necessity is recognised of having . . . special knowledge. . . . The basis of calculation\u201d (as to the organisation of production) \u201cis the same as in all other forms of production\u201d (Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia, Vol. V, Pt. I, pp. -).\n\nMr. Kablukov does not notice that this description of the new type of farm which has only \u201crecently emerged,\u201d in the s, proves precisely the progressive nature of capitalism in agriculture. It was capitalism that first turned agriculture from a \u201clord\u2019s hobby\u201d into ordinary industry, it was capitalism that first compelled people \u201cto regard things simply,\u201d \u201cto break with tradition\u201d and to equip themselves with \u201cspecial knowledge.\u201d Before capitalism this was both unnecessary and impossible, because the farms of the different manors, village communities and peasant families were \u201cself-sufficing,\u201d were not dependent on other farms, and no power on earth could drag them out of their age-long stagnation. Capitalism was the force which created (through the medium of the market) the social accounting of the output of the individual producers, and compelled them to reckon with the demands of social development. It is this that constitutes the progressive role of capitalism in agriculture in all European countries.\n\nListen now to the way Mr. Kablukov describes our purely capitalist farms:\n\n\u201cOnly then is account taken of labour-power as a necessary factor in acting upon nature; without this factor all organisation of the landlord\u2019s estate will be fruitless. Thus, with all appreciation of its significance, this element, at the same time, is not regarded as an independent source of income, as was the case under serfdom, or as is the case now in those instances when what is made the basis of the estate\u2019s profitability is not the product of labour, the obtaining of which is the direct purpose of its application, not the striving to apply this labour to the production of its more valuable products and thereby to enjoy its results, but the striving to reduce the share of the product which the worker gets for himself, the desire to reduce the cost of labour to the master as near as possible to zero\u201d (p. ). Reference is made to farming based on labour in return for the use of cut-off lands. \u201cUnder these circumstances, for a farm to be profitable the owner requires neither knowledge nor special qualities. All that is obtained from this labour represents clear income for the owner or at all events such income as is obtained almost without any expenditure of circulating capital. But such farming cannot, of course, be well conducted and cannot be called farming in the strict sense of the term, any more than the leasing of all pasture and other grounds can be called such; there is no economic organisation here\u201d (). And quoting examples of the leasing of cut-off lands in return for labour-service, the author concludes: \u201cThe main emphasis in the farm economy, the manner of extracting an income from the soil, is rooted in the exertion of influence upon the worker rather than upon matter and its forces\u201d ().\n\nThis argument is an extremely interesting example of how distorted is the picture of actual facts when viewed from the angle of a wrong theory. Mr. Kablukov confuses production with the social system of production. Under every social system production consists in \u201cthe exertion of influence\u201d upon matter and its forces. Under every social system only the surplus product can be the landowner\u2019s source of \u201cincome.\u201d In both respects the labour-service system of economy is fully identical with the capitalist system, Mr. Kablukov\u2019s opinion notwithstanding. The real difference between them is that labour-service necessarily presupposes the lowest productivity of labour; hence, no possibility exists for increasing income by increasing the surplus product; that can only be done by one means, namely, by employing all sorts of bonded forms of hire. Under purely capitalist economy, on the contrary, bonded forms of hire must go by the board, for the proletarian, not being tied to the land, is useless as an object of bondage; \u2013 to raise the productivity of labour becomes not only possible, but also necessary as the sole means of increasing income and with standing severe competition. Thus, the description of our purely capitalist farms, given by the very Mr. Kablukov who so zealously tried to idealise labour-service, fully confirms the fact that Russian capitalism is creating the social conditions which necessarily demand the rationalisation of agriculture and the abolition of bondage, whereas labour-service, on the contrary, precludes the possibility of rationalising agriculture and perpetuates technical stagnation and the producer\u2019s condition of bondage. Nothing could be more frivolous than the customary Narodnik exultation over the fact that capitalism in our agriculture is weak. So much the worse if it is weak, for it only indicates the strength of pre-capitalist forms of exploitation, which are incomparably more burdensome to the producer.\n\nNotes\n[] Cf. Volgin, op. cit., pp -.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cIt is said that the spread of labour-service renting in place of money renting . . . is a retrogressive fact. But do we say that it is desirable or beneficial? We . . . have never asserted that it is progressive,\u201d stated Mr. Chuprov on behalf of all the authors of The Influence of Harvests, etc. (see Verbatim Report of the Debates in the F E. S. of March  and , ,[] p. ) This statement is untrue even formally, for Mr. Karyshev (see above) described labour-service as \u201chelp\u201d to the rural population. And in substance this statement absolutely contradicts the actual content of all the Narodnik theories with their idealisation of labour-service. It is to the great credit of Messrs. T.-Baranovsky and Struve that they have correctly presented the question () of the significance of low grain prices: the criterion for appraising them must be whether such prices promote the elimination of labour-service by capitalism or not. Such a question is obviously one of fact, and in answering it we differ somewhat from the writers mentioned. On the basis of the data given in the text (see particularly \u00a7 VII of this chapter and also Chapter IV ), we consider it possible and even probable that the period of low grain prices will be marked by a no less, if not more, rapid elimination of labour-service by capitalism than was the preceding historical period of high grain prices.\u2014Lenin\n\nVI. The Story of Engelhardt\u2019s Farm\nQuite a special place among the Narodniks is held by Engelhardt. To criticise his appraisal of labour-service and capitalism would mean to repeat what has already been said in the preceding section. We think it far more expedient to set against Engelhardt\u2019s Narodnik views the story of Engelhardt\u2019s own farm. Such a critique will also be of positive value, because the evolution of this farm reflects in miniature, as it were, the main features of the evolution of all private-landowner farming in post-Reform Russia.\n\nWhen Engelhardt settled down on the farm it was based on the traditional labour-service and bondage, which preclude \u201cproper farming\u201d (Letters from the Countryside, ). Labour-service was the cause of the poor condition of cattle raising, of the poor cultivation of the soil and of the monotonous persistence of obsolete systems of field cultivation (). \u201cI saw that it was impossible . . . to go on farming in the old way\u201d (). The competition of grain from the steppe regions was bringing down prices and making farming unprofitable (p. ).[] We would observe that from the very outset, along with the labour-service system a certain part was played on the farm by the capitalist system: wage-workers, although very few in number, were also employed on the farm when it was run in the old way (the cowman and others), and Engelhardt asserts that the wages of his farm labourer (drawn from among allotment-holding peasants) were \u201cfabulously low\u201d (), low because \u201cit was impossible to give more \u201d considering that cattle-raising was in a bad way. The low productivity of labour made it impossible to raise wages. Thus, the starting-point on Engelhardt\u2019s farm was the features, familiar to us, of all Russian farms: labour-service, bondage, the very lowest productivity of labour, \u201cincredibly low\u201d payment of labour, routine farming.\n\nWhat changes did Engelhardt introduce into this state of things? He began to sow flax \u2013 a commercial and industrial crop requiring the employment of labour on a big scale. The commercial and capitalist character of the cultivation was accordingly enhanced. But how was he to obtain labour? Engelhardt tried at first to employ in the new (commercial) cultivation the old system, that of labour-service. Nothing came of that; the work was badly done, the \u201cdessiatine\u201d proved to be beyond the strength of the peasants, who resisted with all their might \u201cgang work\u201d and bonded terms of labour. \u201cThe system had to be changed. Meanwhile I got on my feet. I acquired my own horses, harness, carts, ploughs and harrows and was already in a position to run the farm with regular workers. I began to produce flax, partly with my regular workers and partly on a job basis, hiring labourers for definite jobs\u201d (). Thus, the transition to the new system of farming and to commercial cultivation demanded the replacement of labour-service by the capitalist system. To increase productivity of labour, Engelhardt resorted to the well-tried method of capitalist production: piece work. Women were engaged to work by the stack, or the pood, and Engelhardt (not without some na\\\"ive triumph) tells of the success of this system; the cost of cultivation increased (from  rubles per dess. to  rubles), but profit also increased by  to  rubles; the women\u2019s productivity of labour increased following the change from bonded to hired labour (from half a pood per night to a whole pood) and the earnings of the women increased to - kopeks per day (\u201cunprecedented in our parts\u201d). The local textile merchant was full of praise for Engelhardt: \u201cYour flax has given a great fillip to trade\u201d ().\n\nApplied at first to the cultivation of the commercial crop, hired labour gradually began to embrace other agricultural operations. One of the first operations to be withdrawn by capital from the labour-service system was threshing. It is well known that on all farms run by private landowners this work is mostly performed on capitalist lines. \u201cPart of the land,\u201d wrote Engelhardt, \u201cI lease to peasants for cultivation in cycles, for otherwise I would find it hard to cope with the reaping of the rye\u201d (). Thus, labour-service functions as a direct transition to capitalism, by ensuring the farmer a supply of day labourers in the busiest season. At first cycle-cultivation included threshing, but here, too, the poor quality of the work done compelled the farmer to resort to hired labour. Land began to be leased for cycle-cultivation without threshing, which latter was done partly by farm labourers and partly, through the medium of a contractor, by a team of wage-workers, at piece rates. Here, too, the results of replacing labour-service by the capitalist system were: ) an increase in the productivity of labour: formerly  people threshed  sheaves per day, now  did , sheaves; ) an increase in the yield; ) a reduction in threshing time; ) an increase in the worker\u2019s earnings; ) an increase in the farmer\u2019s profits ().\n\nFurther, the capitalist system also embraced tillage operations. Iron ploughs were introduced in place of the old wooden ones, and the work passed from the bound peasant to the farm labourer. Engelhardt triumphantly reports the success of his innovation, the diligence of the labourers, and quite justly shows that the customary accusations flung at the labourer of being lazy and dishonest are due to the \u201cbrand of serfdom\u201d and to bonded labour \u201cfor the lord,\u201d and that the new organisation of farming also demands something of the farmer: a display of enterprise, a knowledge of people and ability to handle them, a knowledge of the job and its scope, acquaintance with the technical and commercial aspects of agriculture \u2013 i.e., qualities that were not and could not be possessed by the Oblomovs[] of the feudal or bondage suffering countryside. The various changes in the technique of agriculture are inseparably connected with one another and inevitably lead to the transformation of its economy. \u201cFor example, let us suppose you introduce the cultivation of flax and clover \u2013 that will immediately necessitate numerous other changes, and if these are not made, the business will not run smoothly. The ploughing implements will have to be changed and iron ploughs substituted for wooden ones, iron harrows for wooden ones, and this in turn will require a different type of horse, a different type of labourer, a different system of farming as regards the hire of labourers, etc.\u201d (-).\n\nThe change in the technique of agriculture thus proved to be inseparably bound up with the elimination of labour-service by capitalism. Particularly interesting in this regard is the gradualness with which this elimination takes place: the system of farming, as hitherto, combines labour-service and capitalism, but the main weight gradually shifts from the former to the latter. Here is a description of how Engelhardt\u2019s reorganised farm operated:\n\n\u201cNowadays I have much work to do, because I have changed the whole system of farming. A considerable part of the work is done by regular labourers and day labourers. The work is extremely varied. I clear brushwood for wheat growing, uproot birches for flax growing. I have rented meadow land by the Dnieper, and have sown clover, lots of rye and much flax. I need an enormous number of hands. To secure them, you have to make arrangements in good time, for when the busy season starts everybody will be occupied either at home or on other farms. This recruitment of labour is done by advancing money or grain for work to be done\u201d (pp.-).\n\nLabour-service and bondage remained, consequently, even on a \u201cproperly\u201d conducted farm; but, firstly, they now occupied a subordinate position as compared with free hire, and, secondly, the very labour-service underwent a change; it was mainly the second type of labour-service which remained, that implying the labour not of peasant farmers, but of regular labourers and agricultural day labourers.\n\nThus, Engelhardt\u2019s own farm is better than all arguments in refuting Engelhardt\u2019s Narodnik theories. He set out to farm on rational lines, but was unable to do so, under the given social and economic conditions, except by organising the farm on the basis of employing farm labourers. The raising of the technical level of agriculture and the supplanting of labour-service by capitalism proceeded hand in hand on this farm, as it does on all private-landowner farms in general in Russia. This process is most clearly reflected in the employment of machinery in Russian agriculture.\n\nVII. The Employment of Machinery in Agriculture\nThe post-Reform epoch is divided into four periods as regards the development of agricultural machinery production and the employment of machinery in agriculture.[] The first period covers the years immediately preceding the peasant Reform and the years immediately following it. The landlords at first rushed to purchase foreign machinery so as to get along without the \u201cunpaid\u201d labour of the serfs and to avoid the difficulties connected with the hiring of free workers. This attempt ended, of course, in failure; the fever soon died down, and beginning with - the demand for foreign machinery dropped. The end of the s saw the beginning of the second period, which continued until . It was marked by an extremely steady and extremely rapid increase in machinery imports from abroad; home production also grew steadily, but more slowly than imports. From  to  there was a particularly rapid increase in imports of agricultural machinery, due partly to the abolition, in , of the duty-free import of pig-iron and cast-iron for the needs of factories producing agricultural machinery. The third period extended from  to the beginning of the s. Agricultural machinery, hitherto imported duty-free, now had an import duty imposed (of  kopeks gold per pood) . The high duty caused an enormous drop in machinery imports, while home production developed slowly owing to the agricultural crisis which set in at that time. Finally, the beginning of the s evidently saw the opening of a fourth period, marked by a fresh rise in the import of agricultural machinery, and by a particularly rapid increase of its home production.\n\nLet us cite statistics to illustrate these points. Average annual imports of agricultural machinery at various periods were as follows:\n\nAverage annual imports of agricultural machinery.\nThere are, unfortunately, no such complete and precise data on the production of agricultural machinery and implements in Russia. The unsatisfactory state of our factory and-works statistics, the confusing of the production of machinery in general with the production of specifically agricultural machinery, and the absence of any firmly established rules for distinguishing between \u201cfactory\u201d and \u201chandicraft\u201d production of agricultural machinery \u2013 all this prevents a complete picture of the development of agricultural machinery production in Russia being obtained. Combining all the data available from the above-mentioned sources, we get the following picture of the development of agricultural machinery production in Russia:\n\nProduction, imports and employment of agricultural machinery and implements.\nThese data show the vigorousness of the process in which primitive agricultural implements are giving way to improved ones (and, consequently, primitive forms of farming to capitalism). In  years the employment of agricultural machinery increased more than .-fold, and this was mainly because of the expansion of home production, which more than quadrupled. Noteworthy, too, was the shifting of the main centre of such production from the Vistula and Baltic gubernias to the south-Russian steppe gubernias. Whereas in the s the main centre of agricultural capitalism in Russia was the western outer gubernias, in the s still more outstanding areas of agricultural capitalism were created in the purely Russian gubernias.[]\n\nIt is necessary to add, regarding the data just cited, that although they are based on official (and, as far as we know, the only) information on the subject under examination, they are far from complete and are not fully comparable for the different years. For the years - returns are available that were specially compiled for the  exhibition; they are the most comprehensive, covering not only \u201cfactory\u201d but also \u201chandicraft\u201d production of agricultural implements; it was estimated that in - there were, on the average,  establishments in European Russia and the Kingdom of Poland, whereas according to \u201cfactory\u201d statistical data there were in  not more than  factories in European Russia producing agricultural machinery and implements (computed from Orlov\u2019s Directory of Factories and Works for ). The enormous difference in these figures is explained by the fact that of the  establishments less than one-third () were counted as possessing steam power, and more than half () as being operated by hand labour;  establishments of the  had no foundries of their own and had their castings made outside (Historico-Statistical Survey, loc. cit.). The data for  and , on the other hand, are from Collections of Data on Factory Industry in Russia (published by Department of Commerce and Industry).[] These data do not fully cover even the \u201cfactory\u201d production of agricultural machinery and implements; for example, in , according to the Collection, there were in European Russia  works engaged in this industry, whereas Orlov\u2019s Directory mentions more than  works producing agricultural machinery and implements; in , according to the first-mentioned returns, there were in European Russia  works of this kind (Vestnik Finansov, , No. , p. ), but according to the List of Factories and Works there were in - over  factories producing agricultural machinery and implements. As for the small scale, \u201chandicraft\u201d production of agricultural machinery and implements, this is not included in these data at all.[] That is why there can be no doubt that the data for  and  greatly understate the actual facts; this is confirmed by the opinion of experts, who considered that in the beginning of the s agricultural machinery and implements were manufactured in Russia to a sum of about  million rubles (Agriculture and Forestry, ), and in  to a sum of nearly  million rubles (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ).\n\nLet us quote somewhat more detailed data on the types and quantity of agricultural machinery and implements manufactured in Russia. It is considered that in  there were produced , implements; in  \u2013 ,; in  \u2013 ,; in  \u2013 , agricultural machines and implements. How far these figures are exceeded at the present time may be seen from the following: in  about , iron ploughs were manufactured, and in  \u2013 , (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). \u201cWhereas five years ago the problem of the measures to be taken to bring about the wider use of iron ploughs on peasant farms was one awaiting solution, today it has solved itself. It is no longer a rarity for a peasant to buy an iron plough; it has become a common thing, and the number of iron ploughs now acquired by peasants every year runs into thousands.\u201d[] The mass of primitive agricultural implements employed in Russia still leaves a wide field for the production and sale of iron ploughs.[] The progress made in the use of ploughs has even raised the issue of the employment of electricity. According to a report in the Torgovo-Promyshlennaya Gazeta [Commercial and Industrial News ] (, No. ), at the Second Congress of Electrical Engineers \u201cconsiderable interest was aroused by a paper read by V. A. Rzhevsky on \u2018Electricity in Agriculture.\u2019\u201d The lecturer illustrated by means of some excellent drawings the tillage of fields in Germany with the aid of electric ploughs, and, from the plan and estimates he had drawn up at a landowner\u2019s request for his estate in one of  the southern gubernias, cited figures showing the economies to be effected by this method of tilling the land. According to this plan, it was proposed to plough  dess. annually, and a part of this twice a year. The depth of furrow was to be from  / to  vershoks.[] The soil was pure black earth. In addition to ploughs, the plan provided for machinery for other field-work, and also for a threshing machine and a mill, the latter of  h.p., calculated to operate , hours per annum. The cost of completely equipping the estate, including six versts of overhead cable of -mm. thickness, was estimated at , rubles. The cost of ploughing one dessiatine would be  rubles  kopeks if the mill were put up, and  rubles  kopeks with no mill. It was shown that at the local costs of labour, draught animals, etc., the use of electrical equipment would in the first case effect a saving of , rubles, while in the second case, less power being used without a mill, the saving would be  rubles.\n\nNo such sharp change is to be noted in the output of threshing and winnowing machines, because their production was relatively well established long ago.[] In fact, a special centre for the \u201chandicraft\u201d production of these machines was established in the town of Sapozhok, Ryazan Gubernia, and the surrounding villages, and the local members of the peasant bourgeoisie made plenty of money at this \u201cindustry\u201d (cf. Reports and Investigations, I, pp. -). A particularly rapid expansion is observed in the production of reaping machines. In , about  of these machines were produced; in  it was estimated that , to , were sold a year, and in - about ,. In , for example, the works belonging to J. Greaves in the town of Berdyansk, Taurida Gubernia, \u201cthe largest works in Europe in this line of production\u201d (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ) i.e., in the production of reaping machines, turned out , reapers. Among the peasants in Taurida Gubernia reaping machines have become so widespread that a special occupation has arisen, namely, the mechanical reaping of other people\u2019s grain.[]\n\nSimilar data are available for other, less widespread, agricultural implements. Broadcast seeders, for example, are now being turned out at dozens of works, and the more perfect row drills, which were produced at only two works in  (Agriculture and Forestry, ), are now turned out at seven works (Productive Forces, I, ), whose output has again a particularly wide sale in the south of Russia. Machinery is employed in all branches of agriculture and in all operations connected with the production of some kinds of produce: in special reviews reference is made to the extended use of winnowing machines, seed-sorters, seed-cleaners (trieurs), seed-driers, hay presses, flax-scutchers, etc. In the Addendum to the Report on Agriculture for , published by the Pskov Gubernia Zemstvo Administration (Severny Kurier [Northern Courier ], , No. ), the in creasing use of machinery is noted, particularly of flax scutchers, in connection with the transition from flax production for home use to that for commercial purposes. There is an increase in the number of iron ploughs. Reference is made to the influence of migration in augmenting the number of agricultural machines and in raising wages. In Stavropol Gubernia (ibid., No. ), agricultural machinery is being employed on an increasing scale in connection with the growing immigration into this gubernia. In , there were  machines: in -, an average of ,; in -, an average of ,; and in , as many as , agricultural implements and machines.\n\nThe growing employment of machines naturally gives rise to a demand for engines: along with steam-engines, \u201coil engines have latterly begun to spread rapidly on our farms\u201d (Productive Forces, I, ), and although the first engine of this type appeared abroad only seven years ago, there are already  factories in Russia manufacturing them. In Kherson Gubernia in the s only  steam-engines were registered in agriculture (Material for the Statistics of Steam-Engines in the Russian Empire, St. Petersburg, ), and in  about  (Historico-Statistical Survey, Vol. II, section on agricultural implements). In -, in three uyezds of the gubernia (out of six),  steam threshing machines were registered. \u201cAt the present time () there must be at least twice as many\u201d (Tezyakov, Agricultural Workers and the Organisation of Sanitary Supervision over Them, in Kherson Gubernia, Kherson, , p. ). The Vestnik Finansov (, No. ) states that in Kherson Gubernia, \u201cthere are about , steam-threshers, and in the Kuban Region the number is about the same, etc. . . . Latterly the acquisition of steam-threshers has assumed an industrial character. . . . There have been cases of a five thousand-ruble threshing machine with steam-engine fully covering its cost in two or three good harvest years, and of the owner immediately getting another on the same terms. Thus,  and even  such machines are often to be met with on small farms in the Kuban Region. There they have become an essential accessory of every farm that is at all well organised.\u201d \u201cGenerally speaking, in the south of Russia today, more than ten thousand steam-engines are in use for agricultural purposes\u201d (Productive Forces, IX, ).[]\n\nIf we remember that the number of steam-engines in use in agriculture throughout European Russia in   was only , and that in , according to incomplete returns (Collection of Factory Inspectors\u2019 Reports for  ), the number was ,, in  \u2013 ,, in  \u2013 , and in  \u2013 ,, the gigantic revolution brought about by capitalism in agriculture in this country during the last two or three decades will be clear to us. Great service in accelerating this process has been rendered by the Zemstvos. By the beginning of , Zemstvo agricultural machinery and implement depots \u201cexisted under the auspices of  gubernia and  uyezd Zemstvo boards, with a total working capital of about a million rubles\u201d (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). In Poltava Gubernia, the turnover of the Zemstvo depots increased from , rubles in  to , rubles in  and , rubles in . In the six years, , iron ploughs,  winnowing machines and seed-sorters,  reaping machines, and  horse-threshers were sold. \u201cThe principal buyers of implements at the Zemstvo depots are Cossacks and peasants; they account for % of the total number of iron ploughs and horse-threshers sold. The purchasers of seeding and reaping machines were mainly landowners, and large ones at that, possessing over  dessiatines\u201d (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ).\n\nAccording to the report of the Ekaterinoslav Gubernia Zemstvo Board for , \u201cthe use of improved agricultural implements in the gubernia is spreading very rapidly.\u201d For example, in the Verkhne-Dnieper Uyezd there were:\n\nNumbers of improved agricultural implements.\nAccording to the data of the Moscow Gubernia Zemstvo Board, peasants in Moscow Gubernia in  owned , iron ploughs; .% of all householders owned such ploughs (Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). In Tver Gubernia, according to a special record made in , there were , iron ploughs, owned by .% of the total number of householders. In Tver Uyezd there were only  iron ploughs in , and , in  (Statistical Returns for Tver Gubernia, Vol. XIII, Pt. , pp. , ). One can judge, therefore, how rapid is the consolidation and improvement of the farms of the peasant bourgeoisie.\n\nNotes\n[] See Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry, Vol. I, St. Petersburg,  (published for  exhibition), article by V. Chernyayev: \u201cAgricultural Machinery Production.\u201d \u2013 Ditto, Vol. II, St. Petersburg, , in group IX. \u2013 Agriculture and Forestry in Russia (St. Petersburg, , published for Chicago Exhibition), article by V.

Only the last mentioned article puts the question on a political-economic basis; all the previous ones were written by agricultural experts.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] To make possible a judgment of the way the situation has changed in recent years, we quote data from the Yearbook of Russia (published by Central Statistical Committee, St. Petersburg, ), for -. The value of the output of agricultural machinery in the Empire is estimated at ,, rubles, and of imports in  at ,, rubles, and in  at ,, rubles. (Note to nd edition.)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In the Vestnik Finansov, No. , for , comparative data are given for -, but their source is not given specifically.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The total number of workshops engaged in the manufacture and repair of agricultural implements was given. for  as ; for  as ; for  as ; for  as ; for  as ; for  as ; and for  as approximately  (Agriculture and Forestry in Russia, p. , and Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). The Collections, on the other hand, estimated that in - there were only from  to  factories of this kind (average of  for the  years). Here is an example illustrating the ratio of \u201cfactory\u201d production of agricultural machinery to \u201chandicraft\u201d production: it was estimated that in Perm Gubernia in  there were only  \u201cfactories,\u201d with a combined output of , rubles, whereas for this branch of industry the - census showed  \u201chandicraft establishments,\u201d with a combined output of , rubles, and what is more, the number of \u201chandicraft\u201d establishments included such as employed  wage-workers and had an output of over , rubles. (A Sketch of the Condition of Handicraft Industry in Perm Gubernia, Perm, .)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Reports and Investigations of Handicraft Industry in Russia. Published by Ministry of State Properties, Vol. I, St. Petersburg, , p. . The production of ploughs by peasants is simultaneously declining, being forced out by factory production.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Agriculture and Forestry in Russia, p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] . to . inches. \u2013Ed.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In  about , threshing machines were produced, and in - about ,. The latter figure, however, does not include output by handicraft industry.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In , for example, \u201c peasants gathered with their machines on the Uspensky estate belonging to Falz-Fein (who owned , dessiatines) and offered their services, but half of them went away empty-handed, as only  were engaged\u201d (Shakhovskoi, Agricultural Outside Employments, Moscow, , p. ). In the other steppe gubernias, however, especially the Transvolga gubernias, reaping machines are not widely used as yet. Still, in recent years these gubernias too have been trying very hard to overtake Novorossia. Thus, the Syzran-Vyazma railway carried agricultural machinery, traction-engines and parts weighing , poods in , , poods in , , poods in , , poods in , and , poods in ; in other words, in a matter of five years the quantities carried almost trebled. Ukholovo railway station dispatched agricultural machinery of local manufacture to the extent of about , poods in , and about , poods in , whereas up to and including  the weight of agricultural machinery dispatched from that station was even less than , poods per annum. \u201cUkholovo station dispatches mainly threshing machines produced in the villages of Kanino and Smykovo, and partly in the uyezd town of Sapozhok, Ryazan Gubernia. In the village of Kanino there are three foundries, belonging to Yermakov, Karev and Golikov, mainly engaged on agricultural-machinery parts. The work of finishing and assembling the machines is done in the above-mentioned two villages (Kanino and Smykovo), of which almost the entire populations are thus employed\u201d (Brief Review of the Commercial Activity of the Syzran-Vyazma Railway in , Pt. IV, Kaluga, , pp. -). Interesting in this example are, first, the fact of the enormous increase in production precisely in recent years, which have been years of low grain prices; and, second, the fact of the connection between \u201cfactory\u201d and so called \u201chandicraft\u201d production. The latter is nothing more nor less than an \u201cannex\u201d to the factory,\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. an item from Perekop Uyezd, Taurida Gubernia, in Russkiye Vedomosti [Russian Gazette ] of August ,  (No. ). \u201cOwing to the widespread use of reaping machines and steam- and horse-threshing machines among our farmers . . . field-work is proceeding very rapidly. The old-fashioned method of the threshing with \u2018rollers\u2019 is a thing of the past. . . . Every year the Crimean farmer increases his crop area and therefore has willy-nilly to resort to the aid of improved agricultural implements and machines. While it is not possible with rollers to thresh more than  to  poods of grain per day, a -h.p. steam-thresher will do from , to , poods, and a horse-thresher from  to  poods. That is why the demand for agricultural implements, reapers and threshers is growing so rapidly from year to year that the factories and works producing agricultural implements exhaust their stocks, as has happened this year, and are unable to satisfy the farmers\u2019 demand.\u201d The drop in grain prices, which compels farmers to reduce production costs, must be regarded as one of the most important causes of the increased use of improved implements.\u2014Lenin\n\nVIII. The Significance of Machinery in Agriculture\nHaving established the fact of the extremely rapid development of the production of agricultural machinery and of the employment of machines in Russia\u2019s post-Reform agriculture, we must now examine the social and economic significance of this phenomenon. From what has been said above regarding the economics of peasant and landlord farming, the following conclusions may be drawn: on the one hand, capitalism is the factor giving rise to, and extending the use of, machines in agriculture; on the other, the application of machinery to agriculture is of a capitalist character, i.e., it leads to the establishment of capitalist relations and their further development.\n\nLet us dwell on the first of these conclusions. We have seen that the labour-service system of economy and the patriarchal peasant economy inseparably connected with it are by their very nature based on routine technique, on the preservation of antiquated methods of production. There is nothing in the internal structure of that economic regime to stimulate the transformation of technique; on the contrary, the secluded and isolated character of that system of economy, and the poverty and downtrodden condition of the dependent peasant preclude the possibility of improvements. In particular, we would point to the fact that the payment of labour under the labour-service system is much lower (as we have seen) than where hired labour is employed; and it is well known that low wages are one of the most important obstacles to the introduction of machines. And the facts do indeed show us that an extensive movement for the transformation of agricultural technique only commenced in the post-Reform period of the development of commodity economy and capitalism. The competition that is the product of capitalism, and the dependence of the cultivator on the world market made the transformation of technique a necessity, while the drop in grain prices made this necessity particularly urgent.[]\n\nTo explain the second conclusion, we must examine landlord and peasant farming separately. When a landlord introduces a machine or an improved implement, he replaces the implements of the peasant (who has worked for him) with his own; he goes over, consequently, from labour-service to the capitalist system of farming. The spread of agricultural machines means the elimination of labour-service by capitalism. It is possible, of course, that a condition laid down, for example, for the leasing of land is the performance of labour-service in the shape of day-work at a reaping machine, thresher, etc., but this will be labour-service of the second type, labour-service which converts the peasant into a day labourer. Such \u201cexceptions,\u201d consequently, merely go to prove the general rule that the introduction of improved implements on the farms of private landowners means converting the bonded (\u201cindependent\u201d according to Narodnik terminology) peasant into a wage-worker \u2013 in exactly the same way as the acquisition of his own instruments of production by the buyer-up, who gives out work to be done in the home, means converting the bonded \u201chandicraftsman\u201d into a wage-worker. The acquisition by the landlord farm of its own implements leads inevitably to the undermining of the middle peasantry, who get means of subsistence by engaging in labour-service: We have already seen that labour-service is the specific \u201cindustry\u201d of the middle peasant, whose implements, consequently, are a component part not only of peasant, but also of landlord, farming.[] Hence, the spread of agricultural machinery and improved implements and the expropriation of the peasantry are inseparably connected. That the spread of improved implements among the peasantry is of the same significance hardly requires explanation after what has been said in the preceding chapter. The systematic employment of machinery in agriculture ousts the patriarchal \u201cmiddle\u201d peasant as inexorably as the steam-power loom ousts the handicraft weaver.\n\nThe results of the employment of machinery in agriculture confirm what has been said, and reveal all the typical features of capitalist progress with all its inherent contradictions. Machines enormously increase the productivity of labour in agriculture, which, before the present epoch, was almost entirely untouched by social development. That is why the mere fact of the growing employment of machines in Russian agriculture is sufficient to enable one to see how utterly unsound is Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s assertion that there is \u201cabsolute stagnation\u201d (Sketches, p. ) in grain production in Russia, and that there is even a \u201cdecline in the productivity\u201d of agricultural labour. We shall return to this assertion, which contradicts generally established facts and which Mr. N.\u2013on needed for his idealisation of the pre-capitalist order.\n\nFurther, machines lead to the concentration of production and to the practice of capitalist co-operation in agriculture. The introduction of machinery, on the one hand, calls for capital on a big scale, and consequently is only within the capacity of the big farmers; on the other hand, machines pay only when there is a huge amount of products to be dealt with; the expansion of production becomes a necessity with the introduction of machines. The wide use of reaping machines, steam-threshers, etc., is therefore indicative of the concentration of agricultural production \u2013 and we shall indeed see later that the Russian agricultural region where the employment of machines is particularly widespread (Novorossia) is also distinguished by the quite considerable size of its farms. Let us merely observe that it would be a mistake to conceive the concentration of agriculture in just the one form of extensive enlargement of the crop area (as Mr. N.\u2013on does); as a matter of fact, the concentration of agricultural production manifests itself in the most diverse forms, depending on the forms of commercial agriculture (see next chapter on this point). The concentration of production is inseparably connected with the extensive co-operation of workers on the farm. Above we saw an example of a large estate on which the grain was harvested by setting hundreds of reaping machines into operation simultaneously. \u201cThreshers drawn by  to  horses require from  to  and even more workers, half of whom are women and boys, i.e., semi-workers. . . . The  to  h. p. steam-threshers to be found on all large farms\u201d (of Kherson Gubernia), \u201crequire simultaneously from  to  workers, of whom more than half are semi-workers, boys and girls of  to  years of age\u201d (Tezyakov, loc. cit., ). \u201cLarge farms, on each of which from  to , workers are gathered together simultaneously, may safely be likened to industrial establishments,\u201d the same author justly observes (p. ).[] Thus, while our Narodniks were arguing that the \u201cvillage community\u201d \u201ccould easily\u201d introduce co-operation in agriculture, life went on in its own way, and capitalism, splitting up the village community into economic groups with opposite interests, created large farms based on the extensive co-operation of wage-workers.\n\nFrom the foregoing it is clear that machines create a home market for capitalism: first, a market for means of production (for the products of the machine-building industry, mining industry, etc., etc.), and second, a market for labour-power. The introduction of machines, as we have seen, leads to the replacement of labour-service by hired labour and to the creation of peasant farms employing labourers. The mass-scale employment of agricultural machinery presupposes the existence of a mass of agricultural wage-workers. In the localities where agricultural capitalism is most highly developed, this process of the introduction of wage-labour along with the introduction of machines is intersected by another process, namely, the ousting of wage-workers by the machine. On the one hand, the formation of a peasant bourgeoisie and the transition of the landowners from labour-service to capitalism create a demand for wage-workers; on the other hand, in places where farming has long been based on wage-labour, machines oust wage-workers. No precise and extensive statistics are available to show what is the general effect of both these processes for the whole of Russia, i.e., whether the number of agricultural wage-workers is increasing or decreasing. There can be no doubt that hitherto the number has been increasing (see >next section). We imagine that now too it is continuing to increase[]: firstly, data on the ousting of wage-workers in agriculture by machines are available only for Novorossia, while in other areas of capitalist agriculture (the Baltic and western region, the outer regions in the East, some of the industrial gubernias) this process has not yet been noted on a large scale. There still remains an enormous area where labour-service predominates, and in that area the introduction of machinery is giving rise to a demand for wage-workers. Secondly, the growth of intensive farming (introduction of root crops, for example) enormously increases the demand for wage-labour (see Chapter IV) . A decline in the absolute number of agricultural (as against industrial) wage-workers must, of course, take place at a certain stage in the development of capitalism, namely, when agriculture through out the country is fully organised on capitalist lines and when the employment of machinery for the most diverse agricultural operations is general.\n\nAs regards Novorossia, local investigators note here the usual consequences of highly developed capitalism. Machines are ousting wage-workers and creating a capitalist reserve army in agriculture. \u201cThe days of fabulous prices for hands have passed in Kherson Gubernia too. Thanks to . . . the increased spread of agricultural implements . . .\u201d (and other causes) \u201cthe prices of hands are steadily falling \u201d (author\u2019s italics). . . . \u201cThe distribution of agricultural implements, which makes the large farms independent of workers[] and at the same time reduces the demand for hands, places the workers in a difficult position\u201d (Tezyakov, loc. cit., -). The same thing is noted by another Zemstvo Medical Officer, Mr. Kudryavtsev, in his work Migrant Agricultural Workers at the Nikolayev Fair in the Township of Kakhovka, Taurida Gubernia, and Their Sanitary Supervision in  (Kherson, ). \u201cThe prices of hands . . . continue to fall, and a considerable number of migrant workers find themselves without employment and are unable to earn anything; i.e., there is created what in the language of economic science is called a reserve army of labour \u2013 artificial surplus-population\u201d (). The drop in the prices of labour caused by this reserve army is sometimes so great that \u201cmany farmers possessing machines preferred\u201d (in ) \u201cto harvest with hand labour rather than with machines\u201d (ibid., , from Sbornik Khersonskogo Zemstva [Kherson Zemstvo Symposium ], August )! More strikingly and convincingly than any argument this fact reveals how profound are the contradictions inherent in the capitalist employment of machinery!\n\nAnother consequence of the use of machinery is the growing employment of female and child labour. The existing system of capitalist agriculture has, generally speaking, given rise to a certain hierarchy of workers, very much reminiscent of the hierarchy among factory workers. For example, on the estates in South Russia there are the following categories: a) full workers, adult males capable of doing all jobs b) semi-workers, women and males up to the age of ; semi-workers are divided again into two categories: aa) ,  to ,  years of age \u2013 these are semi-workers in the stricter sense of the term \u2013 and bb) semi-workers of great strength ; \u201cin the language used on the estates, \u2018three-quarter\u2019 workers,\u201d[] from  to  years of age, capable of doing all the jobs done by the full worker, except mowing. Lastly, c) semi-workers rendering little help, children not under  and not over  years of age; these act as swine-herds, calf-herds, weeders and plough-boys. Often they work merely for their food and clothing. The introduction of agricultural implements \u201clowers the price of the full worker\u2019s labour\u201d and renders possible its replacement by the cheaper labour of women and juveniles. Statistics on migrant labour confirm the fact of the displacement of male by female labour: in , of the total number of workers registered in the township of Kakhovka and in the city of Kherson, .% were women; in , for the whole gubernia women constituted .% (, out of ,); in , .% (, out of ,). Children in  constituted .% (from  to  years of age), and in , .% (from  to  years of age). Among local workers on estates in Elisavetgrad Uyezd, Kherson Gubernia, children constituted .% (ibid.).\n\nMachines increase the intensity of the workers\u2019 labour. For example, the most widespread type of reaping machine (with hand delivery) has acquired the characteristic name of \u201clobogreyka\u201d or \u201cchubogreyka,\u201d[] since working with it calls for extraordinary exertion on the part of the worker: he takes the place of the delivery apparatus (cf. Productive Forces, I, ). Similarly, intensity of labour increases with the use of the threshing machine. The capitalist mode of employing machinery creates here (as everywhere) a powerful stimulus to the lengthening of the working day. Night work, something previously unknown, makes its appearance in agriculture too. \u201cIn good harvest years . . . work on some estates and on many peasant farms is carried on even at night\u201d (Tezyakov, loc. cit., ), by artificial illumination \u2013 torchlight (). Finally, the systematic employment of machines results in traumatism among agricultural workers; the employment of young women and children at machines naturally results in a particularly large toll of injuries. The Zemstvo hospitals and dispensaries in Kherson Gubernia, for example, are filled, during the agricultural season, \u201calmost exclusively with traumatic patients\u201d and serve as \u201cfield hospitals, as it were, for the treatment of the enormous army of agricultural workers who are constantly being disabled as a result of the ruthless destructive work of agricultural machines and implements\u201d (ibid., ). A special medical literature is appearing that deals with injuries caused by agricultural machines. Proposals are being made to introduce compulsory regulations governing the use of agricultural machines (ibid.). The large-scale manufacture of machinery imperatively calls for public control and regulation of production in agriculture, as in industry. Of the attempts to introduce such control we shall speak below.\n\nLet us note, in conclusion, the extremely inconsistent attitude of the Narodniks towards the employment of machinery in agriculture. To admit the benefit and progressive nature of the employment of machinery, to defend all measures that develop and facilitate it, and at the same time to ignore the fact that machinery in Russian agriculture is employed in the capitalist manner, means to sink to the view point of the small and big agrarians. Yet what our Narodniks do is precisely to ignore the capitalist character of the employment of agricultural machinery and improved implements, without even attempting to analyse what types of peasant and landlord farms introduce machinery. Mr. V. V. angrily calls Mr. V. Chernyayev \u201ca representative of capitalist technique\u201d (Progressive Trends, ). Presumably it is Mr. V. Chernyayev, or some other official in the Ministry of Agriculture, who is to blame for the fact that the employment of machinery in Russia is capitalist in character! Mr. N.\u2013on, despite his grandiloquent promise \u201cnot to depart from the facts\u201d (Sketches, XIV), has preferred to ignore the fact that it is capitalism that has developed the employment of machinery in our agriculture, and he has even invented the amusing theory that exchange reduces the productivity of labour in agriculture (p. )! To criticise this theory, which is proclaimed without any analysis of the facts, is neither possible nor necessary. Let us confine ourselves to citing a small sample of Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s reasoning. \u201cIf,\u201d says he, \u201cthe productivity of labour in this country were to double, we should have to pay for a chetvert (about six bushels) of wheat not  rubles, but six, that is all\u201d (). Not all, by far, most worthy economist. \u201cIn this country\u201d (as indeed in any society where there is commodity economy), the improvement of technique is undertaken by individual farmers, the rest only gradually following suit. \u201cIn this country,\u201d only the rural entrepreneurs are in a position to improve their technique. \u201cIn this country,\u201d this progress of the rural entrepreneurs, small and big, is inseparably connected with the ruin of the peasantry and the creation of a rural proletariat. Hence, if the improved technique used on the farms of rural entrepreneurs were to become socially necessary (only on that condition would the price be reduced by half), it would mean the passing of almost the whole of agriculture into the hands of capitalists, it would mean the complete proletarisation of millions of peasants, it would mean an enormous increase in the non-agricultural population and an increase in the number of factories (for the productivity of labour in our agriculture to double, there must be an enormous development of the machine-building industry, the mining industry, steam transport, the construction of a mass of new types of farm buildings, shops, warehouses, canals, etc., etc.). Mr. N.\u2013on here repeats the little error of reasoning that is customary with him: he skips over the consecutive steps that are necessary with the development of capitalism, he skips over the intricate complex of social-economic changes which necessarily accompany the development of capitalism, and then weeps and wails over the danger of \u201cdestruction\u201d by capitalism.\n\nNotes\n[] \u201cIn the past two years, under the influence of low grain prices and of the need to cheapen agricultural jobs at all costs, reaping machines have also . . . begun to be so widely employed that depots are unable to meet all requirements on time\u201d (Tezyakov, loc cit., p. ) The present agricultural crisis is a capitalist crisis. Like all capitalist crises, it ruins capitalist farmers and peasants in one locality, in one country, in one branch of agriculture, and at the same time gives a tremendous impulse to the development of capitalism in another locality, in another country, in other branches of agriculture. It is the failure to understand this fundamental feature of the present crisis and of its economic nature that constitutes the main error in the reasoning on this theme of Messrs. N.\u2013on, Kablukov, etc., etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr V. V. expresses this truth (that the existence of the middle peasant is largely conditioned by the existence of the labour-service system of farming among the landlords) in the following original way: \u201cthe owner shares, so to speak, the cost of maintaining his (the peasant\u2019s) implements.\u201d \u201cIt appears,\u201d says Mr. Sanin, in a just comment on this, \u201cthat it is not the labourer who works for the landowner, but the landowner who works for the labourer.\u201d A. Sanin, Some Remarks on the Theory of People\u2019s Production, in the appendix to the Russian translation of Hourwich\u2019s Economics of the Russian Village, Moscow, , p. .\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. also next chapter, \u00a7 I , where more detailed data are given on the size of capitalist farms in this part of Russia.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] It hardly needs to be explained that in a country with a mass of peasantry, an absolute increase in the number of agricultural wage-workers is quite compatible not only with a relative, but also with an absolute, decrease of the rural population.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. Ponomaryov expresses himself on this score thus. \u201cMachines, by regulating the harvesting price, in all probability discipline the workers at the same time\u201d (article in Selskoye Khozyaistvo i Lesowdstvo [Agriculture and Forestry ], quoted in Vestnik Finansov, , No. ). It will be remembered that the \u201cPindar of the capitalist factory,\u201d[] Dr. Andrew Ure, welcomed machines as creating \u201corder\u201d and \u201cdiscipline\u201d among the workers. Agricultural capitalism in Russia has already managed to create not only \u201cagricultural factories,\u201d but also the \u201cPindars\u201d of these factories.\u2014Lenin\n\nIX. Wage-Labour in Agriculture\nWe now pass to the principal manifestation of agricultural capitalism \u2013 to the employment of hired labour. This feature of post-Reform economy was marked most strongly in the outer regions of south and east European Russia, in that mass shift of agricultural wage-workers known as the \u201cagricultural migration.\u201d For this reason we shall first cite data concerning this main region of agricultural capitalism in Russia and then examine the data relating to the whole of Russia.\n\nThe tremendous movements of our peasants in search of work for hire have long ago been noted in our literature. Reference to them was made by Flerovsky (Condition of the Working Class in Russia, St. Petersburg, ), who tried to determine their relative incidence in the various gubernias. In , Mr. Chaslavsky gave a general review of \u201cagricultural outside employments\u201d (Compendium of Political Knowledge, Vol. II) and noted their real significance (\u201cthere was formed . . . something in the nature of a semi-vagrant population . . . something in the nature of future farm labourers\u201d). In , Mr. Raspopin gathered together Zemstvo statistics on this phenomenon and regarded them not as \u201cemployments\u201d of the peasants in general, but as a process of the formation of a class of wage-workers in agriculture. In the s, the works of Messrs. S. Korolenko, Rudnev, Tezyakov, Kudryavtsev and Shakhovskoi appeared, thanks to which a much fuller study of this phenomenon was made.\n\nThe principal area to which agricultural wage-workers migrate embraces Bessarabia, Kherson, Taurida, Ekaterinoslav, Don, Samara, Saratov (southern part) and Orenburg gubernias. We confine ourselves to European Russia, but it must be observed that the movement spreads, ever further afield (especially in the recent period), and covers the North Caucasus and the Ural region, etc. Data concerning capitalist agriculture in this area (the area of commercial grain farming) will be given in the next chapter; there, too, we shall point to other localities to which agricultural labourers migrate. The principal area from which agricultural labourers migrate is the central black-earth gubernias: Kazan, Simbirsk, Penza, Tambov, Ryazan, Tula, Orel, Kursk, Voronezh, Kharkov, Poltava, Chernigov, Kiev, Podolia and Volhynia.[] Thus the movement of workers proceeds from the most thickly-populated to the most thinly populated localities, the ones being colonised; from the localities where serfdom was most developed to those where it was least developed[]; from localities where labour-service is most developed to localities where it is little developed and capitalism is highly developed. Hence, the workers flee from \u201csemi-free\u201d to free labour. It would be a mistake to think that this flight amounts exclusively to a movement from thickly-populated to thinly-populated areas. A study of the movement of workers (Mr. S. Korolenko, loc. cit.) has revealed the singular and important fact that workers migrate from many areas in such great numbers as to create a shortage of hands in these places, one that is compensated by the arrival of workers from other places. Hence, the departure of workers expresses not only the tendency of the population to spread more evenly over the given territory, but also the tendency of the workers to go to areas where conditions are better. This tendency will become quite clear to us if we recall that in the area of departure, the area of labour-service, agricultural workers\u2019 wages are particularly low, while in the area of attraction, the area of capitalism, wages are far higher.[]\n\nAs to the extent of \u201cagricultural migration,\u201d general data exist only in the above-mentioned book by Mr. S Korolenko, who calculates the surplus of workers (relative to the local demand for them) at ,, for the whole of European Russia, including ,, in the above-enumerated  gubernias of agricultural emigration, whereas in the  gubernias of immigration the shortage of workers is estimated at ,, persons. Despite the fact that Mr. S. Korolenko\u2019s methods of calculation are by no means always satisfactory, his general conclusions (as we shall see repeatedly below) must be regarded as approximately correct, and the number of migratory workers not only not an exaggeration, but if anything an understatement of the facts. There can be no doubt that part of these two million workers who come to the South are non-agricultural workers. But Mr. Shakhovskoi (loc. cit.) estimates quite arbitrarily, approximately, that industrial workers account for half this number. Firstly, we know from all sources that the workers who migrate to this region are mainly agricultural, and secondly, agricultural workers come there not only from the gubernias mentioned above. Mr. Shakhovskoi himself quotes a figure which confirms Mr. S. Korolenko\u2019s calculations. He states that in  black-earth gubernias (which are included in the above-described area from which agricultural workers emigrate) there were issued in  a total of ,, passports and identity cards (loc. cit., p. ), whereas according to Mr. S. Korolenko\u2019s calculations the number of workers who left these gubernias was only ,,. Consequently, Mr. S. Korolenko\u2019s figures are not in the least exaggerated, and the total number of migratory rural workers in Russia must obviously be over  million.[] The existence of such a mass of \u201cpeasants\u201d who abandon their homes and allotments (where they have homes and allotments) vividly testifies to the tremendous process of the conversion of small cultivators into rural proletarians, of the enormous demand by growing agricultural capitalism for wage-labour.\n\nThe question now arises, what is the total number of rural wage-workers in European Russia, both migratory and resident? The only attempt to answer this question that we know is the one made in Mr. Rudnev\u2019s work Peasant Industries in European Russia (Sbornik Saratovskogo Zemstva [Symposium of the Saratov Zemstvo ], , Nos.  and ). This work, an extremely valuable one, gives a summary of the Zemstvo statistics for  uyezds in  gubernias of European Russia. The total number of \u201cindustrialists\u201d is put at ,,, out of ,, working males ( to  years of age), i.e., % of the total number of working peasants.[] Under \u201cagricultural industries\u201d the author includes only work as hired agricultural labourers (farm labourers, day labourers, herdsmen, stockyard workers). An estimate of the percentage of agricultural workers to the total number of males of working age in various gubernias and districts of Russia, leads the author to the conclusion that in the black-earth belt about % of all working males are engaged in hired agricultural labour, and in the non-black-earth area about %. This gives us the number of agricultural workers in European Russia as ,,, or, in round numbers,  / million (Rudnev, loc. cit., p. . This number is about % of the total number of males of working age). It must be observed in this connection that, according to Mr. Rudnev, \u201cday labour and agricultural job-work were placed in the category of industries by the statisticians only when they were the chief occupation of the given person or family\u201d (loc. cit., ).[]\n\nMr. Rudnev\u2019s figure should be regarded as the minimum, because, firstly, the Zemstvo census returns are more or less out-of-date, relating to the s and at times even to the s, and because, secondly, in determining the percentage of agricultural workers, no account whatever was taken of the Baltic and Western gubernias, where agricultural capitalism is highly developed. For want of other data, however, we are obliged to take this figure of  / million.\n\nIt appears, consequently, that about one-fifth of the peasants have already reached a position where their \u201cchief occupation\u201d is that of wage-labour for rich peasants and landlords. We see here the first group of the entrepreneurs who present a demand for the labour-power of the rural proletariat. These are the rural entrepreneurs, who employ about half of the bottom group of the peasantry. Thus, there is to be observed a complete interdependence between the formation of a class of rural entrepreneurs and the expansion of the bottom group of the \u201cpeasantry,\u201d i.e., the increase in the number of rural proletarians. Among these rural entrepreneurs a prominent part is played by the peasant bourgeoisie: for example, in  uyezds of Voronezh Gubernia, .% of the farm labourers are employed by peasants (Rudnev, ). Were we to take this percentage as the standard for all rural workers and for the whole of Russia, it would be seen that the peasant bourgeoisie present a demand for some one and a half million agricultural workers. One and the same \u201cpeasantry\u201d throws on to the market millions of workers in search of employers \u2013 and presents an impressive demand for wage-workers.\n\nNotes\n[] In Chapter VIII , where we examine the movement of wage-workers in Russia as an entire process, we shall describe in greater detail the character and direction of migration from the various localities.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] In his day Chaslavsky pointed out that in the localities in which workers arrived, serfs constituted from  to % of the total, and in the localities which workers left, from  to %.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See table of data for  years in Chapter VIII, \u00a7 V: the formation of a home market for labour-power.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] There is another way of checking Mr. S. Korolenko\u2019s figure. We learn from the above-quoted books of Messrs. Tezyakov and Kudryavtsev that the number of agricultural workers who in their search for \u201cemployments\u201d use the railways at least in part, is about / of the total workers (combining the figures of both authors, we get the result that out of , workers interrogated, only , traveled at least part of the journey by rail). Yet the number of workers carried in  by the three principal railways in the direction examined does not exceed , (, to ,) \u2013 as we are told by Mr. Shakhovskoi (loc. cit., p. , according to railway returns). Consequently, the total number of workers leaving for the South must be about  million. Incidentally, the very small proportion of agricultural workers who travel by rail points to the incorrectness of Mr. N.\u2013on\u2019s view when he assumed that the passenger traffic on our railways is in the main that of agricultural workers. Mr. N.\u2013on lost sight of the fact that non-agricultural workers receive higher wages and therefore make greater use of the railways and that the migration season of these workers (for example, builders, navvies, stevedores and many others) is also spring and summer.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] By \u201cindustries,\u201d as Mr. Rudnev also points out, are meant all sorts of occupations by peasants except cultivation on their own, purchased or rented land. Undoubtedly, the majority of these \u201cindustrialists\u201d are wage-workers in agriculture or in industry. We therefore call the reader\u2019s attention to the closeness of these figures to our estimate of the number of rural proletarians: in Chapter II, it was assumed that the latter constitute about % of the peasants. Here we see that \u201cindustrialists\u201d constitute %, and of these, in all probability, over % are engaged in all sorts of hired labour.\u2014Lenin\n\nThis figure does not include, therefore, the mass of peasants for whom hired agricultural labor is not the chief occupation, but one of equal importance with their own farms.\u2014Lenin\n\nX. The Significance of Hired Labour in Agriculture\nLet us now attempt to depict the principal features of the new social relations that take shape in agriculture with the employment of hired labour, and to define their significance.\n\nThe agricultural workers who come to the South in such masses belong to the poorest strata of the peasantry. Of the workers who come to Kherson Gubernia, / make the journey on foot, since they lack the money for railway fare; \u201cthey tramp for hundreds and thousands of versts along the railway track and the banks of navigable rivers, admiring the splendid pictures of rapidly-moving trains and smoothly-gliding ships\u201d (Tezyakov, ). On the average, the worker takes with him about  rubles[]; often enough he even lacks the money to pay for a passport, and gets a monthly identity card for ten kopeks. The journey takes from  to  days, and after such a long tramp (sometimes undertaken barefoot in the cold spring mud), the traveler\u2019s feet swell and become calloused and bruised. About / of the workers travel on dubi (large boats made out of rough boards, holding from  to  persons and usually packed to the limit). The reports of an official commission (the Zvegintsev Commission)[] note the grave danger of this form of travel: \u201cnot a year passes but that one, two or even more of these overcrowded dubi go to the bottom with their passengers\u201d (ibid., ). The overwhelming majority of the workers have allotments, but of absolutely insignificant dimensions. \u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d Mr. Tezyakov quite justly observes, \u201call these thousands of agricultural workers are landless village proletarians, for whom outside employments are now the sole means of livelihood. . . . Landlessness is growing rapidly, and at the same time is swelling the ranks of the rural proletariat\u201d (). Striking confirmation of the rapidity of this growth is the number of worker novices, i.e., of those seeking employment for the first time. These novices constitute as many as %. Incidentally, this figure enables us to judge how rapid is the process that creates bodies of permanent agricultural workers.\n\nThe mass migration of workers has given rise to special forms of hire peculiar to highly-developed capitalism. In the South and South-East, numerous labour markets have arisen where thousands of workers gather and employers assemble. These markets are usually held in towns, industrial centres, trading villages and at fairs. The industrial character of the centres is of particular attraction to the workers, who readily accept employment on non-agricultural jobs, too. Thus, in Kiev Gubernia, labour markets are held in Shpola and Smela (large centres of the beet-sugar industry), and in the town of Belaya Tserkov. In Kherson Gubernia, they are held in the commercial villages (Novoukrainka, Birzula and Mostovoye, where on Sundays over , workers gather, and many other villages), at railway stations (Znamenka, Dolinskaya, etc.), and in towns (Elisavetgrad, Bobrinets, Voznesensk, Odessa, and others). In the summer, townspeople, labourers and \u201ccadets\u201d (the local name for tramps) from Odessa also come to hire themselves out for agricultural work. In Odessa rural workers hire themselves out in what is called Seredinskaya Square (or the \u201cMowers\u2019 Market\u201d). \u201cThe workers make for Odessa, avoiding other markets, in the hope of getting better earnings here\u201d (Tezyakov, ). The township of Krivoi Rog is an important centre where workers are hired for agriculture and mining. In Taurida Gubernia, the township of Kakhovka is particularly noted for its labour market, where formerly as many as , workers gathered; in the nineties from , to , gathered there, and now, judging from certain data, the number is still smaller. In Bessarabia Gubernia, mention should be made of the town of Akkerman; in Ekaterinoslav Gubernia, of the town of Ekaterinoslav, and Lozovaya Station; in Don Gubernia, of Rostov-on-Don, frequented every year by as many as , workers. In North Caucasus, of the towns of Ekaterinodar and Novorossiisk, Tikhoretskaya Station, and other places. In Samara Gubernia, of the village of Pokrovskaya (opposite Saratov), the village of Balakovo and other places. In Saratov Gubernia, of the towns of Khvalynsk and Volsk. In Simbirsk Gubernia, of the town of Syzran. Thus, capitalism has created in the outer regions a new form of the \u201ccombination of agriculture with industries,\u201d namely, the combination of agricultural and non-agricultural hired labour. Such a combination is possible on a wide scale only in the period of the final and highest stage of capitalism, that of large-scale machine industry, which attenuates the importance of skill of \u201chand labour,\u201d facilitates the transition from one occupation to another, and levels the forms of hire.[]\n\nIndeed, the forms of hire in this locality are very peculiar and very characteristic of capitalist agriculture. All the semi-patriarchal, semi-bonded forms of hired labour which one so frequently meets in the central black-earth belt disappear here. The only relationships left are those between hirers and hired, a commercial transaction for the purchase and sale of labour-power. As always under developed capitalist relations, the workers prefer hire by the day, or by the week, which enables them to make the pay correspond more exactly to the demand for labour. \u201cPrices are fixed for the area of each market (within a radius of about  versts) with mathematical precision, and it is very hard for the employers to beat down the price, because the muzhik who has come to the market prefers to lie around or go on to another place rather than work for lower pay\u201d (Shakhovskoi, ). It goes without saying that violent fluctuations in prices paid for labour cause innumerable breaches of contract \u2013 only not on one side, as the employers usually claim, but on both sides: \u201cconcerted action is taken by both sides\u201d: the labourers agree among themselves to demand more, and the employers \u2013 to offer less (ibid., ).[] How openly \u201ccallous cash payment\u201d reigns here in the relations between the classes may be seen, for example, from the following fact: \u201cexperienced employers know very well\u201d that the workers will \u201cgive in\u201d only when they have eaten up their food stock. \u201cA farmer related that when he came to the market to hire workers . . . he walked among them, poking with his stick at their knapsacks (sic !): if they had bread left, he would not talk to them; he would leave the market\u201d and wait \u201cuntil the knapsacks in the market were empty\u201d (from the Selsky Vestnik [Rural Herald ], , No. , ibid., -).\n\nAs under developed capitalism anywhere, so here, we see that the worker is particularly oppressed by small capital. The big employer is forced by sheer commercial considerations[] to abstain from petty oppression, which is of little advantage and is fraught with considerable loss should disputes arise. That is why the big employers, for example (those employing from  to  workers), try to keep their workers from leaving at the end of the week, and themselves fix prices according to the demand for labour; some even adopt a system of wage increases if the price of labour in the area goes up \u2013 and all evidence goes to show that these increases are more than compensated by better work and the absence of disputes (ibid., -; ). A small employer, on the contrary, sticks at nothing. \u201cThe farmsteaders and German colonists carefully \u2018choose\u2019 their workers and pay them  or % more; but the amount of work they \u2018squeeze\u2019 out of them is  per cent more\u201d (ibid., ). The \u201cwenches\u201d who work for such an employer \u201cdon\u2019t know day from night,\u201d as they themselves say. The colonists who hire mowers get their sons to follow on their heels (i.e., to speed up the workers!) in shifts, so that the speeders-up, replacing one another three times a day, come with renewed energy to drive the workers on: \u201cthat is why it is so easy to recognise those who have worked for the German colonists by their haggard appearance. Generally speaking, the farmsteaders and the Germans avoid hiring those who have formerly worked on landowners\u2019 estates. \u2018You\u2019ll not stand the pace with us,\u2019 they say quite frankly\u201d (ibid.).[]\n\nLarge-scale machine industry, by concentrating large masses of workers, transforming the methods of production, and destroying all the traditional, patriarchal cloaks and screens that have obscured the relations between classes, always leads to the directing of public attention towards these relations, to attempts at public control and regulation. This phenomenon, which has found particularly striking expression in factory inspection, is also beginning to be observed in Russian capitalist agriculture, precisely in the region where it is most developed. The question of the workers\u2019 sanitary conditions was raised in Kherson Gubernia as early as  at the Second Gubernia Congress of Doctors of the Kherson Zemstvo, and was dealt with again in ; in  there was drawn up a programme for the study of the workers\u2019 conditions. The investigation of sanitary conditions that was carried out (on a far from adequate scale) in - slightly lifted the veil concealing the conditions of labour in the remote villages. It was seen, for instance, that in the majority of cases the workers have no living quarters; where barracks are provided, they are usually very badly built from a hygienic point of view, and \u201cnot infrequently\u201d dug-outs are met with \u2013 they are inhabited, for example, by shepherds, who suffer severely from dampness, overcrowding, cold, darkness and the stifling atmosphere. The food provided is very often unsatisfactory. The working day, as a rule, is from  / to  hours, which is much longer than the usual working day in large-scale industry ( to  hours). An interval during the hottest part of the day is met with only \u201cas an exception\u201d \u2013 and cases of brain diseases are no rarity. Work at machines gives rise to occupational division of labour and occupational diseases. For example, working at threshing machines are \u201cdrummers\u201d (they put the sheaves into the drum; the work is very dangerous and most laborious: thick corn-dust beats into their faces), and \u201cpitchers\u201d (they pitch up the sheaves; the work is so heavy that the shifts have to be changed every hour or two). Women sweep up the straw, which boys carry aside, while from  to  labourers stack it in ricks. The number employed on threshing in the whole gubernia must exceed , (Tezyakov, ).[] Mr. Tezyakov\u2019s conclusions regarding the sanitary conditions of agricultural work, are as follows: \u201cGenerally speaking, the opinion of the ancients that the labour of the husbandman is \u2018the pleasantest and healthiest of occupations\u2019 is hardly sound at the present time, when the capitalist spirit reigns in agriculture. With the introduction of machinery into agriculture, the sanitary conditions of agricultural labour have not improved, but have changed for the worse. Machinery has brought into the field of agriculture a specialisation of labour so little known here before that it has had the effect of developing among the rural population occupational diseases and a host of serious injuries\u201d ().\n\nA result of the investigations into sanitary conditions (after the famine year and the cholera) was the attempt to organise medical and food depots, at which the labourers were to be registered, placed under sanitary supervision and provided with cheap dinners. However modest the scale and the results of this organisation may be, and however precarious its existence,[] it remains an important historical fact, revealing the trends of capitalism in agriculture. At the Congress of Doctors of Kherson Gubernia it was proposed, on the basis of data gathered by practitioners: to recognise the importance of medical and food depots and the need for improving their sanitary condition and extending their activities to give them the character of labour exchanges providing information on the prices of labour and their fluctuations; to extend sanitary inspection to all more or less big farms employing considerable numbers of labourers, \u201cas is done in industrial establishments\u201d (p. ); to issue strict regulations governing the employment of agricultural machines and the registration of accidents; to raise the question of the workers\u2019 right to compensation and of providing better and cheaper steam transport. The Fifth Congress of Russian Doctors passed a resolution calling the attention of the Zemstvos concerned to the activities of the Kherson Zemstvo in the organisation of medical and sanitary inspection.\n\nIn conclusion, let us return to the Narodnik economists. Above we have seen that they idealise labour-service and close their eyes to the progressive nature of capitalism as compared with that system. Now we must add that they are unfavourably disposed to the \u201cmigration\u201d of workers, and favour local \u201cemployments.\u201d Here, for example, is how this usual Narodnik view is expressed by Mr. N.\u2013on: \u201cThe peasants . . . set off in quest of work. . . . How far, one may ask, is it advantageous from the economic point of view? Not personally for each individual peasant, but how far is it advantageous for the peasantry as a whole, from the national economic point of view?. . . What we want is to point to the purely economic disadvantage of the annual peregrination, God knows where to, for the entire summer, when it would seem that one could find plenty of occupations at hand. . .\u201d (-).\n\nWe assert, the Narodnik theory notwithstanding, that the \u201cperegrination\u201d of the workers not only yields \u201cpurely economic\u201d advantages to the workers themselves, but in general should be regarded as progressive; that public attention should not be directed towards replacing outside employments by local \u201coccupations close at hand,\u201d but, on the contrary, towards removing all the obstacles in the way of migration, towards facilitating it in every way, towards improving and reducing the costs of all conditions of the workers\u2019 travel, etc. The grounds for our assertion are as follows:\n\n) \u201cPurely economic\u201d advantage accrues to the workers from \u201cperegrination\u201d in that they go to places where wages are higher, where their position as seekers of employment is a more advantageous one. Simple as this argument is, it is too often forgotten by those who love to rise to a higher, allegedly \u201cnational-economic\u201d point of view.\n\n) \u201cPeregrination\u201d destroys bonded forms of hire and labour-service.\n\nLet us recall, for example, that formerly, when migration was little developed, the southern landowners (and other employers) readily resorted to the following system of hiring labourers: they sent their agents to the northern gubernias and (through the medium of rural officials) hired tax-defaulters on terms extremely disadvantageous to the latter.[] Those offering employment consequently enjoyed the advantage of free competition, but those seeking it did not. We have quoted instances of the peasant\u2019s readiness to flee from labour-service and bondage even to the mines.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that on the question of \u201cperegrination\u201d our agrarians go hand in hand with the Narodniks. Take Mr. S. Korolenko, for example. In his book he quotes numerous opinions of landlords in opposition to the \u201cmigration\u201d of workers, and adduces a host of \u201carguments\u201d against \u201coutside employments\u201d: \u201cdissipation,\u201d \u201crowdy habits,\u201d \u201cdrunkenness,\u201d \u201cdishonesty,\u201d \u201cthe striving to leave the family in order to get rid of it and escape parental supervision,\u201d \u201cthe craving for amusement and a brighter life,\u201d etc. But here is a particularly interesting argument: \u201cFinally, as the proverb says, \u2018if it stay at one spot, a stone will gather moss,\u2019 and a man who stays at one spot will certainly amass property and cherish it\u201d (loc. cit., p. ). The proverb does indeed very strikingly indicate what happens to a man who is tied to one spot. Mr. S. Korolenko is particularly displeased with the phenomenon we referred to above, namely, that \u201ctoo\u201d many workers leave certain gubernias and that the shortage thus created is made good by the arrival of workers from other gubernias. In noting this fact as regards, for example, Voronezh Gubernia, Mr. S. Korolenko points to one of the reasons for this, namely, the large number of peasants possessing gift-land allotments. \u201cEvidently such peasants, who are relatively worse off materially and are not worried about their all too meagre property, more frequently fail to carry out the obligations they undertake and in general more readily leave for other gubernias, even when they could find plenty of employment at home.\u201d \u201cSuch peasants, having little attachment (sic !) to their own inadequate allotments, and sometimes not even possessing implements, more readily abandon their homes and go to seek their fortunes far from their native villages, without troubling about employment locally, and sometimes even about obligations undertaken, since they have nothing on which distraint can be made\u201d (ibid.).\n\n\u201cLittle attachment!\u201d That\u2019s just the term.\n\nIt should give food for thought to those who talk about the disadvantages of \u201cperegrination\u201d and the preferableness of local \u201coccupations close at hand\u201d![]\n) \u201cPeregrinations\u201d mean creating mobility of the population. Peregrinations are one of the most important factors preventing the peasants from \u201cgathering moss,\u201d of which more than enough has been fastened on them by history. Unless the population becomes mobile, it cannot develop, and it would be na\\\"ive to imagine that a village school can teach people what they can learn from an independent acquaintance with the different relations and orders of things in the South and in the North, in agriculture and in industry, in the capital and in the backwoods.\n\nNotes\n[] Money for the journey is obtained by the sale of property, even household goods, by mortgaging the allotment, by pawning things, clothes, etc., and even by borrowing money, to be repaid in labour, \u201cfrom priests, landlords and local kulaks\u201d (Shakhovskoi, ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Mr. Shakhovskoi refers to another form of the combination of agricultural and non-agricultural labour. Thousands of rafts are floated down the Dnieper to the towns in the lower reaches of the river. On every raft there are from  to  workers (raftsmen), mostly Byelorussians and Great-Russians from Orel Gubernia. \u201cFor the whole voyage they get practically nothing\u201d; they count chiefly on getting employment at reaping and threshing. These hopes are rewarded only in \u201cgood\u201d years.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] \u201cAt harvest time in a good year the worker triumphs, and it is a hard job to get him to give way. He is offered a price, but he won\u2019t consider it; he keeps repeating: give me what I ask and it\u2019s a go. And that is not because labour is scarce, but because, as the workers say, \u2018it\u2019s our turn now.\u2019\u201d- (Reported by a volost clerk; Shakhovskoi, .)\n\n\u201cIf the crop is a bad one and the price of labour has dropped, the kulak employer takes advantage of this condition to discharge the worker before the contract has expired, and the worker loses the season either in seeking work in the same district or in tramping the country,\u201d a landlord correspondent confesses (ibid., ).\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Cf. Fr. Engels, Zur Wohnungsfrage. Vorwort. (F. Engels, The Housing Question. Preface. \u2013Ed.)[]\u2014Lenin\n\n[] The same characteristics are displayed by the \u201cCossacks\u201d of the Kuban Region: \u201cThe Cossack resorts to every possible method to force down the price of labour, acting either individually or through the community\u201d (sic ! What a pity we lack more detailed information about this latest function of the \u201ccommunity\u201d!): \u201ccutting down the food, increasing the work quota, docking the pay, retaining the workers\u2019 passports, adopting public resolutions prohibiting specific farmers from employing workers, on Dain of a fine, at above a definite rate, etc.\u201d (\u201cMigrant Workers in the Kuban Region\u201d by A. Beloborodov, in Severny Vestnik, February , p. .)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Let us observe, in passing, that this operation, threshing, is most frequently done by hired labourers. One can judge, therefore how large must be the number employed on threshing all over Russia!\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Of the six uyezd Zemstvo assemblies in Kherson Gubernia whose views on the question of organising supervision over workers are reported by Mr. Tezyakov, four declared against this system. The local landowners accused the gubernia Zemstvo board of \u201cturning the workers into absolute idlers,\u201d etc.\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Shakhovskoi, loc. cit.,  and foll. The author cites even the list of \u201cfees\u201d paid to clerks and village elders for the hire of peasants on advantageous terms. \u2013 Tezyakov loc. cit.,  \u2013 Trirogov The Village Community and the Poll Tax; article entitled \u201cBondage in the National Economy.\u201d\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Here is another example of the pernicious influence of Narodnik prejudices. Mr. Tezyakov, whose splendid work we have frequently quoted, notes the fact that from Kherson Gubernia many local workers go to that of Taurida, although there is a great shortage of labour in the former gubernia. He calls this \u201can extremely queer phenomenon\u201d: \u201cit means a loss to the employers and a loss to the workers, who abandon jobs at home and risk finding none in Taurida\u201d (). We, on the contrary, think that Mr. Tezyakov\u2019s statement is extremely queer. Do the workers really not understand what is to their advantage, and have they not the right to seek the most advantageous conditions of employment they can get? (In Taurida Gubernia the wages of agricultural workers are higher than in Kherson Gubernia.) Are we really to think that it is obligatory for the muzhik to live and work where he is registered and \u201cprovided with an allotment\u201d?\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Zvegintsev Commission \u2013 was established in  under the auspices of the Zemstvo Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs to draw up measures for \u201cintroducing order into employments outside the village and regulating the movement of agricultural labourers.\u201d\n\n Today, Saturday, November , in the course of a speech I made at the Peasants' Congress, I was publicly asked a question to which I forthwith replied. It is essential that this question and my reply should immediately be made known to all the reading public, for while formally speaking only in my own name, I was actually speaking in the name of the whole Bolshevik Party.\n\nThe matter was the following.\n\nTouching on the question of an alliance between the Bolshevik workers and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, whom many peasants at present trust, I argued in my speech that this alliance can be an \"honest coalition\", an honest alliance, for there is no radical divergence of interests between the wage-workers and the working and exploited peasants. Socialism is fully able to meet the interests of both. Only socialism can meet their interests. Hence the possibility and necessity for an \"honest coalition\" between the proletarians and the working and exploited peasantry. On the contrary, a \"coalition\" (alliance) between the working and exploited classes, on the one hand, and the bourgeoisie, on the other, cannot be an \"honest coalition\" because of the radical divergence of interests between these classes.\n\nImagine, I said, that there is a majority of Bolsheviks and a minority of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in the government, or even, let us assume, only one Left Socialist-Revolutionary--the Commissar of Agriculture. Could the Bolsheviks practise an honest coalition under such circumstances?\n\nThey could; for, while they are irreconcilable in their fight against the counter-revolutionary elements (including the Right Socialist-Revolutionary and the defencist elements), the Bolsheviks would be obliged to abstain from voting on questions which concern purely Socialist-Revolutionary points in the land programme approved by the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets. Such, for instance, would be the point on equal land tenure and the redistribution of land among the small holders.\n\nBy abstaining from voting on such a point the Bolsheviks would not be changing their programme in the slightest. For, given the victory of socialism (workers' control over the factories, to be followed by their expropriation, the nationalisation of the banks, and the creation of a Supreme Economic Council for the regulation of the entire economic life of the country)--given that the workers would be obliged to agree to the transitional measures proposed by the small working and exploited peasants, provided such measures were not detrimental to the cause of socialism. Even Kautsky, when he was still a Marxist (-l), frequently admitted--l said --that the measures of transition to socialism cannot be identical in countries with large-scale and those with small-scale farming.\n\nWe Bolsheviks would be obliged to abstain from voting when such a point was being decided in the Council of People's Commissars or in the Central Executive Committee, for if the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries (as well as the peasants who support them) agreed to workers' control, to the nationalisation of the banks, etc., equal land tenure would be only one of the measures of transition to full socialism. For the proletariat to impose such transitional measures would be absurd; it is obliged, in the interests of the victory of socialism, to yield to the small working and exploited peasants in the choice of these transitional measures, for they could do no harm to the cause of socialism.\n\nThereupon, a Left Socialist-Revolutionary (it was Comrade Feofilaktov, if I am not mistaken) asked me the following question:\n\n\"How would the Bolsheviks act if in the Constituent Assembly the peasants wanted to pass a law on equal land tenure, while the bourgeoisie were opposed to the peasants and the decision depended on the Bolsheviks?\"\n\nI replied: under such circumstances, when the cause of socialism would be ensured by the introduction of workers' control, the nationalisation of the banks, etc., the alliance between the workers and the working and exploited peasants would make it obligatory for the party of the proletariat to vote for the peasants and against the bourgeoisie. The Bolsheviks, in my opinion, would be entitled when the vote was being taken to make a declaration of dissent, to place on record their non-agreement, etc., but to abstain from voting under such circumstances would be to betray their allies in the fight for socialism because of a difference with them on a partial issue. The Bolsheviks would never betray the peasants in such a situation. Equal land tenure and like measures cannot prejudice socialism if the power is in the hands of a workers' and peasants' government, if workers' control has been introduced, the banks nationalised, a workers' and peasants' supreme economic body set up to direct (regulate) the entire economic life of the country, and so forth.\n\nSuch was my reply.\n\nN. Lenin The Revolution of October  had shown the exceptional political maturity of the proletariat and its ability to stand firm in opposition to the bourgeoisie, said the speaker. The complete victory of socialism, however, would require a tremendous organisational effort filled with the knowledge that the proletariat must become the ruling class.\n\nThe proletariat was faced with the tasks of transforming the state system on socialist lines, for no matter how easy it would be to cite arguments in favour of a middle course such a course would be insignificant, the country\u2019s economic situation having reached a state that would rule out any middle course. There was no place left for half-measures in the gigantic struggle against imperialism and capitalism.\n\nThe point at issue was\u2014win or lose.\n\nThe workers should and did understand this; this was obvious because they had rejected half-way, compromise decisions. The more profound the revolution, the greater the number of active workers required to accomplish the replacement of capitalism by a socialist machinery. Even if there were no sabotage, the forces of the petty bourgeoisie would be inadequate. The task was one that could be accomplished only by drawing on the masses, only by the independent activity of the masses. The proletariat, therefore, should not think of improving its position at the moment, but should think of becoming the ruling class. It could not be expected that the rural proletariat would be clearly and firmly conscious of its own interests. Only the working class could be, and every proletarian, conscious of the great prospects, should feel himself to be a leader and carry the masses with him.\n\nThe proletariat should become the ruling class in the sense of being the leader of all who work; it should be the ruling class politically.\n\nThe illusion that only the bourgeoisie could run the state must be fought against. The proletariat must take the rule of the state upon itself.\n\nThe capitalists were doing everything they could to complicate the tasks of the working class. And all working-class organisations\u2014trade unions, factory committees and others\u2014would have to conduct a determined struggle in the economic sphere. The bourgeoisie was spoiling everything, sabotaging everything, in order to wreck the working-class revolution. And the tasks of organising production devolved entirely on the working class. They should do away, once and for all, with the illusion that state affairs or the management of banks and factories were beyond the power of the workers. All this could be solved only by tremendous day-to-day organisational work.\n\nIt was essential to organise the exchange of products and introduce regular accounting and control\u2014these were tasks for the working class, and the knowledge necessary for their accomplishment had been provided by factory life.\n\nEvery factory committee should concern itself not only with the affairs of its own factory, but should also be an organisation nucleus helping arrange the life of the state as a whole.\n\nIt was easy to issue a decree on the abolition of private property, but it must and could be implemented only by the workers themselves. Let there be mistakes\u2014they would be the mistakes of a new class creating a new way of life.\n\nThere was not and could not be a definite plan for the organisation of economic life.\n\nNobody could provide one. But it could be done from below, by the masses, through their experience. Instructions would, of course, be given and ways would be indicated, but it was necessary to begin simultaneously from above and from below.\n\nThe Soviets would have to become bodies regulating all production in Russia, but in order that they should not become staff headquarters without troops, work in the lower echelons was needed.... [Several illegible words were omitted\u2014Editor]\n\nThe working-class masses must set about the organisation of control and production on a country-wide scale. Not the organisation of individuals, but the organisation of all the working people, would be a guarantee of success; if they achieved that, if they organised economic life, everything opposing them would disappear of its own accord.",

Lenin argues that while capitalism\npredisposes the workers to the acceptance of socialism it does not spontaneously make\nthem conscious Socialists. The proletariat of its own can achieve only \u201dtrade-union consciousness.\u201d Accordingly, it was necessary to institute a \u201dparty of a new type\u201d capable of\nimbuing the working-class with revolutionary consciousness. This is the origin of Lenin\u2019s\nfamous theory of the Party as \u201dvanguard of the proletariat\u201d. He conceived of the vanguard\nas a highly centralized body organized around a core of experienced professional revolutionaries. Only such a party could succeed in the conditions of illegality prevailing in tsarist\nRussia at the time. The book also contains an attack on Revisionism.\ni\nPreface\nAccording to the author\u2019s original plan, the present pamphlet was to have been devoted to\na detailed development of the ideas expressed in the article \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d , (Iskra, No.\n, May ). We must first apologise to the reader for the delay in fulfilling the promise\nmade in that article (and repeated in response to many private inquiries and letters). One\nof the reasons for this delay was the attempt, undertaken in June of the past year (), to\nunite all the Social-Democratic organisations abroad. It was natural to wait for the results\nof this attempt, for, had the effort proved successful, it would perhaps have been necessary\nto expound Iskra\u2019s conceptions of organisation from a somewhat different approach; in any\ncase, such a success promised to put an end very quickly to the existence of the two trends\nin the Russian Social-Democratic movement. As the reader knows, the attempt failed, and,\nas we propose to show, was bound to fail after the new swing, of Rabocheye Dyelo, in\nits issue No. , towards Economism. It was found to be absolutely essential to begin a\ndetermined struggle against this trend, diffuse and ill-defined, but for that reason the more\npersistent, the more capable of reasserting itself in diverse forms. Accordingly, the original\nplan of the pamphlet was altered and considerably enlarged.\nIts main theme was to have been the three questions raised in the article \u201cWhere To\nBegin\u201d \u2013 the character and main content of our political agitation; our organisational tasks;\nand the plan for building, simultaneously and from various sides, a militant, all-Russia\norganisation. These questions have long engaged the mind of the author, who tried to raise\nthem in Rabochaya Gazeta during one of the unsuccessful attempts to revive that paper (see\nChapter V). But the original plan to confine the pamphlet to an analysis of only these three\nquestions and to set forth our views as far as possible in a positive form, without, or almost\nwithout, entering into polemics, proved wholly impracticable, for two reasons. On the one\nhand, Economism proved to be much more tenacious than we had supposed (we employ the\nterm Economism in the broad sense, as explained in Iskra, No.  (December ), in the\narticle entitled \u201cA Talk With Defenders of Economism\u201d, which was a synopsis, so to speak,\nof the present pamphlet\n). It became clear beyond doubt that the differences regarding the\nsolution of the three questions mentioned were explainable to a far greater degree by the\nii\niii Preface\nbasic antithesis between the two trends in the Russian Social-Democratic movement than\nby differences over details. On the other hand, the perplexity of the Economists over the\npractical application of our views in Iskra clearly revealed that we often speak literally in\ndifferent tongues and therefore cannot arrive at an understanding without beginning ab ovo,\nand that an attempt must be made, in the simplest possible style, illustrated by numerous\nand concrete examples, systematically to \u201cclarify\u201d all our basic points of difference with\nall the Economists. I resolved to make such an attempt at \u201cclarification\u201d, fully realising\nthat it would greatly increase the size of the pamphlet and delay its publication; I saw no\nother way of meeting my pledge I had made in the article \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d. Thus, to\nthe apologies for the delay, I must add others for the serious literary shortcomings of the\npamphlet. I had to work in great haste, with frequent interruptions by a variety of other\ntasks.\nThe examination of the above three questions still constitutes the main theme of this\npamphlet, but I found it necessary to begin with two questions of a more general nature \u2013\nwhy such an \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d slogan as \u201cfreedom of criticism\u201d should be for us a\nveritable war-cry, and why we cannot come to an understanding even on the fundamental\nquestion of the role of Social-Democrats in relation to the spontaneous mass movement.\nFurther, the exposition of our views on the character and substance of political agitation\ndeveloped into an explanation of the difference between trade-unionist politics and SocialDemocratic politics, while the exposition of our views on organisational tasks developed\ninto an explanation of the difference between the amateurish methods which satisfy the\nEconomists, and the organisation of revolutionaries which we hold to be indispensable.\nFurther, I advance the \u201cplan\u201d for an all-Russia political newspaper with all the more insistence because the objections raised against it are untenable, and because no real answer has\nbeen given to the question I raised in the article \u201c\u2019Where To Begin\u201d as to how we can set\nto work from all sides simultaneously to create the organisation we need. Finally, in the\nconcluding part, I hope to show that we did all we could to prevent a decisive break with the\nEconomists, a break which nevertheless proved inevitable; that Rabocheye Dyelo acquired\na special significance, a \u201chistorical\u201d significance, if you will, because it expressed fully and\nstrikingly, not consistent Economism, but the confusion and vacillation which constitute\nthe distinguishing feature of an entire period in the history of Russian Social-Democracy;\nand that therefore the polemic with Rabocheye Dyelo, which may upon first view seem\nexcessively detailed, also acquires significance, for we can make no progress until we have\ncompletely put an end to this period.\nN. Lenin\nFebruary \niv Preface\nCHAPTER \nDOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF\nCRITICISM\n.. WHAT DOES \u201dFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\u201c MEAN?\n\u201dFreedom of criticism\u201c is undoubtedly the most fashionable slogan at the present time, and\nthe one most frequently employed in the controversies between socialists and democrats\nin all countries. At first sight, nothing would appear to be more strange than the solemn\nappeals to freedom of criticism made by one of the parties to the dispute. Have voices been\nraised in the advanced parties against the constitutional law of the majority of European\ncountries which guarantees freedom to science and scientific investigation? \u201dSomething\nmust be wrong here,\u201c will be the comment of the onlooker who has heard this fashionable\nslogan repeated at every turn but has not yet penetrated the essence of the disagreement\namong the disputants; evidently this slogan is one of the conventional phrases which, like\nnicknames, become legitimised by use, and become almost generic terms.\u201d\nIn fact, it is no secret for anyone that two trends have taken form in present-day international\nSocial-Democracy. The conflict between these trends now flares up in a bright flame and\nnow dies down and smoulders under the ashes of imposing \u201ctruce resolutions\u201d. The essence\nof the \u201cnew\u201d trend, which adopts a \u201ccritical\u201d attitude towards \u201cobsolete dogmatic\u201d Marxism, has been clearly enough presented by Bernstein and demonstrated by Millerand.\nSocial-Democracy must change from a party of social revolution into a democratic party\nof social reforms. Bernstein has surrounded this political demand with a whole battery of\nwell-attuned \u201cnew\u201d arguments and reasonings. Denied was the possibility of putting socialism on a scientific basis and of demonstrating its necessity and inevitability from the\npoint of view of the materialist conception of history. Denied was the fact of growing\n\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nimpoverishment, the process of proletarisation, and the intensification of capitalist contradictions; the very concept, \u201cultimate aim\u201d, was declared to be unsound, and the idea of\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat was completely rejected. Denied was the antithesis in\nprinciple between liberalism and socialism. Denied wasthe theory of the class struggle, on\nthe alleged grounds that it could not be applied to a strictly democratic society governed\naccording to the will of the majority, etc.\nThus, the demand for a decisive turn from revolutionary Social-Democracy to bourgeois\nsocial-reformism was accompanied by a no less decisive turn towards bourgeois criticism\nof all the fundamental ideas of Marxism. In view of the fact that this criticism of Marxism has long been directed from the political platform, from university chairs, in numerous\npamphlets and in a series of learned treatises, in view of the fact that the entire younger\ngeneration of the educated classes has been systematically reared for decades on this criticism, it is not surprising that the \u201cnew critical\u201d trend in Social-Democracy should spring\nup, all complete, like Minerva from the head of Jove. The content of this new trend did not\nhave to grow and take shape, it was transferred bodily from bourgeois to socialist literature.\nTo proceed. If Bernstein\u2019s theoretical criticism and political yearnings were still unclear\nto anyone, the French took the trouble strikingly to demonstrate the \u201cnew method\u201d. In this\ninstance, too, France has justified its old reputation of being \u201cthe land where, more than\nanywhere else, the historical class struggles were each time fought out to a decision...\u201d\n(Engels, Introduction to Marx\u2019s Der  Brumaire). The French socialists have begun, not\nto theorise, but to act. The democratically more highly developed political conditions in\nFrance have permitted them to put \u201cBernsteinism into practice\u201d immediately, with all its\nconsequences. Millerand has furnished an excellent example of practical Bernsteinism; not\nwithout reason did Bernstein and Vollmar rush so zealously to defend and laud him. Indeed,\nif Social-Democracy, in essence, is merely a party of reform and must be bold enough to\nadmit this openly, then not only has a socialist the right to join a bourgeois cabinet, but he\nmust always strive to do so. If democracy, in essence, means the abolition of class domination, then why should not a socialist minister charm the whole bourgeois world by orations\non class collaboration? Why should he not remain in the cabinet even after the shootingdown of workers by gendarmes has exposed, for the hundredth and thousandth time, the\nreal nature of the democratic collaboration of classes? Why should he not personally take\npart in greeting the tsar, for whom the French socialists now have no other name than hero\nof the gallows, knout, and exile (knouteur, pendeur et deportateur)? And the reward for\nthis utter humiliation and self-degradation of socialism in the face of the whole world, for\nthe corruption of the socialist consciousness of the working masses \u2013 the only basis that\ncan guarantee our victory \u2013 the reward for this is pompous projects for miserable reforms,\nso miserable in fact that much more has been obtained from bourgeois governments!\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nHe who does not deliberately close his eyes cannot fail to see that the new \u201ccritical\u201d trend\nin socialism is nothing more nor less than a new variety of opportunism. And if we judge\npeople, not by the glittering uniforms they don or by the highsounding appellations they\ngive themselves, but by their actions and by what they actually advocate, it will be clear that\n\u201cfreedom of criticism\u201d means\u2019 freedom for an opportunist trend in Social-Democracy, freedom to convert Social-Democracy into a democratic party of reform, freedom to introduce\nbourgeois ideas and bourgeois elements into socialism.\n\u201cFreedom\u201d is a grand word, but under the banner of freedom for industry the most\npredatory wars were waged, under the banner of freedom of labour, the working people\nwere robbed. The modern use of the term \u201cfreedom of criticism\u201d contains the same inherent falsehood. Those who are really convinced that they have made progress in science\nwould not demand freedom for the new views to continue side by side with the old, but\nthe substitution of the new views for the old. The cry heard today, \u201cLong live freedom of\ncriticism\u201d, is too strongly reminiscent of the fable of the empty barrel.\nWe are marching in a compact group along a precipitous and difficult path, firmly holding each other by the hand. We are surrounded on all sides by enemies, and we have to\nadvance almost constantly under their fire. We have combined, by a freely adopted decision, for the purpose of fighting the enemy, and not of retreating into the neighbouring\nmarsh, the inhabitants of which, from the very outset, have reproached us with having separated ourselves into an exclusive group and with having chosen the path of struggle instead\nof the path of conciliation. And now some among us begin to cry out: Let us go into the\nmarsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort: What backward people you are!\nAre you not ashamed to deny us the liberty to invite you to take a better road! Oh, yes,\ngentlemen! You are free not only to invite us, but to go yourselves wherever you will, even\ninto the marsh. In fact, we think that the marsh is your proper place, and we are prepared\nto render you every assistance to get there. Only let go of our hands, don\u2019t clutch at us\nand don\u2019t besmirch the grand word freedom, for we too are \u201cfree\u201d to go where we please,\nfree to fight not only against the marsh, but also against those who are turning towards the\nmarsh!\n.. THE NEW ADVOCATES OF \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\u201d\nNow, this slogan (\u201cfreedom of criticism\u201d) has in recent times been solemnly advanced by\nRabocheye Dyelo (No. ), organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, not as\na theoretical postulate, but as a political demand, as a reply to the question, \u201cIs it possible to\nunite the Social-Democratic organisations operating abroad?\u201d: \u201cFor a durable unity, there\nmust be freedom of criticism\u201d (p. ).\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nFrom this statement two definite conclusions follow: () that Rabocheye Dyelo has taken\nunder its wing the opportunist trend in international Social-Democracy in general, and ()\nthat Rabocheye Dyelo demands freedom for opportunism in Russian Social-Democracy.\nLet us examine these conclusions.\nRabocheye Dyelo is \u201cparticularly\u201d displeased with the \u201cinclination of Iskra and Zarya to\npredict a rupture between the Mountain and the Gironde in international Social-Deniocracy\u201d.\nGenerally speaking,\u201c writes B. Krichevsky, editor of Rabocheye Dyelo, \u201dthis talk of the\nMountain and the Gironde heard in the ranks of Social-Democracy * represents a shallow\nhistorical analogy, a strange thing to come from the pen of a Marxist. The Mountain and\nthe Gironde did not represent different temperaments-, or intellectual trends, as the historians of social thought may think, but different classes or strata \u2013 the middle bourgeoisie,\non the one hand, and the petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat, on the other. In the modern\nsocialist movement, however, there is no conflict of class interests; the socialist movement\nin its entirety, in all of its diverse forms (Krichevsky\u2019s italics), including the most pronounced Bernsteinians, stands on the basis of the class interests of the proletariat and its\nclass struggle for political and economic emancipation\u201c (pp. -).\nA bold assertion! Has not Krichevsky heard of the fact, long ago noted, that it is precisely the extensive participation of an \u201dacademic\u201c stratum in the socialist movement in\nrecent years that has promoted such a rapid spread of Bernsteinism? And what is most\nimportant \u2013 on what does our author found his opinion that even \u201dthe most pronounced\nBernsteinians\u201c stand on the basis of the class struggle for the political and economic emancipation of the proletariat? No one knows. This determined defence of the most pronounced\nBernsteinians is not supported by any argument or reasoning whatever. Apparently, the\nauthor believes that if he repeats what the most pronounced Bernsteinians say about themselves his assertion requires no proof. But can anything more \u201dshallow\u201c be imagined than\nthis judgement of an entire trend based on nothing more than what the representatives of\nthat trend say about themselves? Can anything more shallow be imagined than the subsequent \u201dhomily\u201c on the two different and even diametrically opposite types, or paths, of\nparty development? (Rabocheye Dyelo, pp. -.) The German Social-Democrats, in\nother words, recognise complete freedom of criticism, but the French do not, and it is\nprecisely their example that demonstrates the \u201dbane of intolerance\u201c.\nTo this we can only say that the very example B. Krichevsky affords us attests to the fact\nthat the name Marxists is at times assumed by people who conceive history literally in the\n\u201dIlovaisky manner\u201c. To explain the unity of the German Socialist Party and the disunity of\nthe French Socialist Party, there is no need whatever to go into the special features in the\nhistory of these countries, to contrast the conditions of military semiabsolutism in the one\nwith republican parliamentarism in the other, to analyse the effects of the Paris Commune\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nand the effects of the Exceptional Law Against the Socialists, to compare the economic\nlife and economic development of the two countries, or to recall that \u201dthe unexampled\ngrowth of German Social-Democracy\u201c was accompanied by a strenuous struggle, unique\nin the history of socialism, not only against erroneous theories (Muhlberger, D \u00a8 uhring, \u00a8\n\nthe Katheder-Socialists), but also against erroneous tactics (Lassalle), etc., etc. All that\nis superfluous! The French quarrel among themselves because they are intolerant; the\nGermans are united because they are good boys.\nAnd observe, this piece of matchless profundity is designed to \u201drefute\u201c the fact that puts\nto rout the defence of the Bernsteinians. The question whether or not the Bernsteinians\nstand on the basis of the class struggle of the proletariat is one that can be completely and\nirrevocably answered only by historical experience. Consequently, the example of France\nholds greatest significance in this respect, because France is the only country in which the\nBernsteinians attempted to stand independently, on their own feet, with the warm approval\nof their German colleagues (and partly also of the Russian opportunists; cf. Rabocheye\nDyelo, No. -, pp. -). The reference to the \u201dintolerance\u201c of the French, apart from\nits \u201dhistorical\u201c significance (in the Nozdryov sense), turns out to be merely an attempt to\n\u2013hush up very unpleasant facts with angry invectives.\nNor are we inclined to make a present of the Germans to Krichevsky and the numerous\nother champions of \u201dfreedom of criticism\u201c. If the \u201dmost pronounced Bernsteinians\u201c are\nstill tolerated in the ranks of the German party, it is only to the extent that they submit to\nthe Hanover resolution, which emphatically rejected Bernstein\u2019s \u201damendments\u201c, and to the\nLubeck resolution, which (notwithstanding the diplomatic terms in which it is couched)\ncontains a direct warning to Bernstein. It is debatable, from the standpoint of the interests\nof the German party, whether diplomacy was appropriate and whether, in * this case, a bad\npeace is better than a good quarrel; in short, opinions may differ as to the expediency of any\none of the methods employed to reject Bernsteinism, but that the German party did reject\nBernsteinism on two occasions, is a fact no one can fail to see. Therefore, to think that\nthe German example confirms the thesis that \u201dthe most pronounced Bernsteinians stand on\nthe basis of the class struggle of the proletariat, for political and economic emancipation\u201c,\nmeans to fail completely to understand what is going on under our very eyes.\nNor is that all. As we have seen, Rabocheye Dyelo demands \u201dfreedom of criticism\u201c and\ndefends Bernsteinism before Russian Social-Democracy. Apparently it convinced itself\nthat we were unfair to our \u201dCritics\u201c and Bernsteinians. But to which ones? who? where?\nwhen? What did the unfairness represent? About this, not a word. Rabocheye Dyelo does\nnot name a single Russian Critic or Bernsteinian! We are left with but one of two possible\nsuppositions. Either the unfairly treated party is none other than Rabocheye Dyelo itself\n(this is confirmed by the fact that in the two articles in No.  reference is made only to the\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nwrongs suffered by Rabocheye Dyelo at the hands of Zarya and Iskra). If that is the case,\nhow is the strange fact to be explained that Rabocheye Dyelo, which always vehemently\ndissociated itself from all solidarity with Bernsteinism, could not defend itself without\nputting in a word in defence of the \u201dmost pronounced Bernsteinians\u201c and of freedom of\ncriticism? Or some third persons have been treated unfairly. if this is the case, then what\nreasons may there be for not naming them?\nWe see, therefore, that Rabocheye Dyelo is continuing to play the game of hide-and-seek\nit has played (as we shall show below) ever since its founding. And let us note further this\nfirst practical application of the vaunted \u201dfreedom of criticism\u201c. In actual fact, not only was\nit forthwith reduced to abstention from all criticism, but also to abstention from expressing independent views altogether. The very Rabocheye Dyelo, which avoids mentioning\nRussian Bernsteinism as if it were a shameful disease (to use Starover\u2019s apt expression),\nproposes, for the treatment of this disease, to copy word for word the latest German prescription for the German variety of the malady! Instead of freedom of criticism slavish\n(worse: apish) imitation! The very same social and political content of modern international opportunism reveals itself in a variety of ways according to national peculiarities. In\none country the opportunists have long ago come out under a separate flag; in another, they\nhave ignored theory and in fact pursued the policy of the Radicals-Socialists; in a third,\nsome members of the revolutionary party have deserted to the camp of opportunism and\nstrive to achieve their aims, not in open struggle for principles and for new tactics, but by\ngradual, imperceptible, and, if one may so put it, unpunishable corruption of their party;\nin a fourth country, similar deserters employ the same methods in the gloom of political\nslavery, and with a completely original combination of \u201dlegal\u201c and \u201dillegal\u201c activity, etc.\nTo talk of freedom of criticism and of Bernsteinism as a condition for uniting the Russian\nSocial Democrats and not to explain how Russian Bernsteinism has manifested itself and\nwhat particular fruits it has borne, amounts to talking with the aim of saying nothing.\nLet us ourselves try, if only in a few words, to say what Rabocheye Dyelo did not want\nto say (or which was, perhaps, beyond its comprehension).\n.. CRITICISM IN RUSSIA\nThe chief distinguishing feature of Russia in regard to the point we are examining is that\nthe very beginning of the spontaneous working-class movement, on the one hand, and of\nthe turn of progressive public opinion towards Marxism, on the other, was marked by the\ncombination of manifestly heterogeneous elements under a common flag to fight the common enemy (the obsolete social and political world outlook). We refer to the heyday of\n\u201dlegal Marxism\u201c. Speaking generally, this was an altogether curious phenomenon that no\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\none in the eighties or the beginning of the nineties would have believed possible. In a\ncountry ruled by an autocracy, with a completely enslaved press, in a period of desperate\npolitical reaction in which even the tiniest outgrowth of political discontent and protest\nis persecuted, the theory of revolutionary Marxism suddenly forces its way into the censored literature and, though expounded in Aesopian language, is understood by all the\n\u201dinterested\u201c. The government had accustomed itself to regarding only the theory of the\n(revolutionary) Narodnaya Volya as dangerous, without, as is usual, observing its internal evolution, and rejoicing at any criticism levelled against it. Quite a considerable time\nelapsed (by our Russian standards) before the government realised what had happened and\nthe unwieldy army of censors and gendarmes discovered the new enemy and flung itself\nupon him. Meanwhile, Marxist books were published one after another, Marxist journals\nand newspapers were founded, nearly everyone became a Marxist, Marxists were flattered,\nMarxists were courted, and the book publishers rejoiced at the extraordinary, ready sale\nof Marxist literature. It was quite natural, therefore, that among the Marxian neophytes\nwho were caught up in this atmosphere, there should be more than one \u201dauthor who got a\nswelled head. . .\u201c\nWe can now speak calmly of this period as of an event of the past. It is no secret that\nthe brief period in which Marxism blossomed on the surface of our literature was called\nforth by an alliance between people of extreme and of very moderate views. In point of\nfact, the latter were bourgeois democrats; this conclusion (so markedly confirmed by their\nsubsequent \u201dcritical\u201c development) suggested itself to some even when the \u201dalliance\u201c was\nstill intact.\nThat being the case, are not the revolutionary Social-Democrats who entered into the\nalliance with the future \u201dCritics\u201c mainly responsible for the subsequent \u201dconfusion\u201c? This\nquestion, together with a reply in the affirmative, is sometimes heard from people with too\nrigid a view. But such people are entirely in the wrong. Only those who are not sure of\nthemselves can fear to enter into temporary alliances even with unreliable people; not a\nsingle political party could exist without such alliances. The combination with the legal\nMarxists was in its way the first really political alliance entered into by Russian Social\n-Democrats. Thanks to this alliance, an astonishingly rapid victory was obtained over\nNarodism, and Marxist ideas (even though in a vulgarised form) became very widespread.\nMoreover, the alliance was not concluded altogether without \u201dconditions\u201c. Evidence of this\nis the burning by the censor, in , of the Marxist collection Material on the Question\nof the Economic Development of Russia. If the literary agreement with the legal Marxists\ncan be compared with a political alliance, then that book can be compared with a political\ntreaty.\nThe rupture, of course, did not occur because the \u201dallies\u201c proved to be bourgeois democrats.\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nOn the contrary, the representatives of the latter trend are natural and desirable allies of\nSocial-Democracy insofar as its democratic tasks, brought to the fore by the prevailing situation in Russia, are concerned. But an essential condition for such an alliance must be the\nfull opportunity for the socialists to reveal to the working class that its interests are diametrically opposed to the interests of the bourgeoisie. However, the Bernsteinian and \u201dcritical\u201c\ntrend, to which the majority of the legal Marxists turned, deprived the socialists of this\nopportunity and demoralised the socialist consciousness by vulgarising Marxism, by advocating the theory of the blunting of social contradictions, by declaring the idea of the social\nrevolution and of the dictatorship of the proletariat to be absurd, by reducing the workingclass movement and the class struggle to narrow trade-unionism and to a \u201drealistic\u201c struggle\nfor petty, gradual reforms. This was synonymous with bourgeois democracy\u2019s denial of socialism\u2019s right to independence and, consequently, of its right to existence; in practice it\nmeant a striving to convert the nascent working-class movement into an appendage of the\nliberals.\nNaturally, under such circumstances the rupture was necessary. But the \u201dpeculiar\u201c feature of Russia manifested itself in the fact that this rupture simply meant the elimination\nof the Social-Democrats from the most accessible and widespread \u201dlegal\u201c literature. The\n\u201dex-Marxists\u201c, who took up the flag of \u201dcriticism\u201c and who obtained almost a monopoly to\n\u201ddemolish Marxism, entrenched themselves in this literature. Catchwords like \u201cAgainst orthodoxy\u201d and \u201cLong live freedom of criticism\u201d (now repeated by Rabocheye Dyelo) forthwith became the vogue, and the fact that neither the censor nor the gendarmes could resist\nthis vogue is apparent from the publication of three Russian editions of the work of the\ncelebrated Bernstein (celebrated in the Herostratean sense) and from the fact that the works\nof Bernstein, Mr. Prokopovich, and others were recommended by Zubatov (Iskra, No.\n). A task now devolved upon the Social Democrats that was difficult in itself and was\nmade incredibly more difficult by purely external obstacles \u2013 the task of combating the\nnew trend. This trend did not confine itself to the sphere of literature. The turn towards\n\u201ccriticism\u201d was accompanied by an infatuation for Economism among Social-Democratic\npractical workers.\nThe manner in which the connection between, and interdependence of, legal criticism\nand illegal Economism arose and grew is in itself an interesting subject, one that could serve\nas the theme of a special article. We need only note here that this connection undoubtedly\nexisted. The notoriety deservedly acquired by the Credo was due precisely to the frankness\nwith which it formulated this connection and blurted out the fundamental political tendency\nof Economism \u2013 let the workers carry on the economic struggle (it would be more correct\nto say the trade unionist struggle, because the latter also embraces specifically working\nclass politics) and let the Marxist intelligentsia merge with the liberals for the political\n\u201cstruggle.\u201d Thus, trade-unionist work \u201camong the people\u201d meant fulfilling the first part\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nof this task, while legal criticism meant fulfilling the second. This statement was such an\nexcellent weapon against Economism that, had there been no Credo, it would have been\nworth inventing one.\nThe Credo was not invented, but it was published without the consent and perhaps even\nagainst the will of its authors. At all events, the present writer, who took part in dragging\nthis new \u201dprogramme\u201c into the light of day, has heard complaints and reproaches to the\neffect that copies of the resume of the speakers\u2019 views were distributed, dubbed the Credo,\nand even published in the press together with the protest! We refer to this episode because\nit reveals a very peculiar feature of our Economism \u2013 fear of publicity. This is a feature of\nEconomism generally, and not of the authors of the Credo alone. It was revealed by that\nmost outspoken and honest advocate of Economism, Rabochaya Mysl, and by Rabocheye\nDyelo (which was indignant over the publication of \u201dEconomist\u201c documents in the Vademecum), as well as by the Kiev Committee, which two years ago refused to permit the\npublication of its profession de foi, together with a repudiation of it,\nand by many other\nindividual representatives of Economism.\nThis fear of criticism displayed by the advocates of freedom of criticism cannot be\nattributed solely to craftiness (although, on occasion, no doubt craftiness is brought into\nplay: it would be improvident to expose the young and as yet frail shoots of the new trend.\nto attacks by opponents). No, the majority of the Economists look with sincere resentment\n(as by the very nature of Economism they must) upon all theoretical controversies, factional\ndisagreements, broad political questions, plans for organising revolutionaries, etc. \u201dLeave\nall that to the people abroad\u00a1\u2018 said a fairly consistent Economist to me one day, thereby\nexpressing a very widespread (and again purely trade-unionist) view; our concern is the\nworking-class movement, the workers, organisations here, in our localities; all the rest is\nmerely the invention of doctrinaires, \u201dthe overrating of ideology\u201c, as the authors of the\nletter, published in Iskra, No. , expressed it, in unison with Rabocheye Dyelo, No. .\nThe question now arises: such being the peculiar features of Russian \u201dcriticism\u201c and\nRussian Bernsteinism, what should have been the task of those who sought to oppose opportunism in deeds and not merely in words? First, they should have made efforts to resume\nthe theoretical work that had barely begun in the period of legal Marxism and that fell anew\non the shoulders of the comrades working underground. Without such work the successful\ngrowth of the movement was impossible. Secondly, they should have actively combated\nthe legal \u201dcriticism\u201c that was perverting people\u2019s minds on a considerable scale. Thirdly,\nthey should have actively opposed confusion and vacillation in the practical movement, exposing and repudiating every conscious or unconscious attempt to degrade our programme\nand our tactics.\nThat Rabocheye Dyelo did none of these things is well known; we shall have occasion\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nbelow to deal with this well-known fact in detail and from various aspects. At the moment,\nhowever, we desire merely to show the glaring contradiction that exists between the demand\nfor \u201dfreedom of criticism\u201c and the specific features of our native criticism and Russian\nEconomism. It suffices but to glance at the text of the resolution in which the Union of\nRussian Social Democrats Abroad endorsed the point of view of Rabocheye Dyelo.\n\u201dIn the interests of the further ideological development of Social-Democracy, we recognise the freedom of criticism of Social-Democratic theory in Party literature to be absolutely necessary insofar as the criticism does not run counter to the class and revolutionary\ncharacter of this theory\u201c (Two Conferences, p. ).\nAnd the motivation? The resolution \u201din its first part coincides with the resolution of the\nLubeck Party Congress on Bernstein\u201c. . . . In the simplicity of their souls the \u201dUnionists\u201c\nfailed to observe what a testimonium paupertatis (attestation of poverty) they betray with\nthis copying. . .. \u201dBut ... in its second part, it restricts freedom of criticism much more than\ndid the Lubeck Party Congress.\u201c\nThe resolution of the Union Abroad, then, is directed against the Russian Bernsteinians?\nIf it is not, then the reference to Lubeck would be utterly absurd. But it is not true to say\nthat it \u201drestricts freedom of criticism\u201c. In adopting their Hanover resolution, the Germans,\npoint by point, rejected precisely the amendments proposed by Bernstein, while in their\nLubeck resolution they cautioned Bernstein personally, by naming him. Our \u201dfree\u201c imitators, however, make not a single allusion to a single manifestation of specifically Russian\n\u201dcriticism\u201c and Russian Economism. In view of this omission, the bare reference to the\nclass and revolutionary character of the theory leaves far wider scope for misinterpretation, particularly when the Union Abroad refuses to identify \u201dso-called Economism\u201c with\nopportunism (Two Conferences, p. , Paragraph ). But all this, in passing. The main\nthing to note is that the positions of the opportunists in relation to the revolutionary SocialDemocrats in Russia are diametrically opposed to those in Germany. In that country, as we\nknow, the revolutionary Social-Democrats are in favour of preserving that which exists \u2013\nthe old programme and the tactics, which are universally known and have been elucidated\nin all their details by many decades of experience. But the \u201dCritics\u201c desire to introduce\nchanges, and since these Critics represent an insignificant minority, and since they are very\ntimid in their revisionist efforts, one can understand the motives of the majority in confining themselves to the dry rejection of \u201dinnovations\u201c. In Russia, however, it is the Critics\nand the Economists who are in favour of preserving that which exists: the \u201dCritics\u201c want\nus to go on regarding them as Marxists and to guarantee them the \u201dfreedom of criticism\u201c\nthey enjoyed to the full (for, in fact, they never recognised any kind of party ties, and,\nmoreover, we never had a generally recognised party body that could \u201drestrict\u201c freedom\nof criticism, if only by counsel); the Economists want the revolutionaries to recognise the\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nsovereign character of the present movement\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , p. ), i.e., to\nrecognise the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of that which exists; they want the \u201cideologists\u201d not to try to\n\u201cdivert\u201d the movement from the path that \u201cis determined by the interaction of material.\nelements and material environment\u201d (\u201cLetter\u201d in Iskra, No. ); they want to have that\nstruggle recognised as desirable \u201cwhich it is possible for the workers to wage under the\npresent conditions\u201d, and as the only possible struggle, that \u201cwhich they are actually waging\nat the present time\u201d (\u201cSeparate Supplement\u201d to Rabochaya MysI, p. ). We revolutionary\nSocial-Democrats, on the contrary, are dissatisfied with this worship of spontaneity, i.e., of\nthat which exists \u201cat the present moment\u201d. We demand that the tactics that have prevailed\nin recent years he changed; we declare that \u201cbefore we can unite, and in order that we may\nunite, we must first of all draw firm and definite lines of demarcation\u201d (see announcement\nof the publication of Iskra). In a word, the Germans stand for that which exists and reject\nchanges; we demand a change of that which exists, and reject subservience thereto and\nreconciliation to it.\nThis \u201cslight\u201d difference our \u201cfree\u201d copyists of German resolutions failed to notice.\n.. ENGELS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THEORETICAL STRUGGLE\n\u201cDogmatism, doctrinairism\u201d, \u201cossification of the party \u2013 the inevitable retribution that follows the violent strait-lacing of thought\u201d \u2013 these are the enemies against which the knightly\nchampions of \u201cfreedom of criticism\u201d in Rabocheye Dyelo rise up in arms. We are very glad\nthat this question has been placed on the order of the day and we would only propose to\nadd to it one other:\nAnd who are the judges?\nWe have before us two publishers\u2019 announcements. One, \u201cThe Programme of the Periodical Organ of the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad \u2013 Rabocheye Dyelo\u201d\n(reprint from No.  of Rabocheye Dyelo), and the other, the \u201cAnnouncement of the Resumption of the Publications of the Emancipation of Labour Group\u201d. Both are dated ,\nwhen the \u201ccrisis of Marxism\u201d had long been under discussion. And what do we find? We\nwould seek in vain in the first announcement for any reference to this phenomenon, or a\ndefinite statement of the position the new organ intends to adopt on this question. Not\na word is said about theoretical work and the urgent tasks that now confront it, either in\nthis programme or in the supplements to it that were adopted by the Third Congress of the\nUnion Abroad in  (Two Conferences, pp. -). During this entire time the Editorial\nBoard of Rabocheye Dyelo ignored theoretical questions, in spite of the fact that these were\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nquestions that disturbed the minds of all Social-Democrats the world over.\nThe other announcement, on the contrary, points first of all to the declining interest in\ntheory in recent years, imperatively demands \u201cvigilant attention to the theoretical aspect of\nthe revolutionary movement of the proletariat\u201d, and calls for \u201cruthless criticism of the Bernsteinian and other anti-revolutionary tendencies\u201d in our movement. The issues of Zarya to\ndate show how this programme has been carried out.\nThus, we see that high-sounding phrases against the ossification of thought, etc., conceal\nunconcern and helplessness with regard to the development of theoretical thought. The case\nof the Russian Social-Democrats manifestly illustrates the general European phenomenon\n(long ago noted also by the German Marxists) that the much vaunted freedom of criticism\ndoes not imply substitution of one theory for another, but freedom from all integral and\npondered theory; it implies eclecticism and lack of principle. Those who have the slightest\nacquaintance with the actual state of our movement cannot but see that the wide spread of\nMarxism was accompanied by a certain lowering of the theoretical level. Quite a number\nof people with very little, and even a total lack of theoretical training joined the movement\nbecause of its practical significance and its practical successes. We can judge from that\nhow tactless Rabocheye Dyelo is when, with an air of triumph, it quotes Marx\u2019s statement:\n\u201cEvery step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes. \u201d To repeat\nthese words in a period of theoretical disorder is like wishing mourners at a funeral many\nhappy returns of the day. Moreover, these words of Marx are taken from his letter on\nthe Gotha Programme, in which hesharply condemns eclecticism in the formulation of\nprinciples. If you must unite, Marx wrote to the party leaders, then enter into agreements to\nsatisfy the practical aims of the movement, but do not allow any bargaining over principles,\ndo not make theoretical \u201cconcessions\u201d. This was Marx\u2019s idea, and yet there are people\namong us who seek-in his name to belittle the significance of theory!\nWithout revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement. This idea cannot\nbe insisted upon too strongly at a time when the fashionable preaching of opportunism goes\nhand in hand with an infatuation for the narrowest forms of practical activity. Yet, for Russian Social-Democrats the importance of theory is enhanced by three other circumstances,\nwhich are often forgotten: first, by the fact that our Party is only in process of formation,\nits features are only just becoming defined, and it has as yet far from settled accounts with\nthe other trends of revolutionary thought that threaten to divert the movement from the\ncorrect path. On the contrary, precisely the very recent past was marked by a revival of\nnon-Social-Democratic revolutionary trends (an eventuation regarding which Axelrod long\nago warned the Economists). Under these circumstances, what at first sight appears to be\nan \u201cunimportant\u201d error may lead to most deplorable consequences, and only short-sighted\npeople can consider factional disputes and a strict differentiation between shades of opinion\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\ninopportune or superfluous. The fate of Russian Social-Democracy for very many years to\ncome may depend on the strengthening of one or the other \u201cshade\u201d.\nSecondly, the Social-Democratic movement is in its very essence an international movement. This means, not only that we must combat national chauvinism, but that an incipient\nmovement in a young country can be successful only if it makes use of the experiences\nof other countries. In order to make use of these experiences it is not enough merely to\nbe acquainted with them, or simply to copy out the latest resolutions. What is required\nis the ability to treat these experiences critically and to test them independently. He who\nrealises how enormously the modern working-class movement has grown and branched out\nwill understand what a reserve of theoretical forces and political (as well as revolutionary)\nexperience is required to carry out this task.\nThirdly, the national tasks of Russian Social-Democracy are such as have never confronted any other socialist party in the world. We shall have occasion further on to deal\nwith the political and organisational duties which the task of emancipating the whole people from the yoke of autocracy imposes upon us. At this point, we wish to state only that\nthe role of vanguard fighter can be fulfilled only by a party that is guided by the most\nadvanced theory. To have a concrete understanding of what this means, let the reader recall such predecessors of Russian Social Democracy as Herzen, Belinsky, Chernyshevsky,\nand the brilliant galaxy of revolutionaries of the seventies; let him ponder over the world\nsignificance which Russian literature is now acquiring; let him. . . but be that enough!\nLet us quote what Engels said in  concerning the significance of theory in the\nSocial-Democratic movement. Engels recognizes, not two forms of the great struggle of\nSocial Democracy (political and economic), as is the fashion among us, but three, placing\nthe theoretical struggle on a par with the first two. His recommendations to the German\nworking-class movement, which had become strong, practically and politically, are so instructive from the standpoint of present-day problems and controversies, that we hope the\nreader will not be vexed with us for quoting a long passage from his prefatory note to Der\ndeutsche Bauernkrieg,\n which has long become a great bibliographical rarity:\n\u201cThe German workers have two important advantages over those of the rest of Europe.\nFirst, they belong to the most theoretical people of Europe; and they have retained that sense\nof theory which the so-called \u2019educated\u2019 classes of Germany have almost completely lost.\nWithout German philosophy, which preceded it, particularly that of Hegel, German scientific socialism \u2013 the only scientific socialism that has ever existed \u2013 would never have come\ninto being. Without a sense of theory among the workers, this scientific socialism would\nnever have entered their flesh and blood as much as is the case. What an immeasurable\nadvantage this is may be seen, on the one hand, from the indifference towards all theory,\nwhich is one of the main reasons why the English working-class movement crawls along\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nso slowly in spite of the splendid organisation of the individual unions; on the other hand,\nfrom the mischief and confusion wrought by Proudhonism, in its original form, among the\nFrench and Belgians, and, in the form further caricatured by Bakunin, among the Spaniards\nand Italians.\n\u201dThe second advantage is that, chronologically speaking, the Germans were about the\nlast to come into the workers\u2019 movement. Just as German theoretical socialism will never\nforget that it rests on the shoulders of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen \u2013 three men who,\nin spite of all their fantastic notions and all their utopianism, have their place among the\nmost eminent thinkers of all times, and whose genius anticipated innumerable things, the\ncorrectness of which is now being scientifically proved by us \u2013 so the practical workers\u2019\nmovement in Germany ought never to forget that it has developed on the shoulders of the\nEnglish and French movements, that it was able simply to utilise their dearly bought experience, and could now avoid their mistakes, which in their time were mostly unavoidable.\nWithout the precedent of the English trade unions and French workers\u2019 political struggles,\nwithout the gigantic impulse given especially by the Paris Commune, where would we be\nnow?\n\u201cIt must be said to the credit of the German workers that they have exploited the advantages of their situation with rare understanding. For the first time since a workers\u2019\nmovement has existed, the struggle is being conducted pursuant to its three sides \u2013 the.\ntheoretical, the political, and the practical-economic (resistance to the capitalists) \u2013 in harmony and in its interconnections, and in a systematic way. It is precisely in this, as it were,\nconcentric attack, that the strength and invincibility of the German movement lies.\n\u201dDue to this advantageous situation, on the one hand, and to the insular peculiarities of\nthe English and the forcible suppression of the French movement, on the other, the German\nworkers have for the moment been placed in the vanguard of the proletarian struggle. How\nlong events will allow them to occupy this post of honour cannot be foretold. But let us\nhope that as long as they occupy it, they will fill it fittingly. This demands redoubled efforts\nin every field of struggle and agitation. In particular, it will be the duty of the leaders to gain\nan ever clearer insight into all theoretical questions, to free themselves more and more from\nthe influence of traditional phrases inherited from the old world outlook, and constantly to\nkeep in mind that socialism, since it has become a science, demands that it be pursued as\na science, i.e., that it be studied. The task will be to spread with increased zeal among the\nmasses of the workers the ever more clarified understanding thus acquired, to knit together\never more firmly the organisation both of the party and of the trade unions....\n\u201cIf the German workers progress in this way, they will not. be marching exactly at the\nhead of the movement \u2013 it is not at all in the interest of this movement that the workers\nof any particular country should march at its head \u2013 but they will occupy an honourable\n DOGMATISM AND \u201cFREEDOM OF CRITICISM\nplace in the battle line; and they will stand armed for battle when either unexpectedly grave\ntrials or momentous events demand of them increased courage, increased determination\nand energy.\u201d\nEngels\u2019s words proved prophetic. Within a few years the German workers were subjected to unexpectedly grave trials in the form of the Exceptional Law Against the Socialists. And they met those trials armed for battle and succeeded in emerging from them\nvictorious.\nThe Russian proletariat will have to undergo trials immeasurably graver; it will have to\nfight a monster compared with which an antisocialist law in a constitutional country seems\nbut a dwarf. History has now confronted us with an immediate task which is the most\nrevolutionary of all the immediate tasks confronting the proletariat of any country. The\nfulfilment of this task, the destruction of the most powerful bulwark, not only of European,\nbut (it may now be said) of Asiatic reaction, would make the Russian proletariat the vanguard of the international revolutionary proletariat. And we have the right to count upon\nacquiring this honourable title, already earned by our predecessors, the revolutionaries of\nthe seventies, if we succeed in inspiring our movement, which is a thousand times broader\nand deeper, with the same devoted determination and vigour.\nCHAPTER \nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES\nAND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nWe have said that our movement, much more extensive and deep than the movement of the\nseventies, must be inspired with the same devoted determination and energy that inspired\nthe movement at that time. Indeed, no one, we think, has until now doubted that the strength\nof the present-day movement lies in the awakening of the masses (principally, the industrial\nproletariat) and that its weakness lies in the lack of consciousness and initiative among the\nrevolutionary leaders.\nHowever, of late a staggering discovery has been made, which threatens to disestablish\nall hitherto prevailing views on this question. This discovery was made by Rabocheye\nDyelo, which in its polemic with Iskra and Zarya did not confine itself to making objections\non separate points, but tried to ascribe \u201cgeneral disagreements\u201d to a more profound cause\n\u2013 to the \u201cdifferent appraisals of the relative importance of the spontaneous and consciously\n\u2019methodical\u2019 element\u201d. Rabocheye Dyelo formulated its indictment as a \u201cbelittling of the\nsignificance of the objective or the spontaneous element of development\u201d.\n To this we say:\nHad the polemics with Iskra and Zarya resulted in nothing more than causing Rabocheye\nDyelo to hit upon these \u201cgeneral disagreements\u201d, that alone would give us considerable\nsatisfaction, so significant is this thesis and so clear is the light it sheds on the quintessence\nof the present-day theoretical and political differences that exist among Russian SocialDemocrats.\nFor this reason the question of the relation between consciousness and spontaneity is of\nsuch enormous general interest, and for this reason the question must be dealt with in great\n\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\ndetail.\n.. THE BEGINNING OF THE SPONTANEOUS UPSURGE\nIn the previous chapter we pointed out how universally absorbed the educated youth of\nRussia was in the theories of Marxism in the middle of the nineties. In the same period the\nstrikes that followed the famous St. Petersburg industrial war of  assumed a similar\ngeneral character. Their spread over the whole of Russia clearly showed the depth of the\nnewly awakening popular movement, and if we are to speak of the \u201cspontaneous element\u201d\nthen, of course, it is this strike movement which, first and foremost, must be regarded as\nspontaneous. But there is spontaneity and spontaneity. Strikes occurred in Russia in the\nseventies and sixties (and even in the first half of the nineteenth century), and they were\naccompanied by the \u201cspontaneous\u201d destruction of machinery, etc. Compared with these\n\u201crevolts\u201d, the strikes of the nineties might even be described as \u201cconscious\u201d, to such an\nextent do they mark the progress which the working-class movement made in that period.\nThis shows that the \u201cspontaneous element\u201d, in essence, represents nothing more nor less\nthan. consciousness in an embryonic form. Even the primitive revolts expressed the awakening of consciousness to a certain extent. The workers were losing their age-long faith in\nthe permanence of the system which oppressed them and began... I shall not say to understand, but to sense the necessity for collective resistance, definitely abandoning their slavish\nsubmission to the authorities. But this was, nevertheless, more in the nature of outbursts of\ndesperation and vengeance than of struggle. The strikes of the nineties revealed far greater\nflashes of consciousness; definite demands were advanced, the strike was carefully timed,\nknown cases and instances in other places were discussed, etc. The revolts were simply the\nresistance of the oppressed, whereas the systematic strikes represented the class struggle in\nembryo, but only in embryo. Taken by themselves, these strikes were simply trade union\nstruggles, not yet Social Democratic struggles. They marked the awakening antagonisms\nbetween workers and employers; but the workers, were not, and could not be, conscious\nof the irreconcilable antagonism of their interests to the whole of the modern political and\nsocial system, i.e., theirs was not yet Social-Democratic consciousness. In this sense, the\nstrikes of the nineties, despite the enormous progress they represented as compared with\nthe \u201crevolts\u2019, remained a purely spontaneous movement.\nWe have said that there could not have been Social-Democratic consciousness among\nthe workers. It would have to be brought to them from without. The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only\ntrade union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions,\nfight the employers, and strive to compel the government to pass necessary labour legis-\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nlation, etc. The theory of socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical,\nand economic theories elaborated by educated representatives of the propertied classes,\nby intellectuals. By their social status the founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx\nand Engels, themselves belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia. In the very same way, in\nRussia, the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose altogether independently of the\nspontaneous growth of the working-class movement; it arose as a natural and inevitable\noutcome of the development of thought among the revolutionary socialist intelligentsia.\nIn the period under discussion, the middle nineties, this doctrine not only represented the\ncompletely formulated programme of the Emancipation of Labour group, but had already\nwon over to its side the majority of the revolutionary youth in Russia.\nHence, we had both the spontaneous awakening of the working masses, their awakening\nto conscious life and conscious struggle, and a revolutionary youth, armed with SocialDemocratic theory and straining towards the workers. In this connection it is particularly\nimportant to state the oft-forgotten (and comparatively little-known) fact that, although\nthe early Social-Democrats of that period zealously carried on economic agitation (being\nguided in this activity by the truly useful indications contained in the pamphlet On Agitation, then still in manuscript), they did not regard this as their sole task. On the contrary,\nfrom the very beginning they set for Russian Social-Democracy the most far-reaching historical tasks, in general, and the task of overthrowing the autocracy, in particular. Thus,\ntowards the end of , the St. Petersburg group of Social-Democrats, which founded\nthe League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, prepared the first issue\nof a newspaper called Rabocheye Dyelo. This issue was ready to go to press when it was\nseized by the gendarmes, on the night of December , , in a raid on the house of one\nof the members of the group, Anatoly Alexeyevich Vaneyey, so that the first edition of\nRabocheye Dyelo was not destined to see the light of day. The leading article in this issue (which perhaps thirty years hence some Russkaya Starina will unearth in the archives\nof the Department of Police) outlined the historical tasks of the working class in Russia\nand placed the achievement of political liberty at their head. The issue also contained an\narticle entitled \u201dWhat Are Our Ministers Thinking About\u00bf\u2018 which dealt with the crushing of the elementary education committees by the police. In addition, there was some\ncorrespondence from St. Petersburg, and from other parts of Russia (e.g., a letter on the\nmassacre of the workers in Yaroslavl Gubernia). This, \u201dfirst effort\u201c, if we are not mistaken, of the Russian Social-Democrats of the nineties was not a purely local, or less still,\n\u201dEconomic\u201c, newspaper, but one that aimed to unite the strike movement with the revolutionary movement against the autocracy, and to win over to the side of Social-Democracy\nall who were oppressed by the policy of reactionary obscurantism. No one in the slightest degree acquainted with the state of the movement at that period could doubt that such\na paper would have met with warm response among the workers of the capital and the\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nrevolutionary intelligentsia and would have had a wide circulation. The failure of the enterprise merely showed that the Social-Democrats of that period were unable to meet the\nimmediate requirements of the time owing to their lack of revolutionary experience and\npractical training. This must be said, too, with regard to the S. Peterburgsky Rabochy Listok and particularly with regard to Rabochaya Gazeta and the Manifesto of the Russian\nSocial-Democratic Labour Party, founded in the spring of . Of course, we would not\ndream of blaming the Social Democrats of that time for this unpreparedness. But in order to profit from the experience of that movement, and to draw practical lessons from it,\nwe must thoroughly understand the causes and significance of this or that shortcoming. It\nis therefore highly important to establish the fact that a part (perhaps even a majority) of\nthe Social-Democrats, active in the period of -, justly considered it possible even\nthen, at the very beginning of the \u201dspontaneous\u201c movement, to come forward with a most\nextensive programme and a militant tactical line. Lack of training of the majority of\nthe revolutionaries, an entirely natural phenomenon, could not have roused any particular\nfears. Once the tasks were correctly defined, once the energy existed for repeated attempts\nto fulfil them, temporary failures represented only part misfortune. Revolutionary experience and organisational skill are things that can be acquired, provided the desire is there to\nacquire them, provided the shortcomings are recognised, which in revolutionary activity is\nmore than half-way towards their removal.\nBut what was only part misfortune became full misfortune when this consciousness\nbegan to grow dim (it was very much alive among the members of the groups mentioned),\nwhen there appeared people \u2013 and even Social -Democratic organs \u2013 that were prepared to\nregard shortcomings as virtues, that even tried to invent a theoretical basis for their slavish\ncringing before spontaneity. It is time to draw conclusions from this trend, the content of\nwhich is incorrectly and too narrowly characterised as Economism.\n.. BOWING TO SPONTANEITY. RABOCHAYA MYSL\nBefore dealing with the literary manifestation of this subservience to spontaneity, we should\nlike to note the following characteristic fact (communicated to us from the above-mentioned\nsource), which throws light on the conditions in which the two future conflicting trends in\nRussian Social-Democracy arose and grew among the comrades working in St. Petersburg.\nIn the beginning of , just prior to their banishment, A. A. Vaneyev and several of his\ncomrades attended a private meeting at which \u201dold\u201c and \u201dyoung members of the League\nof\u2019 Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class gathered. The conversation centred chiefly about the question of organisation, particularly about the \u201crules for the workers\u2019\nmutual benefit fund\u201d, which, in their final form, were published in \u201cListok\u201d Rabotnika, No.\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\n-, p. . Sharp differences immediately showed themselves between the \u201cold\u201d members\n(\u201cDecembrists\u201d, as the St. Petersburg Social Democrats jestingly called them) and several\nthe \u201cyoung\u201d members (who subsequently took an active part in the work of Rabochaya\nMysl), with a heated discussion ensuing. The \u201cyoung\u201d members defended the main principles of the rules in the form in which they were published. The \u201cold\u201d members contended\nthat the prime necessity was not this, but the consolidation of the League of Struggle into\nan organisation of revolutionaries to which all the various workers\u2019 mutual benefit funds,\nstudents\u2019 propaganda circles, etc., should be subordinated. It goes without saying that the\ndisputing sides far from realised at the time that these disagreements were the beginning\nof a cleavage; on the contrary, they regarded them as something isolated and casual. But\nthis fact shows that in Russia, too, Economism did not arise and spread without a struggle against the \u201cold\u201d Social-Democrats (which the Economists of today are apt to forget).\nAnd if, in the main, this struggle has not left \u201cdocumentary\u201d traces behind it, it is solely\nbecause the membership of the circles then functioning underwent such constant change\nthat no continuity was established and, consequently, differences in point of view were not\nrecorded in any documents.\nThe founding of Rabochaya Mysl brought Economism to the light of day, but not at\none stroke. We must picture to ourselves concretely the conditions for activity and the\nshort-lived character of the majority of the Russian study circles (a thing that is possible\nonly for those who have themselves experienced it) in order to understand how much there\nwas of the fortuitous in the successes and failures of the new trend in various towns, and\nthe length of time during which neither the advocates nor the opponents of the \u201cnew\u201d\ncould make up their minds \u2013 and literally had no opportunity of so doing \u2013 as to whether\nthis really expressed a distinct trend or merely the lack of training of certain individuals.\nFor example, the first mimeographed copies of Rabochaya Mysl never reached the great\nmajority of Social-Democrats, and if we are able to refer to the leading article in the first\nnumber, it is only because it was reproduced in an article by V. I. (\u201cListok\u201d Rabotnika, No.\n-, p. , et seq.), who, of course, did not fail to extol with more zeal than reason the new\npaper, which was so different from the papers and projects for papers mentioned above.\nIt is well worth dwelling on this leading article because it brings out in bold relief the entire\nspirit of Rabochaya Mysl and Economism generally.\nAfter stating that the arm of the \u201cblue-coats\u201d could never halt the progress of the workingclass movement, the leading article goes on to say: \u201c. . . The virility of the working-class\nmovement is due to the fact that the workers themselves are at last taking their fate into their\nown hands, and out of the hands of the leaders\u201d; this fundamental thesis is then developed\nin greater detail. Actually, the leaders (i.e.,. the Social-Democrats, the organisers of the\nLeague of Struggle) were, one might say, torn out of the hands of the workers by the police; yet it is made to appear that the workers were fighting against the leaders and liberated\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nthemselves from their yoke! Instead of sounding the call to go forward towards the consolidation of the revolutionary organisation and the expansion of political activity, the call was\nissued for a retreat to the purely trade union struggle. It was announced that \u201cthe economic\nbasis of the movement is eclipsed by the effort never to forget the political ideal\u201d, and that\nthe watchword for the working-class movement was \u201cStruggle for economic conditions\u201d\n(!) or, better still, \u201cThe workers for the workers\u201d. It was declared that strike funds \u201care\nmore valuable to the movement than a hundred other Organisations\u201d (compare this statement made in October , with the polemic between the \u201cDecembrists\u201d and the young\nmembers in the beginning of ), etc. Catchwords like \u201cWe must concentrate, not on the\n\u2019cream\u2019 of the workers, but on the \u2019average\u2019, mass worker\u201d; \u201cPolitics always obediently\nfollows economics\u201d, etc., etc., became the fashion, exercising an irresistible influence\nupon the masses of the youth who were attracted to the movement but who, in the majority of cases, were acquainted only with such fragments of Marxism as were expounded in\nlegally appearing publications.\nPolitical consciousness was completely overwhelmed by spontaneity \u2013 the spontaneity\nof the \u201cSocial-Democrats\u201d who repeated Mr. V. V.\u2019s \u201cideas\u201d, the spontaneity of those workers who were carried away by the arguments that a kopek added to a ruble was worth more\nthan any socialism or politics, and that they must \u201cfight, knowing that they are fighting,\nnot for the sake of some future generation, but for themselves and their children\u201d (leader\nin Rabochaya Mysl, No. ). Phrases like these have always been a favourite weapon of\nthe West-European bourgeois, who, in their hatred for socialism, strove (like the German\n\u201cSozial-Politiker\u201d Hirsch) to transplant English trade-unionism to their native soil and to\npreach to the workers that by engaging in the purely trade union struggle they would be\nfighting for themselves and for their children, and not for some future generations with\nsome future socialism. And now the \u201cV. V.s of Russian Social-Democracy\u201d have set about\nrepeating these bourgeois phrases. It is important at this point to note three circumstances\nthat will be useful to our further analysis of contemporary differences.\nIn the first place, the overwhelming of political consciousness by spontaneity, to which\nwe referred above, also took place spontaneously. This may sound like a pun, but, alas,\nit is the bitter truth. It did not take place as a result of an open struggle between two\ndiametrically opposed points of view, in which one triumphed over the other; it occurred\nbecause of the fact that an increasing number of \u201cold\u201d revolutionaries were \u201ctorn away\u201d by\nthe gendarmes and increasing numbers of \u201cyoung\u201d \u201cV. V.s of Russian Social Democracy\u201d\nappeared on the scene. Everyone, who has, I shall not say participated in, but at least\nbreathed the atmosphere of, the present-day Russian movement, knows perfectly well that\nthis is precisely the case. And if, nevertheless, we insist strongly that the reader be fully\nclear on this generally known fact, if we cite, for explicitness, as it were, the facts of the\nfirst edition of Rabocheye Dyelo and of the polemic between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cyoung\u201d\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nat the beginning of , we do this because the people who vaunt their \u201cdemocracy\u201d\nspeculate on the ignorance of these facts on the part of the broad public (or of the very\nyoung generation). We shall return to this point further on.\nSecondly, in the very first literary expression of Economism we observe the exceedingly\ncurious phenomenon \u2013 highly characteristic for an understanding of all the differences prevailing among presentday Social Democrats \u2013 that the adherents of the \u201clabour movement\npure and simple\u201d, worshippers of the closest \u201corganic\u201d contacts (Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s term)\nwith the proletarian struggle, opponents of any non-worker intelligentsia (even a socialist\nintelligentsia), are compelled, in order to defend their positions, to resort to the arguments\nof the bourgeois \u201cpure trade-unionists\u201d. This shows that from the very outset Rabochaya\nMysl began \u2013 unconsciously \u2013 to implement the programme of the Credo. This shows\n(something Rabocheye Dyelo cannot grasp) that all worship of the spontaneity of the working class movement, all belittling of the role of \u201cthe conscious element\u201d, of the role of\nSocial-Democracy, means, quite independently of whether he who belittles that role desires\nit or not, a strengthening of the influence of bourgeois ideology upon the workers. All those\nwho talk about \u201coverrating the importance of ideology\u201d, about exaggerating the role of\nthe conscious element, etc., imagine that the labour movement pure and simple can elaborate, and will elaborate, an independent ideology for itself, if only the workers \u201cwrest their\nfate from the hands of the leaders\u201d. But this is a profound mistake. To supplement what\nhas been said above, we shall quote the following profoundly true and important words of\nKarl. Kautsky on the new draft programme of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party.\n\u201cMany of our revisionist critics believe that Marx asserted that economic development\nand the class struggle create, not only the conditions for socialist production, but also,\nand directly, the consciousness [K. K.\u2019s italics] of its necessity. And these critics assert\nthat England, the country most highly developed capitalistically, is more remote than any\nother from this consciousness Judging by the draft, one might assume that this allegedly\northodox Marxist view, which is thus refuted, was shared by the committee that drafted\nthe Austrian programme. In the draft programme it is stated: \u2019The more capitalist development increases the numbers of the proletariat, the more the proletariat is compelled and\nbecomes fit to fight against capitalism. The proletariat becomes conscious of the possibility and of the necessity for socialism. In this connection socialist consciousness appears\nto be a necessary and direct result of the proletarian class struggle. But this is absolutely\nuntrue. Of course, socialism, as a doctrine, has its roots in modern economic relationships\njust as the class struggle of the proletariat has, and, like the latter, emerges from the struggle against the capitalist-created poverty and misery of the masses. But socialism and the\nclass struggle arise side by side and not one out of the other; each arises under different\nconditions. Modern socialist consciousness can arise only on the basis of profound scientific knowledge. Indeed, modern economic science is as much a condition for socialist\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nproduction as, say, modern technology, and the proletariat can create neither the one nor\nthe other, no matter how much it may desire to do so; both arise out of the modern social\nprocess. The vehicle of science is not the proletariat, but the bourgeois intelligentsia [K.\nK.\u2019s italics]: it was in the minds of individual members of this stratum that modern socialism originated, and it was they who communicated it to the more intellectually developed\nproletarians who, in their turn, introduce it into the proletarian class struggle where conditions allow that to be done. Thus, socialist consciousness is something introduced into the\nproletarian class struggle from without [von Aussen Hineingetragenes] and not something\nthat arose within it spontaneously [urwuchsig \u00a8 ]. Accordingly, the old Hainfeld programme\nquite rightly stated that the task of Social-Democracy is to imbue the proletariat (literally:\nsaturate the proletariat) with the consciousness of its position and the consciousness of its\ntask. There would be no need for this if consciousness arose of itself from the class struggle. The new draft copied this proposition from the old programme, and attached it to the\nproposition mentioned above. But this completely broke the. line of thought...\u201d\nSince there can be no talk of an independent ideology formulated by the working masses\nthemselves in the process of their movement, the only choice is \u2013 either bourgeois or\nsocialist ideology. There is no middle course (for mankind has not created a \u201cthird\u201d ideology, and, moreover, in a society torn by class antagonisms there can never be a non-class\nor an above-class ideology). Hence, to belittle the socialist ideology in any way, to turn\naside from it in the slightest degree means to strengthen bourgeois ideology. There is\nmuch talk of spontaneity. But the spontaneous development of the working-class movement leads to its subordination to bourgeois ideology, to its development along the lines\nof the Credo programme; for the spontaneous working-class movement is trade-unionism,\nis Nur-Gewerkschaftlerei, and trade unionism means the ideological enslavement of the\nworkers by the bourgeoisie. Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is to combat\nspontaneity, to divert the working-class movement from this spontaneous, trade-unionist\nstriving to come under the wing of the bourgeoisie, and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social Democracy. The sentence employed by the authors of the Economist letter\npublished in Iskra, No. , that the efforts of the most inspired ideologists fail to divert the\nworking-class movement from the path that is determined by the interaction of the material\nelements and the material environment is therefore tantamount to renouncing socialism.\nIf these authors were capable of fearlessly, consistently, and thoroughly considering what\nthey say, as everyone who enters the arena of literary and public activity should be, there\nwould be nothing left for them but to \u201cfold their useless arms over their empty breasts\u201d\nand surrender the field of action to the Struves and Prokopoviches, who are dragging the\nworking-class movement \u201calong the line of least resistance\u201d, i.e., along the line of bourgeois trade-unionism, or to the Zubatovs, who are dragging it along the line of clerical and\ngendarme \u201cideology\u201d.\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nLet us recall the example of Germany. What was the historic service Lassalle rendered to the German working-class movement? It was that he diverted that movement from\nthe path of progressionist trade-unionism and co-operativism towards which it had been\nspontaneously moving (with the benign assistance of Schulze-Delitzsch and his like). To\nfulfil such a task it was necessary to do something quite different from talking of underrating the spontaneous element, of tactics-as-process, of the interaction between elements\nand environment, etc. A fierce struggle against spontaneity was necessary, and only after\nsuch a struggle, extending over many years, was it possible, for instance, to convert the\nworking population of Berlin from a bulwark of the progressionist party into one of the\nfinest strongholds of Social-Democracy. This struggle is by no means over even today (as\nmight seem to those who learn the history of the German movement from Prokopovich,\nand its philosophy from Struve). Even now the German working class is, so to speak,\nsplit up among a number of ideologies. A section of the workers is organised in Catholic\nand monarchist trade unions; another section is organised in the Hirsch-Duricker unions,\nfounded by the bourgeois worshippers of English trade-unionism; the third is organised in\nSocial-Democratic trade unions. The last-named group is immeasurably more numerous\nthan the rest, but the Social-Democratic ideology was able to achieve this superiority, and\nwill be able to maintain it, only in an unswerving struggle against all other ideologies.\nBut why, the reader will ask, does the spontaneous movement, the movement along the\nline of least resistance, lead to the domination of bourgeois ideology? For the simple reason\nthat bourgeois ideology is far older in origin than socialist ideology, that it is more fully\ndeveloped, and that it has at its disposal immeasurably more means of dissemination.\nAnd the younger the socialist movement in any given country, the more vigorously it must\nstruggle against all attempts to entrench non-socialist ideology, and the more resolutely\nthe workers must be warned against the bad counsellors who shout against \u201coverrating the\nconscious element\u201d, etc. The authors of the Economist letter, in unison with Rabocheye\nDyelo, inveigh against the intolerance that is characteristic of the infancy of the movement.\nTo this we reply: Yes, our movement is indeed in its infancy, and in order that it may grow\nup faster, it must become imbued with intolerance against those who retard its growth by\ntheir subservience to spontaneity. Nothing is so ridiculous and harmful as pretending that\nwe are \u201cold hands\u201d who have long ago experienced all the decisive stages of the struggle.\nThirdly, the first issue of Rabochaya MysI shows that the term \u201cEconomism\u201d (which,\nof course, we do not propose to abandon, since, in one way or another, this designation\nhas already established itself) does not adequately convey the real character of the new\ntrend. Rabochaya Mysl does not altogether repudiate the political struggle; the rules for a\nworkers\u2019 mutual benefit fund published in its first issue contain a reference to combating\nthe government. Rabochaya Mysl believes, however, that \u201cpolitics always obediently follows economics\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo varies this thesis when it asserts in its programme that\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\n\u201cin Russia more than in any other country, the economic struggle is inseparable from the\npolitical struggle\u201d). If by politics is meant Social-Democratic politics, then the theses of\nRabochaya MysI and Rabocheye Dyelo are utterly incorrect. The economic struggle of the\nworkers is very often connected (although not inseparably) with bourgeois politics, clerical\npolitics, etc., as we have seen. Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s theses are correct, if by politics is meant\ntrade union politics, viz., the common striving of all workers to secure from the government\nmeasures for alleviating the distress to which their condition gives rise, but which do not\nabolish that condition, i.e., which do not remove the subjection of labour to capital. That\nstriving indeed is common to the English trade-unionists, who are hostile to socialism, to\nthe Catholic workers, to the \u201cZubatov\u201d workers, etc. There is politics and politics. Thus,\nwe see that Rabochaya Mysl does not so much deny the political struggle, as it bows to its\nspontaneity, to its unconsciousness. While fully recognising the political struggle (better:\nthe political desires and demands of the workers), which arises spontaneously from the\nworking-class movement itself, it absolutely refuses independently to work out a specifically Social-Democratic politics corresponding to the general tasks of socialism and to\npresent-day conditions in Russia. Further on we shall show that Rabocheye Dyelo commits\nthe same error.\n.. THE SELF-EMANCIPATION GROUP AND RABOCHEYE\nDYELO\nWe have dealt at such length with the little-known and now almost forgotten leading article\nin the first issue of Rabochaya MysI because it was the first and most striking expression of\nthat general stream of thought which afterwards emerged into the light of day in innumerable streamlets. V. I. was perfectly right when, in praising the first issue and the leading\narticle of Rabochaya Mysl, he said that the article had been written in a \u201csharp and fervent\u201d\nmanner (\u201cListok\u201d Rabotnika, No. -, p. ). Every man with convictions who thinks\nhe has something new to say writes \u201cfervently\u201d and in such a way as to make his views\nstand out in bold relief. Only those who are accustomed to sitting between two stools lack\n\u201cfervour\u201d; only such people are able to praise the fervour of Rabochaya Mysl one day and\nattack the \u201cfervent polemics\u201d of its opponents the next.\nWe shall not dwell on the \u201cSeparate Supplement\u201d to Rabochaya Mysl (below we shall\nhave occasion, on various points, to refer to this work, which expresses the ideas of the\nEconomists more consistently than any other) but shall briefly mention the \u201cAppeal of the\nSelf -Emancipation of the Workers Group\u201d (March , reprinted in the London Nakanune, No. , July ). The authors of the \u201cAppeal\u201d rightly say that \u201cthe workers of\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nRussia are only just awakening, are just beginning to look about them, and are instinctively\nclutching at the first available means of struggle\u201d. Yet they draw from this the same false\nconclusion as that drawn by Rabochaya MysI, forgetting that the instinctive is the unconscious (the spontaneous) to the aid of which socialists must come; that the \u201cfirst available\nmeans of struggle\u201d will always be, in modern society, the trade union means of struggle,\nand the \u201cfirst available\u201d ideology the bourgeois (trade union) ideology. Similarly, these\nauthors do not \u201crepudiate\u201d politics, they merely (merely!) echo Mr. V. V. that politics is the\nsuperstructure, and therefore, \u201cpolitical agitation must be the superstructure to the agitation\ncarried on in favour of the economic struggle; it must arise on the basis of this struggle and\nfollow in its wake\u201d.\nAs for Rabocheye Dyelo, it began its activity with the \u201cdefence\u201d of the Economists. It\nstated a downright untruth in its opening issue (No. , pp. -) in claiming that it \u201cdoes\nnot know to which young comrades Axelrod referred\u201d when he warned the Economists in\nhis well-known pamphlet. In the polemic that flared up with Axelrod and Plekhanov over\nthis untruth, Rabocheye Dyelo had to admit that \u201cin form of perplexity, it sought to defend\nall the younger Social-Democrats abroad from this unjust accusation\u201d (the charge of narrowness levelled by Axelrod at the Economists). In reality this accusation was completely\njustified, and Rabocheye Dyelo knew perfectly well that, among others, it applied also to\nV. I., a member of its Editorial Board. Let me note in passing that in this polemic Axelrod\nwas entirely right and Rabocheye Dyelo entirely wrong in their respective interpretations of\nmy pamphlet The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats.\n The pamphlet was written in\n, before the appearance of Rabochaya MysI, when I thought, rightly, that the original\ntendency of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle, which I characterised above, was dominant. And this tendency was dominant at least until the middle of . Consequently,\nRabocheye Dyelo had no right whatever, in its attempt to deny the existence and danger of\nEconomism, to refer to a pamphlet that expressed views forced out by Economist views in\nSt. Petersburg in -.\nBut Rabocheye Dyelo not only \u201cdefended\u201d the Economists, it itself constantly fell into\ntheir fundamental errors. The source of this confusion is to be found in the ambiguity of\nthe interpretation given to the following thesis of the Rabocheye Dyelo programme: \u201cWe\nconsider that the most important phenomenon of Russian life, the one that will mainly determine the tasks [our italics] and the character of the publication activity of the Union, is\nthe mass working-class movement [Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s italics] which has arisen in recent\nyears.\u201d That the mass movement is a most important phenomenon is a fact not to be disputed. But the crux of the matter is, how is one to understand the statement that the mass\nworking class movement will \u201cdetermine the tasks\u201d? It may be interpreted in one of two\nways. Either it means bowing to the spontaneity of this movement, i.e., reducing the role\nof Social-Democracy to mere subservience to the working-class movement as such (the\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\ninterpretation of Rabochaya Mysl, the Self -Emancipation Group, and other Economists),\nor it means that the mass movement places before us new theoretical, political, and organisational tasks, far more complicated than those that might have satisfied us in the period\nbefore the rise of the mass movement. Rabocheye Dyelo inclined and still inclines towards\nthe first interpretation, for it has said nothing definite about any new tasks, but has argued\nconstantly as though the \u201cmass movement\u201d relieves us of the necessity of clearly understanding and fulfilling the tasks it sets before us. We need only point out that Rabocheye\nDyelo considered that it was impossible to set the overthrow of the autocracy as the first\ntask of the mass working-class movement, and that it degraded this task (in the name of the\nmass movement) to that of a struggle for immediate political demands (Reply, p. ).\nWe shall pass over the article by B. Krichevsky, editor of Rabocheye Dyelo, entitled\n\u201cThe Economic and the Political Struggle in the Russian Movement\u201d, published in No.  of\nthat paper, in which these very mistakes are repeated, and proceed directly to Rabocheye\nDyelo, No. . We shall not, of course, enter in detail into the various objections raised\nby Krichevsky and Martynov against Zarya and Iskra. We are here interested solely in the\nbasis of principles on which Rabocheye Dyelo, in its tenth issue, took its stand. Thus, we\nshall not examine the strange fact that Rabocheye Dyelo saw a \u201cdiametrical contradiction\u201d\nbetween the proposition:\n\u201cSocial-Democracy does not, tie its hands, it does not restrict its activities to some one\npreconceived plan or method of political struggle; it recognises all means of struggle as\nlong as they correspond to the forces at-the disposal of the Party,\u201d etc. (Iskra, No. .)\nand the proposition:\n\u201cWithout a strong organisation skilled in waging political struggle under all circumstances and at all times, there can be no question of that systematic plan of action, illumined\nby firm principles and steadfastly carried out, which alone is worthy of the name of tactics\u201d\n(Iskra, No. ).\nTo confound recognition, in principle, of all means of struggle, of all plans and methods, provided they are expedient, with the demand at a given political moment to be guided\nby a strictly observed plan is tantamount, if we are to talk of tactics, to confounding the\nrecognition by medical science of various methods of treating diseases with the necessity\nfor adopting a certain definite method of treatment for a given disease. The point is, however, that Rabocheye Dyelo, itself the victim of a disease which we have called bowing to\nspontaneity, refuses to recognise any \u201cmethod of treatment\u201d for that disease. Hence, it has\nmade the remarkable discovery that \u201ctactics-as-plan contradicts the fundamental spirit of\nMarxism\u201d (No. , p. ), that tactics are \u201ca process of growth of Party tasks, which grow\ntogether with the Party\u201d (p. , Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s italics). This remark has every chance\nof becoming a celebrated maxim, a permanent monument to the Rabocheye Dyelo \u201ctrend\u201d.\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nTo the question, whither? the leading organ replies: Movement is a process of changing the\ndistance between the starting-point and subsequent points of the movement. This matchless\nexample of profundity is not merely a curiosity (were it that, it would not be worth dealing\nwith at length), but the programme of a whole trend, the very programme which R. M. (in\nthe \u201cSeparate Supplement\u201d to Rabochaya Mysl) expressed in the words: That struggle is\ndesirable which is possible, and the struggle which is possible is that which is going on at\nthe given moment. This is precisely the trend of unbounded opportunism, which passively\nadapts itself to spontaneity.\n\u201cTactics-as-plan contradicts the essence of Marxism!\u201d But this is a slander of Marxism;\nit means turning Marxism into the caricature held up by the Narodniks in their struggle\nagainst us. It means belittling the initiative and energy of class-conscious fighters, whereas\nMarxism, on the contrary, gives a gigantic impetus to the initiative and energy of the SocialDemocrat, opens up for him the widest perspectives, and (if one may so express it) places\nat his disposal the mighty force of many millions of workers \u201cspontaneously\u201d rising for the\nstruggle. The entire history of international Social-Democracy teems with plans advanced\nnow by one, now by another political leader, some confirming the far-sightedness and the\ncorrect political and organisational views of their authors and others revealing their shortsightedness and their political errors. At the time when Germany was at one of the crucial\nturning-points in its history \u2013 the formation of the Empire, the opening of the Reichstag,\nand the granting of universal suffrage \u2013 Liebknecht had one plan for Social-Democratic\npolitics and work in general, and Schweitzer had another. When the anti-socialist law came\ndown on the heads of the German socialists, Most and Hasselmann had one plan \u2013 they were\nprepared then and there to call for violence and terror; Hochbert, Schramm, and (partly)\nBernstein had another \u2013 they began to preach to the Social-Democrats that they themselves\nhad provoked the enactment of the law by being unreasonably bitter and revolutionary,\nand must now earn forgiveness by their exemplary conduct. There was yet a third plan,\nproposed by those who prepared and carried out the publication of an illegal organ. It is\neasy, of course, with hindsight, many years after the struggle over the selection of the path\nto be followed, and after history has pronounced its verdict as to the expediency of the path\nselected, to utter profound maxims about the growth of Party tasks, which grow together\nwith the Party. But at a time of confusion, when the Russian \u201cCritics\u201d and Economists\nare degrading Social-Democracy to the level of trade-unionism, and when the terrorists are\nstrongly advocating the adoption of \u201ctactics-as-plan\u201d that repeats the old mistakes, at such\na time, to confine oneself to profundities of this kind, means simply to issue to oneself a\n\u201ccertificate of poverty\u201d. At a time when many Russian Social-Democrats suffer from a lack\nof initiative and energy, from an inadequate \u201cscope of political propaganda, agitation, and\norganisation,\u201d from a lack of \u201cplans\u201d for a broader organisation of revolutionary work,\nat such a time, to declare that \u201ctactics-as-plan\u201d contradicts the essence of Marxism\u201c means\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nnot only to vulgarise Marxism in the realm of theory, butto drag the Party backward in\npractice.\nRabocheye Dyelo goes on to sermonise:\n\u201dThe task of the revolutionary Social-Democrat is only to accelerate objective development by his conscious work, not to obviate it or substitute his own subjective plans for this\ndevelopment. Iskra knows all this in theory; but the enormous importance which Marxism\njustly attaches to conscious revolutionary work causes it in practice, owing to its doctrinaire\nview of tactics, to belittle the significance of the objective or the spontaneous element of\ndevelopment\u201c (p. ).\nAnother example of the extraordinary theoretical confusion worthy of Mr. V. V. and his\nfraternity. We would ask our philosopher: how may a designer of subjective plans \u201dbelittle\u201c\nobjective development? Obviously by losing sight of the fact that this objective development creates or strengthens, destroys or weakens certain classes, strata, or groups, certain\nnations or groups of nations, etc., and in this way serves to determine a given international\npolitical alignment of forces, or the position adopted by revolutionary parties, etc. If the\ndesigner of plans did that, his guilt would not be that he belittled the spontaneous element,\nbut, on the contrary, that he belittled the conscious element, for he would then show that he\nlacked the \u201dconsciousness\u201c properly to understand objective development. Hence, the very\ntalk of \u201destimating the relative significance\u201c (Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s italics) of spontaneity and\nconsciousness itself reveals a complete lack of \u201dconsciousness\u201c. If certain \u201dspontaneous elements of development\u201c can be grasped at all by human understanding, then an incorrect\nestimation of them will be tantamount to \u201dbelittling the conscious element\u201c. But if they\ncannot be grasped, then we do not know them, and therefore cannot speak of them. What\nthen is Krichevsky discussing? If he thinks that Iskra\u2019s \u201dsubjective plans\u201c are erroneous (as\nhe in fact declares them to be), he should have shown what objective facts they ignore, and\nonly then charged Iskra with lacking political consciousness for ignoring them, with \u201dbelittling the conscious element\u201c, to use his own words. If, however, displeased with subjective\nplans, he can bring forward no argument other than that of \u201dbelittling the spontaneous element\u201c (!), he merely shows: () that, theoretically, he understands Marxism a la Kareyev\nand Mikhailovsky, who have been sufficiently ridiculed by Beltov; and () that, practically,\nhe is quite satisfied with the \u201dspontaneous elements of development\u201c that have drawn our\nlegal Marxists towards Bernsteinism and our Social-Democrats towards Economism, and\nthat he is \u201dfull of wrath\u201c against those who have determined at all costs to divert Russian\nSocial-Democracy from the path of \u201dspontaneous\u201c development.\nFurther, there follow things that are positively droll. \u201dJust as human beings will reproduce in the old-fashioned way despite all the discoveries of natural science, so the birth\nof a new social order will come about, in the future too, mainly as a result of elemental\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\noutbursts, despite all the discoveries of social science and the increase in the number of\nconscious fighters\u201c (p. ). Just as our grandfathers in their old-fashioned wisdom used to\nsay, Anyone can bring children into the world, so today the \u201dmodern socialists\u201c (a la Nartsis Tuporylov) say in their wisdom, Anyone can participate in the spontaneous birth of a\nnew social order. We too hold that anyone can. All that is required for participation of that\nkind is to yield to Economism when Economism reigns and to terrorism when terrorism\narises. Thus, in the spring of this year, when it was so important to utter a note of warning\nagainst infatuation with terrorism, Rabocheye Dyelo stood in amazement, confronted by a\nproblem that was \u201dnew\u201c to it. And now, six months after, when the problem has become\nless topical, it presents us at one and the same time with the declaration: \u201dWe think that it\nis not and should not be the task of Social-Democracy to counteract the rise of terroristic\nsentiments\u201c (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , p. ), and with the Conference resolution: \u201dThe\nConference regards systematic and aggressive terror as being inopportune\u201c (Two Conferences, p. ). How beautifully clear and coherent this is! Not to counteract, but to declare\ninopportune, and to declare it in such a way that unsystematic and defensive terror does\nnot come within the scope of the \u201dresolution\u201c. It must be admitted that such a resolution is\nextremely safe and is fully insured against error, just as a man who talks, but says nothing,\ninsures himself against error. All that is needed to frame such a resolution is an ability to\nkeep at the tail end of the movement. When Iskra ridiculed Rabocheye Dyelo for declaring\nthe question of terror to be new, the latter angrily accused Iskra of \u201dhaving the incredible\neffrontery to impose upon the Party organisation solutions of tactical questions proposed\nby a group of emigrant writers more than fifteen years ago\u201c (p. ). Effrontery. indeed,\nand what an overestimation of the conscious element \u2013 first to resolve questions theoretically beforehand, and then to try to convince the organisation, the Party, and the masses\nof the correctness of this solution! How much better it would be to repeat the elements\nand, without \u201dimposing\u201c anything upon anybody, swing with every \u201dturn\u201c \u2013 whether in\nthe direction of Economism or in the direction of terrorism. Rabocheye Dyelo even generalises this great precept of worldly wisdom and accuses Iskra and Zarya of \u201dsetting up\ntheir programme against the movement, like a spirit hovering over the formless chaos\u201c (p.\n). But what else is the function of Social-Democracy if not to be a \u201dspirit\u201c that not only\nhovers over the spontaneous movement, but also raises this movement to the level of \u201dits\nprogramme\u201c? Surely, it is not its function to drag at the tail of the movement. At best,\nthis would be of no service to the movement; at worst, it would be exceedingly harmful.\nRabocheye Dyelo, however, not only follows this \u201dtactics-as-process\u201c, but elevates it to a\nprinciple, so that it would be more correct to describe its tendency not as opportunism, but\nas tail-ism (from the word tail). And it must be admitted that those who are determined\nalways to follow behind the movement and be its tail are absolutely and forever guaranteed\nagainst \u201dbelittling the spontaneous element of development\u201c.\n\nTHE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATS\nAnd so, we have become convinced that the fundamental error committed by the \u201dnew\ntrend\u201c in Russian Social-Democracy is its bowing to spontaneity and its failure to understand that the spontaneity of the masses demands a high degree of consciousness from\nus Social-Democrats. The greater the spontaneous upsurge of the masses and the more\nwidespread the movement, the more rapid, incomparably so, the demand for greater consciousness in the theoretical, political and organisational work of Social-Democracy.\nThe spontaneous upsurge of the masses in Russia proceeded (and continues) with such\nrapidity that the young Social Democrats proved unprepared to meet these gigantic tasks.\nThis unpreparedness is our common misfortune, the misfortune of all Russian SocialDemocrats. The upsurge of the masses proceeded and spread with uninterrupted continuity; it not only continued in the places where it began, but spread to new localities and\nto new strata of the population (under the influence of the working class movement, there\nwas a renewed ferment among the student youth, among the intellectuals generally, and\neven among the peasantry). Revolutionaries, however, lagged behind this upsurge, both\nin their \u201dtheories\u201c and in their activity; they failed to establish a constant and continuous\norganisation capable of leading the whole movement.\nIn Chapter I, we established that Rabocheye Dyelo belittled our theoretical tasks and\nthat it \u201dspontaneously\u201c repeated the fashionable catchword \u201dfreedom of criticism\u201c; those\nwho repeated this catchword lacked the \u201dconsciousness\u201c to understand that the positions\nof the opportunist \u201dCritics\u201c and those of the revolutionaries in Germany and in Russia are\ndiametrically opposed.\nIn the following chapters, we shall show how this bowing to spontaneity found expression in the sphere of the political tasks and in the organisational work of Social-Democracy.\nCHAPTER \nTRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND\nSOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nWe shall again begin by praising Rabocheye Dyelo. \u201cLiterature of Exposure and the Proletarian Struggle\u201d is the title Martynov gave the article on his differences with Iskra published in Rabocheye Dyelo, No. . He formulated the substance of the differences as\nfollows: \u201cWe cannot confine ourselves solely to exposing the system that stands in its (the\nworking-class party\u2019s) path of development. We must also react to the immediate and current interests of the proletariat.... Iskra . . . is in fact an organ of revolutionary opposition\nthat exposes the state of affairs in our country, particularly the political state of affairs....\nWe, however, work and shall continue to work for the cause of the working class in close\norganic contact with the proletarian struggle\u201d (p. ). One cannot help being grateful to\nMartynov for this formula. It is of outstanding general interest, because substantially it\nembraces not only our disagreements with Rabocheye Dyelo, but the general disagreement\nbetween ourselves and the Economists on the political struggle. We have shown that the\nEconomists do not altogether repudiate \u201cpolitics\u201d, but that they are constantly straying from\nthe Social-Democratic to the trade-unionist conception of politics. Martynov strays in precisely this way, and we shall therefore take his views as a model of Economist error on\nthis question. As we shall endeavour to prove, neither the authors of the \u201cSeparate Supplement\u201d to Rabochaya Mysl nor the authors of the manifesto issued by the Self-Emancipation\nGroup, nor the authors of the Economist letter published in Iskra, No. , will have any\nright to complain against this choice.\n\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\n.. POLITICAL AGITATION AND ITS RESTRICTION BY THE\nECONOMISTS\nEveryone knows that the economic struggle of the Russian workers underwent widespread\ndevelopment and consolidation simultaneously with the production of \u201cliterature\u201d exposing economic (factory and occupational) conditions. The \u201cleaflets\u201d were devoted mainly\nto the exposure of the factory system, and very soon a veritable passion for exposures was\nroused among the workers. As soon as the workers realised that the Social-Democratic\nstudy circles desired to, and could, supply them with a new kind of leaflet that told the\nwhole truth about their miserable existence, about their unbearably hard toil, and their lack\nof rights, they began to send in, actually flood us with, correspondence from the factories\nand workshops. This \u201cexposure literature\u201d created a tremendous sensation, not only in\nthe particular factory exposed in the given leaflet, but in all the factories to which news\nof the, revealed facts spread. And since the poverty and want among the workers in the\nvarious enterprises and in the various trades are much the same, the \u201ctruth about the life of\nthe workers\u201d stirred everyone. Even among the most backward workers, a veritable passion arose to \u201cget into print\u201d \u2013 a noble passion for this rudimentary form of war against\nthe whole of the present social system which is based upon robbery and oppression. And\nin the overwhelming majority of cases these \u201cleaflets\u201d were in truth a declaration of war,\nbecause the exposures served greatly to agitate the workers; they evoked among them common demands for the removal of the most glaring outrages and roused in them a readiness\nto support the demands with strikes. Finally, the employers themselves were compelled\nto recognise the significance of these leaflets as a declaration of war, so much so that in a\nlarge number of cases they did not even wait for the outbreak of hostilities. As is always\nthe case, the mere publication of these exposures made them effective, and they acquired\nthe significance of a strong moral influence. On more than one occasion, the mere appearance of a leaflet proved sufficient to secure the satisfaction of all or part of the demands put\nforward. In a word, economic (factory) exposures were and remain an important lever in\nthe economic struggle. And they will continue to retain this significance as long as there\nis capitalism, which makes it necessary for the workers to defend themselves. Even in the\nmost advanced countries of Europe it can still be seen that the exposure of abuses in some\nbackward trade, or in some forgotten branch of domestic industry, serves as a starting-point\nfor the awakening of class-consciousness, for the beginning of a trade union struggle, and\nfor the spread of socialism.\nThe overwhelming majority of Russian Social-Democrats have of late been almost entirely absorbed by this work of organising the exposure of factory conditions. Suffice it\nto recall Rabochaya MysI to see the extent to which they have been absorbed by it \u2013 so\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nmuch so, indeed, that they have lost sight of the fact that this, taken by itself, is in essence\nstill not Social-Democratic work, but merely trade union work. As a matter of fact, the\nexposures merely dealt with the relations between the workers in a given trade and their\nemployers, and all they achieved was that the sellers of labour power learned to sell their\n\u201ccommodity\u201d on better terms and to fight the purchasers over a purely commercial deal.\nThese exposures could have served (if properly utilised by an organisation of revolutionaries) as a beginning and a component part of Social-Democratic activity; but they could\nalso have led (and, given a worshipful attitude towards spontaneity, were bound to lead) to\na \u201cpurely trade union\u201d struggle and to a non-Social-Democratic working-class movement.\nSocial-Democracy leads the struggle of the working class, not only for better terms for the\nsale of labour-power, but for the abolition of the social system that compels the propertyless to sell themselves to the rich. Social-Democracy represents the working class, not in\nits relation to a given group of employers alone, but in its relation to all classes of modern society and to the state as an organised political force. Hence, it follows that not only\nmust Social-Democrats not confine themselves exclusively to the economic struggle, but\nthat they must not allow the organisation of economic exposures to become the predominant part of their activities. We must take up actively the political education of the working\nclass and the development of its political consciousness. Now that Zarya and Iskra have\nmade the first attack upon Economism, \u201call are agreed\u201d on this (although some agree only\nin words, as we shall soon see).\nThe question arises, what should political education consist in? Can it be confined to the\npropaganda of working-class hostility to the autocracy? Of course not. It is not enough to\nexplain to the workers that they are politically oppressed (any more than it is to explain to\nthem that their interests are antagonistic to the interests of the employers). Agitation must\nbe conducted with regard to every concrete example of this oppression (as we have begun\nto carry on agitation round concrete examples of economic oppression). Inasmuch as this\noppression affects the most diverse classes of society, inasmuch as it manifests itself in\nthe most varied spheres of life and activity \u2013 vocational, civic, personal, family, religious,\nscientific, etc., etc. \u2013 is it not evident that we shall not be fulfilling our task of developing\nthe political consciousness of the workers if we do not undertake the organisation of the\npolitical exposure of the autocracy in all its aspects? In order to carry on agitation round\nconcrete instances of oppression, these instances must be exposed (as it is necessary to\nexpose factory abuses in order to carry on economic agitation).\nOne might think this to be clear enough. It turns out, however, that it is only in words that\n\u201call\u201d are agreed on the need to develop political consciousness, in all its aspects. It turns\nout that Rabocheye Dyelo, for example, far from tackling the task of organising (or making\na start in organising) comprehensive political exposure, is even trying to drag Iskra, which\nhas undertaken this task, away from it. Listen to the following: \u201cThe political struggle of\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nthe working class is merely [it is certainly not \u201d merely\u201c] the most developed, wide, and\neffective form of economic struggle\u201d (programme of Rabocheye Dyelo, published in issue\nNo. , p. ). \u201cThe Social-Democrats are now confronted with the task of lending the\neconomic struggle itself, as far as possible, a political character\u201d (Martynov, Rabocheye\nDyelo, No. , p. ). \u201cThe economic struggle is the most widely applicable means of\ndrawing the masses into active political struggle\u201d (resolution adopted by the Conference of\nthe Union Abroad and \u201camendments\u201d thereto, Two Conferences, pp.  and ). As the\nreader will observe, all these theses permeate Rabocheye Dyelo from its very first number\nto the latest \u201cInstructions to the Editors\u201d, and all of them evidently express a single view\nregarding political agitation and struggle. Let us examine this view from the standpoint of\nthe opinion prevailing among all Economists, that political agitation must follow economic\nagitation. Is it true that, in general, the economic struggle \u201cis the most widely applicable\nmeans\u201d of drawing the masses into the political struggle? It is entirely untrue. Any and\nevery manifestation of police tyranny and autocratic outrage, not only in connection with\nthe economic struggle, is not one whit less \u201cwidely applicable\u201d as a means of \u201cdrawing in\u201d\nthe masses. The rural superintendents and the flogging of peasants, the corruption of the\nofficials and the police treatment of the \u201ccommon people\u201d in the cities, the fight against\nthe famine-stricken and the suppression of the popular striving towards enlightenment and\nknowledge, the extortion of taxes and the persecution of the religious sects, the humiliating\ntreatment of soldiers and the barrack methods in the treatment of the students and liberal\nintellectuals \u2013 do all these and a thousand other similar manifestations of tyranny, though\nnot directly connected with the \u201ceconomic\u201d struggle, represent, in general, less \u201cwidely\napplicable\u201d means and occasions for political agitation and for drawing the masses into\nthe political struggle? The very opposite is true. Of the sum total of cases in which the\nworkers suffer (either on their own account or on account of those closely connected with\nthem) from tyranny, violence, and the lack of rights, undoubtedly only a small minority\nrepresent cases of police tyranny in the trade union struggle as such. Why then should\nwe, beforehand, restrict the scope of political agitation by declaring only one of the means\nto be \u201cthe most widely applicable\u201d, when Social-Democrats must have, in addition, other,\ngenerally speaking, no less \u201cwidely applicable\u201d means?\nIn the dim and distant past (a full year ago! Rabocheye Dyelo wrote: \u201cThe masses begin\nto understand immediate political demands after one strike, or at all events, after several\u201d,\n\u201c as soon as the government sets the police and gendarmerie against them\u201d [August (No.\n) , p. ]. This opportunist theory of stages has now been rejected by the Union\nAbroad, which makes a concession to us by declaring: \u201cThere is no need whatever to\nconduct political agitation right from the beginning, exclusively on an economic basis\u201d\n(Two Conferences, p. ). The Union\u2019s repudiation of part of its former errors will show the\nfuture historian of Russian Social-Democracy better than any number of lengthy arguments\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nthe depths to which our Economists have degraded socialism! But the Union Abroad must\nbe very naive indeed to imagine that the abandonment of one form of restricting politics\nwill induce us to agree to another form. Would it not be more logical to say, in this case too,\nthat the economic struggle should be conducted on the widest possible basis, that it should\nalways be utilised for political agitation, but that \u201cthere is no need whatever\u201d to regard the\neconomic struggle as the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into active\npolitical struggle?\nThe Union Abroad attaches significance to the fact that it has substituted the phrase\n\u201cmost widely applicable means\u201d for the phrase \u201cthe best means\u201d contained in one of the\nresolutions of the Fourth Congress of the Jewish Workers\u2019 Union (Bund). We confess that\nwe find it difficult to say which of these resolutions is the better one. In our opinion they\nareboth worse. Both the Union Abroad and the Bund fall into the error (partly, perhaps\nunconsciously, under the influence of tradition) of giving an Economist, trade-unionist interpretation to politics. Whether this is done by employing the word \u201cbest\u201d or the words\n\u201cmost widely applicable\u201d makes no essential difference whatever. Had the Union Abroad\nsaid that \u201cpolitical agitation on an economic basis\u201d is the most widely applied (not \u201capplicable\u201d) means, it would have been right in regard to a certain period in the development\nof our Social-Democratic movement. It would have been right in regard to the Economists\nand to many (if not the majority) of the practical workers of -; for these practical Economists applied political agitation (to the extent that they applied it at all) almost\nexclusively on an economic basis. Political agitation on such lines was recognised and, as\nwe have seen, even recommended by Rabochaya MysI and the Self-Emancipation Group.\nRabocheye Dyelo should have strongly condemned the fact that the useful work of economic agitation was accompanied by the harmful restriction of the political struggle; instead, it declares the means most widely applied (by the Economists) to be the most widely\napplicable! It is not surprising that when we call these people Economists, they can do\nnothing but pour every manner of abuse upon us; call us \u201cmystifiers\u201d, \u201cdisrupters\u201d, \u201cpapal\nnuncios\u201d, and \u201cslanderers\u201d go complaining to the whole world that we have mortally offended them; and declare almost on oath that \u201cnot a single Social-Democratic organisation\nis now tinged with Economism\u201d. Oh, those evil, slanderous politicians! They must have\ndeliberately invented this Economism, out of sheer hatred of mankind, in order mortally to\noffend other people.\nWhat concrete, real meaning attaches to Martynov\u2019s words when he sets before SocialDemocracy the task of \u201clending the economic struggle itself a political character\u201d? The\neconomic struggle is the collective struggle of the workers against their employers for better\nterms in the sale of their labour-power, for better living and working conditions. This\nstruggle is necessarily a trade union struggle, because working conditions differ greatly in\ndifferent trades, and, consequently, the struggle to improve them can only be conducted on\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nthe basis of trade organisations (in the Western countries, through trade unions; in Russia,\nthrough temporary trade associations and through leaflets, etc.). Lending \u201cthe economic\nstruggle itself a political character\u201d means, therefore, striving to secure satisfaction of these\ntrade demands, the improvement of working conditions in each separate trade by means of\n\u201clegislative and administrative measures\u201d (as Martynov puts it on the ensuing page of his\narticle, p. ). This is precisely what all workers\u2019 trade unions do and always have done.\nRead the works of the soundly scientific (and \u201csoundly\u201d opportunist) Mr. and Mrs. Webb\nand you will see that the British trade unions long ago recognised, and have long been\ncarrying out, the task of \u201clending the economic struggle itself a political character\u201d; they\nhave long been fighting for the right to strike, for the removal of all legal hindrances to the\nco-operative and trade union movements, for laws to protect women and children, for the\nimprovement of labour conditions by means of health and factory legislation, etc.\nThus, the pompous phrase about \u201clending the economic struggle itself a political character\u201d, which sounds so \u201cterrifically\u201d profound and revolutionary, serves as a screen to\nconceal what is in fact the traditional striving to degrade Social-Democratic politics to the\nlevel of trade union politics. Under the guise of rectifying the onesidedness of Iskra, which,\nit is alleged, places \u201cthe revolutionising of dogma higher than the revolutionising of life\u201d,\nwe are presented with the struggle for economic reforms as if it were something entirely\nnew. In point of fact, the phrase \u201clending the economic struggle itself a political character\u201d\nmeans nothing more than the struggle for economic reforms. Martynov himself might have\ncome to this simple conclusion, had he pondered over the significance of his own words.\n\u201cOur Party,\u201d he says, training his heaviest guns on Iskra, \u201ccould and should have presented\nconcrete demands to the government for legislative and administrative measures against\neconomic exploitation, unemployment, famine, etc.\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , pp. -\n). Concrete demands for measures \u2013 does not this mean demands for social reforms?\nAgain we ask the impartial reader: Are we slandering the Rabocheye Dyelo-ites (may I be\nforgiven for this awkward, currently used designation!) by calling them concealed Bernsteinians when, as their point of disagreement with Iskra, they advance their thesis on the\nnecessity of struggling for economic reforms?\nRevolutionary Social-Democracy has always included the struggle for reforms as part of\nits activities. But it utilises \u201ceconomic\u201d agitation for the purpose of presenting to the government, not only demands for all sorts of measures, but also (and primarily) the demand\nthat it cease to be an autocratic government. Moreover, it considers it its duty to present\nthis demand to the government on the basis, not of the economic struggle alone, but of all\nmanifestations in general of public and political life. In a word, it subordinates the struggle\nfor reforms, as the part to the whole, to the revolutionary struggle for freedom and for socialism. Martynov, however, resuscitates the theory of stages in a new form and strives to\nprescribe, as it were, an exclusively economic path of development for the political strug-\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\ngle. By advancing at this moment, when the revolutionary movement is on the upgrade, an\nalleged special \u201ctask\u201d of struggling for reforms, he is dragging the Party backwards and is\nplaying into the hands of both \u201cEconomist\u201d and liberal opportunism.\nTo proceed. Shamefacedly hiding the struggle for reforms behind the pompous thesis\nof \u201clending the economic struggle itself a political character\u201d, Martynov advanced, as if\nit were a special point, exclusively economic (indeed, exclusively factory) reforms. As to\nthe reason for his doing that, we do not know it. Carelessness, perhaps? Yet if he had\nin mind something else besides \u201cfactory\u201d reforms, then the whole of his thesis, which\nwe have cited, loses all sense. Perhaps he did it because he considers it possible and\nprobable that the government will make \u201cconcessions\u201d only in the economic sphere?\nIf so, then it is a strange delusion. Concessions are also possible and are made in the sphere\nof legislation concerning flogging, passports, land redemption payments, religious sects,\nthe censorship, etc., etc. \u201cEconomic\u201d concessions (or pseudo-concessions) are, of course,\nthe cheapest and most advantageous from the government\u2019s point of view, because by these\nmeans it hopes to win the confidence of the working masses. For this very reason, we\nSocial-Democrats must not under any circumstances or in any way whatever create grounds\nfor the belief (or the misunderstanding) that we attach greater value to economic reforms, or\nthat we regard them as being particularly important, etc. \u201cSuch demands,\u201d writes Martynov,\nspeaking of the concrete demands for legislative and administrative measures referred to\nabove, \u201cwould not be merely a hollow sound, because, promising certain palpable results,\nthey might be actively supported by the working masses....\u201d We are not Economists, oh\nno! We only cringe as slavishly before the \u201cpalpableness\u201d of concrete results as do the\nBernsteins, the Prokopoviches, the Struves, the R.M.s, and tutti quanti! We only wish\nto make it understood (together with Nartsis Tuporylov) that all which \u201cdoes not promise\npalpable results\u201d is merely a \u201chollow sound\u201d! We are only trying to argue as if the working\nmasses were incapable (and had not already proved their capabilities, notwithstanding those\nwho ascribe their own philistinism to them) of actively supporting every protest against the\nautocracy, even if it promises absolutely no palpable results whatever!\nLet us take, for example, the very \u201cmeasures\u201d for the relief of unemployment and the\nfamine that Martynov himself advances. Rabocheye Dyelo is engaged, judging by what\nit has promised, in drawing up and elaborating a programme of \u201cconcrete [in the form of\nbills?] demands for legislative and administrative measures\u201d, \u201cpromising palpable results\u201d,\nwhile Iskra, which \u201cconstantly places the revolutionising of dogma higher than the revolutionising of life\u201d, has tried to explain the inseparable connection between unemployment\nand the whole capitalist system, has given warning that \u201cfamine is coming\u201d, has exposed\nthe police \u201cfight against the famine-stricken\u201d, and the outrageous \u201cprovisional penal servitude regulations\u201d; and Zarya has published a special reprint, in the form of an agitational\npamphlet, of a section of its \u201cReview of Home Affairs\u201d, dealing with the famine. But\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\ngood God! How \u201conesided\u201d were these incorrigibly narrow and orthodox doctrinaires,\nhow deaf to the calls of \u201clife itself\u201d! Their articles contained \u2013 oh horror! \u2013 not a single,\ncan you imagine it? not a single \u201cconcrete demand\u201d \u201cpromising palpable results\u201d! Poor\ndoctrinaires! They ought to be sent to Krichevsky and Martynov to be taught that tactics\nare a process of growth, of that which grows, etc., and that the economic struggle itself\nshould be given a political character!\n\u201cIn addition to its immediate revolutionary significance, the economic struggle of the\nworkers against the employers and the government [\u201deconomic struggle against the government\u201c!] has also this significance: it constantly brings home to the workers the fact\nthat they have no political rights\u201d (Martynov, p. ). We quote this passage, not in order\nto repeat for the hundredth and thousandth time what has been said above, but in order to\nexpress particular thanks to Martynov for this excellent new formula: \u201cthe economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the government\u201d. What a gem! With what\ninimitable skill and mastery in eliminating all partial disagreements and shades of differences among Economists this clear and concise proposition expresses the quintessence of\nEconomism, from summoning the workers \u201cto the political struggle, which they carry on\nin the general interest, for the improvement of the conditions of all the workers\u201d, continuing through the theory of stages, and ending in the resolution of the Conference on the\n\u201cmost widely applicable\u201d, etc. \u201cEconomic struggle against the government\u201d is precisely\ntrade-unionist politics, which is still very far from being Social-Democratic politics.\n.. HOW MARTYNOV RENDERED PLEKHANOV MORE PROFOUND\n\u201cWhat a large number of Social-Democratic Lomonosovs have appeared among us lately!\u201dobserved\na comrade one day, having in mind the astonishing propensity of many who are inclined\ntoward Economism to, arrive, \u201cnecessarily, by their own under standing\u201d, at great truths\n(e.g., that the economic struggle stimulates the workers to ponder over their lack of rights)\nand in doing so to ignore, with the supreme contempt of born geniuses, all that has been\nproduced by the antecedent development of revolutionary thought and of the revolutionary\nmovement. Lomonosov-Martynov is precisely such a born genius. We need but glance at\nhis article \u201cUrgent Questions\u201d to see how by \u201chis own understanding\u201d he arrives at what\nwas long ago said by Axelrod (of whom our Lomonosov, naturally, says not a word); how,\nfor instance, he is beginning to understand that we cannot ignore the opposition of such or\nsuch strata of the bourgeoisie (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , pp. , , ; compare this with\nRabocheye Dyelo\u2019s Reply to Axelrod, pp. , -), etc. But alas, he is only \u201carriving\u201d\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nand is only \u201cbeginning\u201d, not more than that, for so little has he understood Axelrod\u2019s ideas,\nthat hetalks about \u201cthe economic struggle against the employers and the government\u201d. For\nthree years (-) Rabocheye Dyelo has tried hard to understand Axelrod, but has so\nfar not understood him! Can one of the reasons be that Social-Democracy, \u201clike mankind\u201d,\nalways sets itself only tasks that can be achieved?\nBut the Lomonosovs are distinguished not only by their ignorance of many things (that\nwould be but half misfortune!), but also by their unawareness of their own ignorance. Now\nthis is a real misfortune; and it is this misfortune that prompts them without further ado to\nattempt to render Plekhanov \u201cmore profound\u201d.\n\u201cMuch water,\u201d Lomonosov-Martynov says, \u201chas flowed under the bridge since Plekhanov\nwrote his book (Tasks of the Socialists in the Fight Against the Famine in Russia). The\nSocial-Democrats who for a decade led the economic struggle of the working class ...\nhave failed as yet to lay down a broad theoretical basis for Party tactics. This question\nhas now come to a head, and if we should wish to lay down such a theoretical basis, we\nshould certainly have to deepen considerably the principles of tactics developed at one time\nby Plekhanov.... Our present definition of the distinction between propaganda and agitation would have to be different from Plekhanov\u2019s (Martynov has just quoted PIekhanov\u2019s\nwords: \u201dA propagandist presents many ideas to one or a few persons; an agitator presents\nonly one or a few ideas, but he presents them to a mass of people.\u201c) By propaganda we\nwould understand the revolutionary explanation of the present social system, entire or in\nits partial manifestations, whether that be done in a form intelligible to individuals or to\nbroad masses. By agitation, in the strict sense of the word (sic!), we would understand the\ncall upon the masses to undertake definite, concrete actions and the promotion of the direct\nrevolutionary intervention of the proletariat in social life.\u201d\nWe congratulate Russian-and international-Social-Democracy on having found, thanks\nto Martynov, a new terminology, more strict and more profound. Hitherto we thought (with\nPlekhanov, and with all the leaders of the international working class movement) that the\npropagandist, dealing with, say, the question of unemployment, must explain the capitalistic nature of crises, the cause of their inevitability in modern society, the necessity for\nthe transformation of this society into a socialist society, etc. In a word, he must present\n\u201cmany ideas\u201d, so many, indeed, that they will be understood as an integral whole only by\na (comparatively) few persons. The agitator, however, speaking on the same subject, will\ntake as an illustration a fact that is most glaring and most widely known to his audience,\nsay, the death of an unemployed worker\u2019s family from starvation, the growing impoverishment, etc., and, utilising this fact, known to all, will direct his efforts to presenting a single\nidea to the \u201cmasses\u201d, e.g., the senselessness of the contradiction between the increase of\nwealth and the increase of poverty; he will strive to rouse discontent and indignation among\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nthe masses against this crying injustice, leaving a more complete explanation of this contradiction to the propagandist. Consequently, the propagandist operates chiefly by means\nof the printed word; the agitator by means of the spoken word. The propagandist requires\nqualities different from those of the agitator. Kautsky and Lafargue, for example, we term\npropagandists; Bebel and Guesde we term agitators. To single out a third sphere, or third\nfunction, of practical activity, and to include in this function \u201cthe call upon the masses to\nundertake definite concrete actions\u201d, is sheer nonsense, because the \u201ccall\u201d, as a single act,\neither naturally and inevitably supplements the theoretical treatise, propagandist pamphlet,\nand agitational speech, or represents a purely executive function. Let us take, for example,\nthe struggle the German Social-Democrats are now waging against the corn duties. The\ntheoreticians write research works on tariff policy, with the \u201ccall\u201d, say, to struggle for commercial treaties and for Free Trade. The propagandist does the same thing in the periodical\npress, and the agitator in public speeches. At the present time, the \u201cconcrete action\u201d of the\nmasses takes the form of signing petitions to the Reichstag against raising the corn duties.\nThe call for this action comes indirectly from the theoreticians, the propagandists, and the\nagitators, and, directly, from the workers who take the petition lists to the factories and\nto private homes for the gathering of signatures. According to the \u201cMartynov terminology\u201d, Kautsky and Bebel are both propagandists, while those who solicit the signatures are\nagitators. Isn\u2019t it clear?\nThe German example recalled to my mind the German word which, literally translated,\nmeans \u201cBallhorning\u201d. Johann Ballhorn, a Leipzig publisher of the sixteenth century, published a child\u2019s reader in which, as was the custom, he introduced a drawing of a cock,\nbut a cock without spurs and with a couple of eggs lying near it. On the cover he printed\nthe legend, \u201cRevised edition by Johann Ballhorn\u201d. Ever since then, the Germans describe\nany \u201crevision\u201d that is really a worsening as \u201cballhorning\u201d. And one cannot help recalling\nBallhorn upon seeing how the Martynovs try to render Plekhanov \u201cmore profound\u201d.\nWhy did our Lomonosov \u201cinvent\u201d this confusion? In order to illustrate how Iskra \u201cdevotes attention only to one side of the case, just as Pleklianov did a decade and a half\nago\u201d (). \u201cWith Iskra, propagandist tasks force agitational tasks into the background, at\nleast for the present\u201d (). If we translate this last proposition from the language of Martynov into ordinary human language (because mankind has not yet managed to learn the\nnewly-invented terminology), we shall get the following: with Iskra, the tasks of political\npropaganda and political agitation force into the background the task of \u201cpresenting to the\ngovernment concrete demands for legislative and administrative measures\u201d that \u201cpromise\ncertain palpable results\u201d (or demands for social reforms, that is, if we are permitted once\nagain to employ the old terminology of the old mankind not yet grown to Martynov\u2019s level).\nWe suggest that the reader compare this thesis with the following tirade:\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\n\u201cWhat also astonishes us in these programmes [the programmes advanced by revolutionary Social-Democrats] is their constant stress upon the benefits of workers\u2019 activity in\nparliament (non-existent in Russia), though they completely ignore (thanks to their revolutionary nihilism) the importance of workers\u2019 participation in the legislative manufacturers\u2019\nassemblies on factory affairs [which do exist in Russia] ... or at least the importance of\nworkers\u2019 participation in municipal bodies....\u201d\nThe author of this tirade expresses in a somewhat more forthright and clearer manner the\nvery idea which Lomonosov-Martynov discovered by his own understanding. The author\nis R. M., in the \u201cSeparate Supplement\u201d to Rabochaya Mysl (p. ).\n.. POLITICAL EXPOSURES AND \u201cTRAINING IN REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY\u201d\nIn advancing against Iskra his theory of \u201craising the activity of the working masses\u201d, Martynov actually betrayed an urge to belittle that activity, for he declared the very economic\nstruggle before which all economists grovel to be the preferable, particularly important,\nand \u201cmost widely applicable\u201d means of rousing this activity and its broadest field. This\nerror is characteristic, precisely in that it is by no means peculiar to Martynov. In reality,\nit is possible to \u201craise the activity of the working masses\u201d only when this activity is not\nrestricted to \u201cpolitical agitation on an economic basis\u201d. A basic condition for the necessary\nexpansion of political agitation is the organisation of comprehensive political exposure. In\nno way except by means of such exposures can the masses be trained in political consciousness and revolutionary activity. Hence, activity of this kind is one of the most important\nfunctions of international Social-Democracy as a whole, for even political freedom does\nnot in any way eliminate exposures; it merely shifts somewhat their sphere of direction.\nThus, the German party is especially strengthening its positions and spreading its influence, thanks particularly to the untiring energy with which it is conducting its campaign of\npolitical exposure. Working-class consciousness cannot be genuine political consciousness\nunless the workers are trained to respond to all cases of tyranny, oppression, violence, and\nabuse, no matter what class is affected \u2013 unless they are trained, moreover, to respond from\na Social-Democratic point of view and no other. The consciousness of the working masses\ncannot be genuine class-consciousness, unless the workers learn, from concrete, and above\nall from topical, political facts and events to observe every other social class in all the manifestations of its intellectual, ethical, and political life; unless they learn to apply in practice\nthe materialist analysis and the materialist estimate of all aspects of the life and activity of\nall classes, strata, and groups of the population. Those who concentrate the attention, ob-\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nservation, and consciousness of the working class exclusively, or even mainly, upon itself\nalone are not Social-Democrats; for the self-knowledge of the working class is indissolubly\nbound up, not solely with a fully clear theoretical understanding \u2013 or rather, not so much\nwith the theoretical, as with the practical, understanding \u2013 of the relationships between\nall the various classes of modern society, acquired through the experience of political life.\nFor this reason the conception of the economic struggle as the most widely applicable\nmeans of drawing the masses into the political movement, which our Economists preach,\nis so extremely harmful and reactionary in its practical significance. In order to become a\nSocial-Democrat, the worker must have a clear picture in his mind of the economic nature\nand the social and political features of the landlord and the priest, the high state official and\nthe peasant, the student and the vagabond; he must know their strong and weak points; he\nmust grasp the meaning of all the catchwords and sophisms by which each class and each\nstratum camouflages its selfish strivings and its real \u201cinner workings\u201d; he must understand\nwhat interests are reflected by certain institutions and certain laws and how they are reflected. But this \u201cclear picture\u201d cannot be obtained from any book. It can be obtained only\nfrom living examples and from exposures that follow close upon what is going on about us\nat a given moment; upon what is being discussed, in whispers perhaps, by each one in his\nown way; upon what finds expression in such and such events, in such and such statistics,\nin such and such court sentences, etc., etc. These comprehensive political exposures are an\nessential and fundamental condition for training the masses in revolutionary activity.\nWhy do the Russian workers still manifest little revolutionary activity in response to\nthe brutal treatment of the people by the police, the persecution of religious sects, the\nflogging of peasants, the outrageous censorship, the torture of soldiers, the persecution of\nthe most innocent cultural undertakings, etc.? Is it because the \u201ceconomic struggle\u201d does\nnot \u201cstimulate\u201d them to this, because such activity does not \u201cpromise palpable results\u201d,\nbecause it produces little that is \u201cpositive\u201d? To adopt such an opinion, we repeat, is merely\nto direct the charge where it does not belong, to blame the working masses for one\u2019s own\nphilistinism (or Bernsteinism). We must blame ourselves, our lagging behind the mass\nmovement, for still being unable to organise sufficiently wide, striking, and rapid exposures\nof all the shameful outrages. When we do that (and we must and can do it), the most\nbackward worker will understand, or will feel, that the students and religious sects, the\npeasants and the authors are being abused and outraged by those same dark forces that are\noppressing and crushing him at every step of his life. Feeling that, he himself will be filled\nwith an irresistible desire to react, and he will know how to hoot the censors one day, on\nanother day to demonstrate outside the house of a governor who has brutally suppressed a\npeasant uprising, on still another day to teach a lesson to the gendarmes in surplices who are\ndoing the work of the Holy Inquisition, etc. As yet we have done very little, almost nothing,\nto bring before the working masses prompt exposures on all possible issues. Many of us\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nas yet do not recognise this as our bounden duty but trail spontaneously in the wake of the\n\u201cdrab everyday struggle\u201d, in the narrow confines of factory life. Under such circumstances\nto say that \u201cIskra displays a tendency to minimise the significance of the forward march\nof the drab everyday struggle in comparison with the propaganda of brilliant and complete\nideas\u201d (Martynov, op. cit., p. ), means to drag the Party back, to defend and glorify our\nunpreparedness and backwardness.\nAs for calling the masses to action, that will come of itself as soon as energetic political\nagitation, live and striking exposures come into play. To catch some criminal red-handed\nand immediately to brand him publicly in all places is of itself far more effective than any\nnumber of \u201ccalls\u201d; the effect very often is such as will make it impossible to tell exactly who\nit was that \u201ccalled\u201d upon the masses and who suggested this or that plan of demonstration,\netc. Calls for action, not in the general, but in the concrete, sense of the term can be\nmade only at the place of action; only those who themselves go into action, and do so\nimmediately, can sound such calls. Our business as Social-Democratic publicists is to\ndeepen, expand, and intensify political exposures and political agitation.\nA word in passing about \u201ccalls to action\u201d. The only newspaper which prior to the\nspring events called upon the workers to intervene actively in a matter that certainly did\nnot promise any palpable results whatever for the workers, i.e., the drafting of the students\ninto the army, was Iskra. Immediately after the publication of the order of January , on\n\u201cdrafting the  students into the army\u201d, Iskra published an article on the matter (in its\nFebruary issue, No. ), and, before any demonstration was begun, forthwith called upon\n\u201cthe workers to go to the aid of the students\u201d, called upon the \u201cpeople\u201d openly to take up\nthe government\u2019s arrogant challenge. We ask: how is the remarkable fact to be explained\nthat although Martynov talks so much about \u201ccalls to action\u201d, and even suggests \u201ccalls to\naction\u201d as a special form of activity, he said not a word about this call? After this, was it\nnot sheer philistinism on Martynov\u2019s part to allege that Iskra was one-sided because it did\nnot issue sufficient \u201ccalls\u201d to struggle for demands \u201cpromising palpable results\u201d?\nOur Economists, including Rabocheye Dyelo, were successful because they adapted\nthemselves to the backward workers. But the Social-Democratic worker, the revolutionary\nworker (and the number of such workers is growing) will indignantly reject all this talk\nabout struggle for demands \u201cpromising palpable results\u201d, etc., because he will understand\nthat this is only a variation of the old song about adding a kopek to the ruble. Such a worker\nwill say to his counsellors from Rabochaya Mysl and Rabocheye Dyelo: you are busying\nyourselves in vain, gentlemen, and shirking your proper duties, by meddling with such excessive zeal in a job that we can very well manage ourselves. There is nothing clever in\nyour assertion that the Social-Democrats\u2019 task is to lend the economic struggle itself a political character; that is only the beginning, it is not the main task of the Social-Democrats.\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nFor all over the world, including Russia, the police themselves often take the initiative in\nlending the economic struggle a political character, and the workers themselves learn to understand whom the government supports. The \u201ceconomic struggle of the workers against\nthe employers and the government\u201d, about which you make as much fuss as if you had\ndiscovered a new America, is being waged in all parts of Russia, even the most remote,\nby the workers themselves who have heard about strikes, but who have heard almost nothing about socialism. The \u201cactivity\u201d you want to stimulate among us workers, by advancing\nconcrete demands that promise palpable results, we are already displaying and in our everyday, limited trade union work we put forward these concrete demands, very often without\nany assistance whatever from the intellectuals. But such activity is not enough for us; we\nare not children to be fed on the thin gruel of \u201ceconomic\u201d politics alone; we want to know\neverything that others know, we want to learn the details of all aspects of political life and\nto take part actively in every single political event. In order that we may do this, the intellectuals must talk to us less of what we already know. and tell us more about what we\ndo not yet know and what we can never learn from our factory and \u201ceconomic\u201d experience,\nnamely, political knowledge. You intellectuals can acquire this knowledge, and it is your\nduty to bring it to us in a hundred- and a thousand-fold greater measure than you have done\nup to now; and you must bring it to us, not only in the form of discussions, pamphlets,\nand articles (which very often \u2013 pardon our frankness \u2013 are rather dull), but precisely in the\nform of vivid exposures of what our government and our governing classes are doing at this\nvery moment in all spheres of life. Devote more zeal to carrying out this duty and talk less\nabout \u201craising the activity of the working masses\u201d. We are far more active than you think,\nand we are quite able to support, by open street fighting, even demands that do not promise\nany \u201cpalpable results\u201d whatever. It is not for you to \u201craise\u201d our activity, because activity is\nprecisely the thing you yourselves lack. Bow less in subservience to spontaneity, and think\nmore about raising your own activity, gentlemen!\n.. WHAT IS THERE IN COMMON BETWEEN ECONOMISM\nAND TERRORISM?\nIn the last footnote we cited the opinion of an Economist and of a non-Social -Democratic\nterrorist, who showed themselves to be accidentally in agreement. Speaking generally,\nhowever, there is not an accidental, but a necessary, inherent connection between the two,\nof which we shall have need to speak later, and which must be mentioned here in connection with the question of education for revolutionary activity. The Economists and the\nroot, namely, subservience to spontaneity, with which we dealt in the preceding chapter as\na general phenomenon and which we shall now examine in relation to its effect upon polit-\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nical activity and the political struggle. At first sight, our assertion may appear paradoxical,\nso great is the difference between those who stress the \u201cdrab everyday struggle\u201d and those\nwho call for the most self sacrificing struggle of individuals. But this is no paradox. The\nEconomists and the terrorists merely bow to different poles of spontaneity; the Economists\nbow to the spontaneity of \u201cthe labour movement pure and simple\u201d, while the terrorists bow\nto the spontaneity of the passionate indignation of intellectuals, who lack the ability or\nopportunity to connect the revolutionary struggle and the working-class movement into an\nintegral whole. It is difficult indeed for those who have lost their belief, or who have never\nbelieved, that this is possible, to find some outlet for their indignation and revolutionary energy other than terror. Thus, both forms of subservience to spontaneity we have mentioned\nare nothing but the beginning of the implementation of the notorious Credo programme:\nLet the workers wage their \u201ceconomic struggle against the employers and the government\u201d\n(we apologise to the author of the Credo for expressing her views in Martynov\u2019s words. We\nthink we have a right to do so since the Credo, too, says that in the economic struggle the\nworkers \u201ccome up against the political regime and let the intellectuals conduct the political\nstruggle by their own efforts \u2013 with the aid of terror, of course! This is an absolutely logical\nand inevitable conclusion which must be insisted on \u2013 even though those who are beginning\nto carry out this programme do not themselves realise that it is inevitable. Political activity\nhas its logic quite apart from the consciousness of those who, with the best intentions, call\neither for terror or for lending the economic struggle itself a political character. The road to\nhell is paved with good intentions, and, in this case, good intentions cannot save one from\nbeing spontaneously drawn \u201dalong the line of least resistance\u201c, along the line of the purely\nbourgeois Credo programme. Surely it is no accident either that many Russian liberals \u2013\navowed liberals and liberals that wear the mask of Marxism \u2013 whole-heartedly sympathise\nwith terror and try to foster the terrorist moods that have surged up in the present time.\nThe formation of the Revolutionary-Socialist Svoboda Group which set itself the aim\nof helping the working-class movement in every possible way, but which included in its\nprogramme terror, and emancipation, so to speak, from Social-Democracy \u2013 once again\nconfirmed the remarkable perspicacity of P. B. Axelrod, who literally foretold these results\nof Social-Democratic waverings as far back as the end of  (Present Tasks and Tactics),\nwhen he outlined his famous \u201dtwo perspectives\u201c. All the subsequent disputes and disagreements among Russian Social-Democrats are contained, like a plant in the seed, in these two\nperspectives.\nFrom this point of view it also becomes clear why Rabocheye Dyelo, unable to withstand the spontaneity of Economism, has likewise been unable to withstand the spontaneity\nof terrorism. It is highly interesting to note here the specific arguments that Svoboda has advanced in defence of terrorism. It \u201dcompletely denies\u201c the deterrent role of terrorism (The\nRegeneration of Revolutionism, p. ), but instead stresses its \u201dexcitative significance\u201c.\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nThis is characteristic, first, as representing one of the stages of the breakup and decline of\nthe traditional (pre-Social-Democratic) cycle of ideas which insisted upon terrorism. The\nadmission that the government cannot now be \u201dterrified\u201c and hence disrupted, by terror, is\ntantamount to a complete condemnation of terror as a system of struggle, as a sphere of activity sanctioned by the programme. Secondly, it is still more characteristic as an example\nof the failure to understand our immediate tasks in regard to \u201deducation for revolutionary\nactivity\u201c. Svoboda advocates terror as a means of \u201dexciting\u201c the working-class movement\nand of giving it a \u201dstrong impetus\u201c. It is difficult to imagine an argument that more thoroughly disproves itself. Are there not enough outrages committed in Russian life without\nspecial \u201dexcitants\u201c having to be invented? On the other hand, is it not obvious that those\nwho are not, and cannot be, roused to excitement even by Russian tyranny will stand by\n\u201dtwiddling their thumbs\u201c and watch a handful of terrorists engaged in single combat with\nthe government? The fact is that the working masses are roused to a high pitch of excitement by the social evils in Russian life, but we are unable to gather, if one may so put it,\nand concentrate all these drops and streamlets of popular resentment that are brought forth\nto a far larger extent than we imagine by the conditions of Russian life, and that must be\ncombined into a single gigantic torrent. That this can be accomplished is irrefutably proved\nby the enormous growth of the working-class movement and the eagerness, noted above,\nwith which the workers clamour for political literature. On the other hand, calls for terror\nand calls to lend the economic struggle itself a political character are merely two different\nforms of evading the most pressing duty now resting upon Russian revolutionaries, namely,\nthe organisation of comprehensive political agitation. Svoboda desires to substitute terror\nfor agitation, openly admitting that \u201das soon as intensified and strenuous agitation is begun\namong the masses the excitative function of terror will be ended\u201c (The Regeneration of\nRevolutionism, p. ). This proves precisely that both the terrorists and the Economists\nunderestimate the revolutionary activity of the masses, despite the striking evidence of the\nevents that took place in the spring, and whereas the one group goes out in search of\nartificial \u201dexcitants\u201c, the other talks about \u201dconcrete demands\u201c. But both fail to devote\nsufficient attention to the development of their own activity in political agitation and in the\norganisation of political exposures. And no other work can serve as a substitute for this\ntask either at the present time or at any other.\n.. THE WORKING CLASS AS VANGUARD FIGHTER FOR\nDEMOCRACY\nWe have seen that the conduct of the broadest political agitation and, consequently, of allsided political exposures is an absolutely necessary and a paramount task of our activity,\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nif this activity is to be truly Social-Democratic. However, we arrived at this conclusion\nsolely on the grounds of the pressing needs of the working class for political knowledge\nand political training. But such a presentation of the question is too narrow, for it ignores\nthe general democratic tasks of Social-Democracy, in particular of present-day Russian\nSocial-Democracy. In order to explain the point more concretely we shall approach the\nsubject from an aspect that is \u201dnearest\u201c to the Economist, namely, from the practical aspect. \u201dEveryone agrees\u201c that it is necessary to develop the political consciousness of the\nworking class. The question is, how that is to be done and what is required to do it. The economic struggle merely \u201dimpels\u201c the workers to realise the government\u2019s attitude towards\nthe working class. Consequently, however much we may try to \u201dlend the economic, struggle\nitself a political character\u201c, we shall never be able to develop the political consciousness of\nthe workers (to the level of Social-Democratic political consciousness) by keeping within\nthe framework of the economic struggle, for that framework is too narrow. The Martynov\nformula has some value for us, not because it illustrates Martynov\u2019s aptitude for confusing\nthings, but because it pointedly expresses the basic error that all the Economists commit,\nnamely, their conviction that it is possible to develop the class political consciousness of\nthe workers from within, so to speak, from their economic struggle, i.e., by making this\nstruggle the exclusive (or, at least, the main) starting-point, by making it the exclusive (or,\nat least, the main) basis. Such a view is radically wrong. Piqued by our polemics against\nthem, the Economists refuse to ponder deeply over the origins of these disagreements, with\nthe result that we simply cannot understand one another. It is as if we spoke in different\ntongues.\nClass political consciousness can be brought to the workers only from without, that\nis, only from outside the economic struggle, from outside the sphere of relations between\nworkers and employers. The sphere from which alone it is possible to obtain this knowledge\nis the sphere of relationships of all classes and strata to the state and the government, the\nsphere of the interrelations between all classes. For that reason, the reply to the question\nas to what must be done to bring political knowledge to the workers cannot be merely the\nanswer with which, in the majority of cases, the practical workers, especially those inclined\ntowards Economism, mostly content themselves, namely: \u201dTo go among the workers.\u201c To\nbring political knowledge to the workers the Social Democrats mustgo among all classes\nof the population; they must dispatch units of their army in all directions.\nWe deliberately select this blunt formula, we deliberately express ourselves in this\nsharply simplified manner, not because we desire to indulge in paradoxes, but in order\nto \u201dimpel\u201c the Economists to a realisation of their tasks which they unpardonably ignore,\nto suggest to them strongly the difference between trade-unionist and Social-Democratic\npolitics, which they refuse to understand. We therefore beg the reader not to get wrought\nup, but to hear us patiently to the end.\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nLet us take the type of Social-Democratic study circle that has become most widespread\nin the past few years and examine its work. It has \u201dcontacts with the workers\u201c and rests\ncontent with this, issuing leaflets in which abuses in the factories, the government\u2019s partiality towards the capitalists, and the tyranny of the police are strongly condemned. At\nworkers\u2019 meetings the discussions never, or rarely ever, go beyond the limits of these subjects. Extremely rare are the lectures and discussions held on the history of the revolutionary movement, on questions of the government\u2019s home and foreign policy, on questions\nof the economic evolution of Russia and of Europe, on the position of the various classes\nin modern society, etc. As to systematically acquiring and extending contact with other\nclasses of society, no one even dreams of that. In fact, the ideal leader, as the majority\nof the members of such circles picture him, is something far more in the nature of a trade\nunion secretary than a socialist political leader. For the secretary of any, say English, trade\nunion always helps the workers to carry on the economic struggle, he helps them to expose factory abuses, explains the injustice of the laws and of measures that hamper the\nfreedom to strike and to picket (i. e., to warn all and sundry that a strike is proceeding\nat a certain factory), explains the partiality of arbitration court judges who belong to the\nbourgeois classes, etc., etc. In a word, every trade union secretary conducts and helps to\nconduct \u201dthe economic struggle against the employers and the government\u201c. It cannot be\ntoo strongly maintained that this is still not Social-Democracy, that the Social-Democrat\u2019s\nideal should not be the trade union secretary, but the tribune of the people, who is able\nto react to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression, no matter where it appears, no\nmatter what stratum or class of the people it affects; who is able to generalise all these manifestations and produce a single picture of police violence and capitalist exploitation; who\nis able to take advantage of every event, however small, in order to set forthbefore all his\nsocialist convictions and his democratic demands, in order to clarify for all and everyone\nthe world-historic significance of the struggle for the emancipation of the proletariat. Compare, for example, a leader like Robert Knight (the well-known secretary and leader of the\nBoiler-Makers\u2019 Society, one of the most powerful trade unions in England), with Wilhelm\nLiebknecht, and try to apply to them the contrasts that Martynov draws in his controversy\nwith Iskra. You will see \u2013 I am running through Martynov\u2019s article \u2013 that Robert Knight\nengaged more in \u201dcalling the masses to certain concrete actions\u201c (Martynov, op. cit., p. ),\nwhile Willielin Liebknecht engaged more in \u201dthe revolutionary elucidation of the whole of\nthe present system or partial manifestations of it\u201c (-); that Robert Knight \u201dformulated\nthe immediate demands of the proletariat and indicated the means by which they can be\nachieved\u201c (), whereas Wilhelm Liebknecht, while doing this, did not hold back from\n\u201dsimultaneously guiding the activities of various opposition strata\u201c, \u201ddictating a positive\nprogramme of action for them\u201c (); that Robert Knight strove \u201das far as possible to lend\nthe economic struggle itself a political character\u201c () and was excellently able \u201dto sub-\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nmit to the government concrete demands promising certain palpable results\u201c (), whereas\nLiebknecht engaged to a much greater degree in \u201done-sided\u201c \u201dexposures\u201c (); that Robert\nKnight attached more significance to the \u201dforward march of the drab everyday struggle\u201c\n(), whereas Liebknecht attached more significance to the \u201dpropaganda of brilliant and\ncompleted ideas\u201c (); that Liebknecht converted the paper he was directing into \u201dan organ of revolutionary opposition that exposed the state of affairs in our country, particularly\nthe political state of affairs, insofar as it affected the interests of the most varied strata of\nthe population\u201c (), whereas Robert Knight \u201dworked for the cause of the working class\nin close organic connection with the proletarian struggle\u201c () \u2013 if by \u201dclose and organic\nconnection\u201c is meant the subservience to spontaneity which we examined above, by taking\nthe examples of Krichevsky and Martynov \u2013 and \u201drestricted the sphere of his influence\u201c,\nconvinced, of course, as is Martynov, that \u201dby doing so he deepened that influence\u201c ().\nIn a word, you will see that de facto Martynov reduces Social-Democracy to the level of\ntrade-unionism, though he does so, of course, not because he does not desire the good of\nSocial-Democracy, but simply because he is a little too much in a hurry to render Plekhanov\nmore profound, instead of taking the trouble to understand him.\nLet us return, however, to our theses. We said that a Social Democrat, if he really\nbelieves it necessary to develop comprehensively the political consciousness of the proletariat, must \u201dgo among all classes of the population\u201c. This gives rise to the questions: how\nis this to be done? have we enough forces to do this? is there a basis for such work among\nall the other classes? will this not mean a retreat, or lead to a retreat, from the class point\nof view? Let us deal with these questions.\nWe must \u201dgo among all classes of the population\u201c as theoreticians, as proagandists, as\nagitators, and as organisers. Noone doubts that the theoretical work of Social-Democrats\nshould aim at studying all the specific features of the social and political condition of the\nvarious classes. But extremely little is done in this direction as compared with the work\nthat is done in studying the specific features of factory life. In the committees and study\ncircles, one can meet people who are immersed in the study even of some special branch of\nthe metal industry; but one can hardly ever find members of organisations (obliged, as often\nhappens, for some reason or other to give up practical work) who are especially engaged\nin gathering material on some pressing question of social and political life in our country\nwhich could serve as a means for conducting Social-Democratic work among other strata\nof the population. In dwelling upon the fact that the majority of the present-day leaders of\nthe working-class movement lack training, we cannot refrain from mentioning training in\nthis respect also, for it too is bound up with the Economist conception of \u201dclose organic\nconnection with the proletarian struggle\u201c. The principal thing, of course, is propaganda\nand agitation among all strata of the people. The work of the West European SocialDemocrat is in this respect facilitated by the public meetings and rallies which all are free\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nto attend, and by the fact that in parliament he addresses the representatives of all classes.\nWe have neither a parliament nor freedom of assembly; nevertheless, we are able to arrange\nmeetings of workers who desire to listen to a Social-Democrat. We must also find ways\nand means of calling meetings of representatives of all social classes that desire to listen\nto a democrat; for he is no Social-Democrat who forgets in practice that \u201dthe Communists\nsupport every revolutionary movement\u201c, that we are obliged for that reason to expound\nand emphasise general democratic tasks before the whole people, without for a moment\nconcealing our socialist convictions. He is no Social-Democrat who forgets in practice his\nobligation to be ahead of all in raising, accentuating, and solving every general democratic\nquestion.\n\u201dBut everyone agrees with this\u00a1\u2018 the impatient reader will exclaim, and the new instructions adopted by the last conference of the Union Abroad for the Editorial Board of\nRabocheye Dyelo definitely say: \u2019All events of social and political life that affect the proletariat either directly as a special class or as the vanguard of all the revolutionary forces\nin the struggle for freedom should serve as subjects for political propaganda and agitation\u201d\n(Two Conferences, p. , our italics). Yes, these are very true and very good words, and\nwe would be fully satisfied if Rabocheye Dyelo understood them and if it refrained from\nsaying in the next breath things that contradict them. For it is not enough to call ourselves\nthe \u201cvanguard\u201d, the advanced contingent; we must act in such a way that all the other contingents recognise and are obliged to admit that we are marching in the vanguard. And we\nask the reader: Are the representatives of the other \u201ccontingents\u201d such fools as to take our\nword for it when we say that we are the \u201cvanguard\u201d? just picture to yourselves the following: a Social-Democrat comes to the \u201ccontingent\u201d of Russian educated radicals, or liberal\nconstitutionalists, and says, We are the vanguard; \u201cthe task confronting us now is, as far as\npossible, to lend the economic struggle itself a political character\u201d. The radical, or constitutionalist, if he is at all intelligent (and there are many intelligent men among Russian radicals and constitutionalists), would only smile at such a speech and would say (to himself, of\ncourse, for in the majority of cases he is an experienced diplomat): \u201cYour \u2019vanguard\u2019 must\nbe made up of simpletons. They do not even understand that it is our task, the task of the\nprogressive representatives of bourgeois democracy to lend the workers\u2019 economic struggle\nitself a political character. Why, we too, like the West-European bourgeois, want to draw\nthe workers into politics, but only into trade-unionist, not into Social-Democratic politics.\nTrade-unionist politics of the working class is precisely bourgeois politics of the working\nclass, and this \u2019vanguard\u2019s\u2019 formulation of its task is the formulation of trade-unionist politics! Let them call themselves Social-Democrats to their heart\u2019s content, I am not a child\nto get excited over a label. But they must not fall under the influence of those pernicious\northodox doctrinaires, let them allow \u2019freedom of criticism\u2019 to those who unconsciously\nare driving Social-Democracy into trade-unionist channels.\u201d\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nAnd the faint smile of our constitutionalist will turn into Homeric laughter when he\nlearns that the Social-Democrats who talk of Social-Democracy as the vanguard, today,\nwhen spontaneity almost completely dominates our movement, fear nothing so much as\n\u201cbelittling the spontaneous element\u201d, as \u201cunderestimating the significance of the forward\nmovement of the drab everyday struggle, as compared with the propaganda of brilliant and\ncompleted ideas\u201d, etc., etc.! A \u201cvanguard\u201d which fears that consciousness will outstrip\nspontaneity, which fears to put forward a bold \u201cplan\u201d that would compel general recognition even among those who differ with us. Are they not confusing \u201cvanguard\u201d with\n\u201crearguard\u201d?\nIndeed, let us examine the following piece of reasoning by Martynov. On page  he\nsays that Iskra is one-sided in its tactics of exposing abuses, that \u201chowever much we may\nspread distrust and hatred of the government, we shall not achieve our aim until we have\nsucceeded in developing sufficient active social energy for its overthrow\u201d. This, it may be\nsaid parenthetically, is the familiar solicitude for the activation of the masses, with a simultaneous striving to restrict one\u2019s own activity. But that is not the main point at the moment.\nMartynov speaks here, accordingly, of revolutionary energy (\u201cfor overthrowing\u201d). And\nwhat conclusion does he arrive at? Since in ordinary times various social strata inevitably\nmarch separately, \u201cit is therefore, clear that we Social-Democrats cannot simultaneously\nguide the activities of various opposition strata, we cannot dictate to them a positive programme of action, we cannot point out to them in what manner they should wage a day-today struggle for their interests.... The liberal strata will themselves take care of the active\nstruggle for their immediate interests, the struggle that will bring them face to face with our\npolitical regime\u201d (p. ). Thus, having begun with talk about revolutionary energy, about\nthe active struggle for the overthrow of the autocracy, Martynov immediately turns toward\ntrade union energy and active struggle for immediate interests! It goes without saying that\nwe cannot guide the struggle of the students, liberals, etc., for their \u201cimmediate interests\u201d;\nbut this was not the point at issue, most worthy Economist! The point we were discussing\nwas the possible and necessary participation of various social strata in the overthrow of the\nautocracy; and not only are we able, but it is our bounden duty, to guide these \u201cactivities of\nthe various opposition strata\u201d, if we desire to be the \u201cvanguard\u201d. Not only will our students\nand liberals, etc., themselves take care of \u201cthe struggle that brings them face to face with\nour political regime\u201d; the police and the officials of the autocratic government will see to\nthis first and foremost. But if \u201cwe\u201d desire to be front-rank democrats, we must make it\nour concern to direct the thoughts of those who are dissatisfied only with conditions at the\nuniversity, or in the Zemstvo, etc., to the idea that the entire political system is worthless.\nWe must take upon ourselves the task of organising an all-round political struggle under\nthe leadership of our Party in such a manner as to make it possible for all oppositional\nstrata to render their fullest support to the struggle and to our Party. We must train our\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nSocial-Democratic practical workers to become political leaders, able to guide all the manifestations of this all-round struggle, able at the right time to \u201cdictate a positive programme\nof action\u201d for the aroused students, the discontented Zemstvo people, the incensed religious sects, the offended elementary schoolteachers, etc., etc. For that reason, Martynov\u2019s\nassertion that \u201cwith regard to these, we can function merely in the negative role of exposers of abuses... we can only dissipate their hopes in various government commissions\u201d\nis completely false (our italics). By saying this, Martynov shows that he absolutely fails to\nunderstand the role that the revolutionary \u201cvanguard\u201d must really play. If the reader bears\nthis in mind, he will be clear as to the real meaning of Martynov\u2019s concluding remarks:\n\u201cIskra is the organ of the revolutionary opposition which exposes the state of affairs in our\ncountry, particularly the political state of affairs, insofar as it affects the interests of the most\nvaried strata of the population. We, however, work and will continue to work for the cause\nof the working class in close organic contact with the proletarian struggle. By restricting\nthe sphere of our active influence we deepen that influence\u201d (). The true sense of this\nconclusion is as follows: Iskra desires to elevate the trade-unionist politics of the working\nclass (to which, through misconception, through lack of training, or through conviction, our\npractical workers frequently confine themselves) to the level of Social-Democratic politics.\nRabocheye Dyelo, however, desires to degrade Social-Democratic politics to trade-unionist\npolitics. Moreover, it assures the world that the two positions are \u201centirely compatible\nwithin the common cause\u201d (). , sancta simplicitas!\nTo proceed. Have we sufficient forces to direct our propaganda and agitation among all\nsocial classes? Most certainly. Our Economists, who are frequently inclined to deny this,\nlose sight of the gigantic progress our movement has made from (approximately)  to\n. Like real \u201ctail-enders\u201d they often go on living in the bygone stages of the movement\u2019s inception. In the earlier period , indeed, we had astonishingly few forces, and it was\nperfectly natural and legitimate then to devote ourselves exclusively to activities among the\nworkers and to condemn severely any deviation from this course. The entire task then was\nto consolidate our position in the working class. At the present time, however, gigantic\nforces have been attracted to the movement. The best representatives of the younger generation of the educated classes are coming over to us. Everywhere in the provinces there\nare people, resident there by dint of circumstance, who have taken part in the movement\nin the past or who desire to do so now and who, are gravitating towards Social-Democracy\n(whereas in  one could count the Social-Democrats on the fingers of one\u2019s hand). A\nbasic political and organisational shortcoming of our movement is our inability to utilise\nall these forces and give them appropriate work (we shall deal with this more fully in the\nnext chapter). The overwhelming majority of these forces entirely lack the opportunity of\n\u201cgoing among the workers\u201d, so that there are no grounds for fearing that we shall divert\nforces from our main work. In order to be able to provide the workers with real, compre-\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nhensive, and live political knowledge, we must have \u201cour own people\u201d, Social-Democrats,\neverywhere, among all social strata, and in all positions from which we can learn the inner\nsprings of our state mechanism. Such people are required, not only for propaganda and\nagitation, but in a still larger measure for organisation.\nIs there a basis for activity among all classes of the population? Whoever doubts this lags\nin his consciousness behind the spontaneous awakening of the masses. The working-class\nmovement has aroused and is continuing to arouse discontent in some, hopes of support\nfor the opposition in others, and in still others the realisation that the autocracy is unbearable and must inevitably fall. We would be \u201cpoliticians\u201d and Social-Democrats in name\nonly (as all too often happens in reality), if we failed to realise that our task is to utilise\nevery manifestation of discontent, and to gather and turn to the best account every protest,\nhowever small. This is quite apart from the fact that the millions of the labouring peasantry, handicraftsmen, petty artisans, etc., would always listen eagerly to the speech of any\nSocial-Democrat who is at all qualified. Indeed, is there a single social class in which there\nare no individuals, groups, or circles that are discontented with the lack of rights and with\ntyranny and, therefore, accessible to the propaganda of Social-Democrats as the spokesmen of the most pressing general democratic needs? To those who desire to have a clear\nidea of what the political agitation of a Social-Democrat among all classes and strata of the\npopulation should be like, we would point to political exposures in the broad sense of the\nword as the principal (but, of course, not the sole) form of this agitation.\n\u201cWe must arouse in every section of the population that is at all politically conscious a\npassion for political exposure,\u201d l wrote in my article \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d [Iskra, May (No.\n), ], with which I shall deal in greater detail later. \u201cWe must not be discouraged\nby the fact that the voice of political exposure is today so feeble, timid, and infrequent.\nThis is not because of a wholesale submission to police despotism, but because those who\nare able and ready to make exposures have no tribune from which to speak, no eager and\nencouraging audience, they do not see anywhere among the people that force to which it\nwould be worth while directing their complaint against the \u2019omnipotent\u2019 Russian Government.... We are now in a position to provide a tribune for the nation-wide exposure of the\ntsarist government, and it is our duty to do this. That tribune must be a Social-Democratic\nnewspaper.\u201d\nThe ideal audience for political exposure is the working class, which is first and foremost in need of all-round and live political knowledge, and is most capable of converting\nthis knowledge into active struggle, even when that struggle does not promise \u201cpalpable results\u201d. A tribune for nation-wide exposures can be only an all-Russia newspaper. \u201cWithout\na political organ, a political movement deserving that name is inconceivable in the Europe\nof today\u201d; in this respect Russia must undoubtedly be included in present-day Europe. The\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\npress long ago became a power in our country, otherwise the government would not spend\ntens of thousands of rubles to bribe it and to subsidise the Katkovs and Meshcherskys. And\nit is no novelty in autocratic Russia for the underground press to break through the wall of\ncensorship and compel the legal and conservative press to speak openly of it. This was the\ncase in the seventies and even in the fifties. How much broader and deeper are now the sections of the people willing to read the illegal underground press, and to learn from it \u201chow\nto live and how to die\u201d\u2019, to use the expression of a worker who sent a letter to Iskra (No. ).\nPolitical exposures are as much a declaration of war against the government as economic\nexposures are a declaration of war against the factory owners. The moral significance of\nthis declaration of war will be all the greater, the wider and more powerful the campaign of\nexposure will be and the more numerous and determined the social class that has declared\nwar in order to begin the war. Hence, political exposures in themselves serve as a powerful instrument for disintegrating the system we oppose, as a means for diverting from the\nenemy his casual or temporary allies, as a means for spreading hostility and distrust among\nthe permanent partners of the autocracy.\nIn our time only a party that will organise really nation-wide exposures can become the\nvanguard of the revolutionary forces. The word \u201cnation-wide\u201d has a very profound meaning. The overwhelming majority of the non-working- class exposers (be it remembered that\nin order to become the vanguard, we must attract other classes) are sober politicians and\nlevel-headed men of affairs. They know perfectly well how dangerous it is to \u201ccomplain\u201d\neven against a minor official, let alone against the \u201comnipotent\u201d Russian Government. And\nthey will come to us with their complaints only when they see that these complaints can\nreally have effect, and that we represent a political force. In order to become such a force\nin the eyes of outsiders, much persistent and stubborn work is required to raise our own\nconsciousness, initiative, and energy.. To accomplish this it is not enough to attach a \u201cvanguard\u201d label to rearguard theory and practice.\nBut if we have to undertake the organisation of a really nationwide exposure of the\ngovernment, in what way will then the class character of our movement be expressed? \u2013 the\noverzealous advocate of \u201cclose organic contact with the proletarian struggle\u201d will ask us,\nas indeed he does. The reply is manifold: we Social-Democrats will organise these nationwide exposures; all questions raised by the agitation will he explained in a consistently\nSocial-Democratic spirit, without any concessions to deliberate or undeliberate distortions\nof Marxism; the all-round political agitation will be conducted by a party which unites into\none inseparable whole the assault on the government in the name of the entire people, the\nrevolutionary training of the proletariat, and the safeguarding of its political independence,\nthe guidance of the economic struggle of the working class, and the utilisation of all its\nspontaneous conflicts with its exploiters which rouse and bring into our camp increasing\nnumbers of the proletariat.\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nBut a most characteristic feature of Economism is its failure to understand this connection, more, this identity of the most pressing need of the proletariat (a comprehensive\npolitical education through the medium of political agitation and political exposures) with\nthe need of the general democratic movement. This lack of understanding is expressed, not\nonly in \u201cMartynovite\u201d phrases, but in the references to a supposedly class point of view\nidentical in meaning with these phrases. Thus, the authors of the Economist letter in Iskra,\nNo. , state: \u201cThis basic drawback of Iskra (overestimation of ideology] is also the\ncause of its inconsistency on the question of the attitude of Social-Democracy to the various\nsocial classes and tendencies. By theoretical reasoning (not by \u201dthe growth of Party tasks,\nwhich grow together with the Party\u201c), Iskra solved the problem of the immediate transition\nto the struggle against absolutism. In all probability it senses the difficulty of such a task\nfor the workers under the present state of affairs (not only senses, but knows full well that\nthis task appears less difficult to the workers than to the Economist intellectuals with their\nnursemaid concern, for the workers are prepared to fight even for demands which, to use\nthe language of the never-to-be-forgotten Martynov, do not \u201dpromise palpable results\u201c) but\nlacking the patience to wait until the workers will have gathered sufficient forces for this\nstruggle, Iskra begins to seek allies in the ranks of the liberals and intellectuals\u201d. . . .\nYes, we have indeed lost all \u201cpatience\u201d \u201cwaiting\u201d for the blessed time, long promised\nus by diverse \u201cconciliators\u201d, when the Economists will have stopped charging the workers\nwith their own backwardness and justifying their own lack of energy with allegations that\nthe workers lack strength. We ask our Economists: What do they mean by \u201cthe gathering\nof workingclass strength for the struggle\u201d? Is it not evident that this means the political\ntraining of the workers, so that all the aspects of our vile autocracy are revealed to them?\nAnd is it not clear that precisely for this work we need \u201callies in the ranks of the liberals and intellectuals\u201d, who are prepared to join us in the exposure of the political attack\non the Zemstvos, on the teachers, on the statisticians, on the students, etc.? Is this surprisingly \u201cintricate mechanism\u201d really so difficult to understand? Has not P. B. Axelrod\nconstantly repeated since  that \u201cthe task before the Russian Social-Democrats of acquiring adherents and direct and indirect allies among the non-proletarian classes will be\nsolved principally and primarily by the character of the propagandist activities conducted\namong the proletariat itself\u201d? But the Martynovs and the other Economists continue to\nimagine that \u201cby economic struggle against the employers and the government\u201d the workers must first gather strength (for trade-unionist politics) and then \u201cgo over\u201d \u2013 we presume\nfrom trade-unionist \u201ctraining for activity\u201d to Social-Democratic activity!\n\u201c...In this quest,\u201d continue the Economists, \u201cIskra not infrequently departs from the\nclass point of view, obscures class antagonisms, and puts into the forefront the common\nnature of the discontent with the government, although the causes and the degree of the\ndiscontent vary considerably among the \u2019allies\u2019. Such, for example, is Iskra\u2019s attitude\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\ntowards the Zemstvo . . .\u201d Iskra, it is alleged, \u201cpromises the nobles that are dissatisfied\nwith the government\u2019s sops the assistance of the working class, but it does not say a word\nabout the class antagonism that exists between these social strata\u201d. If the reader will turn\nto the article \u201cThe Autocracy and the Zemstvo\u201d (Iskra, Nos.  and ), to which, in all\nprobability, the authors of the letter refer, he will find that they deal with the attitude of\nthe government towards the \u201cmild agitation of the bureaucratic Zemstvo, which is based on\nthe social-estates\u201d, and towards the \u201cindependent activity of even the propertied classes\u201d.\nThe article states that the workers cannot look on indifferently while the government is\nwaging a struggle against the Zemstvo, and the Zemstvos are called upon to stop making\nmild speeches and to speak firmly and resolutely when revolutionary Social-Democracy\nconfronts the government in all its strength. What the authors of the letter do not agree\nwith here is not clear. Do they think that the workers will \u201cnot understand\u201d the phrases\n\u201cpropertied classes\u201d and \u201cbureaucratic Zemstvo based on the social-estates\u201d? Do they think\nthat urging the Zemstvo to abandon mild speeches and to speak firmly is \u201coverestimating\nideology\u201d? Do they imagine the workers can \u201cgather strength\u201d for the struggle against the\nautocracy if they know nothing about the attitude of the autocracy towards the Zemstvo as\nwell? All this too remains unknown. One thing alone is clear and that is that the authors\nof the letter have a very vague idea of what the political tasks of Social-Democracy are.\nThis is revealed still more clearly by their remark: \u201cSuch, too, is Iskra\u2019s attitude towards\nthe student movement\u201d (i.e., it also \u201cobscures the class antagonisms\u201d). Instead of calling\non the workers to declare by means of public demonstrations that the real breeding-place\nof unbridled violence, disorder, and outrage is not the university youth but the Russian\nGovernment (Iskra, No.  []) we ought probably to have inserted arguments in the spirit\nof Rabochaya Mysl! Such ideas were expressed by Social-Democrats in the autumn of\n, after the events of February and March, on the eve of a fresh upsurge of the student\nmovement, which reveals that even in this sphere the \u201cspontaneous\u201d protest against the\nautocracy is outstripping the conscious Social-Democratic leadership of the movement.\nThe spontaneous striving of the workers to defend the students who are being assaulted\nby the police and the Cossacks surpasses the conscious activity of the Social-Democratic\norganisation!\n\u201cAnd yet in other articles,\u201d continue the authors of the letter, \u201cIskra sharply condemns\nall compromise and defends, for instance, the intolerant conduct of the Guesdists.\u201d We\nwould advise those who are wont so conceitedly and frivolously to declare that the present\ndisagreements among the Social-Democrats are unessential and do not justify a split, to\nponder these words. Is it possible for people to work together in the same organisation,\nwhen some among them contend that we have done extremely little to explain the hostility\nof the autocracy to the various classes and to inform the workers of the opposition displayed\nby the various social strata to the autocracy, while others among them see in this clarifi-\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\ncation a \u201ccompromise\u201d \u2013 evidently a compromise with the theory of \u201ceconomic struggle\nagainst the employers and the government\u201d?\nWe urged the necessity of carrying the class struggle into the rural districts in connection with the fortieth anniversary of the emancipation of the peasantry (issue No.  and\nspoke of the irreconcilability of the local government bodies and the autocracy in relation\nto Witte\u2019s secret Memorandum (No. ). In connection with the new law we attacked the\nfeudal landlords and the government which serves them (No. ) and we welcomed the\nillegal Zemstvo congress. We urged the Zemstvo to pass over from abject petitions (No.\n\n) to struggle. We encouraged the students, who had begun to understand the need for\nthe political struggle, and to undertake this struggle (No. ), while, at the same time, we\nlashed out at the \u201coutrageous incomprehension\u201d revealed by the adherents of the \u201cpurely\nstudent\u201d movement, who called upon the students to abstain from participating in the street\ndemonstrations (No. , in connection with the manifesto issued by the Executive Committee of the Moscow students on February ). We exposed the \u201csenseless dreams\u201d and the\n\u201clying hypocrisy\u201d of the cunning liberals of Rossiya (No. ), while pointing to the violent\nfury with which the government-gaoler persecuted \u201cpeaceful writers, aged professors, scientists, and well-known liberal Zemstvo members\u201d (No. , \u201cPolice Raid on Literature\u201d).\nWe exposed the real significance of the programme of \u201cstate protection for the welfare of\nthe workers\u201d and welcomed the \u201cvaluable admission\u201d that \u201cit is better, by granting reforms\nfrom above, to forestall the demand for such reforms from below than to wait for those demands to be put forward\u201d (No. ). We encouraged the protesting statisticians (No. ) and\ncensured the strike-breaking statisticians (No. ). He who sees in these tactics an obscuring of the class-consciousness of the proletariat and a compromise with liberalism reveals\nhis utter failure to understand the true significance of the programme of the Credo and\ncarries out that programme de facto, however much he may repudiate it. For by such an\napproach he drags Social-Democracy towards the \u201ceconomic struggle against the employers and the government\u201d and yields to liberalism, abandons the task of actively intervening\nin every \u201cliberal\u201d issue and of determining his own, Social-Democratic, attitude towards\nthis question.\n.. ONCE MORE \u201cSLANDERERS\u201d, ONCE MORE \u201cMYSTIFIERS\u201d\nThese polite expressions, as the reader will recall, belong to Rabocheye Dyelo, which in\nthis way answers our charge that it \u201cis indirectly preparing the ground for converting the\nworking-class movement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy\u201d. In its simplicity\nof heart Rabocheye Dyelo decided that this accusation was nothing more than a polemical\nsally: these malicious doctrinaires are bent on saying all sorts of unpleasant things about us,\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nand, what can be more unpleasant than being an instrument of bourgeois democracy? And\nso they print in bold type a \u201crefutation\u201d: \u201cNothing but downright slander\u201d, \u201cmystification\u201d,\n\u201cmummery\u201d (Two Conferences, pp. , , ). Like Jove, Rabocheye Dyelo (although\nbearing little resemblance to that deity) is wrathful because it is wrong, and proves by its\nhasty abuse that it is incapable of understanding its opponents\u2019 mode of reasoning. And\nyet, with only a little reflection it would have understood why any subservience to the\nspontaneity of the mass movement and any degrading of Social-Democratic politics to the\nlevel of trade-unionist politics mean preparing the ground for converting the working-class\nmovement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy. The spontaneous working-class\nmovement is by itself able to create (and inevitably does create) only trade-unionism, and\nworking-class trade-unionist politics is precisely working-class bourgeois politics. The fact\nthat the working class participates in the political struggle, and even in the political revolution, does not in itself make its politics Social-Democratic politics. Will Rabocheye Dyelo\nmake bold to deny this? Will it, at long last, publicly, plainly, and without equivocation\nexplain how it understands the urgent questions of international and of Russian SocialDemocracy? Hardly. It will never do anything of the kind, because it holds fast to the trick,\nwhich might be described as the \u201cnot here\u201d method \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s not my horse, I\u2019m\nnot the driver. We are not Economists; Rabochaya Mysl does not stand for E\u2019conomism;\nthere is no Economism at all in Russia.\u201d This is a remarkably adroit and \u201cpolitical\u201d trick,\nwhich suffers from the slight defect, however, that the publications practising it are usually\nnicknamed, \u201cAt your service, sir\u201d.\nRabocheye Dyelo imagines that bourgeois democracy in Russia is, in general, merely\na \u201cphantom\u201d (Two Conferences, p. ). Happy people! Ostrich-like, they bury their\nheads in the sand and imagine that everything around has disappeared. Liberal publicists\nwho month after month proclaim to the world their triumph over the collapse and even\nthe disappearance of Marxism; liberal newspapers (S. Peterburgskiye Vedomosti, Russkiye\nVedomosti, and many others) which encourage the liberals who bring to the workers the\nBrentano conception of the class struggle and the trade-unionist conception of politics; the\ngalaxy of critics of Marxism, whose real tendencies were so very well disclosed by the\nCredo and whose literary products alone circulate in Russia without let or hindrance; the\nrevival of revolutionary non-Social-Democratic tendencies, particularly after the February\nand March events \u2013 all these, apparently, are just phantoms! All these have nothing at all\nto do with bourgeois democracy!\nRabocheye Dyelo and the authors of the Economist letter published in Iskra, No. ,\nshould \u201cponder over the reason why the events of the spring brought about such a revival\nof revolutionary non-Social-Democratic tendencies instead of increasing the authority and\nthe prestige of Social-Democracy\u201d.\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nThe reason lies in the fact that we failed to cope with our tasks. The masses of the workers proved to be more active than we. We lacked adequately trained revolutionary leaders\nand organisers possessed of a thorough knowledge of the mood prevailing among all the\nopposition strata and able to head the movement, to turn a spontaneous demonstration into\na political one, broaden its political character, etc. Under such circumstances, our backwardness will inevitably be utilised by the more mobile and more energetic non-SocialDemocratic revolutionaries, and the workers, however energetically and self-sacrificingly\nthey may fight the police and the troops, however revolutionary their actions may be, will\nprove to be merely a force supporting those revolutionaries, the rearguard of bourgeois\ndemocracy, and not the Social-Democratic vanguard. Let us take, for example, the German\nSocial-Democrats, whose weak aspects alone our Economists desire to emulate. Why is\nthere not a single political event in Germany that does not add to the authority and prestige\nof Social-Democracy? Because Social-Democracy is always found to be in advance of all\nothers in furnishing the most revolutionary appraisal of every given event and in championing every protest against tyranny. It does not lull itself with arguments that the economic\nstruggle brings the workers to realise that they have no political rights and that the concrete\nconditions unavoidably impel the working-class movement on to the path of revolution. It\nintervenes in every sphere and in every question of social and political life; in the matter of\nWilhelm\u2019s refusal to endorse a bourgeois progressist as city mayor (our Economists have\nnot yet managed to educate. the Germans to the understanding that such an act is, in fact, a\ncompromise with liberalism!); in the matter of the law against \u201cobscene\u201d publications and\npictures; in the matter of governmental influence on the election of professors, etc., etc.\nEverywhere the Social-Democrats are found in the forefront, rousing political discontent\namong all classes, rousing the sluggards, stimulating the laggards, and providing a wealth\nof material for the development of the political consciousness and the political activity of\nthe proletariat. As a result, even the avowed enemies of socialism are filled with respect for\nthis advanced political fighter, and not infrequently an important document from bourgeois,\nand even from bureaucratic and Court circles, makes its way by some miraculous means\ninto the editorial office of Vorwarts.\nThis, then, is the resolution of the seeming \u201ccontradiction\u201d that surpasses Rabocheye\nDyelo\u2019s powers of understanding to such an extent that it can only throw up its hands\nand cry, \u201cMummery!\u201d Indeed, just think of it: We, Rabocheye Dyelo, regard the mass\nworking-class movement as the corner-stone (and say so in bold type!); we warn all and\nsundry against belittling the significance of the element of spontaneity; we desire to lend\nthe economic struggle itself \u2013 itself \u2013 a political character; we desire to maintain close and\norganic contact with the proletarian struggle. And yet we are told that we are preparing the\nground for the conversion of the working-class movement into an instrument of bourgeois\ndemocracy! And who are they that presume to say this? People who \u201ccompromise\u201d with\n TRADE-UNIONIST POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS\nliberalism by intervening in every \u201cliberal\u201d issue (what a gross misunderstanding of \u201corganic contact with the proletarian struggle\u201d!), by devoting so much attention to the students\nand even (oh horror!) to the Zemstvos! People who in general wish to devote a greater percentage (compared with the Economists) of their efforts to activity among non-proletarian\nclasses of the population! What is this but \u201cmummery\u201d?\nPoor Rabocheye Dyelo! Will it ever find the solution to this perplexing puzzle?\nCHAPTER \nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE\nECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION\nOF THE REVOLUTIONARIES\nRabocheye Dyelo\u2019s assertions, which we have analyzed, that the economic struggle is the\nmost widely applicable means of political agitation and that our task now is to lend the\neconomic struggle itself a political character, etc., express a narrow view, not only of our\npolitical, but also of our organizational tasks. The \u201ceconomic struggle against the employers and the government\u201d does not at all require an all-Russia centralized organization, and\nhence this struggle can never give rise to such an organization as will combine, in one\ngeneral assault, all the manifestations of political opposition, protest, and indignation, an\norganization that will consist of professional revolutionaries and be led by the real political\nleaders of the entire people. This stands to reason. The character of any organization is\nnaturally and inevitably determined by the content of its activity. Consequently, Rabocheye\nDyelo, by the assertions analyzed above, sanctifies and legitimizes not only narrowness of\npolitical activity, but also of organizational work. In this case, Rabocheye Dyelo, as always, proves itself an organ whose consciousness yields to spontaneity. Yet subservience\nto spontaneously developing forms of organisation, failure to realise the narrowness and\nprimitiveness of our organisational work, of our \u201chandicraft\u201d methods in this most important sphere, failure to realise this, I say, is a veritable ailment from which our movement\nsuffers. It is not an ailment that comes with decline, but one, of course, that comes with\ngrowth. It is however at the present time, when the wave of spontaneous indignation, as\nit were, is sweeping over us, leaders and organisers of the movement, that an irreconcilable struggle must be waged against all defence of backwardness, against any legitimation\nof narrowness in this matter. It is particularly necessary to arouse in all who participate\n\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nin practical work, or are preparing to take up that work, discontent with the amateurism\nprevailing among us and an unshakable determination to rid ourselves of it.\n.. WHAT IS PRIMITIVENESS?\nWe shall try to answer this question by giving a brief description of the activity of a typical Social-Democratic study circle of the period -. We have noted that the entire\nstudent youth of the period was absorbed in Marxism. Of course, these students were not\nonly, or even not so much, interested in Marxism as a theory; they were interested in it as an\nanswer to the question, \u201cWhat is to be done?\u201d, as a call to take the field against the enemy.\nThese new warriors marched to battle with astonishingly primitive equipment and training.\nIn a vast number of cases they had almost no equipment and absolutely no training. They\nmarched to war like peasants from the plough, armed only with clubs. A students\u2019 circle\nestablishes contacts with workers and sets to work, without any connection with the old\nmembers of the movement, without any connection with study circles in other districts,\nor even in other parts of the same city (or in other educational institutions), without any\norganisation of the various divisions of revolutionary work, without any systematic plan\nof activity covering any length of time. The circle gradually expands its propaganda and\nagitation; by its activities it wins the sympathies of fairly large sections of workers and of a\ncertain section of the educated strata, which provide it with money and from among whom\nthe \u201ccommittee\u201d recruits new groups of young people. The attractive power of the committee (or League of Struggle) grows, its sphere of activity becomes wider, and the committee\nexpands this activity quite spontaneously; the very people who a year or a few months\npreviously spoke at the students\u2019 circle gatherings and discussed the question, \u201cWhither?\u201d,\nwho established and maintained contacts with the workers and wrote and published leaflets,\nnow, establish contacts with other groups of revolutionaries, procure literature, set to work\nto publish a local newspaper, begin to talk of organising a demonstration, and finally turn\nto open warfare (which may, according to circumstances, take the form of issuing the first\nagitational leaflet or the first issue of a newspaper, or of organising the first demonstration).\nUsually the initiation of such actions ends in an immediate and complete fiasco. Immediate\nand complete, because this open warfare was not the result of a systematic and carefully\nthought-out and gradually prepared plan for a prolonged and stubborn struggle, but simply\nthe result of the spontaneous growth of traditional study circle work; because, naturally,\nthe police, in almost every case, knew the principal leaders of the local movement, since\nthey had already \u201cgained a reputation\u201d for themselves in their student days, and the police\nwaited only for the right moment to make their raid. They deliberately allowed the study\ncircle sufficient time to develop its work so that they might, obtain a palpable corpus delicti,\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nand they always permitted several of the persons known to them to remain at liberty \u201cfor\nbreeding\u201d (which, as far as I know, is the technical term used both by our people and by\nthe gendarmes). One cannot help comparing this kind of warfare with that conducted by\na mass of peasants, armed with clubs, against modern troops. And one can only wonder\nat the vitality of the movement which expanded, grew, and scored victories despite the total lack of training on the part of the fighters. True, from the historical point of view, the\nprimitiveness of equipment was not only inevitable at first, but even legitimate as one of the\nconditions for the wide recruiting of fighters, but as soon as serious war operations began\n(and they began in fact with the strikes in the summer of ), the defects in our fighting\norganisations made themselves felt to an ever-increasing degree. The government, at first\nthrown into confusion and committing a number of blunders (e.g., its appeal to the public\ndescribing the misdeeds of the socialists, or the banishment of workers from the capitals to\nprovincial industrial centres), very soon adapted itself to the new conditions of the struggle\nand managed to deploy well its perfectly equipped detachments of agents provocateurs,\nspies, and gendarmes. Raids became so frequent, affected such a vast number of people,\nand cleared out the local study circles so thoroughly that the masses of the workers lost\nliterally all their leaders, the movement assumed an amazingly sporadic character, and it\nbecame utterly impossible to establish continuity and coherence in the work. The terrible\ndispersion of the local leaders; the fortuitous character of the study circle memberships;\nthe lack of training in, and the narrow outlook on, theoretical, political, and organisational\nquestions were all the inevitable result of the conditions described above. Things have\nreached such a pass that in several places the workers, because of our lack of self-restraint\nand the inability to maintain secrecy, begin to lose faith in the intellectuals and to avoid\nthem; the intellectuals, they say, are much too careless and cause police raids!\nAnyone who has the slightest knowledge of the movement is aware that all thinking\nSocial-Democrats have at last begun to regard these amateurish methods as a disease. In\norder that the reader who is not acquainted with the movement may have no grounds for\nthinking that we are \u201cinventing\u201d a special stage or special disease of the movement, we\nshall refer once again to the witness we have quoted. We trust we shall be forgiven for the\nlength of the passage:\n\u201cWhile the gradual transition to more extensive practical activity,\u201d writes B-v in Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , \u201ca transition that is directly dependent on the general transitional period\nthrough which the Russian working-class movement is now passing, is a characteristic feature, . . . there is, however, another, no less interesting feature in the general mechanism\nof the Russian workers\u2019 revolution. We refer to the general lack of revolutionary forces fit\nfor action, [all italics ours \u2013 Lenin] which is felt not only in St. Petersburg, but throughout\nRussia. With the general revival of the working-class movement, with the general development of the working masses, with the growing frequency of strikes, with the increasingly\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nopen mass struggle of the workers and with the intensified government persecution, arrests,\ndeportation, and exile, this lack of highly skilled revolutionary forces is becoming more and\nmore marked and, without a doubt, cannot but affect the depth and the general character of\nthe movement. Many strikes take place without any strong and direct influence upon them\nby the revolutionary organisations.... A shortage of agitational leaflets and illegal literature\nIs felt.... The workers\u2019 study circles are left without agitators.... In addition, there is a constant dearth of funds. In a word, the growth of the working class movement is outstripping\nthe growth and development of the revolutionary organisations. The numerical strength of\nthe active revolutionaries is too small to enable them to concentrate in their own hands the\ninfluence exercised upon the whole mass of discontented workers, or to give this discontent\neven a shadow of coherence and organisation.... The separate study circles, the separate\nrevolutionaries, scattered, uncombined, do not represent a single, strong, and disciplined\norganisation with proportionately developed parts. . . .\u201d Admitting that the immediate\norganization of fresh study circles to replace those that have been broken up merely proves\nthe vitality of the movement ... but does not prove the existence of an adequate number\nof adequately prepared revolutionary workers, the author concludes: \u201cThe lack of practical training among the St. Petershurg revolutionaries is seen in the results of their work.\nThe recent trials, especially that of the Self-Emancipation Group and the Labour-againstCapital group, clearly showed that the young agitator, lacking a detailed knowledge of\nworking class conditions and, consequently, of the conditions under which agitation can be\ncarried on in a given factory, ignorant of the principles of secrecy, and understanding only\nthe general principles of Social-Democracy [if he does], is able to carry on his work for\nperhaps four, five, or six months. Then come arrests, which frequently lead to the break-up\nof the entire organisation, or at all events, of part of it. The question arises, therefore, can\nthe group conduct successful activity if its existence is measured by months?... Obviously,\nthe defects of the existing organisations cannot be wholly ascribed to the transitional period.... Obviously, the numerical, and above all the qualitative, make-up of the functioning\norganisations is no small factor, and the first task our Social-Democrats must undertake\n... is that of effectively combining the organisations and making a strict selection of their\nmembership.\u201d\n.. PRIMITIVENESS AND ECONOMISM\nWe must now deal with a question that has undoubtedly come to the mind of every reader.\nCan a connection be established between primitiveness as growing pains that affect the\nwhole movement, and Economism, which is one of the currents in Russian Social-Democracy?\nWe think that it can. Lack of practical training, of ability to carry on organisational work\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nis certainly common to us all, including those who have from the very outset unswervingly\nstood for revolutionary Marxism. Of course, were it only lack of practical training, no one\ncould blame the practical workers. But the term \u201cprimitiveness\u201d embraces something more\nthan lack of training; it denotes a narrow scope of revolutionary work generally, failure to\nunderstand that a good organisation of revolutionaries cannot be built on the basis of such\nnarrow activity, and lastly \u2013 and this is the main thing \u2013 attempts to justify this narrowness\nand to elevate it to a special \u201ctheory\u201d, i.e., subservience to spontaneity on this question\ntoo. Once such attempts were revealed, it became clear that primitiveness is connected\nwith Economism and that we shall never rid ourselves of this narrowness of our organisational activity until we rid ourselves of Economism generally (i.e., the narrow conception\nof Marxist theory, as well as of the role of Social-Democracy and of its political tasks).\nThese attempts manifested themselves in a twofold direction. Some began to say that the\nworking masses themselves have not yet advanced the broad and militant political tasks\nwhich the revolutionaries are attempting to \u201cimpose\u201d on them; that they must continue to\nstruggle for immediate political demands, to conduct \u201cthe economic struggle against the\nemployers and the government\u201d (and, naturally, corresponding to this struggle which is\n\u201caccessible\u201d to the mass movement there must be an organisation that will be \u201caccessible\u201d\nto the most untrained youth). Others, far removed from any theory of \u201cgradualness\u201d, said\nthat it is possible and necessary to \u201cbring about a political revolution\u201d, but that this does not\nrequire building a strong organisation of revolutionaries to train the proletariat in steadfast\nand stubborn struggle. All we need do is to snatch up our old friend, the \u201caccessible\u201d cudgel. To drop metaphor, it means that we must organise a general strike, or that we must\nstimulate the \u201cspiritless\u201d progress of the working-class movement by means of \u201cexcitative\nterror\u201d. Both these trends, the opportunists and the \u201crevolutionists\u201d, bow to the prevailing\namateurism; neither believes that it can be eliminated, neither understands our primary and\nimperative practical task to establish an organisation of revolutionaries capable of lending\nenergy, stability, and continuity to the political struggle.\nWe have quoted the words of B-v: \u201cThe growth of the working-class movement is outstripping the growth and development of the revolutionary organisations.\u201d This \u201cvaluable\nremark of a close observer\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s comment on B-v\u2019s article) has a twofold\nvalue for us. It shows that we were right in our opinion that the principal cause of the\npresent crisis in Russian Social-Democracy is the lag of the leaders (\u201cideologists\u201d, revolutionaries, Social-Democrats) behind the spontaneous upsurge of the masses. It shows that\nall the arguments advanced by the authors of the Economist letter (in Iskra, No. ), by\nKrichevsky and by Martynov, as to the danger of belittling the significance of the spontaneous element, of the drab everyday struggle, as to tactics-as-process, etc., are nothing more\nthan a glorification and a defence of primitiveness. These people who cannot pronounce\nthe word \u201ctheoretician\u201d without a sneer, who describe their genuflections to common lack\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nof training and backwardness as a \u201csense for the realities of life\u201d, reveal in practice a failure to understand our most imperative practical tasks. To laggards they shout: Keep in\nstep! Don\u2019t run ahead! To people suffering from a lack of energy and initiative in organisational work, from a lack of \u201cplans\u201d for wide and bold activity, they prate about \u201ctacticsas-process\u201d! The worst sin we commit is that we degrade our political and organisational\ntasks to the level of the immediate, \u201cpalpable\u201d, \u201cconcrete\u201d interests of the everyday economic struggle; yet they keep singing to us the same refrain: Lend the economic struggle\nitself a political character! We repeat: this kind of thing displays as much \u201csense for the\nrealities of life\u201d as was displayed by the hero in the popular fable who cried out to a passing\nfuneral procession, \u201cMany happy returns of the day!\u201d\nRecall the matchless, truly \u201cNarcissus-like\u201d superciliousness with which these wiseacres\nlectured Plekhanov on the \u201cworkers\u2019 circles generally\u201d (sic!) being \u201cunable to cope with\npolitical tasks in the real and practical sense of the word, i.e., in the sense of the expedient\nand successful practical struggle for political demands\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s Reply, p. ).\nThere are circles and circles, gentlemen! Circles of \u201camateurs\u201d are not, of course, capable\nof coping with political tasks so long as they have not become aware of their amateurism\nand do not abandon it. If, besides this, these amateurs are enamoured of their primitive\nmethods, and insist on writing the word \u201cpractical\u201d in italics, and imagine that being practical demands that one\u2019s tasks be reduced to the level of understanding of the most backward strata of the masses, then they are hopeless amateurs and, of course, certainly cannot\nin general cope with any political tasks. But a circle of leaders, of the type of Alexeyev\nand Myshkin, of Khalturin and Zhelyabov, is capable of coping with political tasks in the\ngenuine and most practical sense of the term, for the reason and to the extent that their impassioned propaganda meets with response among the spontaneously awakening masses,\nand their sparkling energy is answered and supported by the energy of the revolutionary\nclass. Plekhanov was profoundly right, not only in pointing to this revolutionary class and\nproving that its spontaneous awakening was inevitable, but in setting even the \u201cworkers\u2019\ncircles\u201d a great and lofty political task. But you refer to the mass movement that has sprung\nup since that time in order to degrade this task, to curtail the energy and scope of activity\nof the \u201cworkers\u2019 circles\u201d. If you are not amateurs enamoured of your primitive methods,\nwhat are you then? You boast that you are practical, but you fail to see what every Russian practical worker knows, namely, the miracles that the energy, not only of a circle, but\neven of an individual person is able to perform in the revolutionary cause. Or do you think\nthat our movement cannot produce leaders like those of the seventies? If so, why do you\nthink so? Because we lack training? But we are training ourselves, we will go on training\nourselves, and we will be trained! Unfortunately it is true that the surface of the stagnant\nwaters of the \u201ceconomic struggle against the employers and the government\u201d is overgrown\nwith fungus; people have appeared among us who kneel in prayer to spontaneity, gazing\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nwith awe (to take an expression from Plekhanov) upon the \u201cposterior\u201d of the Russian proletariat. But we will get rid of this fungus. The time has come when Russian revolutionaries,\nguided by a genuinely revolutionary theory, relying upon the genuinely revolutionary and\nspontaneously awakening class, can at last \u2013 at long last! \u2013 rise to full stature in all their\ngiant strength. All that is required is for the masses of our practical workers, and the still\nlarger masses of those who dreamed of practical work when they were still at school, to\npour scorn and ridicule upon any suggestion that may be made to degrade our political\ntasks and to restrict the scope of our organisational work. And we will achieve that, rest\nassured, gentlemen!\nIn the article \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d, I wrote in opposition to Rabocheye Dyelo: \u201cThe tactics\nof agitation in relation to some special question, or the tactics with regard to some detail\nof party organisation may be changed in twenty-four hours; but only people devoid of all\nprinciple are capable of changing, in twenty-four hours, or, for that matter, in twenty-four\nmonths, their view on the necessity- \u2013 in general, constantly, and absolutely \u2013 of an organisation of struggle and of political agitation among the masses.\u201d To this Rabocheye Dyelo\nreplied: \u201cThis, the only one of Iskra\u2019s charges that makes a pretence of being based on\nfacts, is totally without foundation. Readers of Rabocheye Dyelo know very well that from\nthe outset we not only called for political agitation, without waiting for the appearance of\nIskra ... [saying at the same time that not only the workers\u2019 study circles, \u201dbut also the\nmass working-class movement could not regard as its first political task the overthrow of\nabsolutism\u201c, but only the struggle for immediate political demands, and that \u201dthe masses\nbegin to understand immediate political demands after one, or at all events, after several\nstrikes\u201c], . . . but that with our publications which we furnished from abroad for the comrades working in Russia, we provided the only Social-Democratic political and agitational\nmaterial ... [and in this sole material you not only based the widest political agitation exclusively on the economic struggle, but you even went to the extent of claiming that this\nrestricted agitation was the \u201dmost widely applicable\u201c. And do you not observe, gentlemen,\nthat your own argument \u2013 that this was the only material provided \u2013 proves the necessity for\nIskra\u2019s appearance, and its struggle against Rabocheye Dyelo?).... On the other hand, our\npublishing activity actually prepared the ground for the tactical unity of the Party... [unity\nin the conviction that tactics is a process of growth of Party tasks that grow together with\nthe Party? A precious unity indeed!]... and by that rendered possible the creation of a \u2019militant organisation\u2019 for which the Union Abroad did all that an organisation abroad could\ndo\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , p. ). A vain attempt at evasion! I would never dream of\ndenying that you did all you possibly could. I have asserted and assert now that the limits\nof what is \u201cpossible\u201d for you to do are restricted by the narrowness of your outlook. It is\nridiculous to talk of a \u201cmilitant organisation\u201d to fight for \u201cimmediate political demands\u201d,\nor to conduct the economic struggle against the employers and the government\u201c.\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nBut if the reader wishes to see the pearls of \u201dEconomist\u201c infatuation with amateurism,\nhe must, of course, turn from the eclectic and vacillating Rabocheye Dyelo to the consistent\nand determined Rabochaya Mysl. In its Separate Supplement, p. , R. M. wrote: \u201dNow\ntwo words about the so-called revolutionary intelligentsia proper. True, on more than one\noccasion it has proved itself prepared \u2019to enter into determined battle with tsarism\u2019. The\nunfortunate thing, however, is that our revolutionary intelligentsia, ruthlessly persecuted\nby the political police, imagined the struggle against the political police to be the political\nstruggle against the autocracy. That is why, to this day, it cannot understand \u2019where the\nforces for the struggle against the autocracy are to be obtained\u2019.\u201c\nTruly matchless is the lofty contempt for the struggle against the police displayed by this\nworshipper (in the worst sense of the word) of the spontaneous movement! He is prepared\nto justify our inability to organise secret activity by the argument that with the spontaneous\nmass movement it is not at all important for us to struggle against the political police! Very\nfew people indeed would subscribe to this appalling conclusion; to such an extent have our\ndeficiencies in revolutionary organisations become a matter of acute importance. But if\nMartynov, for example, refuses to subscribe to this, it will only be because he is unable, or\nlacks the courage, to think out his ideas to their logical conclusion. Indeed, does the \u201dtask\u201c\nof advancing concrete demands by the masses, demands that promise palpable results, call\nfor special efforts to create a stable, centralised, militant organisation of revolutionaries?\nCannot such a \u201dtask\u201c be carried out even by masses that do not \u201dstruggle against the political police\u201c at all? Could this task, moreover, be fulfilled if, in addition to the few leaders, it\nwere not undertaken by such workers (the overwhelming majority) as are quite incapable\nof \u201dstruggling against the political police\u201c? Such workers, average people of the masses,\nare capable of displaying enormous energy and selfsacrifice in strikes and in street, battles\nwith the police and the troops, and are capable (in fact, are alone capable) of determining\nthe outcome of our entire movement \u2013 but the struggle against the political police requires\nspecial qualities; it requires professional revolutionaries. And we must see to it, not only\nthat the masses \u201dadvance\u201c concrete demands, but that the masses of the workers \u201dadvance\u201c\nan increasing number of such professional revolutionaries. Thus, we have reached the question of the relation between an organisation of professional revolutionaries and the labour\nmovement pure and simple. Although this question has found little reflection in literature,\nit has greatly engaged us \u201dpoliticians\u201c in conversations and polemics with comrades who\ngravitate more or less towards Economism. It is a question meriting special treatment. But\nbefore taking it up, let us offer one further quotation by way of illustrating our thesis on the\nconnection between primitiveness and Economism.\nIn his Reply, Mr. N. N. wrote: \u201dThe Emancipation of Labour group demands direct\nstruggle against the government without first considering where the material forces for this\nstruggle are to be obtained, and without indicating the path of the struggle.\u201c Emphasising\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nthe last words, the author adds the following footnote to the word \u201dPath\u201c: \u201dThis cannot be\nexplained by purposes of secrecy, because the programme does not refer to a plot but to\na mass movement. And the masses cannot proceed by secret paths. Can we conceive of\na secret strike? Can we conceive of secret demonstrations and petitions\u00bf\u2018 (Vademecum, p.\n.) Thus, the author comes quite close to the question of the \u201dmaterial forces\u201c (organisers of strikes and demonstrations) and to the \u201dpaths\u201c of the struggle, but, nevertheless, is\nstill in a state of consternation, because he \u201dworships\u201c the mass movement, i.e., he regards\nit as something that relieves us of the necessity of conducting revolutionary activity and\nnot as something that should encourage us and stimulate our revolutionary activity. It is\nimpossible for a strike to remain a secret to those participating in it and to those immediately associated with it, but it may (and in the majority of cases does) remain a \u201dsecret\u201c\nto the masses of the Russian workers, because the government takes care to cut all communication with the strikers, to prevent all news of strikes from spreading. Here indeed is\nwhere a special \u201dstruggle against the political police\u201c is required, a struggle that can never\nbe conducted actively by such large masses as take part in strikes. This struggle must be\norganised, according to \u201dall the rules of the art\u201c, by people who are professionally engaged\nin revolutionary activity. The fact that the masses are spontaneously being drawn into the\nmovement does not make the organisation of this struggle less necessary. On the contrary,\nit makes it more necessary; for we socialists would be failing in our direct duty to the\nmasses if we did not prevent the police from making a secret of every strike and every\ndemonstration (and if we did not ourselves from time to time secretly prepare strikes and\ndemonstrations). And we will succeed in doing this, because the spontaneously awakening\nmasses will also produce increasing, numbers of \u201dprofessional revolutionaries\u201c from their\nown ranks (that is, if we do not take it into our heads to advise the workers to keep on\nmarking time).\n.. ORGANISATION OF WORKERS AND ORGANISATION OF\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nIt is only natural to expect that for a Social-Democrat whose conception of the political\nstruggle coincides with the conception of the \u201deconomic struggle against the employers\nand the government\u201c, the \u201dorganisation of revolutionaries\u201c will more or less coincide with\nthe \u201dorganisation of workers\u201c. This, in fact, is what actually happens; so that when we\nspeak of organisation, we literally speak in different tongues. I vividly recall, for example, a conversation I once had with a fairly consistent Economist, with whom I had not\nbeen previously acquainted. We were discussing the pamphlet, Who Will Bring About the\nPolitical Revolution? and were soon of a mind that its principal defect was its ignoring\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nof the question of organisation. We had begun to assume full agreement between us; but,\nas the conversation proceeded, it became evident that we were talking of different things.\nMy interlocutor accused the author of ignoring strike funds, mutual benefit societies, etc.,\nwhereas I had in mind an organisation of revolutionaries as an essential factor in \u201dbringing about\u201c the political revolution. As soon as the disagreement became clear, there was\nhardly, as I remember, a single question of principle upon which I was in agreement with\nthe Economist!\nWhat was the source of our disagreement? It was the fact that on questions both of organisation and of politics the Economists are forever lapsing from Social-Democracy into\ntrade-unionism. The political struggle of Social-Democracy is far more extensive and complex than the economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the government.\nSimilarly (indeed for that reason), the organisation of the revolutionary Social-Democratic\nParty must inevitably be of a kind different from the organisation of the workers designed\nfor this struggle. The workers\u2019 organisation must in the first place be a trade union organisation; secondly, it must be as broad as possible; and thirdly, it must be as public as\nconditions will allow (here, and further on, of course, I refer only to absolutist Russia). On\nthe other hand, the organisation of the revolutionaries must consist first and foremost of\npeople who make revolutionary activity their profession (for which reason I speak of the\norganisation of revolutionaries, meaning revolutionary Social-Democrats). In view of this\ncommon characteristic of the members of such an organisation, all distinctions as between\nworkers and intellectuals, not to speak of distinctions of trade and profession, in both categories, must be effaced. Such an organisation must perforce not be very extensive and must\nbe as secret as possible. Let us examine this threefold distinction.\nIn countries where political liberty exists the distinction between a trade union and a\npolitical organisation is clear enough, as is the distinction between trade unions and SocialDemocracy. The relations between the latter and the former will naturally vary in each\ncountry according to historical, legal, and other conditions; they may be more or less close,\ncomplex, etc. (in our opinion they should be as close and as little complicated as possible);\nbut there can be no question in free countries of the organisation of trade unions coinciding with the organisation of the Social-Democratic Party. In Russia, however, the yoke\nof the autocracy appears at first glance to obliterate all distinctions between the SocialDemocratic organisation and the workers\u2019 associations, since all workers\u2019 associations and\nall study circles are prohibited, and since the principal manifestation and weapon of the\nworkers\u2019 economic struggle \u2013 the strike \u2013 is regarded as a criminal (and sometimes even\nas a political!) offence. Conditions in our country, therefore, on the one hand, strongly\n\u201dimpel\u201c the workers engaged in economic struggle to concern themselves with political\nquestions, and, on the other, they \u201dimpel\u201c Social-Democrats to confound trade-unionism\nwith Social-Democracy (and our Krichevskys, Martynoys, and Co., while diligently dis-\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\ncussing the first kind of \u201dimpulsion\u201c, fail to notice the second). Indeed, picture to yourselves people who are immersed ninety-nine per cent in \u201dthe economic struggle against the\nemployers and the government\u201c. Some of them will never, during the entire course of their\nactivity (from four to six months), be impelled to think of the need for a more complex\norganisation of revolutionaries. Others, perhaps, will come across the fairly widely distributed Bernsteinian literature, from which they will become convinced of the profound\nimportance of the forward movement of \u201dthe drab everyday struggle\u201c. Still others will be\ncarried away, perhaps, by the seductive idea of showing the world a new example of \u201dclose\nand organic contact with the proletarian struggle\u201c \u2013 contact between the trade union and\nthe Social Democratic movements. Such people may argue that the later a country enters\nthe arena of capitalism and, consequently, of the working-class movement, the more the\nsocialists in that country may take part in, and support, the trade union movement, and the\nless the reason for the existence of non-Social-Democratic trade unions. So far the argument is fully correct; unfortunately, however, some go beyond that and dream of a complete\nfusion of Social-Democracy with trade-unionism. We shall soon see, from the example of\nthe Rules of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle, what a harmful effect such dreams have\nupon our plans of organisation.\nThe workers\u2019 organisations for the economic struggle should be trade union organisations. Every Social-Democratic worker should as far as possible assist and actively work in\nthese organisations. But, while this is true, it is certainly not in our interest to demand that\nonly Social-Democrats should be eligible for membership in the \u201dtrade\u201c unions, since that\nwould only narrow the scope of our influence upon the masses. Let every worker who understands the need to unite for the struggle against the employers and the government join\nthe trade unions. The very aim of the trade unions would be impossible of achievement, if\nthey did not unite all who have attained at least this elementary degree of understanding, if\nthey were not very broad organisations. The broader these organisations, the broader will\nbe our influence over them \u2013 an influence due, not only to the \u201dspontaneous\u201c development\nof the economic struggle, but to the direct and conscious effort of the socialist trade union\nmembers to influence their comrades. But a broad organisation cannot apply methods of\nstrict secrecy (since this demands far greater training than is required for the economic\nstruggle). How is the contradiction between the need for a large membership and the need\nfor strictly secret methods to be reconciled? How are we to make the trade unions as public\nas possible? Generally speaking, there can be only two ways to this end: either the trade\nunions become legalised (in some countries this preceded the legalisation of the socialist\nand political unions), or the organisation is kept secret, but so \u201dfree\u201c and amorphous, lose\n[German \u201dloose\u201c \u2013Ed] as the Germans say, that the need for secret methods becomes almost\nnegligible as far as the bulk of the members is concerned.\nThe legalisation of non-socialist and non-political labour unions in Russia has begun,\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nand there is no doubt that every advance made by our rapidly growing Social-Democratic\nworking-class movement will multiply and encourage attempts at legalisation \u2013 attempts\nproceeding for the most part from supporters of the existing order, but partly also from\nthe workers themselves and from liberal intellectuals. The banner of legality has already\nbeen hoisted by the Vasilyevs and the Zubatovs. Support has been promised and rendered\nby the Ozerovs and the Wormses, and followers of the new tendency are now to be found\namong the workers. Henceforth, we cannot but reckon with this tendency. How we are to\nreckon with it, on this there can be no two opinions among Social-Democrats. We must\nsteadfastly expose any part played in this movement by the Zubatovs and the Vasilyeys,\nthe gendarmes and the priests, and explain their real intentions to the workers. We must\nalso expose all the conciliatory, \u201dharmonious\u201c notes that will be heard in the speeches of\nliberal politicians at legal meetings of the workers, irrespective of whether the speeches are\nmotivated by an earnest conviction of the desirability of peaceful class collaboration, by\na desire to curry favour with the powers that be, or whether they are simply the result of\nclumsiness. Lastly, we must warn the workers against the traps often set by the police, who\nat such open meetings and permitted societies spy out the \u201dfiery ones\u201c and try to make use\nof legal organisations to plant their agents provocateurs in the illegal organisations.\nDoing all this does not at all mean forgetting that in the long run the legalisation of the\nworking-class movement will be, to our advantage, and not to that of the Zubatovs. On the\ncontrary, it is precisely our campaign of exposure that will help us to separate the tares from\nthe wheat. What the tares are, we have already indicated. By the wheat we mean attracting\nthe attention of ever larger numbers, including the most backward sections, of the workers\nto social and political questions, and freeing ourselves, the revolutionaries, from functions\nthat are essentially legal (the distribution of legal books, mutual aid, etc.), the development\nof which will inevitably provide us with an increasing quantity of material for agitation. In\nthis sense, we may, and should, say to the Zubatovs and the Ozerovs: Keep at it, gentlemen,\ndo your best! Whenever you place a trap in the path of the workers (either by way of direct\nprovocation, or by the \u201dhonest\u201c demoralisation of the workers with the aid of \u201dStruvism\u201c)\nwe will see to it that you are exposed. But whenever you take a real step forward, though\nit be the most \u201dtimid zigzag\u201c, we will say: Please continue! And the only step that can be\na real step forward is a real, if small, extension of the workers\u2019 field of action. Every such\nextension will be to our advantage and will help to hasten the advent of legal societies of the\nkind in which it will not be agents provocateurs who are detecting socialists, but socialists\nwho are gaining adherents. in a word, our task is to fight the tares. It is not our business\nto grow wheat in flower-pots. By pulling up the tares, we clear the soil for the wheat. And\nwhile the Afanasy Ivanoviches and Pulkheria Ivanovnas are tending their flower-pot crops,\nwe must prepare the reapers, not only to cut down the tares of today, but to reap the wheat\nof tomorrow.\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nThus, we cannot by means of legalisation solve the problem of creating a trade union\norganisation that will be as little secret and as extensive as possible (but we should be\nextremely glad if the Zubatovs and the Ozerovs disclosed to us even a partial opportunity\nfor such a solution \u2013 to this end, however, we must strenuously combat them). There remain\nsecret trade union organisations, and we must give all possible assistance to the workers\nwho (as we definitely know) are adopting this course. Trade union organisations, not only\ncan be of tremendous value in developing and consolidating the economic struggle, but can\nalso become a very important auxiliary to political agitation and revolutionary organisation.\nIn order to achieve this purpose, and in order to guide the nascent trade union movement in\nthe channels desired by Social-Democracy, we must first understand clearly the absurdity\nof the plan of organisation the St. Petersburg Economists have been nursing for nearly five\nyears. That plan is set forth in the \u201dRules for a Workers\u2019 Mutual Benefit Fund\u201c of July \n(\u201dListok\u201c Rabotnika, No. -, p. , taken from Rabochaya Mysl, No. ), as well as in the\n\u201dRules for a Trade Union Workers\u2019 Organisation\u201c of October  (special leaflet printed\nin St. Petersburg and referred to in Iskra, No. ). Both these sets of rules have one main\nshortcoming: they set up the broad workers\u2019 organisation in a rigidly specified structure\nand confound it with the organisation of revolutionaries. Let us take the last-mentioned set\nof rules, since it is drawn up in greater detail. The body consists of fifty-two paragraphs.\nTwenty-three deal with the structure, the method of functioning, and the competence of\nthe \u201dworkers\u2019 circles\u201c, which are to be organised in every factory (\u201da maximum of ten\npersons\u201c) and which elect \u201dcentral (factory) groups\u201c. \u201dThe central group,\u201c says paragraph\n, \u201dobserves all that goes on in its factory or workshop and keeps a record of events.\u201c\n\u201dThe central group presents to subscribers a monthly financial account\u201c (par. ), etc. Ten\nparagraphs are devoted to the \u201ddistrict organisation\u201c, and nineteen to the highly complex\ninterconnection between the Committee of the Workers\u2019 Organisation and the Committee\nof the St. Petersburg League of Struggle (elected representatives of each district and of\nthe \u201dexecutive groups\u201c \u2013 \u201dgroups of propagandists, groups for maintaining contact with the\nprovinces, and with the organisation abroad, groups for managing stores; publications, and\nfunds\u201c).\nSocial-Democracy = \u201dexecutive groups\u201c in relation to the economic struggle of the\nworkers! It would be difficult to show more glaringly how the Economists\u2019 ideas deviate from Social-Democracy to trade-unionism, and how alien to them is any idea that a\nSocial-Democrat must concern himself first and foremost with an organisation of revolutionaries capable of guiding the entire proletarian struggle for emancipation. To talk of\n\u201dthe political emancipation of the working class\u201c and of the struggle against \u201dtsarist despotism\u201c, and at the same time to draft rules like these, means to have no idea whatsoever of\nthe real political tasks of Social-Democracy. Not one of the fifty or so paragraphs reveals\neven a glimmer of understanding that it is necessary to conduct the widest possible political\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nagitation among the masses, an agitation highlighting every aspect of Russian absolutism\nand the specific features of the various social classes in Russia. Rules like these are of no\nuse even for the achievement of trade union, let alone political, aims, since trade unions are\norganised by trades, of which no mention is made.\nBut most characteristic, perhaps, is the amazing top-heaviness of the whole \u201dsystem\u201c,\nwhich attempts to bind each single factory and its \u201dcommittee\u201c by a permanent string of\nuniform and ludicrously petty rules and a three-stage system of election. Hemmed in by\nthe narrow outlook of Economism, the mind is lost in details that positively reek of red tape\nand bureaucracy. In practice, of course, three-fourths of the clauses are never applied; on\nthe other hand, a \u201dsecret\u201c organisation of this kind, with its central group in each factory,\nmakes it very easy for the gendarmes to carry out raids on a vast scale. The Polish cornrades\nhave passed through a similar phase in their movement, with everybody enthusiastic about\nthe extensive organisation of workers\u2019 benefit funds; but they very quickly abandoned this\nidea when they saw that such organisations only provided rich harvests for the gendarmes.\nIf we have in mind broad workers\u2019 organisations, and not widespread arrests, if we do not\nwant to provide satisfaction to the gendarmes, we must see to it that these organisations\nremain without any rigid formal structure. But will they be able to function in that case?\nLet us see what the functions are: \u201d. . . To observe all that goes on in the factory and keep\na record of events\u201c (par.  of the Rules). Do we really require a formally established group\nfor this purpose? Could not the purpose be better served by correspondence conducted in\nthe illegal papers without the setting up of special groups? \u201d. . . To lead the struggles\nof the workers for the improvement of their workshop conditions\u201c (par. ). This, too,\nrequires no set organisational form. Any sensible agitator can in the course of ordinary\nconversation gather what the demands of the workers are and transmit them to a narrow \u2013\nnot a broad \u2013 organisation of revolutionaries for expression in a leaflet. \u201d ... To organise a\nfund ... to which subscriptions of two kopeks per ruble [of wages earned] should be made\u201c\n(par. ) \u2013 and then to present to subscribers a monthly financial account (par. ), to expel\nmembers who fail to pay their contributions (par. ), and so forth. Why, this is a very\nparadise for the police; for nothing would be easier for them than to penetrate into such a\nsecrecy of a \u201dcentral factory fund\u201c, confiscate the money, and arrest the best people. Would\nit not be simpler to issue one-kopek or two-kopek coupons bearing the official stamp of\na well-known (very narrow and very secret) organisation, or to make collections without\ncoupons of any kind and to print reports in a certain agreed code in an illegal paper? The\nobject would thereby be attained, but it would be a hundred times more difficult for the\ngendarmes to pick up clues.\nI could go on analysing the Rules, but I think that what has been said will suffice. A\nsmall, compact core of the most reliable, experienced, and hardened workers, with respon-\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nsible representatives in the principal districts and connected by all the rules of strict secrecy\nwith the organisation of revolutionaries, can, with the widest support of the masses and\nwithout any formal organisation, perform all the functions of a trade union organisation, in\na manner, moreover, desirable to Social-Democracy. Only in this way can we secure the\nconsolidation and development of a Social-Democratic trade union movement, despite all\nthe gendarmes.\nIt may be objected that an organisation which is so lose that it is not even definitely\nformed, and which has not even an enrolled and registered membership, cannot be called\nan organisation at all. Perhaps so. Not the name is important. What is important is that\nthis \u201dorganisation without members\u201c shall do everything that is required, and from the very\noutset ensure a solid connection between our future trade unions and socialism. Only an\nincorrigible utopian would have a broad organisation of workers, with elections, reports,\nuniversal suffrage, etc., under the autocracy.\nThe moral to be drawn from this is simple. If we begin with the solid foundation of\na strong organisation of revolutionaries, we can ensure the stability of the movement as a\nwhole and carry out the aims both of Social-Democracy and of trade unions proper. If,\nhowever, we begin with a broad workers\u2019 organisation, which is supposedly most \u201daccessible\u201c to the masses (but which is actually most accessible to the gendarmes and makes\nrevolutionaries most accessible to the police), we shall achieve neither the one aim nor the\nother; we shall not eliminate our rule-of-thumb methods, and, because we remain scattered\nand our forces are constantly broken up by the police, we shall only make trade unions of\nthe Zubatov and Ozerov type the more accessible to the masses.\nWhat, properly speaking, should be the functions of the organisation of revolutionaries?\nWe shall deal with this question in detail. First, however, let us examine a very typical\nargument advanced by our terrorist, who (sad fate!) in this matter also is a next-door\nneighbour to the Economist. Svoboda, a journal published for workers, contains in its first\nissue an article entitled \u201dOrganisation\u201c, the author of which tries to defend his friends, the\nEconomist workers of Ivanovo-Voznesensk. He writes:\n\u201dIt is bad when the masses are mute and unenlightened, when the movement does not\ncome from the rank and file. For instance, the students of a university town leave for their\nhomes during the summer and other holidays, and immediately the workers\u2019 movement\ncomes to a standstill. Can a workers\u2019 movement which has to be pushed on from outside\nbe a real force? No, indeed.... It has not yet learned to walk, it is still in leading-strings.\nSo it is in all matters. The students go off, and everything comes to a standstill. The most\ncapable are seized; the cream is skimmed and the milk turns sour. If the \u2019committee\u2019 is\narrested, everything comes to a standstill until a new one can he formed. And one never\nknows what sort of committee will be set up next \u2013 it may be nothing like the former. The\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nfirst said one thing, the second may say the very opposite. Continuity between yesterday\nand tomorrow is broken, the experience of the past does not serve as a guide for the future.\nAnd all because no roots have been struck in depth, in the masses; the work is carried on\nnot by a hundred fools, but by a dozen wise men. A dozen wise men can be wiped out at\na snap, but when the organisation embraces masses, everything proceeds from them, and\nnobody, however he tries, can wreck the cause\u201c (p. ).\nThe facts are described correctly. The picture of our amateurism is well drawn. But\nthe conclusions are worthy of Rabochaya Mysl, both as regards their stupidity and their\nlack of political tact. They represent the height of stupidity, because the author confuses\nthe philosophical and social-historical question of the \u201ddepth\u201c of the \u201droots\u201c of the movement with the technical and organisational question of the best method in combating the\ngendarmes. They represent the height of political tactlessness, because, instead of appealing from bad leaders to good leaders, the author appeals from the leaders in general to\nthe \u201dmasses\u201c . This is as much an attempt to drag us back organisationally as the idea\nof substituting excitative terrorism for political agitation drags us back politically. Indeed,\nI am experiencing a veritable embarras de richesses, and hardly know where to begin to\ndisentangle the jumble offered up by Svoboda. For clarity, let me begin by citing an example. Take the Germans. It will not be denied, I hope, that theirs is a mass organisation,\nthat in Germany everything proceeds from the masses, that the working-class movement\nthere has learned to walk. Yet observe how these millions value their \u201ddozen\u201c tried political leaders, how firmly they cling to them. Members of the hostile parties in parliament\nhave often taunted the socialists by exclaiming: \u201dFine democrats you are indeed! Yours\nis a working-class movement only in name; in actual fact the same clique of leaders is\nalways in evidence, the same Bebel and the same Liebknecht, year in and year out, and\nthat goes on for decades. Your supposedly elected workers\u2019 deputies are more permanent\nthan the officials appointed by the Emperor\u00a1\u2018 But the Germans only smile with contempt\nat these demagogic attempts to set the \u201dmasses\u201c against the \u201dleaders\u201c, to arouse bad and\nambitious instincts in the former, and to rob the movement of its solidity and stability by\nundermining the confidence of the masses in their \u201ddozen wise men\u201c. Political thinking is\nsufficiently developed among the Germans, and they have accumulated sufficient political\nexperience to understand that without the \u201ddozen\u201c tried and talented leaders (and talented\nmen are not born by the hundreds), professionally trained, schooled by long experience,\nand working in perfect harmony, no class in modern society can wage a determined struggle. The Germans too have had demagogues in their ranks who have flattered the \u201dhundred\nfools\u201c, exalted them above the \u201ddozen wise men\u201c, extolled the \u201dhorny hand\u201c of the masses,\nand (like Most and Hasselmann) have spurred them on to reckless \u201drevolutionary\u201c action\nand sown distrust towards the firm and steadfast leaders. It was only by stubbornly and\nrelentlessly combating all demagogic elements within the socialist movement that German\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nsocialism has managed to grow and become as strong as it is. Our wiseacres, however,\nat a time when Russian Social-Democracy is passing through a crisis entirely due to the\nlack of sufficiently trained, developed, and experienced leaders to guide the spontaneously\nawakening masses, cry out ,with the profundity of fools: \u201dIt is a bad business when the\nmovement does not proceed from the rank and file.\u201c\n\u201dA committee of students is of no use; it is not stable.\u201c Quite true. But the conclusion\nto be drawn from this is that we must have a committee of professional revolutionaries,\nand it is immaterial whether a student or a worker is capable of becoming a professional\nrevolutionary. The conclusion you draw, how. ever, is that the working-class movement\nmust not be pushed on from outside! In your political innocence you fail to notice that\nyou are playing into the hands of our Economists and fostering our amateurism. Wherein,\nmay I ask, did our students \u201dpush on\u201c our workers? In the sense that the student brought\nto the worker the fragments of political knowledge he himself possesses, the crumbs of\nsocialist ideas he has managed to acquire (for the principal intellectual diet of the presentday student, legal Marxism, could furnish only the rudiments, only scraps of knowledge).\nThere has never been too much of such \u201dpushing on from outside\u201c; on the contrary, there\nhas so far been all too little of it in our movement, for we have been stewing too assiduously\nin our own juice; we have bowed far too slavishly to the elementary \u201deconomic struggle of\nthe workers against the employers and the government\u201c. We professional revolutionaries\nmust and will make it our business to engage in this kind of \u201dpushing on\u201c a hundred times\nmore forcibly than we have done hitherto. But the very fact that you select so hideous a\nphrase as \u201dpushing on from outside\u201c \u2013 a phrase which cannot but rouse in the workers (at\nleast in the workers who are as unenlightened as you yourselves) a sense of distrust towards\nall who bring them political knowledge and revolutionary experience from outside, which\ncannot but rouse in them an instinctive desire to resist all such people \u2013 proves you to be\ndemagogues, and demagogues are the worst enemies of the working class.\nAnd, please \u2013 don\u2019t hasten howling about my \u201duncomradely methods\u201c of debating. I\nhave not the least desire to doubt the purity of your intentions. As I have said, one may\nbecome a demagogue out of sheer political innocence. But I have shown that you have\ndescended to demagogy, and I will never tire of repeating that demagogues are the worst\nenemies of the working class. The worst enemies, because they arouse base instincts in\nthe masses, because the unenlightened worker is unable to recognise his enemies in men\nwho represent themselves, and sometimes sincerely so, as his friends. The worst enemies,\nbecause in the period of disunity and vacillation, when our movement is just beginning to\ntake shape, nothing is easier than to employ demagogic methods to mislead the masses, who\ncan realise their error only later by bitter experience. That is why the slogan of the day for\nthe Russian Social-Democrat must be \u2013 resolute struggle against Svoboda and Rabocheye\nDyelo, both of which have sunk to the level of demagogy. We shall deal with this further in\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\ngreater detail.\n\u201dA dozen wise men can be more easily wiped out than a hundred fools.\u201c This wonderful\ntruth (for which the hundred fools will always applaud you) appears obvious only because\nin the very midst of the argument you have skipped from one question to another. You began\nby talking and continued to talk of the unearthing of a \u201dcommittee\u201c, of the unearthing of an\n\u201dorganisation\u201c, and now you skip to the question of unearthing the movement\u2019s \u201droots\u201c in\ntheir \u201ddepths\u201c. The fact is, of course, that our movement cannot be unearthed, for the very\nreason that it has countless thousands of roots deep down among the masses; but that is not\nthe point at issue. As far as \u201ddeep roots\u201c are concerned, we cannot be \u201dunearthed\u201c even\nnow, despite all our amateurism, and yet we all complain, and cannot but complain, that the\n\u201dorganisations\u201c are being unearthed and as a result it is impossible to maintain continuity\nin the movement. But since you raise the question of organisations being unearthed and\npersist in your opinion, I assert that it is far more difficult to unearth a dozen wise men than\na hundred fools. This position I will defend, no matter how much you instigate the masses\nagainst me for my \u201danti-democratic\u201c views, etc. As I have stated repeatedly, by \u201dwise\nmen\u201c, in connection with organisation, I mean professional revolutionaries, irrespective of\nwhether they have developed from among students or working men. I assert: () that no\nrevolutionary movement can endure without a stable organisation of leaders maintaining\ncontinuity; () that the broader the popular mass drawn spontaneously into the struggle,\nwhich forms the basis of the movement and participates in it, the more urgent the need for\nsuch an organisation, and the more solid this organisation must be (for it is much easier for\nall sorts of demagogues to side-track the more backward sections of the masses); () that\nsuch an organisation must consist chiefly of people professionally engaged in revolutionary\nactivity; () that in an autocratic state, the more we confine the membership of such an organisation to people who are professionally engaged in revolutionary activity and who have\nbeen professionally trained in the art of combating the political police, the more difficult\nwill it be to unearth the organisation; and () the greater will be the number of people from\nthe working class and from the other social classes who will be able to join the movement\nand perform active work in it.\nI invite our Economists, terrorists, and \u201dEconomists-terrorists\u201c to confute these propositions. At the moment, I shall deal only with the last two points. The question as to whether\nit is easier to wipe out \u201da dozen wisemen\u201c or \u201da hundred fools\u201c reduces itself to the question, above considered, whether it is possible to have a mass organisation when the maintenance of strict secrecy is essential. We can never give a mass organisation that degree\nof secrecy without which there can be no question of persistent and continuous struggle\nagainst the government. To concentrate all secret functions in the hands of as small a number of professional revolutionaries as possible does not mean that the latter will \u201ddo the\nthinking for all\u201c and that the rank and file will not take an active part in the movement. On\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nthe contrary, the membership will promote increasing numbers of the professional revolutionaries from its ranks; for it will know that it is not enough for a few students and for a\nfew working men waging the economic struggle to gather in order to form a \u201dcommittee\u201c,\nbut that it takes years to train oneself to be a professional revolutionary; and the rank and\nfile will \u201dthink\u201c, not only of amateurish methods, but of such training. Centralisation of\nthe secret functions of the organisation by no means implies centralisation of all the functions of the movement. Active participation of the widest masses in the illegal press will\nnot diminish because a \u201ddozen\u201c professional revolutionaries centralise the secret functions\nconnected with this work; on the contrary, it will increase tenfold. In this way, and in this\nway alone, shall we ensure that reading the illegal press, writing for it, and to some extent\neven distributing it, will almost cease to be secret work, for the police will soon come to\nrealise the folly and impossibility of judicial and administrative red-tape procedure over\nevery copy of a publication that is being distributed in the thousands. This holds not only\nfor the press, but for every function of the movement, even for demonstrations. The active\nand widespread participation of the masses will not suffer; on the contrary, it will benefit\nby the fact that a \u201ddozen\u201c experienced revolutionaries, trained professionally no less than\nthe police, will centralise all the secret aspects of the work \u2013 the drawing up of leaflets, the\nworking out of approximate plans; and the appointing of bodies of leaders for each urban\ndistrict, for each institution, etc. (I know that exception will be taken to my \u201dundemocratic\u201c\nviews, but I shall reply below fully to this anything but intelligent objection.) Centralisation of the most secret functions in an organisation of revolutionaries will not diminish,\nbut rather increase the extent and enhance the quality of the activity of a large number of\nother organisations that are intended for a broad public and are therefore as loose and as\nnon-secret as possible, such as workers\u2019 trade unions; workers\u2019 self-education circles and\ncircles for reading illegal literature; and socialist, as well as democratic, circles among all\nother sections of the population; etc., etc. We must have such circles, trade unions, and\norganisations everywhere in as large a number as possible and with the widest variety of\nfunctions; but it would be absurd and harmful to confound them with the organisation of\nrevolutionaries, to efface the border-line between them, to make still more hazy the all too\nfaint recognition of the fact that in order to \u201dserve\u201c the mass movement we must have people who will devote themselves exclusively to Social-Democratic activities, and that such\npeople must train themselves patiently and steadfastly to be professional revolutionaries.\nYes, this recognition is incredibly dim. Our worst sin with regard to organisation consists in the fact that by our primitiveness we have lowered the prestige of revolutionaries\nin Russia. A person who is flabby and shaky on questions of theory, who has a narrow\noutlook, who pleads the spontaneity of the masses as an excuse for his own sluggishness,\nwho resembles a trade union secretary more than a spokesman of the people, who is unable\nto conceive of a broad and bold plan that would command the respect even of opponents,\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nand who is inexperienced and clumsy in his own professional art \u2013 the art of combating the\npolitical police \u2013 such a man is not a revolutionary, but a wretched amateur!\nLet no active worker take offence at these frank remarks, for as far as insufficient training\nis concerned, I apply them first and foremost to myself. I used to work in a study circle that\nset itself very broad, all-embracing tasks; and all of us, members of that circle, suffered\npainfully and acutely from the realisation that we were acting as amateurs at a moment in\nhistory when we might have been able to say, varying a well-known statement: \u201dGive us an\norganisation of revolutionaries, and we will overturn RussiaP\u2019 The more I recall the burning\nsense of shame I then experienced, the bitterer become my feelings towards those pseudoSocial-Democrats whose preachings \u201cbring disgrace on the calling of a revolutionary\u201d, who\nfail to understand that our task is not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the\nlevel of an amateur, but to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries.\n.. THE SCOPE OF ORGANISATIONAL WORK\nWe have heard B-v tell us about \u201cthe lack of revolutionary forces fit for action which is felt\nnot only in St. Petersburg, but throughout Russia\u201d. Hardly anyone will dispute this fact.\nBut the question is, how is it to be explained? B-v writes:\n\u201cWe shall not go into an explanation of the historical causes of this phenomenon; we\nshall merely state that a society, demoralised by prolonged political reaction and split by\npast and present economic changes, promotes from its own ranks an extremely small number of persons fit for revolutionary work; that the working class does produce revolutionary\nworkers who to some extent reinforce the ranks of the illegal organisations, but that the\nnumber of such revolutionaries is inadequate to meet the requirements of the times. This is\nall the more so because the worker who spends eleven and a half hours a day in the factory\nis in such a position that he can, in the main, perform only the functions of an agitator;\nbut propaganda and organisation, the delivery and reproduction of illegal literature, the issuance of leaflets, etc., are duties which must necessarily fall mainly upon the shoulders of\nan extremely small force of intellectuals\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , pp. -).\nOn many points we disagree with B-v, particularly with those we have emphasised,\nwhich most saliently reveal that, although weary of our amateurism (as is every thinking\npractical worker), B-v cannot find the way out of this intolerable situation because he is\nweighted down by Economism. The fact is that society produces very many persons fit for\n\u201cthe cause\u201d, but we are unable to make use of them all. The critical, transitional state of our\nmovement in this respect may be formulated as follows: There are no people \u2013 yet there is\na mass of people. There is a mass of people, because the working class and increasingly\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nvaried social strata, year after year, produce from their ranks an increasing number of discontented people who desire to protest, who are ready to render all the assistance they can in\nthe struggle against absolutism, the intolerableness of which, though not yet recognised by\nall, is more and more acutely sensed by increasing masses of the people. At the same time,\nwe have no people, because we have no leaders, no political leaders, no talented organisers capable of arranging. extensive and at the same time uniform and harmonious work\nthat would employ all forces, even the most inconsiderable. \u201cThe growth and development\nof the revolutionary organisations\u201d lag, not only behind the growth of the working-class\nmovement, which even B-v admits, but behind that of the general democratic movement\namong all strata of the people. (In passing, probably B-V would now regard this as supplementing his conclusion.) The scope of revolutionary work is too narrow, as compared\nwith the breadth of the spontaneous basis of the movement. It is too hemmed in by the\nwretched theory of \u201ceconomic struggle against the employers and the government\u201d. Yet,\nat the present time, not only Social-Democratic political agitators, but Social-Democratic\norganisers must \u201cgo among all classes of the population\u201d. There is hardly a single practical worker who will doubt that the Social-Democrats could distribute the thousand and one\nminute functions of their organisational work among individual representatives of the most\nvaried classes. Lack of specialisation is one of the most serious defects of our technique,\nabout which B-v justly and bitterly complains. The smaller each separate \u201coperation\u201d in\nour common cause the more people we can find capable of carrying out such operations\n(people who, in the majority of cases, are completely incapable of becoming professional\nrevolutionaries); more difficult will it be for the police to \u201cnet\u201d all these \u201cdetail workers\u201d,\nand the more difficult will it be for them to frame up, out of an arrest for some petty affair, a\n\u201ccase\u201d that would justify the government\u2019s expenditure on \u201csecurity\u201d. As for the number of\npeople ready to help us, we referred in the preceding chapter to the gigantic change that has\ntaken place in this respect in the last five years or so. On the other hand, in order to unite all\nthese tiny fractions into one whole, in order not to break up the movement while breaking\nup its functions, and in order to imbue the people who carry out the minute functions with\nthe conviction that their work is necessary and important, without which conviction they\nwill never do the work, it is necessary to have a strong organisation of tried revolutionaries. The more secret such an organisation is, the stronger and more widespread will be the\nconfidence in the Party. As we know, in time of war, it is not only of the utmost importance\nto imbue one\u2019s own army with confidence in its strength, but it is important also to convince\nthe enemy and all neutral elements of this strength; friendly neutrality may sometimes decide the issue. If such an organisation existed, one built up on a firm theoretical foundation\nand possessing a Social-Democratic organ, we should have no reason to fear that the movement might be diverted from its path by the numerous \u201coutside\u201d elements that are attracted\nto it. (On the contrary, it is precisely at the present time, with amateurism prevalent, that\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nwe see many Social-Democrats leaning towards the Credo and only imagining that they are\nSocial Democrats.) In a word, specialisation necessarily presupposes centralisation, and in\nturn imperatively calls for it.\nBut B-v himself, who has so excellently described the necessity for specialisation, underestimates its importance, in our opinion, in the second part of the argument we have\nquoted. The number of working-class revolutionaries is inadequate, he says. This is perfectly true, and once again we stress that the \u201c valuable communication of a close observer\u201d\nfully confirms our view of the causes of the present crisis in Social-Democracy, and, consequently, of the means required to overcome it. Not only are revolutionaries in general\nlagging behind the spontaneous awakening of the masses, but even worker-revolutionaries\nare lagging behind the spontaneous awakening of the working-class masses. This fact confirms with clear evidence, from the \u201cpractical\u201d point of view, too, not only the absurdity\nbut even the politically reactionary nature of the \u201cpedagogics\u201d to which we are so often\ntreated in the discussion of our duties to the workers. This fact proves that our very first\nand most pressing duty is to help to train working-class revolutionaries who will he on the\nsame level in regard to Party activity as the revolutionaries from amongst the intellectuals\n(we emphasise the words \u201cin regard to Party activity\u201d, for, although necessary, it is neither\nso easy nor so pressingly necessary to bring the workers up to the level of intellectuals in\nother respects). Attention, therefore, must be devoted principally to raising the workers to\nthe level of revolutionaries; it is not at all our task to descend to the level of the \u201cworking\nmasses\u201d as the Economists wish to do, or to the level of the \u201caverage worker\u2019 as Svoboda\ndesires to do (and by this ascends to the second grade of Economist \u201dpedagogics\u201c). I am\nfar from denying the necessity for popular literature for the workers, and especially popular\n(of course, not vulgar) literature for the especially backward workers. But what annoys me\nis this constant confusion of pedagogics with questions of politics and organisation. You,\ngentlemen, who are so much concerned about the \u201daverage worker\u201c, as a matter of fact,\nrather insult the workers by your desire to talk down to them when discussing workingclass politics and working-class organisation. Talk about serious things in a serious manner; leave pedagogics to the pedagogues, and not to politicians and organisers! Are there\nnot advanced people, \u201daverage people\u201c, and \u201dmasses\u201c among the intelligentsia too? Does\nnot everyone recognise that popular literature is also required for the intelligentsia, and is\nnot such literature written? Imagine someone, in an article on organising college or highschool students, repeating over and over again, as if he had made a new discovery, that first\nof all we must have an organisation of \u201daverage students\u201c. The author of such an article\nwould be ridiculed, and rightly so. Give us your ideas on organisation, if you have any,\nhe would be told, and we ourselves will decide who is \u201daverage\u201c, who above average, and\nwho below. But if you have no organisational ideas of your own, then all your exertions\nin behalf of the \u201dmasses\u201c and \u201daverage people\u201c will be simply boring. You must realise\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nthat these questions of \u201dpolitics\u201c and \u201dorganisation\u201c are so serious in themselves that they\ncannot be dealt with in any other but a serious way. We can and must educate workers (and\nuniversity and Gymnasium students) so that we may be able to discuss these questions with\nthem. But once you do bring up these questions, you \u201dmust give real replies to them; do\nnot fall back on the \u201caverage\u201d, or on the \u201cmasses\u201d; do not try to dispose of the matter with\nfacetious remarks and mere phrases.\nTo be fully prepared for his task, the worker-revolutionary must likewise become a\nprofessional revolutionary. Hence B-v is wrong in saying that since the worker spends\neleven and a half hours in the factory, the brunt of all other revolutionary functions (apart\nfrom agitation) \u201cmust necessarily fall mainly upon the shoulders of an extremely small\nforce of intellectuals\u201d. But this condition does not obtain out of sheer \u201cnecessity\u201d. It obtains\nbecause we are backward, because we do not recognise our duty to assist every capable\nworker to become a professional agitator, organiser, propagandist, literature distributor,\netc., etc. In this respect, we waste our strength in a positively shameful manner; we lack\nthe ability to husband that which should be tended and reared with special care. Look\nat the Germans: their forces are a hundredfold greater than ours. But they understand\nperfectly well that really capable agitators, etc., are not often promoted from the ranks of\nthe \u201caverage\u201d. For this reason they immediately try to place every capable working man in\nconditions that will enable him to develop and apply his abilities to the fullest: he is made\na professional agitator, he is encouraged to widen the field of his activity, to spread it from\none factory to the whole of the industry, from a single locality to the whole country. He\nacquires experience and dexterity in his profession; he broadens his outlook and increases\nhis knowledge; he observes at close quarters the prominent political leaders from other\nlocalities and of other parties; he strives to rise to their level and combine in himself the\nknowledge of the working-class environment and the freshness of socialist convictions with\nprofessional skill, without which. the proletariat cannot wage a stubborn struggle against\nits excellently trained enemies. In this way alone do the working masses produce men of the\nstamp of Bebel and Auer. But what is to a great extent automatic in a politically free country\nmust in Russia be done deliberately and systematically by our organisations. A workeragitator who is at all gifted and \u201cpromising\u201d must not be left to work eleven hours a day in\na factory. We must arrange that he be maintained by the Party; that he may go underground\nin good time; that he change the place of his activity, if he is to enlarge his experience,\nwiden his outlook, and be able to hold out for at least a few years in the struggle against the\ngendarmes. As the spontaneous rise of their movement becomes broader and deeper, the\nworking-class masses promote from their ranks not only an increasing number of talented\nagitators, but also talented organisers, propagandists, and \u201cpractical workers\u201d in the best\nsense of the term (of whom there are so few among our intellectuals who, for the most\npart, in the Russian manner, are somewhat careless and sluggish in their habits). When we\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nhave forces of specially trained worker-revolutionaries who have gone through extensive\npreparation (and, of course, revolutionaries \u201cof all arms of the service\u201d), no political police\nin the world will then be able to contend with them, for these forces, boundlessly devoted\nto the revolution, will enjoy the boundless confidence of the widest masses of the workers.\nWe are directly to blame for doing too little to \u201cstimulate\u201d the workers to take this path,\ncommon to them and to the \u201cintellectuals\u201d, of professional revolutionary training, and for\nall too often dragging them back by our silly speeches about what is \u201caccessible\u201d to the\nmasses of the workers, to the \u201caverage workers\u201d, etc.\nIn this, as in other respects, the narrow scope of our organisational work is without a\ndoubt due directly to the fact (although the overwhelming majority of the \u201cEconomists\u201d\nand the novices in practical work do not perceive it) that we restrict our theories and our\npolitical tasks to a narrow field. Subservience to spontaneity seems to inspire a fear of\ntaking even one step away from what is \u201caccessible\u201d to the masses, a fear of rising too high\nabove mere attendance on the immediate and direct requirements of the masses. Have no\nfear, gentlemen! Remember that we stand so low on the plane of organisation that the very\nidea that we could rise too high is absurd!\n.. \u201cCONSPIRATORIAL\u201d ORGANISATION AND \u201cDEMOCRATISM\u201d\nYet there are many people among us who are so sensitive to the \u201cvoice of life\u201d that they fear\nit more than anything in the world and charge the adherents of the views here expounded\nwith following a Narodnaya Volya line, with failing to understand \u201cdemocratism\u201d, etc.\nThese accusations, which, of course, have been echoed by Rabocheye Dyelo, need to be\ndealt with.\nThe writer of these lines knows very well that the St. Petersburg Economists levelled\nthe charge of Narodnaya Volya tendencies also against Rabochaya Gazeta (which is quite\nunderstandable when one compares it with Rabochaya Mysl). We were not in the least\nsurprised, therefore, when, soon after the appearance of Iskra, a comrade informed us that\nthe Soclal-Democrats in the town of X describe Iskra as a Narodnaya Volya organ. We,\nof course, were flattered by this accusation; for what decent Social-Democrat has not been\naccused by the Economists of being a Narodnaya Volya sympathiser?\nThese accusations are the result of a twofold misunderstanding. First, the history of the\nrevolutionary movement is so little known among us that the name \u201cNarodnaya Volya\u201d is\nused to denote any idea of a militant centralised organisation which declares determined\nwar upon tsarism. But the magnificent organisation that the revolutionaries had in the seventies, and that should serve us as a model, was not established by the Narodnaya Volya,\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nbut by the Zemlya i Volya, which split up into the Chorny Peredel and the Narodnaya Volya.\nConsequently, to regard a militant revolutionary organisation as something specifically Narodnaya Volya in character is absurd both historically and logically; for no revolutionary\ntrend, if it seriously thinks of struggle, can dispense with such an organisation. The mistake the Narodnaya Volya committed was not in striving to enlist all the discontented in the\norganisation and to direct this organisation to resolute struggle against the autocracy; on the\ncontrary, that was its great historical merit. The mistake was in relying on a theory which\nin substance was not a revolutionary theory at all, and the Narodnaya Volya members either\ndid not know how, or were unable, to link their movement inseparably with the class struggle in the developing capitalist society. Only a gross failure to understand Marxism (or an\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d of it in the spirit of \u201cStruveism\u201d) could prompt the opinion that the rise of\na mass, spontaneous working-class movement relieves us of the duty of creating as good\nan organisation of revolutionaries as the Zemlya i Volya had, or, indeed, an incomparably\nbetter one. On the contrary, this movement imposes the duty upon us; for the spontaneous\nstruggle of the proletariat will not become its genuine \u201cclass struggle\u201d until this struggle is\nled by a strong organisation of revolutionaries.\nSecondly, many people, including apparently B. Krichevsky (Rabocheye Dyelo, No.\n, p. ), misunderstand the polemics that Social-Democrats have always waged against\nthe \u201cconspiratorial\u201d view of the political struggle. We have always protested, and will, of\ncourse, continue to protest against confining the political struggle to conspiracy. But this\ndoes not, of course, mean that we deny the need for a strong revolutionary organisation.\nThus, in the pamphlet mentioned in the preceding footnote, after the polemics against reducing the political struggle to a conspiracy, a description is given (as a Social-Democratic\nideal) of an organisation so strong as to be able to \u201cresort to. . .rebellion\u201d and to every\n\u201cother form of attack, in order to \u201ddeliver a smashing blow against absolutism\u201c. In form\nsuch a strong revolutionary organisation in an autocratic country may also be described as\na \u201dconspiratorial\u201c organisation, because the French word \u201dconspiration\u201c is the equivalent\nof the Russian word \u201dzagovar\u201c (\u201dconspiracy\u201c), and such an organisation must have the utmost secrecy. Secrecy is such a necessary condition for this kind of organisation that all\nthe other conditions (number and selection of members, functions, etc.) must be made to\nconform to it. It would be extremely naive indeed, therefore, to fear the charge that we\nSocial-Democrats desire to create a conspiratorial organisation. Such a charge should be as\nflattering to every opponent of Economism as the charge of following a Narodnaya Volya\nline.\nThe objection may be raised that such a powerful and strictly secret organisation, which\nconcentrates in its hands all the threads of secret activities, an organisation which of necessity is centralised, may too easily rush into a premature attack, may thoughtlessly intensify\nthe movement before the growth of political discontent, the intensity of the ferment and\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nanger of the working class, etc., have made such an attack possible and necessary. Our\nreply to this is: Speaking abstractly, it cannot be denied, of course, that a militant organisation may thoughtlessly engage in battle, which may end in a defeat entirely avoidable\nunder other conditions. But we cannot confine ourselves to abstract reasoning on such\na question, because every battle bears within itself the abstract possibility of defeat, and\nthere is no way of reducing this possibility except by organised preparation for battle. If,\nhowever, we proceed from the concrete conditions at present obtaining in Russia, we must\ncome to the positive conclusion that a strong revolutionary organisation is absolutely necessary precisely for the purpose of giving stability to the movement and of safeguarding it\nagainst the possibility of making thoughtless attacks. Precisely at the present time, when\nno such organisation yet exists, and when the revolutionary movement is rapidly and spontaneously growing, we already observe two opposite extremes (which, as is to be expected,\n\u201dmeet\u201c). These are: the utterly unsound Economism and the preaching of moderation,\nand the equally unsound \u201dexcitative terror\u201c, which strives \u201dartificially to call forth symptoms of the end of the movement, which is developing and strengthening itself, when this\nmovement is as yet nearer to the start than to the end\u201c (V. Zasulich, in Zarya, No. -,\np. ). And the instance of Rabocheye Dyelo shows that there exist Social-Democrats\nwho give way to both these extremes. This is not surprising, for, apart from other reasons,\nthe \u201deconomic struggle against the employers and the government\u201c can never satisfy revolutionaries, and opposite extremes will therefore always appear here and there. Only a\ncentralised, militant organisation that consistently carries out a Social-Democratic policy,\nthat satisfies, so to speak, all revolutionary instincts and strivings, can safeguard the movement against making thoughtless attacks and prepare attacks that hold out the promise of\nsuccess.\nA further objection may be raised, that the views on organisation here expounded contradict the \u201ddemocratic principle\u201c. Now, while the earlier accusation was specifically Russian\nin origin, this one is specifically foreign in character. And only an organisation abroad\n(the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad) was capable of giving its Editorial Board\ninstructions like the following:\n\u201dOrganisational Principle. In order to secure the successful development and unification of Social-Democracy, the broad democratic principle of Party organisation must\nbe emphasised, developed, and fought for; this is particularly necessary in view of the\nanti-democratic tendencies that have revealed themselves in the ranks of our Party\u201c (Two\nConferences, p. ).\nWe shall see in the next chapter how Rabocheye Dyelo combats Iskra\u2019s \u201danti-democratic\ntendencies\u201c. For the present, we shall examine more closely the \u201dprinciple\u201c that the Economists\nadvance. Everyone will probably agree that \u201dthe broad democratic principle\u201c presupposes\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nthe two following conditions: first, full publicity, and secondly, election to all offices. It\nwould be absurd to speak of democracy without publicity, moreover, without a publicity\nthat is not limited to the membership of the organisation. We call the German Socialist\nParty a democratic organisation because all its activities are carried out publicly; even its\nparty congresses are held in public. But no one would call an organisation democratic that\nis hidden from every one but its members by a veil of secrecy. What is the use, then, of advancing \u201dthe broad democratic principle\u201c when the fundamental condition for this principle\ncannot be fulfilled by a secret organisation? \u201dThe broad principle\u201c proves itself simply to\nbe a resounding but hollow phrase. Moreover, it reveals a total lack of understanding of the\nurgent tasks of the moment in regard to organisation. Everyone knows how great the lack\nof secrecy is among the \u201dbroad\u201c masses of our revolutionaries. We have heard the bitter\ncomplaints of B-v on this score and his absolutely just demand for a \u201dstrict selection of\nmembers\u201c (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , p. ). Yet, persons who boast a keen \u201dsense of realities\u201c urge, in a situation like this, not the strictest secrecy and the strictest (consequently,\nmore restricted) selection, of members, but \u201dthe broad democratic principle\u201c! This is what\nyou call being wide of the mark.\nNor is the situation any better with regard to the second attribute of democracy, the\nprinciple of election. In politically free countries, this condition is taken for granted. \u201dThey\nare members of the Party who accept the principles of the Party programme and render the\nParty all possible support,\u201c reads Clause  of the Rules of the German Social-Democratic\nParty. Since the entire political arena is as open to the public view as is a theatre stage to the\naudience, this acceptance or non-acceptance, support or opposition, is known to all from\nthe press and from public meetings. Everyone knows that a certain political figure began\nin such and such a way, passed through such and such an evolution, behaved in a trying\nmoment in such and such a manner, and possesses such and such qualities; consequently, all\nparty members, knowing all the facts, can elect or refuse to elect this person to a particular\nparty office. The general control (in the literal sense of the term) exercised over every\nact of a party man in the political field brings into existence an automatically operating\nmechanism which produces what in biology is called the \u201dsurvival of the fittest\u201c. \u201dNatural\nselection\u201c by full publicity, election, and general control provides the assurance that, in the\nlast analysis, every political figure will be \u201din his proper place\u201c, do the work for which lie\nis best fitted by his powers and abilities, feel the effects of his mistakes on himself, and\nprove before all the world his ability to recognise mistakes and to avoid them.\nTry to fit this picture into the frame of our autocracy! Is it conceivable in Russia for\nall \u201dwho accept the principles of the Party programme and render the Party all possible\nsupport to control every action of the revolutionary working in secret? Is it possible for all\nto elect one of these revolutionaries to any particular office, when, in the very interests of\nthe work, the revolutionary must conceal his identity from nine out of ten of these \u201call\u201d?\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nReflect somewhat over the real meaning of the high-sounding phrases to whichRabocheye\nDyelo gives utterance, and you will realise that \u201cbroad democracy\u201d in Party organisation,\namidst the gloom of the autocracy and the domination of gendarmerie, is nothing more\nthan a useless and harmful toy. It is a useless toy because, in point of fact, no revolutionary organisation has ever practiced, or could practice, broad democracy, however much it\nmay have desired to do so. It is a harmful toy because any attempt to practise \u201cthe broad\ndemocratic principle\u201d will simply facilitate the work of the police in carrying out largescale raids, will perpetuate the prevailing primitiveness, and will divert the thoughts of the\npractical workers from the serious and pressing task of training themselves to become professional revolutionaries to that of drawing up detailed \u201cpaper\u201d rules for election systems.\nOnly abroad, where very often people with no opportunity for conducting really active\nwork gather, could this \u201cplaying at democracy\u201d develop here and there, especially in small\ngroups.\nTo show the unseemliness of Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s favourite trick of advancing the plausible \u201cprinciple\u201d of democracy in revolutionary affairs, we shall again summon a witness.\nThis witness, Y. Serebryakov, editor of the London magazine, Nakanune, has a soft spot for\nRabocheye Dyelo and is filled with a great hatred for Plekhanov and the \u201cPlekhanovites\u201d. In\nits articles on the split in the Union of Russian Social -Democrats Abroad, Nakanune definitely sided with Rabocheye Dyelo and poured a stream of petty abuse upon Plekhanov. All\nthe more valuable, therefore, is this witness in the question at issue. In Nakanune for July\n(No. ) , an article entitled \u201cConcerning the Manifesto of the Self-Emancipation of\nthe Workers Group\u201d, Serebryakov argued that it was \u201cindecent\u201d to talk about such things as\n\u201cself-deception, leadership, and the so-called Areopagus in a serious revolutionary movement\u201d and, inter alia, wrote:\n\u201cMyshkin, Rogachov, Zhelyabov, Mikhailov, Perovskaya, Figner, and others never regarded themselves as leaders, and no one ever elected or appointed them as such, although\nin actuality, they were leaders, because, in the propaganda period, as well as in the period\nof the struggle against the government, they took the brunt of the work upon themselves,\nthey went into the most dangerous places, and their activities were the most fruitful. They\nbecame leaders, not because they wished it, but because the comrades surrounding them\nhad confidence in their wisdom, in their energy, in their loyalty. To be afraid of some kind\nof Areopagus (if it is not feared, why write about it?) that would arbitrarily govern the\nmovement is far too naive. Who would pay heed to it?\u201d\nWe ask the reader, in what way does the \u201cAreopagus\u201d differ from \u201cantidemocratic ten- \u02dc\ndencies\u201d? And is it not evident that Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d organisational principle\nis equally naive and indecent; naive, because no one would pay heed to the \u201cAreopagus\u201d,\nor people with \u201canti- democratic tendencies\u201d, if \u201cthe comrades surrounding them had\u201d no\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\n\u201cconfidence in their wisdom, energy, and loyalty\u201d; indecent, because it is a demagogic sally\ncalculated to play on the conceit of some, on the ignorance of others regarding the actual\nstate of our movement, and on the lack of training and the ignorance of the history of the\nrevolutionary movement on the part of still others. The only serious organisational principle\nfor the active workers of our movement should he the strictest secrecy, the strictest selection of members, and the training of professional revolutionaries. Given these qualities,\nsomething even more than \u201cdemocratism\u201d would be guaranteed to us, namely, complete,\ncomradely, mutual confidence among revolutionaries. This is absolutely essential for us,\nbecause there can be no question of replacing it by general democratic control in Russia. It\nwould be a great mistake to believe that the impossibility of establishing real \u201cdemocratic\u201d\ncontrol renders the members of the revolutionary organisation beyond control altogether.\nThey have not the time to think about toy forms of democratism (democratism within a\nclose and compact body of comrades in which complete, mutual confidence prevails), but\nthey have a lively sense of their responsibility, knowing as they do from experience that an\norganisation of real revolutionaries will stop at nothing to rid itself of an unworthy member. Moreover, there is a fairly well-developed public opinion in Russian (and international)\nrevolutionary circles which has a long history behind it, and which sternly and ruthlessly\npunishes every departure from the duties of comradeship (and \u201cdemocratism\u201d, real and\nnot toy democratism, certainly forms a component part of the conception of comradeship).\nTake all this into consideration and you will realise that this talk and these resolutions\nabout \u201canti-democratic tendencies\u201d have the musty odour of the playing at generals which\nis indulged in abroad.\nIt must be observed also that the other source of this talk, viz., naivete is likewise fostered by the confusion of ideas concerning the meaning of democracy. In Mr. and Mrs.\nWebb\u2019s book on the English trade unions there is an interesting chapter entitled \u201cPrimitive\nDemocracy\u201d. In it the authors relate how the English workers, in the first period of existence of their unions, considered it an indispensable sign of democracy for all the members\nto do all the work of managing the unions; not only were all questions decided by the vote\nof all the members, but all official duties were fulfilled by all the members in turn. A long\nperiod of historical experience was required for worker\u2019s to realise the absurdity of such\na conception of democracy and to make them understand the necessity for representative\ninstitutions, on the one hand, and for full-time officials, on the other. Only after a number\nof cases of financial bankruptcy of trade union treasuries had occurred did the workers realise that the rates of contributions and benefits cannot be decided merely by a democratic\nvote, but that this requires also the advice of insurance experts. Let us take also Kautsky\u2019s\nbook on parliamentarism and legislation by the people. There we find that the conclusions drawn by the Marxist theoretician coincide with the lessons learned from many years\nof practical experience by the workers who organised \u201cspontaneously\u201d. Kautsky strongly\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nprotests against Rittinghausen\u2019s primitive conception of democracy; he ridicules those who\nin the name of democracy demand that \u201cpopular newspapers shall be edited directly by\nthe people\u201d; he shows the\u2019 need for professional journalists, parliamentarians, etc., for the\nSocial-Democratic leadership of the proletarian class struggle; he attacks the \u201csocialism of\nanarchists and litterateurs who in their \u201dstriving for effect\u201c extol direct legislation by the\nwhole people, completely failing to understand that this idea can be applied only relatively\nin modern society.\nThose who have performed practical work in our movement know how widespread the\n\u201dprimitive\u201c conception of democracy is among the masses of the students and workers. It is\nnot surprising that this conception penetrates also into rules of organisations and into literature. The Economists of the Bernsteinian persuasion included in their rules the following:\n\u201d\u00a7. All affairs affecting the interests of the whole of the union organisation shall be decided by a majority vote of all its members.\u201c The Economists of the terrorist persuasion\nrepeat after them. \u201dThe decisions of the committee shall become effective only after they\nhave been referred to all the circles\u201c (Svoboda, No. , p. ). Observe that this proposal\nfor a widely applied referendum is advanced in addition to the demand that the whole of\nthe organisation be built on an elective basis! We would not, of course, on this account\ncondemn practical workers who have had too few opportunities for studying the theory and\npractice of real democratic organisations. But when Rabocheye Dyelo, which lays claim\nto leadership, confines itself, under such conditions, to a resolution on broad democratic\nprinciples, can this be described as anything but a mere \u201dstriving for effect\u201c?\n.. LOCAL AND ALL-RUSSIA WORK\nThe objections raised against the plan of organisation here outlined on the grounds that\nit is undemocratic and conspiratorial are totally unsound. Nevertheless, there remains a\nquestion which is frequently put and which deserves detailed examination. This is the\nquestion of the relations between local work and all-Russia work. Fears are expressed that\nthe formation of a centralised organisation may shift the centre of gravity from the former to\nthe latter, damage the movement through weakening our contacts with the working masses\nand the continuity of local agitation generally. To these fears we reply that our movement\nin the past few years has suffered precisely from the fact that local workers have been\ntoo absorbed in local work; that therefore it is absolutely necessary to shift the centre of\ngravity somewhat to national work; and that, far from weakening this would strengthen our\nties and the continuity of our local agitation. Let us take the question of central and local\nnewspapers. I would ask the reader not to forget that we cite the publication of newspapers\nonly as an example illustrating an immeasurably broader and more varied revolutionary\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nactivity in general.\nIn the first period of the mass movement (-), an attempt was made by local revolutionary workers to publish an all-Russia paper \u2013 Rabochaya Gazeta. In the next period\n(-), the movement made an enormous stride forward, but the attention of the\nleaders was wholly absorbed by local publications. If we compute the total number of the\nlocal papers that were published, we shall find that on the average one issue per month was\npublished. Does this not clearly illustrate our amateurism? Does this not clearly show\nthat our revolutionary organisation lags behind the spontaneous growth of the movement?\nIf the same number of issues had been published, not by scattered local groups, but by a\nsingle organisation, we would not only have saved an enormous amount of effort, but we\nwould have secured immeasurably greater stability and continuity in our work. This simple\npoint is frequently lost sight of by those practical workers who work actively and almost\nexclusively on local publications (unfortunately this is true even now in the overwhelming\nmajority of cases), as well as by the publicists who display an astonishing quixotism on this\nquestion. The practical workers usually rest content with the argument that \u201dit is difficult\u201c\nfor local workers to engage in the organisation of an all-Russia newspaper, and that local\nnewspapers are better than no newspapers at all. This argument is, of course, perfectly\njust, and we, no less than any practical worker, appreciate the enormous importance and\nusefulness of local newspapersin general. But not this is the point. The point is, can we not\novercome the fragmentation and primitiveness that are so glaringly expressed in the thirty\nissues of local newspapers that have been published throughout Russia in the course of two\nand a half years? Do not restrict yourselves to the indisputable, but too general, statement\nabout the usefulness of local newspapers generally; have the courage frankly to admit their\nnegative aspects revealed by the experience of two and a half years. This experience has\nshown that under the conditions in which we work, these local newspapers prove, in the\nmajority of cases, to be unstable in their principles, devoid of political significance, extremely costly in regard to expenditure of revolutionary forces, and totally unsatisfactory\nfrom a technical point of view (I have in mind, of course, not the technique of printing,\nbut the frequency and regularity of publication). These defects are riot accidental; they\nare the inevitable outcome of the fragmentation which, on the one hand, explains the predominance of local newspapers in the period under review, and, on the other, is fostered by\nthis predominance. It is positively beyond the strength of a separate local organisation to\nraise its newspaper to the level of a political organ maintaining stability of principles; it is\nbeyond its strength to collect and utilise sufficient material to shed light on the whole of our\npolitical life. The argument usually advanced to support the need for numerous local newspapers in free countries that the cost of printing by local workers is low and that the people\ncan be kept more fully and quickly informed \u2013 this argument as experience has shown,\nspeaks against local newspapers in Russia. They turn out to be excessively costly in regard\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nto the expenditure of revolutionary forces, and appear very rarely, for the simple reason\nthat the publication of an illegal newspaper, however small its size, requires an extensive\nsecret apparatus, such as is possible with large-scale factory production; for this apparatus\ncannot be created in a small, handicraft workshop. Very frequently, the primitiveness of\nthe secret apparatus (every practical worker can cite numerous cases) enables the police\nto take advantage of the publication and distribution of one or two issues to make mass\narrests, which result in such a clean sweep that it becomes necessary to start all over again.\nA well-organised secret apparatus requires professionally well-trained revolutionaries and\na division of labour applied with the greatest consistency, but both these requirements are\nbeyond the strength of a separate local organisation, however strong it may be at any given\nmoment. Not only the general interests of our movement as a whole (training of the workers in consistent socialist and political principles) but also specifically local interests are\nbetter served by non-local newspapers. This may seem paradoxical at first sight, but it has\nbeen proved to the hilt by the two and a half years of experience referred to. Everyone will\nagree that had all the local forces that were engaged in the publication of the thirty issues\nof newspapers worked on a single newspaper, sixty, if not a hundred, issues could easily\nhave been published, with a fuller expression, in consequence, of all the specifically local\nfeatures of the movement. True, it is no easy matter to attain such a degree of organisation,\nbut we must realise the need for it. Every local study circle must think about it and work\nactively to achieve it, without waiting for an impetus from outside, without being tempted\nby the popularity and closer proximity of a local newspaper which, as our revolutionary\nexperience has shown, proves to a large extent to be illusory.\nAnd it is a bad service indeed those publicists render to the practical work who, thinking\nthemselves particularly (close to the practical workers, fail to see this illusoriness, and make\nshift with the astoundingly hollow and cheap argument that we must have local newspapers, we must have district newspapers, and we must have all-Russia newspapers. Generally speaking, of course, all these are necessary, but once the solution of a concrete\norganisational problem is undertaken, surely time and circumstances must be taken into\nconsideration. Is it not quixotic for Svoboda (No. , p. ) to write in a special article\n\u201ddealing with the question of a newspaper\u201c: \u201dIt seems to us that every locality, with any\nappreciable number of workers, should have its own workers\u2019 newspaper; not a newspaper\nimported from somewhere, but its very own.\u201c If the publicist who wrote these words refuses\nto think of their meaning, then at least the reader may do it for him. How many scores, if\nnot hundreds, of \u201dlocalities\u201c with any appreciable number of workers\u201d there are in Russia,\nand what a perpetuation of our amateurish methods this would mean if indeed every local\norganisation set about publishing its own. newspaper! How this diffusion would facilitate\nthe gendarmerie\u2019s task of netting \u2013 and without \u201cany appreciable\u201d effort \u2013 the local revolutionary workers at the very outset of their activity and of preventing them from developing\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\ninto real revolutionaries. A reader of an all-Russia newspaper, continues the author, would\nfind little interest in the descriptions of the. malpractices of the factory owners and the\n\u201cdetails of factory life in various towns not his own\u201d. But \u201can inhabitant of Orel would not\nfind Orel affairs dull reading. In every issue he would learn who had been \u2019picked for a\nlambasting\u2019 and who had been \u2019flayed\u2019, and he would be in high spirits\u201d (p. ). Certainly,\nthe Orel reader is in high spirits, but our publicist\u2019s flights of imagination are also high \u2013\ntoo high. He should have asked himself whether such concern with trivialities is tactically\nin order. We are second to none in appreciating the importance and necessity of factory\nexposures, but it must be borne in mind that we have reached a stage when St. Petersburg\nfolk find it dull reading the St. Petersburg correspondence of the St. Petersburg Rabochaya\nMysl. Leaflets are the medium through which local factory exposures have always been and\nmust continue to be made, but we must raise the level of the newspaper, not lower it to the\nlevel of a factory leaflet. What we ask of a newspaper is not so much \u201cpetty\u201d exposures, as\nexposures of the major, typical evils of factory life, exposures based on especially striking\nfacts and capable, therefore, of arousing the interest of all workers and all leaders of the\nmovement, of really enriching their knowledge, broadening their outlook, and serving as a\nstarting-point for awakening new districts and workers from ever-newer trade areas.\n\u201cMoreover, in a local newspaper, all the malpractices of the factory administration and\nother authorities may he denounced then and there. In the case of a general, distant newspaper, however, by the time the news reaches it the facts will have been forgotten in the\nsource localities. The reader, on getting the paper, will exclaim: \u2019When was that-who remembers it?\u201d\u2019 (ibid.). Precisely \u2013 who remembers it! From the same source we learn that\nthe  issues of newspapers which appeared in the course of two and a half years were\npublished in six cities. This averages one issue per city per half-year! And even if our\nfrivolous publicist trebled his estimate of the productivity of local work (which would be\nwrong in the case of an average town, since it is impossible to increase productivity to any\nconsiderable extent by our rule-of-thumb methods), we would still get only one issue every\ntwo months, i.e., nothing at all like \u201cdenouncing then and there\u201d. It would suffice, however,\nfor ten local organisations to combine and send their delegates to take an active part in organising a general newspaper, to enable us every fortnight to \u201cdenounce\u201d, over the whole\nof Russia, not petty, but really outstanding and typical evils. No one who knows the state\nof affairs in our organisations can have the slightest doubt on that score. As for catching\nthe enemy red-handed \u2013 if we mean it seriously and not merely as a pretty phrase \u2013 that\nis quite beyond the ability of an illegal paper generally. It can be done only by a leaflet,\nbecause the time limit for exposures of that nature can be a day or two at the most (e.g., the\nusual brief strikes, violent factory clashes, demonstrations, etc.).\n\u201cThe workers live not only at the factory, but also in the city,\u201d continues our author, rising\nfrom the particular to the general, with a strict consistency that would have done honour\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nto Boris Krichevsky himself; and he refers to matters like municipal councils, municipal\nhospitals, municipal schools, and demands that workers\u2019 newspapers should not ignore\nmunicipal affairs in general.\nThis demand \u2013 excellent in itself \u2013 serves as a particularly vivid illustration of the empty\nabstraction to which discussions of local newspapers are all too frequently limited. In the\nfirst place, if indeed newspapers appeared \u201cin every locality with any appreciable number of workers\u201d with such detailed information on municipal affairs as Svoboda desires,\nthis would, under our Russian conditions, inevitably degenerate into actual concern with\ntrivialities, lead to a weakening of the consciousness of the importance of an all-Russia\nrevolutionary assault upon the tsarist autocracy, and strengthen the extremely virile shoots\n\u2013 not uprooted but rather hidden or temporarily suppressed \u2013 of the tendency that has become noted as a result of the famous remark about revolutionaries who talk a great deal\nabout non-existent parliaments and too little about existent municipal councils. We say\n\u201cinevitably\u201d, in order to emphasise that Svoboda obviously does not desire this, but the\ncontrary, to come about. But good intentions are not enough. For municipal affairs to be\ndealt with in their proper perspective, in relation to our entire work, this perspective must\nfirst be clearly conceived, firmly established, not only by argument, but by numerous examples, so that it may acquire the stability of a tradition. This is still far from being the\ncase with us. Yet this must be done first, before we can allow ourselves to think and talk\nabout an extensive local press.\nSecondly, to write really well and interestingly about municipal affairs, one must have\nfirst-hand knowledge, not book knowledge, of the issues. But there are hardly any SocialDemocrats anywhere in Russia who possess such knowledge. To be able to write in newspapers (not in popular pamphlets) about municipal and state affairs, one must have fresh\nand varied material gathered and written up by able people. And in order to be able to gather\nand write up such material, we must have something more than the \u201cprimitive democracy\u201d\nof a primitive circle, in which everybody does everything and all entertain themselves by\nplaying at referendums. It is necessary to have a staff of expert writers and correspondents,\nan army of Social-Democratic reporters who establish contacts far and wide, who are able\nto fathom all sorts of \u201cstate secrets\u201d (the knowledge of which makes the Russian government official so puffed up, but the blabbing of which is such an easy matter to him), who\nare able to penetrate \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d \u2013 an army of\u2019 people who must, as their \u201cofficial\nduty\u201d, be ubiquitous and omniscient. And we, the Party that fights against all economic,\npolitical, social, and national oppression, can and must find, gather, train, mobilise, and\nset into motion such an army of omniscient people \u2013 all of which requires still to be done.\nNot only has not a single step in this direction been taken in the overwhelming majority of\nlocalities, but even the recognition of its necessity is very often lacking. One will search\nin vain in our Social-Democratic press for lively and interesting articles, correspondence,\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nand exposures dealing with our big and little affairs \u2013 diplomatic, military, ecclesiastical,\nmunicipal, financial, etc., etc. There is almost nothing, or very little, about these matters.\nThat is why \u201cit always annoys me frightfully when a man comes to me, utters beautiful and\ncharming words\u201d about the need for newspapers in \u201cevery locality with any appreciable\nnumber of workers\u201d that will expose factory, municipal, and government evils.\nThe predominance of the local papers over a central press may be a sign of either poverty\nor luxury. Of poverty, when the movement has not yet developed the forces for large-scale\nproduction, continues to flounder in amateurism, and is all but swamped with \u201cthe petty\ndetails of factory life\u201d. Of luxury, when the movement has fully mastered the task of comprehensive exposure and comprehensive agitation, and it becomes necessary to publish numerous local newspapers in addition to the central organ. Let each decide for himself what\nthe predominance of local newspapers implies in present-day Russia. I shall limit myself\nto a precise formulation of my own conclusion, to leave no grounds for misunderstanding.\nHitherto, the majority of our local organisations have thought almost exclusively in terms\nof local newspapers, and have devoted almost all their activities to this work. This is abnormal; the very opposite should have been the case. The majority of the local organisations\nshould think principally of the publication of an all-Russia newspaper and devote their activities chiefly to it. Until this is done, we shall not be able to establish a single newspaper\ncapable, to any degree, of serving the movement with comprehensive press agitation. When\nthis is done, however, normal relations between the necessary central newspaper and the\nnecessary local newspapers will be established automatically.\nIt would seem at first glance that the conclusion on the necessity for shifting the centre\nof gravity from local to all-Russia work does not apply to the sphere of the specifically\neconomic struggle. In this struggle, the immediate enemies of the workers are the individual employers or groups of employers, who are not bound by any organisation having\neven the remotest resemblance to the purely military, strictly centralised organisation of the\nRussian Government \u2013 our immediate enemy in the political struggle \u2013 which is led in all\nits minutest details by a single will.\nBut that is not the case. As we have repeatedly pointed out, the economic struggle is\na trade struggle, and for that reason it requires that the workers be organised according to\ntrades, not only according to place of employment. Organisation by trades becomes all the\nmore urgently necessary, the more rapidly our employers organise in all sorts of companies\nand syndicates. Our fragmentation and our amateurism are an outright hindrance to this\nwork of organisation which requires the existence of a single, all-Russia body of revolutionaries capable of giving leadership to the all-Russia trade unions. We have described\n\nTHE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARIES\nabove the type of organisation that is needed for this purpose; we shall now add but a few\nwords on the question of our press in this connection.\nHardly anyone will doubt the necessity for every Social-Democratic newspaper to have\na special department devoted to the trade union (economic) struggle. But the growth of\nthe trade union movement compels us to think about the creation of a trade union press.\nIt seems to us, however, that with rare exceptions, there can be no question of trade union\nnewspapers in Russia at the present time; they would be a luxury, and many a time we lack\neven our daily bread. The form of trade union press that would suit the conditions of our\nillegal work and is already required at the present time is trade union pamphlets. In these\npamphlets, legal and illegal material should be gathered and grouped systematically, on\nthe working conditions in a given trade, on the differences in this respect in the various parts\nof, Russia; on the main demands advanced by the workers in the given trade; on the inadequacies of legislation affecting that trade; on outstanding instances of economic struggle by\nthe workers in the trade; on the beginnings, the present state, and the requirements of their\ntrade union organisation, etc. Such pamphlets would, in the first place, relieve our SocialDemocratic press of a mass of trade details that are of interest only to workers in the given\ntrade. Secondly, they would record the results of our experience in the trade union struggle,\nthey would preserve the gathered material, which now literally gets lost in a mass of leaflets\nand fragmentary correspondence; and they would summarise this material. Thirdly, they\ncould serve as guides for agitators, because working conditions change relatively slow ly\nand the main demands of the workers in a given trade are extremely stable (cf., for example,\nthe demands advanced by the weavers in the Moscow district in  and in the St. Petersburg district in ). A compilation of such demands and needs might serve for years as\nan excellent handbook for agitators on economic questions in backward localities or among\nthe backward strata of the workers. Examples of successful strikes in a given region, information on higher living standards, on improved working conditions, in one locality, would\nencourage the workers in other localities to take up the fight again and again. Fourthly,\nhaving made a start in generalising the trade union struggle and in this way strengthening\nthe link between the Russian trade union movement and socialism, the Social-Democrats\nwould at the same time see to it that our trade union work occupied neither too small nor\ntoo large a place in our Social-Democratic work as a whole. A local organisation that is cut\noff from organisations in other towns finds it very difficult, sometimes almost impossible,\nto maintain a correct sense of pro portion (the example ofRabochaya MysI shows what a\nmonstrous exaggeration can be made in the direction of trade-unionism) But an all-Russia\norganisation of revolutionaries that stands undeviatingly on the basis of Marxism, that leads\nthe entire political struggle and possesses a staff of professional agitators, will never find it\ndifficult to determine the proper proportion.\nCHAPTER \nTHE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA\nPOLITICAL NEWSPAPER\n\u201cThe most serious blunder Iskra committed in this connection\u201d writes B. Krichevsky (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. , p. ), charging us with a tendency to \u201cconvert theory into a lifeless\ndoctrine by isolating it from practice\u201d, \u201cwas its \u2019plan\u2019 for a general party organisation\u201d\n(viz., the article entitled \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d). Martynov echoes this idea in declaring\nthat \u201cIskra\u2019s tendency to belittle the significance of the forward march of the drab everyday struggle in comparison with the propaganda of brilliant and completed ideas ... was\ncrowned with the plan for the organisation of a party which it sets forth in the article entitled\n\u2019Where To Begin\u2019 in issue No. \u201d (ibid., p. ). Finally, L. Nadezhdin has of late joined\nin the chorus of indignation against this \u201cplan\u201d (the quotation marks were meant to express\nsarcasm). In his pamphlet, which we have just received, entitled The Eve of the Revolution\n(published by the \u201cRevolutionary-Socialist Group\u201d Svoboda, whose acquaintance we have\nmade), he declares (p. ): \u201cTo speak now of an organisation held together by an allRussia newspaper means propagating armchair ideas and armchair work\u201d and represents a\nmanifestation of \u201cbookishness\u201d, etc.\nThat our terrorist turns out to be in agreement with the champions of the \u201cforward march\nof the drab everyday struggle\u201d is not surprising, since we have traced the roots of this intimacy between them in the chapters on politics and organisation. But must draw attention\nhere to the fact that Nadezhdin is the only one who has conscientiously tried to grasp the\ntrain of thought in an article he disliked and has made an attempt to reply to the point,\nwhereas Rabocheye Dyelo, has said nothing that is material to the subject, but has tried\nmerely to confuse the question by a series of unseemly, demagogic sallies. Unpleasant\nthough the task may be, we must first spend some time in cleansing this Augean stable.\n\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\n.. WHO WAS OFFENDED BY THE ARTICLE \u201cWHERE TO\nBEGIN\u201d\nLet us present a small selection of the expletives and exclamations that Rabocheye Dyelo\nhurled at us. \u201cIt is not a newspaper that can create a party organisation, but vice versa. .\n. . A newspaper, standing above the party, outside of its control, and independent of it,\nthanks to its having its own staff of agents. \u201dBy what miracle has Iskra forgotten about the\nactually existing Social-Democratic organisations of the party to which it belongs?. . .\u201c\n\u201dThose who possess firm principles and a corresponding plan are the supreme regulators\nof the real struggle of the party and dictate to it their plan. . . .\u201c \u201dThe plan drives our\nactive and virile organisations into the kingdom of shadows and desires to call into being\na fantastic network of agents ...... \u201cWere Iskra\u2019s plan carried into effect, every trace of\nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, which is taking shape, would be obliterated\n.... \u201d \u201cA propagandist organ becomes an uncontrolled autocratic law-maker for the entire\npractical revolutionary struggle. . . .\u201d \u201cHow should our Party react to the suggestion that it\nbe completely subordinated to an autonomous editorial board?\u201d, etc., etc.\nAs the reader can see from the contents and the tone of these above quotations, Rabocheye Dyelo has taken offence. Offence, not for its own sake, but for the sake of the organisations and committees of our Party which it alleges Iskra desires to drive into the kingdom\nof shadows and whose very traces it would obliterate. How terrible! But a curious thing\nshould be noted. The article \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d appeared in May . The articles in\nRabocheye Dyelo appeared in September . Now we are in mid-January . During\nthese five months (prior to and after September), not a single committee and not a single\norganisation of the Party protested formally against this monster that seeks to drive them\ninto the kingdom of shadows; and yet scores and hundreds of communications from all\nparts of Russia have appeared during this period in Iskra, as well as in numerous local and\nnon-local publications. How could it happen that those who would be driven into the realm\nof shadows are not aware of it and have not taken offence, though a third party has?\nThe explanation is that the committees and other organisations are engaged in real work\nand are not playing at \u201cdemocracy\u201d. The committees read the article \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d,\nsaw that it represented an attempt \u201cto elaborate a definite plan for an organisation, so that\nits formation may be undertaken from all aspects\u201d; and since they knew and saw very\nwell that not one of these \u201csides\u201d would dream of \u201csetting about to build it\u201d until it was\nconvinced of its necessity, and of the correctness of the architectural plan, it has naturally\nnever occurred to them to take offence at the boldness of the people who said in Iskra:\n\u201cIn view of the pressing importance of the question we, on our part, take the liberty of\nsubmitting to the comrades a skeleton plan to be developed in greater detail in a pamphlet\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nnow in preparation for the print.\u201d With a conscientious approach to the work, was it possible\nto view things otherwise than that if the comrades accepted the plan submitted to them,\nthey would carry it out, not because they are \u201csubordinate\u201d, but because they would be\nconvinced of its necessity for our common cause, and that if they did not accept it, then\nthe \u201cskeleton\u201d (a pretentious word, is it not?) would remain merely a skeleton? Is it not\ndemagogy to fight against the skeleton of a plan, not only by \u201cpicking it to pieces\u201d and\nadvising comrades to reject it, but by inciting people inexperienced in revolutionary matters\nagainst its authors merely on the grounds that they dare to \u201clegislate\u201d and come out as the\n\u201csupreme regulators\u201d, i.e., because they dare to propose an outline of a plan? Can our Party\ndevelop and make progress if an attempt to raise local functionaries to broader views,\ntasks, plans, etc., is objected to, not only with the claim that these views are erroneous,\nbut on the grounds that the very \u201cdesire\u201d to \u201craise\u201d us gives \u201coffence\u201d? Nadezhdin, too,\n\u201cpicked\u201d our plan \u201cto pieces\u201d, but he did not sink to such demagogy as cannot be explained\nsolely by naivete or by primitiveness of political views. From the outset, he emphatically\nrejected the charge that we intended to establish an \u201cinspectorship over the Party\u201d. That\nis why Nadezhdin\u2019s criticism of the plan can and should be answered on its merits, while\nRabocheye Dyelo deserves only to be treated with contempt.\nBut contempt for a writer who sinks so low as to shout about autocracy\u201c and \u201dsubordination\u201c does not relieve us of the duty of disentangling the confusion that such people\ncreate in the minds of their readers. Here we can clearly demonstrate to the world the nature\nof catchwords like \u201dbroad democracy\u201c. We are accused of forgetting the committees, of\ndesiring or attempting to drive them into the kingdom of shadows, etc. How can we reply\nto these charges when, out of considerations of secrecy, we can give the reader almost no\nfacts regarding our real relationships with the committees? Persons hurling vehement accusations calculated to provoke the crowd prove to be ahead of us because of their brazenness\nand their disregard of the duty of a revolutionary to conceal carefully from the eyes of the\nworld the relationships and contacts which he maintains, which he is establishing or trying\nto establish. Naturally, we refuse once and for all to compete with such people in the field\nof \u201ddemocratism\u201c. As to the reader who is not initiated in all Party affairs, the only way in\nwhich we can discharge our duty to him is to acquaint him, not with what is and what is im\nWerden but with a particle of what has taken place and what may be told as a thing of the\npast.\nThe Bund hints that we are \u201dimpostors\u201c; the Union Abroad accuses us of attempting\nto obliterate all traces of the Party. Gentlemen, you will get complete satisfaction when we\nrelate to the public four facts concerning the past.\nFirst fact. The members of one of the Leagues of Struggle, who took a direct part\nin founding our Party and in sending a delegate to the Inaugural Party Congress, reached\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nagreement with a member of the Iskra group regarding the publication of a series of books\nfor workers that were to serve the entire movement. The attempt to publish the series failed\nand the pamphlets written for it, The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats and The New\nFactory Law,by a circuitous course and through the medium of third parties, found their\nway abroad, where they were published.\nSecond fact. Members of the Central Committee of the Bund approached a member of\nthe Iskra group with the proposal to organise what the Bund then described as a \u201dliterary\nlaboratory\u201c. In making the proposal, they stated that unless this was done, the movement\nwould greatly retrogress. The result of these negotiations was the appearance of the pamphlet The Working-Class Cause in Russia.\nThird fact. The Central Committee of the Bund, via a provincial town, approached a\nmember of the Iskra group with the proposal that he undertake the editing of the revived\nRabochaya Gazeta and, of course, obtained his consent. The offer was later modified: the\ncomrade in question was invited to act as a contributor, in view of a new plan for the composition of the Editorial Board. Also this proposal, of course, obtained his consent. Articles\nwere sent (which we managed to preserve): \u201dOur Programme\u201c which was a direct protest\nagainst Bernsteinism, against the change in the line of the legal literature and of Rabochaya\nMysl; \u201dOur Immediate Task\u201c (\u201dto publish a Party organ that shall appear regularly and have\nclose contacts with all the local groups\u201c, the drawbacks of the prevailing \u201damateurism\u201c),\n\u201dAn Urgent Question\u201c (an examination of the objection that it is necessary first to develop\nthe activities of local groups before undertaking the publication of a common organ; an\ninsistence on the paramount importance of a \u201drevolutionary organisation\u201c and on the necessity of \u201ddeveloping organisation, discipline, and the technique of secrecy to the highest\ndegree of perfection\u201c). The proposal to resume publication of Rabochaya Gazeta was\nnot carried out, and the articles were not published.\nFourth fact. A member of the committee that was organising the second regular congress\nof our Party communicated to a member of the Iskra group the programme of the congress\nand proposed that group as editorial board of the revived Rabochaya Gazeta. This preliminary step, as it were, was later sanctioned by the committee to which this member belonged,\nand by the Central Committee of the Bund. The Iskra group was notified of the place and\ntime of the congress and (uncertain of being able, for certain reasons, to send a delegate)\ndrew up a written report for the congress. In the report, the idea was suggested that the mere\nelection of a Central Committee would not only fail to solve the question of unification at a\ntime of such complete disorder as the present, but would even compromise the grand idea\nof establishing a party, in the event of an early, swift, and thorough police round-up, which\nwas more than likely in view of the prevailing lack of secrecy; that therefore, a beginning\nshould be made by inviting all committees and all other organisations to support the revived\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\ncommon organ, which would establish real contacts between all the committees and really\ntrain a group of leaders for the entire movement; and that the committees and the Party\nwould very easily be able to transform such a group into a Central Committee as soon as\nthe group had grown and become strong. In consequence of a number of police raids and\narrests, however, the congress could not take place. For security reasons the report was\ndestroyed, having been read only by a few comrades, including the representatives of one\ncommittee.\nLet the reader now judge for himself the character of the methods employed by the Bund\nin hinting that we were impostors, or by Rabocheye Dyelo, which accuses us of trying to\nrelegate the committees to the kingdom of shadows and to \u201dsubstitute\u201c for the organisation of a party an organisation disseminating the ideas advocated by a single newspaper. It\nwas to the committees, on their repeated invitation, that we reported on the necessity for\nadopting a definite plan of concerted activities. It was precisely for the Party organisation\nthat we elaborated this plan, in articles sent to Rabochaya Gazeta, and in the report to the\nParty congress, again on the invitation of those who held such an influential position in the\nParty that they took the initiative in its (actual) restoration. Only after the twice repeated\nattempts of the Party organisation, in conjunction with ourselves, officially to revive the\ncentral organ of the Party had failed, did we consider it our bounden duty to publish an\nunofficial organ, in order that with the third attempt the comrades might have before them\nthe results of experience and not merely conjectural proposals. Now certain results of this\nexperience are present for all to see, and all comrades may now judge whether we properly\nunderstood our duties and what should be thought of people that strive to mislead those unacquainted with the immediate past, simply because they are piqued at our having pointed\nout to some their inconsistency on the \u201dnational\u201c question, and to others the inadmissibility\nof their vacillation in matters of principle.\n.. CAN A NEWSPAPER BE A COLLECTIVE ORGANISER?\nThe quintessence of the article \u201dWhere To Begin\u201c consists in the fact that it discusses\nprecisely this question and gives an affirmative reply to it. As far as we know, the only\nattempt to examine this question on its merits and to prove that it must be answered in the\nnegative was made by L. Nadezhdin, whose argument we reproduce in full:\n\u201dIt pleased us greatly to see Iskra (No. ) present the question of the need for an allRussia newspaper; but we cannot agree that this presentation bears relevance to the title\n\u2019Where To Begin\u2019. Undoubtedly this is an extremely important matter, but neither a newspaper, nor a series of popular leaflets, nor a mountain of manifestoes, can serve as the basis\nfor a militant organisation in revolutionary times. We must set to work to build strong po-\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nlitical organisations in the localities. We lack such organisations; we have been carrying on\nour work mainly among enlightened workers, while the masses have been engaged almost\nexclusively in the economic struggle. If strong political organisations are not trained locally, what significance will even an excellently organised all-Russia newspaper have? It\nwill be a burning bush, burning without being consumed, but firing no one! Iskra thinks that\naround it and in the activities in its behalf people will gather and organise. But they will find\nit far easier to gather and organise around activities that are more concrete. This something more concrete must and should be the extensive organisation of local newspapers,\nthe immediate preparation of the workers\u2019 forces for demonstrations, the constant activity\nof local organisations among the unempIoyed (indefatigable distribution of pamphlets and\nleaflets, convening of meetings, appeals to actions of protest against the government, etc.).\nWe must begin live political work in the localities, and when the time comes to unite on this\nreal basis, it will not he an artificial, paper unity; not by means of newspapers can such a\nunification of local work into an all-Russia cause be achieved\u00a1\u2018 (The Eve of the Revolution,\np. .)\nWe have emphasised the passages in this eloquent tirade that most clearly show the author\u2019s incorrect judgement of our plan, as well as the incorrectness of his point of view in\ngeneral, which is here contraposed to that of Iskra. Unless we train strong political organisations in the localities, even an excellently organised all-Russia newspaper will be of no\navail. This is incontrovertible. But the whole point is that there is no other way of training\nstrong political organisations except through the medium of an all-Russia newspaper. The\nauthor missed the most important statement Iskra made before it proceeded to set forth\nits \u201dplan\u201c: that it was necessary \u201dto call for the formation of a revolutionary organisation,\ncapable of uniting all forces and guiding the movement in actual practice and not in name\nalone, that is, an organisation ready at any time to support every protest and every outbrea\u2019 and use it to build up and consolidate the fighting forces suitable for the decisive\nstruggle\u201c. But now after the February and March events, everyone will agree with this in\nprinciple, continues Iskra. Yet what we need is not a solution of the question in principle, but its practical solution; we must immediately advance a definite constructive plan\nthrough which all may immediately set to work to build from every side. Now we are again\nbeing dragged away from the practical solution towards something which in principle is\ncorrect, indisputable, and great, but which is entirely inadequate and incomprehensible to\nthe broad masses of workers, namely, \u201dto rear strong political organisations\u201c! This is not\nthe point at issue, most worthy author. The point is how to go about the rearing and how to\naccomplish it.\nIt is not true to say that \u201dwe have been carrying on our work mainly among enlightened\nworkers, while the masses have been engaged almost exclusively in the economic struggle\u201c. Presented in such a form, the thesis reduces itself to Svoboda\u2019s usual but fundamen-\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\ntally false contraposition of the enlightened workers to the \u201dmasses\u201c. In recent years, even\nthe enlightened workers have been \u201dengaged almost exclusively in the economic struggle\u201c.\nThat is the first point. On the other hand, the masses will never learn to conduct the political\nstruggle until we help to train leaders for this struggle, both from among the enlightened\nworkers and from among the intellectuals. Such leaders can acquire training solely by systematically evaluating all the everyday aspects of our political life, all attempts at protest\nand struggle on the part of the various classes and on various grounds. Therefore, to talk\nof \u201drearing political organisations\u201c and at the same time to contrast the \u201dpaper work\u201c of a\npolitical newspaper to \u201dlive political work in the localities\u201c is plainly ridiculous. Iskra has\nadapted its \u201dplan\u201c for a newspaper to the \u201dplan\u201c for creating a \u201dmilitant preparedness\u201c to\nsupport the unemployed movement, peasant revolts, discontent among, the Zemstvo people, \u201dpopular indignation against some tsarist bashi-bazouk on the rampage\u201c, etc. Anyone\nwho is at all acquainted with the movement knows full well that the vast majority of local organisations have never even dreamed of these things; that many of the prospects of\n\u201dlive political work\u201c here indicated have never been realised by a single organisation; that\nthe attempt, for example, to call attention to the growth of discontent and protest among\nthe Zemstvo intelligentsia rouses feelings of consternation and perplexity in Nadezhdin\n(\u201dGood Lord, is this newspaper intended for Zemstvo people\u00bf\u2018-The Eve, p. ), among\nthe Economists (Letter to Iskra, No. ), and among many practical workers. Under these\ncircumstances, it is possible to \u201dbegin\u201c only by inducing people to think about all these\nthings, to summarise and generalise all the diverse signs of ferment and active struggle. In\nour time, when Social-Democratic tasks are being degraded, the only way \u201dlive political\nwork\u201c can be begun is with live political agitation, which is impossible unless we have an\nall-Russia newspaper, frequently issued and regularly distributed.\nThose who regard the Iskra \u201dplan\u201c as a manifestation of \u201dbookishness\u201c have totally\nfailed to understand its substance and take for the goal that which is suggested as the most\nsuitable means for the present time. These people have not taken the trouble to study the\ntwo comparisons that were drawn to present a clear illustration of the plan. Iskra wrote:\nThe publication of an all-Russia political newspaper must be the main line by which we\nmay unswervingly develop, deepen, and expand the organisation (viz., the revolutionary\norganisation that is ever ready to support every protest and every outbreak). Pray tell me,\nwhen bricklayers lay bricks in, various parts of an enormous, unprecedentedly large structure, is it \u201dpaper\u201c work to use a line to help them find the correct place for the bricklaying;\nto indicate to them the ultimate goal of the common work; to enable them to use, not only\nevery brick, but even every piece of brick which, cemented to the bricks laid before and\nafter it, forms a finished, continuous line? And are we not now passing through precisely\nsuch a period in our Party life when we have bricks and bricklayers, but lack the guide\nline for all to see and follow? Let them shout that in stretching out the line, we want to\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\ncommand. Had we desired to command, gentlemen, we would have written on the title\npage, not \u201dIskra, No. \u201c, but \u201dRabochaya Gazeta, No. \u201c, as we were invited to do by\ncertain comrades, and as we would have had a perfect right to do after the events described\nabove. But we did not do that. We wished to have our hands free to wage an irreconcilable\nstruggle against all pseudo-Social-Democrats; we wanted our line, if properly laid, to be\nrespected because it was correct, and not because it had been laid by an official organ.\n\u201dThe question of uniting local activity in central bodies runs in a vicious circle,\u201c Nadezhdin\nlectures us; \u201dunification requires homogeneity of the elements, and the homogeneity can\nbe created only by something that unites; but the unifying element may be the product\nof strong local organisations which at the present time are by no means distinguished for\ntheir homogeneity.\u201c This truth is as revered and as irrefutable as that we must train strong\npolitical organisations. And it is equally barren. Every question \u201druns in a vicious circle\u201c\nbecause political life as a whole is an endless chain consisting of an infinite number of\nlinks. The whole art of politics lies in finding and taking as firm a grip as we can of the\nlink that is least likely to be struck from our hands, the one that is most important at the\ngiven moment, the one that most of all guarantees its possessor the possession of the whole\nchain. If we had a crew of experienced bricklayers who had learned to work so well\ntogether that they could lay their bricks exactly as required without a guide line (which,\nspeaking abstractly, is by no means impossible), then perhaps we might take hold of some\nother link. But it is unfortunate that as yet we have no experienced bricklayers trained for\nteamwork, that bricks are often laid where they are not needed at all, that they are not laid\naccording to the general line, but are so scattered that the enemy can shatter the structure\nas if it were made of sand and not of bricks.\n\u2019Another comparison: \u201dA newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, it is also a collective organiser. In this respect it may be compared to the scaffolding erected round a building under construction; it marks the contours of the structure\nand facilitates communication between the builders, permitting them to distribute the work\nand to view the common results achieved by their organised labour.\u201c Does this sound\nanything like the attempt of an armchair author to exaggerate his role? The scaffolding is\nnot required at all for the dwelling; it is made of cheaper material, is put up only temporarily, and is scrapped for firewood as soon as the shell of the structure is completed. As for\nthe building of revolutionary organisations, experience shows that sometimes they may be\nbuilt without scaffolding, as the seventies showed. But at the present time we cannot even\nimagine the possibility of erecting the building we require without scaffolding.\nNadezhdin disagrees with this, saying: \u201dIskra thinks that around it and in the activities\nin its behalf people will gather and organise. But they will find it far easier to gather and\norganise around activities that are more concrete\u00a1\u2018 Indeed, \u201dfar easier around activities that\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nare more concrete\u201c. A Russian proverb holds: \u201dDon\u2019t spit into a well, you may want to\ndrink from it.\u201c But there are people who do not object to drinking from a well that has been\nspat into. What despicable things our magnificent, legal \u201dCritics of Marxism\u201c and illegal\nadmirers of Rabochaya Mysl have said in the name of this something more concrete! How\nrestricted our movement is by our own narrowness, lack of initiative, and hesitation, which\nare justified with the traditional argument about finding it \u201dfar easier to gather around something more concrete\u201c! And Nadezhdin \u2013 who regards himself as possessing a particularly\nkeen sense of the \u201drealities of life\u201c, who so severely condemns \u201darmchair\u201c authors and\n(with pretensions to wit) accuses Iskra of a weakness for seeing Economism everywhere,\nand who sees himself standing far above the division between the orthodox and the Critics \u2013 fails to see that with his arguments he contributes to the narrowness that arouses his\nindignation and that he is drinking from the most spat-in well! The sincerest indignation\nagainst narrowness, the most passionate desire to raise its worshippers from their knees,\nwill not suffice if the indignant one is swept along without sail or rudder and, as \u201dspontaneously\u201c as the revolutionaries of the seventies, clutches at such things as \u201dexcitative\nterror\u201c, \u201dagrarian terror\u201c, \u201dsounding the tocsin etc. Let us take a glance at these \u201cmore concrete\u201d activities around which he thinks it will be \u201cfar easier\u201d to gather and organise: ()\nlocal newspapers; () preparations for demonstrations; () work among the unemployed. It\nis immediately apparent that all these things have been seized upon at random as a pretext\nfor saying something; for, however we may regard them, it would be absurd to see in them\nanything especially suitable for \u201cgathering and organising\u201d. The selfsame Nadezhdin says\na few pages further: \u201cIt is time we simply stated the fact that activity of a very pitiable\nkind is being carried on in the localities, the committees are not doing a tenth of what they\ncould do ... the coordinating centres we have at present are the purest fiction, representing\na sort of revolutionary bureaucracy, whose members mutually grant generalships to one\nanother; and so it will continue until strong local organisations grow up.\u201d These remarks,\nthough exaggerating the position somewhat, no doubt contain many a bitter truth; but can\nit be said that Nadezhdin does not perceive the connection between the pitiable activity in\nthe localities and the narrow mental outlook of the functionaries, the narrow scope of their\nactivities, inevitable in the circumstances of the lack of training of Party workers confined\nto local organisations? Has he, like the author of the article on organisation, published in\nSvoboda, forgotten how the transition to a broad local press (from ) was accompanied by a strong intensification of Economism and \u201cprimitiveness\u201d? Even if a \u201cbroad local\npress\u201d could be established at all satisfactorily (and we have shown this to be impossible,\nsave in very, exceptional cases) \u2013 even then the local organs could not \u201cgather and organise\u201d all the revolutionary forces for a general attack upon the autocracy and for leadership\nof the united struggle. Let us not forget that we are here discussing only the \u201crallying\u201d,\norganising significance of the newspaper, and we could put to Nadezhdin, who defends\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nfragmentation, the question he himself has ironically put: \u201cHave we been left a legacy of\n, revolutionary organisers?\u201d Furthermore, \u201cpreparations for demonstrations\u201d cannot\nbe contraposed to Iskra\u2019s plan, for the very reason that this plan includes the organisation\nof the broadest possible demonstrations as one of its aims; the point under discussion is\nthe selection of the practical means. On this point also Nadezhdin is confused, for he has\nlost sight of the fact that only forces that are \u201cgathered and organised\u201d can \u201cprepare for\u201d\ndemonstrations (which hitherto, in the overwhelming majority of cases, have taken place\nspontaneously) and that we lack precisely the ability to rally and organise. \u201cWork among\nthe unemployed.\u201d Again the same confusion; for this too represents one of the field operations of the mobilised forces and not a plan for mobilising the forces. The extent to which\nNadezhdin here too underestimates the harm caused by our fragmentation, by our lack of\n\u201c, organisers\u201d, can be seen from the fact that: many people (including Nadezhdin)\nhave reproached Iskra for the paucity of the news it gives on unemployment and for the\ncasual nature of the correspondence it publishes about the most common affairs of rural\nlife. The reproach is justified; but Iskra is \u201cguilty without sin\u201d. We strive \u201cto stretch a line\u201d\nthrough the countryside too, where there are hardly any bricklayers anywhere, and we are\nobliged to encourage everyone who informs us even as regards the most common facts, in\nthe hope that this will increase the number of our contributors in the given field and will\nultimately train us all to select facts that are really the most outstanding. But the material\non which we can train is so scanty that, unless we generalise it for the whole of Russia,\nwe shall have very little to train on at all. No doubt, one with at least as much ability as\nan agitator and as much knowledge of the life of the vagrant as Nadezhdin manifests could\nrender priceless service to the movement by carrying on agitation among the unemployed;\nbut such a person would be simply hiding his light under a bushel if he failed to inform all\ncomrades in Russia as regards every step he took in his work, so that others, who, in the\nmass, still lack the ability to undertake new kinds of work, might learn from his example.\nAll without exception now talk of the importance of unity, of the necessity for \u201cgathering and organising\u201d; but in the majority of cases what is lacking is a definite idea of where\nto begin and how to bring about this unity. Probably all will agree that if we \u201cunite\u201d, say,\nthe district circles in a given town, it will be necessary to have for this purpose common\ninstitutions, i.e., not merely the common title of \u201cLeague\u201d, but genuinely common work,\nexchange of material, experience, and forces, distribution of functions, not only by districts,\nbut through specialisation on a town-wide scale. All will agree that a big secret apparatus\nwill not pay its way (to use a commercial expression) \u201cwith the resources\u201d (in both money\nand manpower, of course) of a single district, and that this narrow field will not provide\nsufficient scope for a specialist to develop his talents. But the same thing applies to the\nco-ordination of activities of a number of towns, since even a specific locality will be and,\nin the history of our Social-Democratic movement, has proved to be, far too narrow a field;\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nwe have demonstrated this above in detail with regard to political agitation and organisational work. What we require foremost and imperatively is to broaden the field, establish\nreal contacts between the towns on the basis of regular, common work; for fragmentation\nweighs down on the people and they are \u201cstuck in a hole\u201d (to use the expression employed\nby a correspondent to Iskra), not knowing what is happening in the world, from whom to\nlearn, or how to acquire experience and satisfy their desire to engage in broad activities. I\ncontinue to insist that we can start establishing real contacts only with the aid of a common\nnewspaper, as the only regular, all-Russia enterprise, one which will summarise the results\nof the most diverse forms of activity and thereby stimulate people to march forward untiringly along all the innumerable paths leading to revolution, in the same way as all roads\nlead to Rome. If we do not want unity in name only, we must arrange for all local study\ncircles immediately to assign, say, a fourth of their forces to active work for the common\ncause, and the newspaper will immediately convey to them the general design, scope,\nand character of the cause; it will give them a precise indication of the most keenly felt\nshortcomings in the all-Russia activity, where agitation is lacking and contacts are weak,\nand it will point out which little wheels in the vast general mechanism a given study circle\nmight repair or replace with better ones. A study circle that has not yet begun to work,\nbut which is only just seeking activity, could then start, not like a craftsman in an isolated\nlittle workshop unaware of the earlier development in \u201cindustry\u201d or of the general level of\nproduction methods prevailing in industry, but as a participant in an extensive enterprise\nthat reflects the whole general revolutionary attack on the autocracy. The more perfect the\nfinish of each little wheel and the larger the number of detail workers engaged in the common cause, the closer will our network become and the less will be the disorder in the ranks\nconsequent on inevitable police, raids.\nThe mere function of distributing a newspaper would help to establish actual contacts\n(if it is a newspaper worthy of the name, i.e., if it is issued regularly, not once a month\nlike a magazine, but at least four times a month). At the present time, communication\nbetween towns on revolutionary business is an extreme rarity, and, at all events, is the\nexception rather than the rule. If we had a newspaper, however, such communication would\nbecome the rule and would secure, not only the distribution of the newspaper, of course,\nbut (what is more important) an exchange of experience, of material, of forces, and of\nresources. Organisational work would immediately acquire much greater scope, and the\nsuccess of one locality would serve as a standing encouragement to further perfection; it\nwould arouse the desire to utilise the experience gained by comrades working in other\nparts of the country. Local work would become far richer and more varied than it is at\npresent. Political and economic exposures gathered from all over Russia would provide\nmental food for workers of all trades and all stages of development; they would provide\nmaterial and occasion for talks and readings on the most diverse subjects, which would,\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nin addition, be suggested by hints in the legal press, by talk among the people, and by\n\u201cshamefaced\u201d government statements. Every outbreak, every demonstration, would be\nweighed and, discussed in its every aspect in all parts of Russia and would thus stimulate\na desire to keep up with, and even surpass, the others (we socialists do not by any means\nflatly reject all emulation or all \u201ccompetition\u201d!) and consciously prepare that which at first,\nas it were, sprang up spontaneously, a desire to take advantage of the favourable conditions\nin a given district or at a given moment for modifying the plan of attack, etc. At the same\ntime, this revival of local work would obviate that desperate, \u201cconvulsive\u201d exertion of all\nefforts and risking of all forces which every single demonstration or the publication of\nevery single issue of a local newspaper now frequently entails. On the one hand, the police\nwould find it much more difficult to get at the \u201croots\u201d, if they did not know in what district\nto dig down for them. On the other hand, regular common work would train our people\nto adjust the force of a given attack to the strength of the given contingent of the common\narmy (at the present time hardly anyone ever thinks of doing that, because in nine cases out\nof ten these attacks occur spontaneously); such regular common work would facilitate the\n\u201ctransportation\u201d from one place to another, not only of literature, but also of revolutionary\nforces.\nIn a great many cases these forces are now being bled white on restricted local work,\nbut under the circumstances we are discussing it would be possible to transfer a capable\nagitator or organiser from one end of the country to the other, and the occasion for doing\nthis would constantly arise. Beginning with short journeys on Party business at the Party\u2019s\nexpense, the comrades would become accustomed to being maintained by the Party, to\nbecoming professional revolutionaries, and to training themselves as real political leaders.\nAnd if indeed we succeeded in reaching the point when all, or at least a considerable\nmajority, of the local committees local groups, and study circles took up active work for the\ncommon cause, we could, in the not distant future, establish a weekly newspaper for regular distribution in tens of thousands of copies throughout Russia. This newspaper would\nbecome part of an enormous pair of smith\u2019s bellows that would fan every spark of the class\nstruggle and of popular indignation into a general conflagration. Around what is in itself\nstill a very innocuous and very small, but regular and common, effort, in the full sense\nof the word, a regular army of tried fighters would systematically gather and receive their\ntraining. On the ladders and scaffolding of this general organisational structure there would\nsoon develop and come to the fore Social-Democratic Zhelyabovs from among our revolutionaries and Russian Bebels from among our workers, who would take their place at the\nhead of the mobilised army and rouse the whole people to settle accounts with the shame\nand the curse of Russia.\nThat is what we should dream of!\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\n\u201cWe should dream!\u201d I wrote these words and became alarmed. I imagined myself sitting\nat a \u201cunity conference\u201d and opposite me were the Rabocheye Dyelo editors and contributors. Comrade Martynov rises and, turning to me, says sternly: \u201cPermit me to ask you, has\nan autonomous editorial board the right to dream without first soliciting the opinion of the\nParty committees?\u201d He is followed by Comrade Krichevsky; who (philosophically deepening Comrade Martynov, who long ago rendered Comrade Plekhanov more profound)\ncontinues even more sternly: \u201cI go further. I ask, has a Marxist any right at all to dream,\nknowing that according to Marx, mankind always sets itself the tasks it can solve and that\ntactics is a process of the growth of Party tasks which grow together with the Party?\u201d\nThe very thought of these stern questions sends a cold shiver down my spine and makes\nme wish for nothing but a place to hide in. I shall try to hide behind the back of Pisarev.\n\u201cThere are rifts and rifts,\u201d wrote Pisarev of the rift between dreams and reality. \u201cMy\ndream may run ahead of the natural march of events or may fly off at a tangent in a direction\nin which no natural march of events will ever proceed. In the first case my dream will not\ncause any harm; it may even support and augment the energy of the working men.... There\nis nothing in such dreams that would distort or paralyse labour-power. On the contrary, if\nman were completely deprived of the ability to dream in this way, if he could not from time\nto time run ahead and mentally conceive, in an entire and completed picture, the product\nto which his hands are only just beginning to lend shape, then I cannot at all imagine what\nstimulus there would be to induce man to undertake and complete extensive and strenuous\nwork in the sphere of art, science, and practical endeavour.... The rift between dreams\nand reality causes no harm if only the person dreaming believes seriously in his dream, if\nhe attentively observes life, compares his observations with his castles in the air, and if,\ngenerally speaking, he works conscientiously for the achievement of his fantasies. If there\nis some connection between dreams and life then all is well.\u201d\nOf this kind of dreaming there is unfortunately too little in our movement. And the\npeople most responsible for this are those who boast of their sober views, their \u201ccloseness\u201d\nto the \u201cconcrete\u201d, the representatives of legal criticism and of illegal \u201ctail-ism\u201d.\n.. WHAT TYPE OF ORGANISATION DO WE REQUIRE?\nFrom what has been said the reader will see that our \u201ctactics. as-plan\u201d consists in rejecting\nan immediate call for assault; in demanding \u201cto lay effective siege to the enemy fortress\u201d;\nor, in other words, in demanding that all efforts be directed towards gathering, organising,\nand mobilising a permanent army. When we ridiculed Rabocheye Dyelo for its leap from\nEconomism to shouting for an assault (for which it clamoured in April , in \u201cListok\u201d\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nRabochego Dyela, No. ) it of course came down on us with accusations of being\n\u201cdoctrinaire\u201d, of failing to understand our revolutionary duty, of calling for caution, etc.\nOf course, we were not in the least surprised to hear these accusations from those who\ntotally lack principles and who evade all arguments by references to a profound \u201ctacticsas-process\u201d, any more than we were surprised by the fact that these charges were repeated\nby Nadezhdin, who in general has a supreme contempt for durable programmes and the\nfundamentals of tactics.\nIt is said that history does not repeat itself. But Nadezhdin exerts every effort to cause\nit to repeat itself and he zealously imitates Tkachov in strongly condemning \u201crevolutionary culturism\u201d, in shouting about \u201csounding the tocsin\u201d and about a special \u201c eve-of-therevolution point of view\u201d, etc., Apparently, he has forgotten the well-known maxim that\nwhile an original historical event represents a tragedy, its replica is merely a farce. The\nattempt to seize power, which was prepared by the preaching of Tkachov and carried out\nby means of the \u201cterrifying\u201d terror that did really terrify, had grandeur, but the \u201cexcitative\u201d\nterror of a Tkachov the Little is simply ludicrous, particularly so when it is supplemented\nwith the idea of an organisation of average people.\n\u201cIf Iskra would only emerge from its sphere of bookishness,\u201d wrote Nadezhdin, \u201cit\nwould realise that these (instances like the worker\u2019s letter to Iskra, No. , etc.) are symptoms of the fact that soon, very soon, the \u2019assault\u2019 will begin, and to speak now [sic!] of an\norganisation linked with an all-Russia newspaper means to propagate armchair ideas and\narmchair activity.\u201d What an unimaginable muddle \u2013 on the one hand, excitative terror and\nan \u201corganisation of average people\u201d, along with the opinion that it is far \u201ceasier\u201d to gather\naround something \u201cmore concrete\u201d, like a local newspaper, and, on the other, the view that\nto talk \u201cnow\u201d about an all-Russia organisation means to propagate armchair thoughts, or,\nbluntly put, \u201cnow\u201d it is already too late! But what of the \u201cextensive organisation of local\nnewspapers\u201d \u2013 is it not too late for that, my dear L. Nadezhdin? And compare with this\nIskra\u2019s point of view and tactical line: excitative terror is nonsense; to talk of an organisation of average people and of the extensive publication of local newspapers means to fling\nthe door wide open to Economism. We must speak of a single all-Russia organisation of\nrevolutionaries, and it will neverbe too late to talk of that until the real, not a paper, assault\nbegins.\n\u201cYes, as far as organisation is concerned the situation is anything but brilliant,\u201d continues\nNadezhdin. \u201cYes, Iskra is entirely right in saying that the mass of our fighting forces\nconsists of volunteers and insurgents.... You do well to give such a sober picture of the\nstate of our forces. But why, at the same time, do you forget that the masses are not ours at\nall, and consequently, will not ask us when to begin military operations; they will simply\ngo and \u2019rebel\u2019.... When the crowd itself breaks out with its elemental destructive force it\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nmay overwhelm and sweep aside the \u2019regular troops\u2019 among whom we prepared all the time\nto introduce extremely systematic organisation, but never managed to do so.\u201d (Our italics.)\nAstounding logic! For the very reason that the \u201cmasses are not ours\u201d it is stupid and\nunseemly to shout about an immediate \u201cassault\u201d, for assault means attack by regular troops\nand not a spontaneous mass upsurge. For the very reason that the masses may overwhelm\nand sweep aside the regular troops we must without fail \u201cmanage to keep up\u201d with the\nspontaneous upsurge by our work of \u201cintroducing extremely systematic organisation\u201d in\nthe regular troops, for the more we \u201cmanage\u201d to introduce such organisation the more\nprobably will the regular troops not be overwhelmed by the masses, but will take their\nplace at their head. Nadezhdin is confused because he imagines that troops in the course of\nsystematic organisation are engaged in something that isolates them from the masses, when\nin actuality they are engaged exclusively in all-sided and all-embracing political. agitation,\ni.e., precisely in work that brings closer and merges into a single whole the elemental\ndestructive force of the masses and the conscious destructive force of the organisation of\nrevolutionaries. You, gentlemen, wish to lay the blame where it does not belong. For\nit is precisely the Svoboda group that, by including terror in its programme, calls for an\norganisation of terrorists, and such an organisation would indeed prevent our troops from\nestablishing closer contacts with the masses, which, unfortunately, are still not ours, and\nwhich, unfortunately, do not yet ask us, or rarely ask us, when and how to launch their\nmilitary operations.\n\u201cWe shall miss the revolution itself,\u201d continues Nadezhdin in his attempt to scare Iskra,\n\u201cin the same way as we missed ..the recent events, which came upon us like a bolt from the\nblue.\u201d This sentence, taken in connection with what has been quoted above, clearly demonstrates the absurdity of the \u201ceve-of-therevolution point of view\u201d invented by Svoboda.Plainly\nput, this special \u201cpoint of view\u201d boils down to this that it is too late \u201cnow\u201d to discuss and\nprepare. If that is the case, most worthy opponent of \u201cbookishness\u201d, what was the use of\nwriting a pamphlet of pages on \u201cquestions of theory and tactics\u201d? Don\u2019t you think\nit would have been more becoming for the \u201ceve- of- the-revolution point of view\u201d to have\nissued ,leaflets containing the summary call, \u201cBang them \u2013 knock\u2019em down!\u201d?\nThose who make nation-wide political agitation the cornerstone of their programme,\ntheir tactics, and their organisational work, as Iskra does, stand the least risk of missing\nthe revolution. The people who are now engaged throughout Russia in weaving the network\nof connections that spread from the all-Russia newspaper not only did not miss the spring\nevents, but, on the contrary, gave us an opportunity to foretell them. Nor did they miss the\ndemonstrations that were described in Iskra, Nos. and ; on the contrary, they took part\nin them, clearly realising that it was their duty to come to the aid of the spontaneously rising\nmasses and, at the same time, through the medium of the newspaper, help all the comrades\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\nin Russia to inform themselves of the demonstrations and to make use of their gathered\nexperience. And if they live they will not miss the revolution, which, first and foremost, will\ndemand of us experience in agitation, ability to support (in a Social-Democratic manner)\nevery protest, as well as direct the spontaneous movement, while safeguarding it from the\nmistakes of friends and the traps of enemies.\nWe have thus come to the last reason that compels us so strongly to insist on the plan\nof an organisation centred round an all-Russia newspaper, through the common work for\nthe common newspaper. Only such organisation will ensure the flexibility required of a\nmilitant Social-Democratic organisation, viz., the ability to adapt itself immediately to the\nmost diverse and rapidly changing conditions of struggle, the ability, \u201con the one hand, to\navoid an open battle against an overwhelming enemy, when the enemy has concentrated\nall his forces at one spot and yet, on the other, to take advantage of his unwieldiness and\nto attack him when and where he least expects it\u201d. It would be a grievous error indeed\nto build the Party organisation in anticipation only of outbreaks and street fighting, or only\nupon the \u201cforward march of the drab everyday struggle\u201d. We must always conduct our\neveryday work and always be prepared for every situation, because very frequently it is\nalmost impossible to foresee when a period of outbreak will give way to a period of calm.\nIn the instances, however, when it is possible to do so, we could not turn this foresight\nto account for the purpose of reconstructing our organisation; for in an autocratic country\nthese changes take place with astonishing rapidity, being sometimes connected with a single\nnight raid by the tsarist janizaries. And the revolution itself must not by any means be\nregarded as a single act (as the Nadezhdins apparently imagine), but as a series of more or\nless powerful outbreaks rapidly alternating with periods of more or less complete calm. For\nthat reason, the principal content of the activity of our Party organisation, the focus of this\nactivity, should be work that is both possible and essential in the period of a most powerful\noutbreak as well as in the period of complete calm, namely, work of political agitation,\nconnected throughout Russia, illuminating all aspects of life, and conducted among the\nbroadest possible strata of the masses. But this work is unthinkable in present-day Russia\nwithout an all-Russia newspaper, issued very frequently. The organisation, which will form\nround this newspaper, the organisation of its collaborators (in the broad sense of the word,\ni.e., all those working for it), will be ready for everything, from upholding the honour, the\nprestige, and the continuity of the Party in periods of acute revolutionary \u201cdepression\u201d to\npreparing for, appointing the time for, and carrying out the nation-wide armed uprising.\nIndeed, picture to yourselves a very ordinary occurrence in Russia-the total round-up\nof our comrades in one or several localities. In the absence of a single, common, regular\nactivity that combines all the local organisations, such round-ups frequently result in the\ninterruption of the work for many months. if, however, all the local organisations had one\ncommon activity, then, even in the event of a very serious round-up, two or three energetic\n THE \u201cPLAN\u201d FOR AN ALL-RUSSIA POLITICAL NEWSPAPER\npersons could in the course of a few weeks establish contact between the common centre\nand new youth circles, which, as we know, spring up very quickly even now. And when\nthe common activity, hampered by the arrests, is apparent to all, new circles will be able to\ncome into being and make connections with the centre even more rapidly.\nOn the other hand, picture to yourselves a popular uprising. Probably everyone will now\nagree that we must think of this and prepare for it. But how? Surely the Central Committee\ncannot appoint agents to all localities for the purpose of preparing the uprising. Even if\nwe had a Central Committee, it could achieve absolutely nothing by such appointments\nunder present-day Russian conditions. But a network of agents that would form in the\ncourse of establishing and distributing the common newspaper would not have to \u201csit about\nand wait\u201d for the call for an uprising, but could carry on the regular activity that would\nguarantee the highest probability of success in the event of an uprising. Such activity would\nstrengthen our contacts with the broadest strata of the working masses and with all social\nstrata that are discontented with the autocracy, which is of such importance for an uprising.\nPrecisely such activity would serve to cultivate the ability to estimate correctly the general\npolitical situation and, consequently, the ability to select the proper moment for an uprising.\nPrecisely such activity would train all local organisations to respond simultaneously to the\nsame political questions, incidents, and events that agitate the whole of Russia and to react\nto such \u201cincidents\u201d in the most vigorous, uniform, and expedient manner possible; for an\nuprising is in essence the most vigorous, most uniform, and most expedient \u201canswer\u201d of\nthe entire people to the government. Lastly, it is precisely such activity that would train\nall revolutionary organisations throughout Russia to maintain the most continuous, and at\nthe same time the most secret, contacts with one another, thus creating real Party unity; for\nwithout such contacts it will be impossible collectively to discuss\u2019 the plan for the uprising\nand to take the necessary preparatory measures on the eve, measures that must be kept in\nthe strictest secrecy.\nIn a word, the \u201cplan for an all-Russia political newspaper\u201d, far from representing the\nfruits of the labour of armchair workers, infected with dogmatism and bookishness (as it\nseemed to those who gave but little thought to it), is the most practical plan for immediate\nand all-round preparation of the uprising, with, at the same time, no loss of sight for a\nmoment of the pressing day-to-day work.\nEndnotes\nNotes\nCollected Works, Vol. , pp -\nCollected Works, Vol. , pp -\n\nIncidentally, in the history of modern socialism this is a phenomenon, perhaps unique\nand in its way very consoling, namely, that the strife of the various trends within the\nsocialist movement has from national become international. Formerly, the disputes between Lassalleans and Eisenachers, between Guesdists and Possibilists, between Fabians\nand Social-Democrats, and between Narodnaya Volya adherents and Social-Democrats,\nremained confined within purely national frameworks, reflecting purely national features,\nand proceeding, as it were, on different planes. At the present time (as is now evident),\nthe English Fabians, the French Ministerialists, the German Bernsteinians, and the Russian\nCritics \u2013 all belong to the same family, all extol each other, learn from each other, and\ntogether take up arms against \u201cdogmatic\u201d Marxism. In this first really international battle\nwith socialist opportunism, international revolutionary Social-Democracy will perhaps become sufficiently strengthened to put an end to the political reaction that has long reigned\nin Europe?\n A comparison of the two trends within the revolutionary proletariat (the revolutionary\nand the opportunist), and the two trends within the revolutionary bourgeoisie in the eighteenth century (the Jacobin, known as the Mountain, and the Girondist) was made in the\nleading article in No.  of Iskra (February ). The article was written by Plekhanov.\nThe Cadets, !he Bezzaglavtsi, and the Mensheviks to this day love to refer to Jacobinism\nin Russian Social-Democracy. But how Plekhanov came to apply this concept for the first\ntime against the Right wing of Social-Democracy \u2013 about this they prefer to keep silent or\nto forget. (Author\u2019s note to the  edition \u2013 Ed.)\n\n NOTES\nAt the time Engels dealt his blows at Duhring, many representatives of German SocialDemocracy inclined towards the latter\u2019s views, and accusations of acerbity, intolerance,\nuncomradely polemics, etc., were hurled at Engels even publicly at a Party Congress.

See, for instance, the reports of the Stuttgart Congress in\nNo. - (p. ), in which all the disagreements are reduced to \u201ctactics\u201d and the statement\nis merely made that the overwhelming majority remain true to the previous revolutionary\ntactics.

Curiously enough, in No. - (p. ), we read the\nfollowing: \u201c...the views expounded by Bebel have the support of the vast majority of the\nCongress,\u201d and a few lines thereafter: \u201c ..David defended Bernstein\u2019s views.... First of all,\nhe tried to show that ... Bernstein and his friends, after all is said and done (sic!), stand\non the basis of the class struggle...\u201d This was written in December , and in September  Rabocheye Dyelo, apparently no longer believing that Bebel was right, repeats\nDavid\u2019s views as, its own!\nThe reference is to an article by K. Tulin directed against Struve. (See Collected Works,\nVol. , pp. -. \u2013 Ed.) The article was based on an essay entitled \u201cThe Reflection of\nMarxism in Bourgeois Literature\u201d.

The facts given above show that the assertion about\n NOTES\n\u201dabsence of conditions\u201c is diametrically opposed to the truth. Not only at the end, but\neven in the mid-nineties, all the conditions existed for other work, besides the struggle for\npetty demands \u2013 all the conditions except adequate training of leaders. Instead of frankly\nadmitting that we, the ideologists, the leaders, lacked sufficient training \u2013 the Economists\nseek to shift the blame entirely upon the \u201dabsence of conditions\u201c, upon the effect of material\nenvironment that determines the road from which no ideologist will be able to divert the\nmovement. What is this but slavish cringing before spontaneity, what but the infatuation of\nthe \u201dideologists\u201c with their own shortcomings?\nIt should be stated in passing that the praise of Rabochaya MysI in November ,\nwhen Economism had become fully defined, especially abroad, emanated from the selfsame V. I, who very soon after became one of the editors of Rabocheye Dyelo. And yet\nRabocheye Dyelo denied that there were two trends in Russian Social-Democracy, and\ncontinues to deny It to this day!\nThat this simile is a correct one is shown by the following characteristic fact. When, after the arrest of the \u201dDecembrists\u201c, the news spread among the workers of the Schlusselburg \u00a8\nHighway that the discovery and arrest were facilitated by an agent provocateur, N. N.\nMikhailov, a dentist, who had been in contact with a group associated with the \u201dDecembrists\u201c, the workers were so enraged that they decided to kill him.\nThese quotations are taken from the same leading article in the first number of Rabochaya\nMysl. One can judge from this the degree of theoretical training possessed by these \u201dV. V.s\nof Russian Social-Democracy\u201c, who kept repeating the crude vulgarisation of \u201deconomic\nmaterialism\u201c at a time when the Marxists were carrying on a literary war against the real\nMr. V. V., who had long ago been dubbed \u201da past master of reactionary deeds\u201c for holding\nsimilar views on the relations between politics and economics!\nThe Germans even have a special expression, Nur-Gewerkschaftler, which means an\nadvocate of the \u201dpure trade union\u201c struggle.\nWe emphasise the word contemporary for the benefit of those who may pharisaically\nshrug their shoulders and say: It is easy enough to attack Rabochaya Mysl now, but is not\nall this ancient history? Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur (change the name and the\ntale is about you \u2013 Ed.) is our answer to such contemporary Pharisees, whose complete\nsubjection to the ideas of Rabochaya MysI will be proved further on.\nLetter of the Economists, in Iskra, No. .\nRabocheye Dyelo, No. .\n NOTES\nNeue Zeit, -, XX, I, No. , p. . The committee\u2019s draft to which Kautsky\nrefers was adopted by the Vienna Congress (at the end of last year) in a slightly amended\nform.\nThis does not mean, of course, that the workers have no part in creating such an ideology. They take part, however, not as workers, but as socialist theoreticians, as Proudhons\nand Weitlings; in other words, they take part only when they are able, and to the extent that\nthey are able, more or less, to acquire the knowledge of their age and develop that knowledge. But in order that working men may succeed in this more often, every effort must be\nmade to raise the level of the consciousness of the workers in general; it is necessary that\nthe workers do not confine themselves to the artificially restricted limits of \u201dliterature for\nworkers\u201c but that they learn to an increasing degree to master general literature. It would\nbe even truer to say \u201dare not confined\u201c, instead of \u201ddo not confine themselves\u201c, because the\nworkers themselves wish to read and do read all that is written for the intelligentsia, and\nonly a few (bad) intellectuals believe that it is enough \u201dfor workers\u201c to be told a few things\nabout factory conditions and to have repeated to them over and over again what has long\nbeen known.\nIt is often said that the working class spontaneously gravitates towards socialism. This\nis perfectly true in the sense that socialist theory reveals the causes of the misery of the\nworking class more profoundly and more correctly than any other theory, and for that reason the workers are able to assimilate it so easily, provided, however, this theory does not\nitself yield to spontaneity, provided it subordinates spontaneity to itself. Usually this is\ntaken for granted, but it is precisely this which Rabocheye Dyelo forgets or distorts. The\nworking class spontaneously gravitates towards socialism; nevertheless, most widespread\n(and continuously and diversely revived) bourgeois ideology spontaneously imposes itself\nupon the working class to a still greater degree.\nPresent Tasks and Tactics of the Russian Social-Democracy, Geneva, . Two letters\nto Rabochaya Gazeta, written in .\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. -. \u2013Ed.\nIn defending its first untruth (\u201dwe do not know to which young comrades Axelrod referred\u201c), Rabocheye Dyelo added a second, when it wrote in its Reply: \u201dSince the review\nof The Tasks was published, tendencies have arisen, or become more or less clearly defined, among certain Russian Social-Democrats, towards economic one-sidedness, which\nrepresent a step backwards from the state of our movement as described in The Tasks\u201c (p.\n). This, in the Reply, published in . But the first issue of Rabocheye Dyelo (containing the review) appeared in April . Did Economism really arise only in ? No.\n NOTES\nThe year  saw the first protest of the Russian Social-Democrats against Economism\n(the protest against the Credo). Economism arose in , as Rabocheye Dyelo very well\nknows, for already in November , V. I. was praising Rabochaya MysI (see \u201dListok\u201c\nRabotnika, No. -).\nThe \u201dstages theory\u201c, or the theory of \u201dtimid zigzags\u201c, in the political struggle is expressed, for example, in this article, in the following way: \u201dPolitical demands, which in\ntheir character are common to the whole of Russia, should, however, at first (this was written in August !) correspond to the experience gained by the given stratum (sic!) of\nworkers in the economic struggle. Only [!] on the basis of this experience can and should\npolitical agitation be taken up,\u201c etc. (p. ). On page , the author, protesting against what\nhe regards as the absolutely unfounded charge of Economist heresy, pathetically exclaims:\n\u201dWhat Social-Democrat does not know that according to the theories of Marx and Engels\nthe economic interests of certain classes play a decisive role in history, and, consequently,\nthat particularly the proletariat\u2019s struggle for its economic interests must be of paramount\nimportance in its class development and struggle for emancipation\u00bf\u2018 (Our italics.) The word\n\u201dconsequently\u201c is completely irrelevant. The fact that economic interests play a decisive\nrole does not in the least imply that the economic (i.e., trade union) struggle is of prime importance; for the most essential, the \u201ddecisive\u201c interests of classes can be satisfied only by\nradical political changes in general. In particular the fundamental economic interests of the\nproletariat can be satisfied only by a political revolution that will replace the dictatorship of\nthe bourgeoisie by the dictatorship of the proletariat. Krichevsky repeats the arguments of\nthe \u201dV. V.s of Russian Social-Democracy\u201c (viz., that politics follows economics, etc.) and\nof the Bernsteinians of German Social-Democracy (e.g., by similar arguments Woltmann\nsought to prove that the workers must first of all acquire \u201deconomic power\u201c before they can\nthink about political revolution).\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. - \u2013Ed.\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , p.  \u2013Ed.\n\n\u201dEin Jahr der Verwirrung\u201c (\u201dA Year of Confusion\u201c) is the title Mehring gave to the\nchapter of his History of German Social-Democracy in which he describes the hesitancy\nand lack of determination displayed at first by the socialists in selecting the \u201dtactics-asplan\u201c for the new situation.\nLeading article in Iskra, No. . (See Collected Works, Vol. , p.  \u2013Ed.)\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. -. \u2013Ed.\nNor must it be forgotten that in solving \u201dtheoretically\u201c the problem of terror, the Eman-\n NOTES\ncipation of Labour group generalised the experience of the antecedent revolutionary movement.\nTo avoid misunderstanding, we must point out that here, and throughout this pamphlet, by economic struggle, we imply (in keeping with the accepted usage among us) the\n\u201cpractical economic struggle\u201d, which Engels, in the passage quoted above, described as\n\u201cresistance to the capitalists\u201d, and which in free countries is known as the organised-labour\nsyndical, or trade union struggle.\nIn the present chapter we deal only with the political struggle, in its broader or narrower\nmeaning. Therefore, we note only in passing, merely as a curiosity, Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s\ncharge that Iskra is \u201ctoo restrained\u201d in regard to the economic struggle (Two Conferences,\np. , rehashed by Martynov in his pamphlet, Social-Democracy and the Working Class).\nIf the accusers computed by the hundredweights or reams (as they are so fond of doing)\nany given year\u2019s discussion of the economic struggle in the industrial section of Iskra,\nin comparison with the corresponding sections of Rabocheye Dyelo and Rabochaya Mysl\ncombined, they would easily see that the latter lag behind even in this respect. Apparently,\nthe realisation of this simple truth compels them to resort to arguments that clearly reveal\ntheir confusion. \u201cIskra,\u201d they write, \u201cwilly-nilly [!] is compelled [!] to reckon with the\nimperative demands of life and to publish at least [!!] correspondence about the workingclass movement\u201d (Two Conferences, p. ). Now this is really a crushing argument!\nWe say \u201cin general\u201d, because Rabocheye Dyelo speaks of general principles and of the\ngeneral tasks of the Party as a whole. Undoubtedly, cases occur in practice when politics really must follow economics, but only Economists can speak of this in a resolution intended\nto apply to the whole of Russia. Cases do occur whenit is possible \u201cright from the beginning\u201d to carry on political agitation \u201cexclusively on an economic basis\u201d; yet Rabocheye\nDyelo came in the end to the conclusion that \u201cthere is no need for this whatever\u201d (Two Conferences, p. ). In the following chapter, we shall show that the tactics of the \u201cpoliticians\u201d\nand revolutionaries not only do not ignore the trade union tasks of Social-Democracy, but\nthat, on the contrary, they alone can secure their consistent fulfilment.\nThese are the precise expressions used in Two Conferences, pp. , ,  and .\nTwo Conferences, p. .\nRabocheye Dyelo, No. , p. . This is the Martynov variation of the application,\nwhich we have characterised above, of the thesis \u201cevery step of real movement is more\nimportant than a dozen programmes\u201d to the present chaotic state of our movement. In\nfact, this is merely a translation into Russian of the notorious Bernsteinian sentence: \u201cThe\nmovement is everything, the final aim is nothing.\u201d\n NOTES\nP. . \u201cOf course, when we advise the workers to present certain economic demands\nto the government, we do so because in the economic sphere the autocratic government is,\nof necessity, prepared to make certain concessions!\u201d\nSee Collected Works, Vol , pp. - \u2013Ed.\nRabochaya MysI, \u201cSeparate Supplement\u201d, p. .\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. --Ed.\nThe demand \u201cto lend the economic struggle itself a political character\u201d most strikingly\nexpresses subservience to spontaneity in the sphere of political activity. Very often the\neconomic struggle spontaneously assumes a political character, that is to say, without the\nintervention of the \u201crevolutionary bacilli \u2013 the intelligentsia\u201d, without the intervention of\nthe class-conscious Social-Democrats. The economic struggle of the English workers, for\ninstance, also assumed a political character without any intervention on the part of the socialists. The task of the Social-Democrats, however, is not exhausted by political agitation\non an economic basis; their task is to convert trade-unionist politics into Social-Democratic\npolitical struggle, to utilise the sparks of political consciousness which the economic struggle generates among the workers, for the purpose of raising the workers to the level of\nSocial-Democratic political consciousness. The Martynovs, however, instead of raising\nand stimulating the spontaneously awakening political consciousness of the workers, bow\nto spontaneity and repeat over and over ad nauseam, that the economic struggle \u201cImpels\u201d\nthe workers to realise their own lack of political rights. It is unfortunate, gentlemen, that\nthe spontaneously awakening trade-unionist political consciousness does not\u201cimpel\u201d you\nto an understanding ofyour Social-Democratic tasks.\nTo prove that this imaginary speech of a worker to an Economist is based on fact, we\nshall refer to two witnesses who undoubtedly have direct knowledge of the working-class\nmovement and who are least of all inclined to be partial towards us \u201cdoctrinaires\u201d; for\none witness is an Economist (who regards even Rabocheye Dyelo as a political organ!),\nand the other is a terrorist. The first witness is the author of a remarkably truthful and\nvivid article entitled \u201cThe St. Petersburg Working-Class Movement and the Practical Tasks\nof Social-Democracy\u201d, published in Rabocheye Dyelo No. . He divides the workers\ninto the following categories: () class-conscious revolutionaries; () intermediate stratum;\n() the remaining masses. The intermediate stratum, he says, \u201cis often more interested\nin questions of political life than in its own immediate economic interests, the connection\nbetween which and the general social conditions it has long understood\u201d ...Rabochaya Mysl\n\u201cis sharply criticised\u201d: \u201cIt keeps on repeating the same thing over and over again, things\nwe have long known, read long ago.\u201d \u201cAgain nothing in the political review!\u201d (pp. -).\n NOTES\nBut even the third stratum, \u201cthe younger and more sensitive section of the workers, less\ncorrupted by the tavern and the church, who hardly ever have the opportunity of getting\nhold of political literature, discuss political events in a rambling way and ponder over the\nfragmentary news they get about student riots\u201d, etc. The terrorist writes as follows: They\nread over once or twice the petty details of factory life in other towns, not their own, and\nthen they read no more ... dull, they find it.... To say nothing in a workers\u2019 paper about the\ngovernment ... is to regard the workers as being little children.... The workers are not little\nchildren\u201c (Svoboda, published by the Revolutionary-Socialist Group,. pp. -).\nMartynov \u201dconceives of another, more realistic [?] dilemma\u201c (Social-Democracy and\nthe Working Class, p. ): \u201dEither Social-Democracy takes over the direct leadership of the\neconomic struggle of the proletariat and by that [!] transforms it into a revolutionary class\nstruggle....\u201c \u201dBy that\u201c, i.e., apparently by the direct leadership of the economic struggle.\nCan Martynov cite an instance in which leading the trade-union struggle alone has succeeded in transforming a trade-unionist movement into a revolutionary class movement?\nCan he not understand that in order to bring about this \u201dtransformation\u201c we must actively\ntake up the \u201ddirect leadership\u201c of all-sided political agitation?... \u201dOr the other perspective: Social-Democracy refrains from assuming the leadership of the economic struggle of\nthe workers and so ... clips its own wings. ..\u201c In In Rabocheye Dyelo\u2019s opinion, quoted\nabove, it is Iskra that \u201drefrains\u201c. We have seen, however, that the latter does far more than\nRabocheye Dyelo to lead the economic struggle, but that, moreover, it does not confine\nitself thereto and does not narrow down its political tasks for its sake.\nThe big street demonstrations which began in the spring of . (Author\u2019s note to the\n edition \u2013Ed.)\nFor example, during the Franco-Prussian War, Liebknecht dictated a programme of\naction for the whole of democracy; to an even greater extent Marx and Engels did this in\n.\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. - \u2013Ed.\nLack of space has prevented us from replying in detail, in Iskra, to this letter, which\nis highly characteristic of the Economists. We were very glad at its appearance, for the\nallegations that Iskra did not maintain a consistent class point of view had reached us long\nbefore that from various sources, and we were waiting for an appropriate occasion, or for\na formulated expression of this fashionable charge, to give our reply. Moreover, it is our\nhabit to reply to attacks, not by defence, but by counter-attack.\n\u201dIn the interval between these articles there was one (Iskra, No. ), which dealt especially with class antagonisms in the countryside. (SeeCollected Works, Vol. , pp. -\n NOTES\n\u2013Ed.)\nIbid., pp. - \u2013Ed.\nIbid., Vol. , pp. - \u2013Ed.\nIbid., pp. - \u2013Ed.\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. - \u2013Ed.\nThere follows a reference to the \u201cconcrete Russian conditions which fatalistically impel the working-class movement on to the revolutionary path\u201d. But these people refuse\nto understand that the revolutionary path of the working-class movement might not be a\nSocial-Democratic path. When absolutism reigned, the entire West-European bourgeoisie\n\u201cimpelled\u201d, deliberately impelled, the workers on to the path of revolution. We SocialDemocrats, however, cannot be satisfied with that. And if we, by any means whatever,\ndegrade Social-Democratic politics to the level of spontaneous trade-unionist politics, we\nthereby play into the hands of bourgeois democracy.\nRabochaya MysI and Rabocheye Dyelo, especially the Reply to Plekhanov.\nSee \u201cWho Will Bring About the Political Revolution?\u201d in the collection published in\nRussia, entitled The Proletarian Struggle. Re-issued by the Kiev Committee.\nRegeneration of Revolutionism and the journal Svoboda.\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , p.  \u2013Ed.\nIskra\u2019s campaign against the tares evoked the following angry outburst from Rabocheye Dyelo: \u201cFor Iskra, the signs of the times lie not so much in great events [of the spring],\nas in the miserable attempts of the agents of Zubatov to \u2019legalise\u2019 the working-class movement. It fails to see that these facts tell against it; for they testify that the working-class\nmovement has assumed menacing proportions in the eyes of the government\u201d (Two Conferences, p. ). For all this we have to blame the \u201cdogmatism\u201d of the orthodox who \u201cturn\na deaf ear to the imperative demands of life\u201d. They obstinately refuse to see the yardhigh wheat and are combating inch-high tares! Does this not reveal a \u201cdistorted sense of\nperspective in regard to the Russian working-class movement\u201d (ibid., p. )?\nFor the moment let us observe merely that our remarks on \u201cpushing on from outside\u201d and Svoboda\u2019s other disquisitions on organisation apply in their entirety to all the\nEconomists, including the adherents of Rabocheye Dyelo; for some of them have actively\npreached and defended such views on organisation, while others among them have drifted\n NOTES\ninto them.\nThis term is perhaps more applicable to Svoboda than the former, for in an article\nentitled \u201cThe Regeneration of Revolutionisin\u201d the publication defends terrorism, while in\nthe article at present under review it defends Economism. One might say of Svoboda that\n\u201cit would if it could, but it can\u2019t\u201d. Its wishes and intentions are of the very best \u2013 but\nthe result is utter confusion; this is chiefly due to the fact that, while Svoboda advocates\ncontinuity of organisation, it refuses to recognise continuity of revolutionary thought and\nSocial-Democratic theory. It wants to revive the professional revolutionary (\u201cThe Regeneration of Revolutionism\u201d), and to that end proposes, first, excitative terrorism, and, secondly,\n\u2013 an organisation of average workers\u201c (Svoboda, No. , p. , et seq.), as less likely to be\n\u201dpushed on from outside\u201c. In other words, it proposes to pull the house down to use the\ntimber for heating it.\nThus, an undoubted revival of the democratic spirit has recently been observed among\npersons in military service, partly as a consequence of the more frequent street battles with\n\u201denemies\u201c like workers and students. As soon as our available forces permit, we must\nwithout fail devote the most serious attention to propaganda and agitation among soldiers\nand officers, and to the creation of \u201dmilitary organisations\u201c affiliated to our Party.\nI recall that once a comrade told me of a factory inspector who wanted to help the\nSocial-Democrats, and actually did, but complained bitterly that he did not know whether\nhis \u201dinformation\u201c reached the proper revolutionary centre, how much his help was really\nrequired, and what possibilities there were for utilising his small and petty services. Every\npractical worker can, of course, cite many similar instances in which our primitiveness\ndeprived us of allies. These services, each \u201dsmall\u201c in itself, but invaluable when taken\nin the mass, could and would be rendered to us by office employees and officials, not\nonly in factories, but in the postal service, on the railways, in the Customs, among the\nnobility, among the clergy, and in every other walk of life, including even the police and\nthe Court! Had we a real party, a real militant organisation of revolutionaries, we would\nnot make undue demands on every one of these \u201daides\u201c, we would not hasten always and\ninvariably to bring them right into the very heart of our \u201dillegality\u201c, but, on the contrary,\nwe would husband them most carefully and would even train people especially for such\nfunctions, bearing in mind that many students could be of much greater service to the Party\nas \u201daides\u201c holding some official post than as \u201dshort-term\u201c revolutionaries. But, I repeat,\nonly an organisation that is firmly established and has no lack of active forces would have\nthe right to apply such tactics.\nSvoboda, No. , p. , in the article \u201dOrganisation\u201c: \u201dThe heavy tread of the army of\nworkers will reinforce all the demands that will be advanced in behalf of Russian Labour\u201c\n NOTES\n\u2013 Labour with a capital L, of course. And the author exclaims: \u201dI am not in the least hostile\ntowards the intelligentsia, but [but \u2013 the word that Shchedrin translated as meaning: The\nears never grow higher than the forehead!] \u2013 but I always get frightfully annoyed when a\nman comes to me uttering beautiful and charming words and demands that they be accepted\nfor their [his?] beauty and other virtues\u201c (p. ). Yes, I always get \u201dfrightfully annoyed\u201c,\ntoo.\nCf. The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats, p. , polemics against P. L. Lavrov.\n(See Collected Works, Vol. , pp. -. \u2013Ed.)\nThe Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats, p. . (See Collected Works, Vol. , p.\n.. \u2013Ed.) Apropos, we shall give another illustration of the fact that Rabocheye Dyelo\neither does not understand what it is talking about or changes its views \u201dwith the wind\u201c.\nIn No.  of Rabocheye Dyelo, we find the following passage in italics: \u201dThe substance\nset forth in the pamphlet accords entirely with the editorial programme of \u2019Rabocheye\nDyelo\u2019 \u201c (p. ). Really? Does the view that the overthrow of the autocracy must not\nbe set as the first task of the mass movement accord with the views expressed in The Tasks\nof the Russian Social-Democrats? Dothe theory of \u201dthe economic struggle against the\nemployers and the government\u201c and the stages theory accord with the views expressed in\nthat pamphlet? We leave it to the reader to judge whether a periodical that understands the\nmeaning of \u201daccordance in opinion\u201c in this peculiar manner can have firm principles.\nSee Report to the Paris Congress, p. . From that time () to the spring of ,\nthirty issues of various papers were published in various places.... On an average, over one\nissue per month was published\u201d.\nThis difficulty is more apparent than real. In fact, there is not a single local study circle\nthat lacks the opportunity of taking up some function or other in connection with all-Russia\nwork. \u201cDon\u2019t say, I can\u2019t; say, I won\u2019t.\u201d\nThat is why even examples of exceptionally good local newspapers fully confirm our\npoint of view. For example, Yuzhny Rabochy is an excellent newspaper, entirely free of\ninstability of principle. But it has been unable to provide what it desired for the local movement, owing to the infrequency of its publication and to extensive police raids. Principled\npresentation of the fundamental questions of the movement and wide political agitation,\nwhich our Party most urgently requires at the present time, has proved too big a job for\nthe local newspaper. The material of particular value it has published, like the articles on\nthe mine owners\u2019 convention and on unemployment, was not strictly local material, it was\nrequired for the whole of Russia, not for the South alone. No such articles have appeared\nin any of our Social-Democratic newspapers.\n NOTES\nLegal material is particularly important in this connection, and we are particularly\nbehind in our ability to gather and utilise it systematically. It would not be an exaggeration\nto say that one could somehow compile a trade union pamphlet on the basis solely of legal\nmaterial, but it could not be done on the basis of illegal material alone. In gathering illegal\nmaterial from Workers oil questions like those dealt with in the publications of Rabochaya\nMysl, we waste a great deal of the efforts of revolutionaries (whose place in this work\ncould very easily be taken by legal workers), and yet we never obtain good material. The\nreason is that a worker who very often knows only a single department of a large factory\nand almost always the economic results, but not the general conditions and standards of his\nwork, cannot acquire the knowledge which is possessed by the office staff of a factory, by\ninspectors, doctors, etc., and which is scattered in petty newspaper reports and in special\nindustrial, medical, Zemstvo, and other publications.\nI vividly recall my \u201cfirst experiment\u201d, which I would never like to repeat. I spent\nmany weeks \u201cexamining\u201d a worker, who would often visit me, regarding every aspect of\nthe conditions prevailing in the enormous factory at which he was employed. True, after\ngreat effort, I managed to obtain material for a description (of the one single factory!), but\nat the end of the interview the worker would wipe the sweat from his brow, and say to me\nsmilingly: \u2019I find it easier to work overtime than to answer your questions.\u201c\nThe more energetically we carry on our revolutionary struggle, the more the government will be compelled to legalise part of the \u201dtrade union\u201c work, thereby relieving us of\npart of our burden.\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. - \u2013Ed.\nIskra, No. .The reply of the Central Committee of the General Jewish Union of Russia\nand Poland to our article on the national question.\nWe deliberately refrain from relating these facts in the sequence of their occurrence.\nSee Collected Works, Vol. , pp. - and -\u2013Ed.\nThe author requests me to state that, like his previous pamphlets, this one was sent to\nthe Union Abroad on the assumption that its publications were edited by the Emancipation\nof Labour group (owing to certain circumstances, he could not then \u2013 February  \u2013\nknow of the change in editorship).

Send in a complaint at once. Here you\nhave a ready-made topic for two leading articles for No.  of Rabocheye Dyelo!\nMartynov, in quoting the first sentence of this passage in Rabocheye Dyelo (No. , p.\n), omitted the second, as if desiring to emphasise either his unwillingness to discuss the\nessentials of the question or his inability to understand them.\nA reservation: that is, if a given study circle sympathises with the policy of the newspaper and considers it useful to become a collaborator, meaning by that, not only for literary\ncollaboration, but for revolutionary collaboration generally. Note for Rabocheye Dyelo:\nAmong revolutionaries who attach value to the cause and not to playing at democracy, who\ndo not separate \u201csympathy\u201d from the most active and lively participation, this reservation\nis taken for granted.\nThe Eve of the Revolution, p. .\nIn his Review of Questions of Theory, Nadezhdin, by the way, made almost no contribution whatever to the discussion of questions of theory, apart, perhaps, from the following\npassage, a most peculiar one from the \u201ceve-of-the-revolution point of view\u201d: \u201cBernsteinism, on the whole, is losing its acuteness for us at the present moment, as is the question\nwhether Mr. Adamovich will prove that Mr. Struve has already earned a lacing, or, on the\ncontrary, whether Mr. Struve will refute Mr. Adamovich and will refuse to resign \u2013 it really\nmakes no difference, because the hour of revolution has struck (p. ). One can hardly\nimagine a more glaring illustration of Nadezhdin\u2019s infinite disregard for theory. We have\nproclaimed \u201dthe eve of the revolution\u201c, therefore \u201dit really makes no difference\u201c whether\nor not the orthodox will succeed in finally driving the Critics from their positions! Our\nwiseacre fails to see that it is precisely during the revolution that we shall stand in need of\nthe results of our theoretical battles with the Critics in order to be able resolutely to combat\ntheir practical positions!\nIskra, No. , \u201dWhere To Begin\u201c. \u201dRevolutionary culturists, who do not accept the eveof-the-revolution point of view, are not in the least perturbed by the prospect of working\nfor a long period of time,\u201c writes Nadezhdin (p. ). This brings us to observe: Unless\nwe are able to devise political tactics and an organisational plan for work over a very long\nperiod, while ensuring, in the very process of this work, our Party\u2019s readiness to be at its\npost and fulfil its duty in every contingency whenever the march of events is accelerated \u2013\nunless we succeed in doing this, we shall prove to he but miserable political adventurers.\nOnly Nadezhdin, who began but yesterday to describe himself as a Social-Democrat, can\nforget that the aim of Social-Democracy is to transform radically the conditions of life of\n NOTES\nthe whole of mankind and that for this reason it is not permissible for a Social-Democrat to\nbe \u201dperturbed\u201c by the question of the duration of the work.\nAlas, alas! Again I have let slip that awful word \u201dagents\u201c, which jars so much on\nthe democratic cars of the Martynovs! I wonder why this word did not offend the heroes\nof the seventies and yet off ends the amateurs of the nineties? I like the word, because\nit clearly and trenchantly indicates the common cause to which all the agents bend their\nthoughts and actions, and if I had to replace this word by another, the only word I might\nselect would be the word \u201dcollaborator\u201c, if it did not suggest a certain bookishness and\nvagueness. The thing we need is a military organisation of agents. However, the numerous\nMartynovs (particularly abroad), whose favourite pastime is \u201dmutual grants of generalships\nto one another\u201c, may instead of saying \u201dpassport agent\u201c prefer to say, \u201dChief of the Special\nDepartment for Supplying Revolutionaries with Passports\u201c. etc. A. The Preparations For The Congress\nThere is a saying that everyone is entitled to curse his judges for twenty-four hours. Our Party Congress, like any congress of any party, was also the judge of certain persons, who laid claim to the position of leaders but who met with discomfiture. Today these representatives of the \u201cminority\u201d are, with a na\u00efvet\u00e9 verging on the pathetic, \u201ccursing their judges\u201d and doing their best to discredit the Congress, to belittle its importance and authority. This striving has been expressed most vividly, perhaps, in an article in Iskra, No. , by \u201cPractical Worker\u201d,[] who feels out raged at the idea of the Congress being a sovereign \u201cdivinity\u201d. This is so characteristic a trait of the new Iskra that it cannot be passed over in silence. The editors, the majority of whom were rejected by the Congress, continue, on the one hand, to call themselves a \u201cParty\u201d editorial board, while, on the other, they accept with open arms people who declare that the Congress was not divine. Charming, is it not? To be sure, gentlemen, the Congress was not divine; but what must we think of people who begin to \u201cblackguard\u201d the Congress after they have met with defeat at it?\n\nFor indeed, let us recall the main facts in the history of the preparations for the Congress.\n\nIskra declared at the very outset, in its announcement of publication in , that before we could unite, lines of demarcation must be drawn. Iskra endeavoured to make the Conference of [] a private meeting and not a Party Congress.[] Iskra acted with extreme caution in the summer and autumn of  when it re-established the Organising Committee elected at that conference. At last the work of demarcation was finished\u2014as we all acknowledged. The Organising Committee was constituted at the very end of . Iskra welcomed its firm establishment, and in an editorial article in its nd issue declared that the convocation of a Party Congress was a most urgent and pressing necessity.[] Thus, the last thing we can be accused of is having been hasty in convening the Second Congress. We were, in fact, guided by the maxim: measure your cloth seven times before you cut it; and we had every moral right to expect that after the cloth had been cut our comrades would not start complaining and measuring it all over again.\n\nThe Organising Committee drew up very precise (formalistic and bureaucratic, those would say who are now using these words to cover up their political spinelessness) Regulations for the Second Congress, got them passed by all the committees, and finally endorsed them, stipulating among other things, in Point , that \u201call decisions of the Congress and all the elections it carries out are decisions of the Party and binding on all Party organisations. They cannot be challenged by anyone on any pretext whatever and can be rescinded or amended only by the next Party Congress\u201d.[] How innocent in themselves, are they not, are these words, accepted at the time without a murmur, as something axiomatic; yet how strange they sound today\u2014like a verdict against the \u201cminority\u201d! Why was this point included? Merely as a formality? Of course not. This provision seemed necessary, and was indeed necessary, because the Party consisted of a number of isolated and independent groups, which might refuse to recognise the Congress. This provision in fact expressed the free will of all the revolutionaries (which is now being talked about so much, and so irrelevantly, the term \u201cfree\u201d being euphemistically applied to what really deserves the epithet \u201ccapricious\u201d). It was equivalent to a word of honour mutually pledged by all the Russian Social-Democrats. It was intended to guarantee that all the tremendous effort, danger and expense entailed by the Congress should not be in vain, that the Congress should not be turned into a farce. It in advance qualified any refusal to recognise the decisions and elections at the Congress as a breach of faith.\n\nWho is it, then, that the new Iskra is scoffing at when it makes the new discovery that the Congress was not divine and its decisions are not sacrosanct? Does that discovery imply \u201cnew views on organisation\u201d, or only new attempts to cover up old tracks?\nB. Significance of the Various Groupings at the Congress\nThus, the Congress was called after the most careful preparation and on the basis of the fullest representation. The general recognition that its composition was correct and its decisions absolutely binding found expression also in the statement of the chairman (Minutes, p. ) after the Congress had been constituted.\n\nWhat was the principal task of the Congress? To create a real party on the basis of the principles and organisational ideas that had been advanced and elaborated by Iskra. That this was the direction in which the Congress had to work was predetermined by the three years\u2019 activities of Iskra and by the recognition of the latter by the majority of the committees. Iskra\u2019s programme and trend were to become the programme and trend of the Party; Iskra\u2019s organisational plans were to be embodied in the Rules of Organisation of the Party. But it goes without saying that this could not be achieved without a struggle: since the Congress was so highly representative, the participants included organisations which had vigorously fought Iskra (the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo ) and organisations which, while verbally recognising Iskra as the leading organ, actually pursued plans of their own and were unstable in matters of principle (the Yuzhny Rabochy group and delegates from some of the committees who were closely associated with it). Under these circumstances, the Congress could not but become an arena of struggle for the victory of the \"Iskra \" trend. That it did become such an arena will at once be apparent to all who peruse its minutes with any degree of attention. Our task now is to trace in detail the principal groupings revealed at the Congress on various issues and to reconstruct, on the basis of the precise data of the minutes, the political complexion of each of the main groups. What precisely were these groups, trends and shades which, at the Congress, were to unite under the guidance of Iskra into a single party?\u2014that is what we must show by analysing the debates and the voting. The elucidation of this is of cardinal importance both for a study of what our Social Democrats really are and for an understanding of the causes of the divergence among them. That is why, in my speech at the League Congress and in my letter to the editors of the new Iskra, I gave prime place to an analysis of the various groupings. My opponents of the \u201cminority\u201d (headed by Martov) utterly failed to grasp the substance of the question. At the League Congress they confined themselves to corrections of detail, trying to \u201cvindicate\u201d themselves from the charge of having swung towards opportunism, but not even attempting to counter my picture of the groupings at the Congress by drawing any different one. Now Martov tries in Iskra (No. ) to represent every attempt clearly to delimit the various political groups at the Congress as mere \u201ccircle politics\u201d. Strong language, Comrade Martov! But the strong language of the new Iskra has this peculiar quality: one has only to reproduce all the stages of our divergence, from the Congress onwards, for all this strong language to turn completely and primarily against the present editorial board. Take a look at yourselves, you so-called Party editors who talk about circle politics!\n\nMartov now finds the facts of our struggle at the Congress so unpleasant that he tries to slur over them altogether. \u201cAn Iskra-ist,\u201d he says, \"is one who, at the Party Congress and prior to it, expressed his complete solidarity with Iskra, advocated its programme and its views on organisation and supported its organisational policy. There were over forty such Iskra-ists at the Congress\u2014that was the number of votes cast for Iskra\u2019s programme and for the resolution adopting Iskra as the Central Organ of the Party.\" Open the Congress Minutes, and you will find that the programme was adopted by the votes of all (p. ) except Akimov, who abstained. Thus, Comrade Martov wants to assure us that the Bundists, and Brouckere, and Martynov demonstrated their \u201ccomplete solidarity\u201d with Iskra and advocated its views on organisation! This is ridiculous. The fact that after the Congress all who took part became equal members of the Party (and not even all, for the Bundists had withdrawn) is here jumbled with the question of the grouping that evoked the struggle at the Congress. Instead of a study of the elements that went to make up the \u201cmajority\u201d and the \u201cminority\u201d after the Congress, we get the official phrase, \u201crecognised the programme\u201d!\n\nTake the voting on the adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ. You will see that it was Martynov\u2014whom Comrade Martov, with a courage worthy of a better cause, now credits with having advocated Iskra\u2019s organisational views and organisational policy\u2014who insisted on separating the two parts of the resolution: the bare adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ, and the recognition of its services. When the first part of the resolution (recognising the services of Iskra, expressing solidarity with it) was put to the vote, only thirty five votes were cast in favour; there were two votes against (Akimov and Brouck\u00e8re) and eleven abstentions (Martynov, the five Bundists and the five votes of the editorial board: the two votes each of Martov and myself and Plekhanov\u2019s one). Consequently, the anti-Iskra group (five Bundists and three Rabocheye Dyelo-ists) is quite apparent in this instance also, one most advantageous to Martov\u2019s present views and chosen by himself. Take the voting on the second part of the resolution\u2014adopting Iskra as the Central Organ without any statement of motives or expression of solidarity (Minutes, p. ): forty-four votes in favour, which the Martov of today classes as Iskra-ist. The total number of votes to be cast was fifty-one; subtracting the five votes of the editors, who abstained, we get forty-six; two voted against (Akimov and Brouck\u00e8re); consequently, the remaining forty-four include all five Bundists. And so, the Bundists at the Congress \u201cexpressed complete solidarity with Iskra\u201d\u2014this is how official history is written by the official Iskra! Running ahead somewhat, we will explain to the reader the real reasons for this official truth: the present editorial board of Iskra could and would have been a real Party editorial board (and not a quasi-Party one, as it is today) if the Bundists and the \u201cRabocheye Dyelo\u201d-ists had not withdrawn from the Congress; that is why these trusty guardians of the present, so-called Party editorial board had to be proclaimed Iskra-ists. But I shall speak of this in greater detail later.\n\nThe next question is: if the Congress was a struggle between the Iskra-ist and the anti-Iskra-ist elements, were there no intermediate, unstable elements who vacillated between the two? Anyone at all familiar with our Party and with the picture generally presented by congresses of every kind will be inclined a priori to answer the question in the affirmative. Comrade Martov is now very reluctant to recall these unstable elements, so he represents the Yuzhny Rabochy group and the delegates who gravitated towards it as typical Iskra-ists, and our differences with them as paltry and unimportant. Fortunately, we now have before us the complete text of the minutes and are able to answer the question\u2014a question of fact, of course\u2014on the basis of documentary evidence. What we said above about the general grouping at the Congress does not, of course, claim to answer the question, but only to present it correctly.\n\nWithout an analysis of the political groupings, without having a picture of the Congress as a struggle between definite shades, the divergence between us cannot be understood at all. Martov\u2019s attempt to gloss over the different shades by ranking even the Bundists with the Iskra-ists is simply an evasion of the question. Even a priori, on the basis of the history of the Russian Social-Democratic movement before the Congress, three main groups are to be noted (for subsequent verification and detailed study): the Iskra-ists, the anti-Iskra-ists, and the unstable, vacillating, wavering elements.\nC. Beginning of the Congress. The Organising Committee Incident\nThe most convenient way to analyse the debates and the voting is to take them in the order of the Congress sittings, so as successively to note the political shades as they became more and more apparent. Only when absolutely necessary will departures from the chronological order be made for the purpose of considering together closely allied questions or similar groupings. For the sake of impartiality, we shall endeavour to mention all the more important votes, omitting, of course, the innumerable votes on minor issues, which took up an inordinate amount of time at our Congress (owing partly to our inexperience and inefficiency in dividing the material between the commissions and the plenary sittings, and partly to quibbling which bordered on obstruction).\n\nThe first question to evoke a debate which began to reveal differences of shades was whether first place should be given (on the Congress \u201corder of business\u201d) to the item: \u201cPosition of the Bund in the Party\u201d (Minutes, pp. -). From the standpoint of the Iskra-ists, which was advocated by Plekhanov, Martov, Trotsky, and myself, there could be no doubt on this score. The Bund\u2019s withdrawal from the Party strikingly bore out our view: if the Bund refused to go our way and accept the principles of organisation which the majority of the Party shared with Iskra, it was useless and senseless to \u201cmake believe\u201d that we were going the same way and only drag out the Congress (as the Bundists did drag it out). The matter had already been fully clarified in our literature, and it was apparent to any at all thoughtful Party member that all that remained was to put the question frankly, and bluntly and honestly make the choice: autonomy (in which case we go the same way), or federation (in which case our ways part).\n\nEvasive in their entire policy, the Bundists wanted to be evasive here too and postpone the matter. They were joined by Comrade Akimov, who, evidently on behalf of all the followers of Rabocheye Dyelo, at once brought up the differences with Iskra over questions of organisation (Minutes, p. ). The Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo were supported by Comrade Makhov (representing the two votes of the Nikolayev Committee\u2014which shortly before had expressed its solidarity with Iskra!). To Comrade Makhov the matter was altogether unclear, and another \u201csore spot\u201d, he considered, was \u201cthe question of a democratic system or, on the contrary [mark this!], centralism\u201d\u2014exactly like the majority of our present \u201cParty\u201d editorial board, who at the Congress had not yet noticed this \u201csore spot\u201d!\n\nThus the Iskra-ists were opposed by the Bund, Rabocheye Dyelo and Comrade Makhov, who together controlled the ten votes which were cast against us (p. ). Thirty votes were cast in favour\u2014this is the figure, as we shall see later, around which the votes of the Iskra-ists often fluctuated. Eleven abstained, apparently not taking the side of either of the contending \u201cparties\u201d. It is interesting to note that when we took the vote on Paragraph  of the Rules of the Bund (it was the rejection of this Paragraph  that caused the Bund to withdraw from the Party), the votes in favour of it and the abstentions also amounted to ten (Minutes, p. ), the abstainers being the three Rabocheye Dyelo-ists (Brouck\u00e8re, Martynov, and Akimov) and Comrade Makhov. Clearly, the grouping in the vote on the place of the Bund item on the agenda was not fortuitous. Clearly, all these comrades differed with Iskra not only on the technical question of the order of discussion, but in essence as well. In the case of Rabocheye Dyelo, this difference in essence is clear to everyone, while Comrade Makhov gave an inimitable description of his attitude in the speech he made on the withdrawal of the Bund (Minutes, pp. -). It is worth while dwelling on this speech. Comrade Makhov said that after the resolution rejecting federation, \u201cthe position of the Bund in the R.S.D.L.P. ceased to be for me a question of principle and became a question of practical politics in relation to an historically evolved national organisation\u201d. \u201cHere,\u201d the speaker continued, \u201cI could not but take into account all the consequences that might follow from our vote, and would therefore have voted for Paragraph  in its entirety.\u201d Comrade Makhov has admirably imbibed the spirit of \u201cpractical politics\u201d: in principle he had already rejected federation, and therefore in practice he would have voted for including in the Rules a point that signified federation! And this \u201cpractical\u201d comrade explained his profound position of principle in the following words: \u201cBut [the famous Shchedrin \u201cbut\u201d!] since my voting one way or the other would only have significance in principle [!!] and could not be of any practical importance, in view of the almost unanimous vote of all the other Congress delegates, I preferred to abstain in order to bring out in principle [God preserve us from such principles!] the difference between my position on this question and the position of the Bund delegates, who voted in favour. Conversely, I would have voted in favour if the Bund delegates had abstained, as they had at first insisted.\u201d Can you make head or tail of it? A man of principle abstains from loudly saying \u201cYes\u201d because practically it is useless when everybody else says \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nAfter the vote on the place of the Bund item on the agenda, the question of the Borba group cropped up at the Congress; it too led to an extremely interesting grouping and was closely bound up with the \u201csorest\u201d point at the Congress, namely, the personal composition of the central bodies. The committee appointed to determine the composition of the Congress pronounced against inviting the Borba group, in accordance with a twice-adopted decision of the Organising Committee (see Minutes, pp.  and ) and the report of the latter\u2019s representatives on this committee (p. ).\n\nThereupon Comrade Egorov, a member of the Organising Committee, declared that \u201cthe question of Borba\u201d (mark, of Borba, not of some particular member of it) was \u201cnew to him\u201d, and demanded an adjournment. How a question on which the Organising Committee had twice taken a decision could be new to a member of the Organising Committee remains a mystery. During the adjournment the Organising Committee held a meeting (Minutes, p. ), attended by such of its members as happened to be at the Congress (several members of theOrganising Committee, old members of the Iskra organisation, were not at the Congress).[] Then began a debate about Borba. The Rabocheye Dyelo-ists spoke in favour (Martynov, Akimov, and Brouck\u00e8re\u2014pp. -), the Iskra-ists (Pavlovich, Sorokin, Lange,[] Trotsky, Martov, and others)\u2014against. Again the Congress split up into the grouping with which we are already familiar. The struggle over Borba was a stubborn one, and Comrade Martov made a very circumstantial (p. ) and \u201cmilitant\u201d speech, in which he rightly referred to \u201cinequality of representation\u201d of the groups in Russia and abroad, and said that it would hardly be \u201cwell\u201d to allow a foreign group any \u201cprivilege\u201d (golden words, particularly edifying today, in the light of the events since the Congress!), and that we should not encourage \"the organisational chaos in the Party that was characterised by a disunity not justified by any considerations of principle\" (one right in the eye for . . . the \u201cminority\u201d at our Party Congress!). Except for the followers of Rabocheye Dyelo, nobody came out openly and with reasoned motives in favour of Borba until the list of speakers was closed (p. ). It should be said in fairness to Comrade Akimov and his friends that they at least did not wriggle and hide, but frankly advocated their line, frankly said what they wanted.\n\nAfter the list of speakers had been closed, when it was already out of order to speak on the issue itself, Comrade Egorov \u201cinsistently demanded that a decision just adopted by the Organising Committee be heard\u201d. It is not surprising that the delegates were outraged at this manoeuvre, and Comrade Plekhanov, the chairman, expressed his \u201castonishment that Comrade Egorov should insist upon his demand\u201d. One thing or the other, one would think: either take an open and definite stand before the whole Congress on the question at issue, or say nothing at all. But to allow the list of speakers to be closed and then, under the guise of a \u201creply to the debate\u201d, confront the Congress with a new decision of the Organising Committee on the very subject that had been under discussion, was like a stab in the back!\n\nWhen the sitting was resumed after dinner, the Bureau still in perplexity, decided to waive \u201cformalities\u201d and resort to the last method, adopted at congresses only in extreme cases, viz., \u201ccomradely explanation\u201d. The spokesman of the Organising Committee, Popov, announced the committee\u2019s decision, which had been adopted by all its members against one, Pavlovich (p. ), and which recommended the Congress to invite Ryazanov.\n\nPavlovich declared that he had challenged and continued to challenge the lawfulness of the Organising Committee meeting, and that the Committee\u2019s new decision \u201ccontradicts its earlier decision\u201d. This statement caused an uproar. Comrade Egorov, also an Organising Committee member and a member of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, evaded answering on the actual point in question and tried to make the central issue one of discipline. He claimed that Comrade Pavlovich had violated Party discipline (!), for, having heard his protest, the Organising Committee had decided \u201cnot to lay Pavlovich\u2019s dissenting opinion before the Congress\u201d. The debate shifted to the question of Party discipline, and Plekhanov, amid the loud applause of the delegates, explained for the edification of Comrade Egorov that \u201cwe have no such thing as binding instructions\u201d (p. ; cf. p. , Regulations for the Congress, Point : \u201cThe powers of delegates must not be restricted by binding instructions. In the exercise of their powers, delegates are absolutely free and independent\u201d). \u201cThe Congress is the supreme Party authority\u201d, and, consequently, he violates Party discipline and the Congress Regulations who in any way restricts any delegate in taking directly to the Congress any question of Party life whatsoever. The issue thus came down to this: circles or a party? Were the rights of delegates to be restricted at the Congress in the name of the imaginary rights or rules of the various bodies and circles, or were all lower bodies and old groups to be completely, and not nominally but actually, disbanded in face of the Congress, pending the creation of genuinely Party official institutions? The reader will already see from this how profoundly important from the standpoint of principle was this dispute at the very outset (the third sitting) of this Congress whose purpose was the actual restoration of the Party. Focused in this dispute, as it were, was the conflict between the old circles and small groups (such as Yuzhny Rabochy) and the renascent Party. And the anti-Iskra groups at once revealed themselves: the Bundist Abramson, Comrade Martynov, that ardent ally of the present Iskra editorial board, and our friend Cornrade Makhov all sided with Egorov and the Yuzhny Rabochy group against Pavlovich. Comrade Martynov, who now vies with Martov and Axelrod in sporting \u201cdemocracy\u201d in organisation, even cited the example of . . . the army, where an appeal to a superior authority can only be made through a lower one!! The true meaning of this \u201ccompact\u201d anti-Iskra opposition was quite clear to everyone who was present at the Congress or who had carefully followed the internal history of our Party prior to the Congress. It was the purpose of the opposition (perhaps not always realised by all of its representatives, and sometimes pursued by force of inertia) to guard the independence, individualism and parochial interests of the small, petty groups from being swallowed up in the broad Party that was being built on the Iskra principles.\n\nIt was precisely from this angle that the question was approached by Comrade Martov, who had not yet joined forces with Martynov. Comrade Martov vigorously took the field, and rightly so, against those whose \u201cnotion of Party discipline does not go beyond a revolutionary\u2019s duty to the particular group of a lower order to which he belongs\u201d. \u201cNo compulsory [Martov\u2019s italics] grouping can be tolerated within a united Party,\u201d he explained to the champions of the circle mentality, not foreseeing what a flail these words would be for his own political conduct at the end of the Congress and after.... A compulsory grouping cannot be tolerated in the case of the Organising Committee, but can quite well be tolerated in the case of the editorial board. Martov condemns a compulsory grouping when he looks at it from the centre, but Martov defends it the moment he finds himself dissatisfied with the composition of the centre....\n\nIt is interesting to note that in his speech Comrade Martov laid particular stress not only on Comrade Egorov\u2019s \u201cprofound error\u201d, but also on the political instability the Organising Committee had displayed. \u201cA recommendation has been submitted on behalf of the Organising Committee,\u201d he exclaimed in just indignation, \u201cwhich runs counter to the committee report [based, we will add, on the report of members of the Organising Committee\u2014p. , Koltsov\u2019s remarks] and to the Organising Committee\u2019s own earlier recommendations.\u201d (My italics.) As we see, at that time, before his \u201cswing-over\u201d, Martov clearly realised that substituting Ryazanov for Borba in no way removed the utter contradictoriness and inconsistency of the Organising Committee\u2019s actions (Party members may learn from the League Congress Minutes, p. , how Martov conceived the matter after his swing-over). Martov did not confine himself then to analysing the issue of discipline; he bluntly asked the Organising Committee: \u201cWhat new circumstance has arisen to necessitate the change?\u201d (My italics.) And, indeed, when the Organ ising Committee made its recommendation, it did not even have the courage to defend its opinion openly, as Akimov and the others did. Martov denies this (League Minutes p. ), but whoever reads the minutes of the Congress will see that he is mistaken. Popov, in submitting the Organising Committee recommendation, did not say a word about the motives (Party Congress Minutes, p. ). Egorov shifted the issue to one of discipline, and all he said on the question itself was: \"The Organising Committee may have had new reasons [but whether it did, and what those new reasons were, is unknown]; it could have forgotten to nominate somebody, and so on. [This \u201cand so on\u201d was the speaker\u2019s sole refuge, for the Organising Committee could not have forgotten about Borba, which it had discussed twice before the Congress and once in the committee.] The Organising Committee did not adopt this decision because it has changed its attitude towards the Borba group, but because it wants to remove unnecessary rocks in the path of the Party\u2019s future central organisation at the very outset of its activities.\" This is not a reason, but an evasion of a reason. Every sincere Social-Democrat (and we do not entertain the least doubt about the sincerity of any Congress delegate) is concerned to remove what he considers to be sunken rocks, and to remove them by those methods which he considers advisable. Giving reasons means explicitly stating and explaining one\u2019s view of things, and not making shift with truisms. And they could not give a reason without \u201cchanging their attitude towards Borba\u201d, because in its earlier and contrary decisions the Organising Committee had also been concerned to remove sunken rocks, but it had then regarded the very opposite as \u201crocks\u201d. And Comrade Martov very severely and very rightly attacked this argument, saying that it was \u201cpetty\u201d and inspired by a wish to \u201cburke the issue\u201d, and advising the Organising Committee \u201cnot to be afraid of what people will say\u201d. These words characterise perfectly the essential nature of the political shade which played so large a part at the Congress and which is distinguished precisely by its want of independence, its pettiness, its lack of a line of its own, its fear of what people will say, its constant vacillation between the two definite sides, its fear of plainly stating its credo\u2014in a word, by all the features of a \u201cMarsh\u201d.[][] There are people in our Party today who are horrified when they hear this word, and raise an outcry about uncomradely methods of controversy. A strange perversion of sensibility due to . . . a misapplied sense of official form! There is scarcely a political party acquainted with internal struggles that has managed to do without this term, by which the unstable elements who vacillate between the contending sides have always been designated. Even the Germans, who know how to keep their internal struggles within very definite bounds indeed, are not offended by the word versumpft (sunk in the marsh\u2014Ed.) are not horrified, and do not display ridiculous official prudery. \u2014Lenin\nA consequence of this political spinelessness of the unstable group was, incidentally, that no one except the Bundist Yudin (p. ) did put before the Congress a resolution to invite one of the members of the Borba group. Yudin\u2019s resolution received five votes\u2014all Bundists, apparently: the vacillating elements had changed sides again! How large was the vote of the middle group is shown approximately by the voting on the resolutions of Koltsov and Yudin on this question: the Iskra-ist received thirty-two votes (p. ), the Bundist received sixteen, that is, in addition to the eight anti-Iskra-ist votes, the two votes of Comrade Makhov (cf. p. ), the four votes of the members of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, and two others. We shall show in a moment that this alignment can by no means be regarded as accidental; but first let us briefly note Martov\u2019s present opinion of this Organising Committee incident. Martov maintained at the League that \u201cPavlovich and others fanned passions\u201d. One has only to consult the Congress Minutes to see that the longest, most heated and sharpest speeches against Borba and the Organising Committee were delivered by Martov himself. By trying to lay the \u201cblame\u201d on Pavlovich he only demonstrates his own instability: it was Pavlovich he helped to elect prior to the Congress as the seventh member of the editorial board; at the Congress he fully associated himself with Pavlovich (p. ) against Egorov; but afterwards, having suffered defeat at the hands of Pavlovich, he began to accuse him of \u201cfanning passions\u201d. This is ludicrous.\n\nMartov waxes ironical in Iskra (No. ) over the importance that was attached to whether X or Y should be invited. But again the irony turns against Martov, for it was this Organising Committee incident that started the dispute over such an \u201cimportant\u201d question as inviting X or Y on to the Central Committee or the Central Organ. It is unseemly to measure with two different yardsticks, depending on whether the matter concerns your own \u201cgroup of a lower order\u201d (relative to the Party) or someone else\u2019s. This is precisely a philistine and circle, not a Party attitude. A simple comparison of Martov\u2019s speech at the League (p. ) with his speech at the Congress (p. ) sufficiently demonstrates this. \u201cI can not understand,\u201d Martov said, inter alia, at the League, \u201chow people can insist on calling themselves Iskra-ists and at the same time be ashamed of being Iskra-ists.\u201d A strange failure to understand the difference between \u201ccalling oneself\u201d and \u201cbeing\u201d\u2014between word and deed. Martov himself, at the Congress, called himself an opponent of compulsory groupings, yet, after the Congress, came to be a supporter of them....\nD. Dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy Group\nThe alignment of the delegates over the Organising Committee question may perhaps seem accidental. But such an opinion would be wrong, and in order to dispel it we shall depart from the chronological order and at once examine an incident which occurred at the end of the Congress, but which was very closely connected with the one just discussed. This incident was the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group. The organisational trend of Iskra\u2014complete amalgamation of the Party forces and removal of the chaos dividing them\u2014came into conflict here with the interests of one of the groups, which had done useful work when there was no real party, but which had become superfluous now that the work was being centralised. From the standpoint of circle interests, the Yuzhny Rabochy group was entitled no less than the old Iskra editorial board to lay claim to \u201ccontinuity\u201d and inviolability. But in the interests of the Party, it was its duty to submit to the transfer of its forces to \u201cthe appropriate Party organisations\u201d (p. , end of resolution adopted by the Congress). From the standpoint of circle interests and \u201cphilistinism\u201d, the dissolution of a useful group, which no more desired it than did the old Iskra editorial board, could not but seem a \u201cticklish matter\u201d (the expression used by Comrade Rusov and Comrade Deutsch). But from the standpoint of the interests of the Party, its dissolution, its \u201cassimilation\u201d in the Party (Gusev\u2019s expression), was essential. The Yuzhny Rabochy group bluntly declared that it \u201cdid not deem it necessary\u201d to proclaim itself dissolved and demanded that \u201cthe Congress definitely pronounce its opinion\u201d, and pronounce it \u201cimmediately: yes or no\u201d. The Yuzhny Rabochy group openly invoked the same \u201ccontinuity\u201d as the old Iskra editorial board began to invoke . . . after it was dissolved! \u201cAlthough we are all individually members of one Party,\u201d Comrade Egorov said, \u201cit nevertheless consists of a number of organisations, with which we have to reckon as historical entities.... If such an organisation is not detrimental to the Party, there is no need to dissolve it.\u201d\n\nThus an important question of principle was quite definitely raised, and all the Iskra-ists\u2014inasmuch as their own circle interests had not yet come to the forefront\u2014took a decisive stand against the unstable elements (the Bundists and two of the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists had already withdrawn from the Congress; they would undoubtedly have been heart and soul in favour of \u201creckoning with historical entities\u201d). The result of the vote was thirty-one for, five against and five abstentions (the four votes of .the members of the Yuzhny Rabochy group and one other, that of Byelov, most likely, judging by his earlier pronouncements, p. ). A group of ten votes distinctly opposed to Iskra\u2019s consistent organisational plan and defending the circle spirit as against the party spirit can be quite definitely discerned here. During the debate the Iskra-ists presented the question precisely from the standpoint of principle (see Lange\u2019s speech, p. ), opposing parochial amateurishness and disunity, refusing to pay heed to the \u201csympathies\u201d of individual organisations, and plainly declaring that \u201cif the comrades of Yuzhny Rabochy had adhered more strictly to principle earlier, a year or two ago, the unity of the Party and the triumph of the programme principles we have sanctioned here would have been achieved sooner\u201d. Orlov, Gusev, Lyadov, Muravyov, Rusov, Pavlovich, Glebov, and Gorin all spoke in this strain. And far from protesting against these definite and repeated references made at the Congress to the lack of principle in the policy and \u201cline\u201d of Yuzhny Rabochy, of Makhov and of others, far from making any reservation on this score, the Iskra-ists of the \u201cminority\u201d, in the person of Deutsch, vigorously associated themselves with these views, condemned \u201cchaos\u201d, and welcomed the \u201cblunt way the question was put\u201d (p. ) by that very same Comrade Rusov who, at this same sitting, had the audacity\u2014oh, horror!\u2014to \u201cbluntly put\u201d the question of the old editorial board too on a purely Party basis (p. ).\n\nOn the part of the Yuzhny Rabochy group the proposal to dissolve it evoked violent indignation, traces of which are to be found in the minutes (it should not be forgotten that the minutes offer only a pale reflection of the debates, for they do not give the full speeches, but only very condensed summaries and extracts). Comrade Egorov even described as a \u201clie\u201d the bare mention of the Rabochaya Mysl[] group alongside of Yuzhny Rabochy\u2014a characteristic sample of the attitude that prevailed at the Congress towards consistent Economism. Even much later, at the th sitting, Egorov spoke of the dissolution of Yuzhny Rabochy with the utmost irritation (p. ), requesting to have it recorded in the minutes that during the discussion on Yuzhny Rabochy the members of the group had not been asked either about publication funds or about control by the Central Organ and the Central Committee. Comrade Popov hinted, during the debate on Yuzhny Rabochy, at a compact majority having predetermined the fate of the group. \u201cNow,\u201d he said (p. ), \u201cafter the speeches of Comrades Gusev and Orlov, everything is clear.\u201d The meaning of these words is unmistakable: now, after the Iskra-ists had stated their opinion and moved a resolution, everything was clear, i.e., it was clear that Yuzhny Rabochy would be dissolved, against its own wishes. Here the Yuzhny Rabochy spokesman himself drew a distinction between the Iskra-ists (and, moreover, Iskra-ists like Gusev and Orlov) and his own supporters, as representing different \u201clines\u201d of organisational policy. And when the present-day Iskra represents the Yuzhny Rabochy group (and Makhov too, most likely?) as \u201ctypical Iskra-ists\u201d, it only demonstrates that the new editorial board has forgotten the most important (from this group\u2019s standpoint) events of the Congress and is anxious to cover up the evidence showing what elements went to form what is known as the \u201cminority\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, the question of a popular periodical was not discussed at the Congress. It was very actively discussed by all the Iskra-ists both before the Congress and during the Congress itself, outside the sittings, and they agreed that it would be highly irrational at this moment in the Party\u2019s life to launch such a publication or convert any of the existing ones for the purpose. The anti-Iskra-ists expressed the opposite opinion at the Congress; so did the Yuzhny Rabochy group in their report; and the fact that a motion to this effect, with ten signatures, was not tabled can only be attributed to chance, or to a disinclination to raise a \u201chopeless\u201d issue.\n\n\nE. The Equality of Languages Incident\nLet us return to the chronological order of the Congress sittings.\n\nWe have now convincingly seen that even before the Congress proceeded to discuss its actual business, there was clearly revealed not only a perfectly definite group of anti-Iskra-ists (eight votes), but also a group of intermediate and unstable elements prepared to support the eight anti-Iskra-ists and increase their votes to roughly sixteen or eighteen.\n\nThe question of the position of the Bund in the Party, which was discussed at the Congress in extreme, excessive detail, reduced itself to deciding about the principle, while its practical decision was postponed until the discussion on organisation. Since the points involved had been given quite a lot of space in the press prior to the Congress, the discussion at the Congress produced relatively little that was new. It must, however, be mentioned that the supporters of Rabocheye Dyelo (Martynov, Akimov, and Brouck\u00e8re), while agreeing with Martov\u2019s resolution, made the reservation that they found it inadequate and disagreed with the conclusions drawn from it (pp. , ,  and ).\n\nAfter discussing the position of the Bund, the Congress passed on to the programme. This discussion centred mainly around amendments of detail which present but slight interest. The opposition of the anti-Iskra-ists on matters of principle found expression only in Comrade Martynov\u2019s onslaught on the famous presentation of the question of spontaneity and consciousness. Martynov was, of course, backed by the Bundists and Rabocheye Dyelo-ists to a man. The unsoundness of his objections was pointed out, among others, by Martov and Plekhanov. It should be noted as a curiosity that the Iskra editorial board (on second thoughts, apparently) have now gone over to Martynov\u2019s side and are saying the opposite of what they said at the Congress! Presumably, this is in accordance with the celebrated principle of \u201ccontinuity\u201d.... It only remains for us to wait until the editorial board have thoroughly cleared up the question and explain to us just how far they agree with Martynov, on what points exactly, and since when. Meanwhile, we only ask: has anyone ever seen a party organ whose editorial board said after a congress the very opposite of what they had said at the congress?\n\nPassing over the arguments about the adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ (we dealt with that above) and the beginning of the debate on the Rules (which it will be more convenient to examine in connection with the whole discussion of the Rules), let us consider the shades of principle revealed during the discussion of the programme. First of all let us note one detail of a highly characteristic nature, namely, the debate on proportional representation. Comrade Egorov of Yuzhny Rabochy advocated the inclusion of this point in the programme, and did so in a way that called forth the justified remark from Posadovsky (an Iskra-ist of the minority) that there was a \u201cserious difference of opinion\u201d. \u201cThere can be no doubt,\u201d said Comrade Posadovsky, \u201cthat we do not agree on the following fundamental question: should we subordinate our future policy to certain fundamental democratic principles and attribute absolute value to them, or should all democratic principles be exclusively subordinated to the interests of our Party? I am decidedly in favour of the latter.\u201d Plekhanov \u201cfully associated himself\u201d with Posadovsky, objecting in even more definite and emphatic terms to \u201cthe absolute value of democratic principles\u201d and to regarding them \u201cabstractly\u201d. \u201cHypothetically,\u201d he said, \u201ca case is conceivable where we Social-Democrats would oppose universal suffrage. There was a time when the bourgeoisie of the Italian republics deprived members of the nobility of political rights. The revolutionary proletariat may restrict the political rights of the upper classes in the same way as the upper classes used to restrict its political rights.\u201d Plekhanov\u2019s speech was greeted with applause and hissing, and when Plekhanov protested against somebody\u2019s Zwischenruf,[] \u201cYou should not hiss,\u201d and told the comrades not to restrain their demonstrations, Comrade Egorov got up and said: \u201cSince such speeches call forth applause, I am obliged to hiss.\u201d Together with Comrade Goldblatt (a Bund delegate), Comrade Egorov challenged the views of Posadovsky and Plekhanov. Unfortunately, the debate was closed, and this question that had cropped up in it immediately vanished from the scene. But it is useless for Comrade Martov to attempt now to belittle or even altogether deny its significance by saying at the League Congress: \"These words [Plekhanov\u2019sl aroused the indignation of some of the delegates; this could easily have been avoided if Comrade Plekhanov had added that it was of course impossible to imagine so tragic a situation as that the proletariat, in order to consolidate its victory, should have to trample on such political rights as freedom of the press.... (Plekhanov: \u2019Merci.\u2019)\" (League Minutes, p. .) This interpretation directly contradicts Comrade Posadovsky\u2019s categorical statement at the Congress about a \u201cserious difference of opinion\u201d and disagreement on a \u201cfundamental question\u201d. On this fundamental question, all the Iskra-ists at the Congress opposed the spokesmen of the anti-Iskra \u201cRight\u201d (Goldblatt) and of the Congress \u201cCentre\u201d (Egorov). This is a fact, and one may safely assert that if the \u201cCentre\u201d (I hope this word will shock the \u201cofficial\u201d supporters of mildness less than any other. . .) had had occasion to speak \u201cwithout restraint\u201d (through the mouth of Comrade Egorov or Makhov) on this or on analogous questions, the serious difference of opinion would have been revealed at once.\n\nIt was revealed even more distinctly over the matter of \u201cequality of languages\u201d (Minutes, p.  et seq.). On this point it was not so much the debate that was so eloquent, but the voting: counting up the times a vote was taken, we get the incredible number of sixteen! Over what? Over whether it was enough to stipulate in the programme the equality of all citizens irrespective of sex, etc., and language, or whether it was necessary to stipulate \u201cfreedom of language\u201d, or \u201cequality of languages\u201d. Comrade Martov characterised this episode fairly accurately at the League Congress when he said that \u201ca trifling dispute over the formulation of one point of the programme became a matter of principle because half the Congress was prepared to overthrow the Programme Committee\u201d. Precisely.[] [] Martov added: \u201cOn this occasion much harm was done by Plekhanov\u2019s witticism about asses.\u201d (When the question of freedom of language was being discussed, a Bundist, I think it was, mentioned stud farms among other institutions, whereupon Plekhanov said in a loud undertone: \u201cHorses don\u2019t talk, but asses sometimes do.\u201d) I cannot, of course, see anything particularly mild, accommodating, tactful or flexible about this witticism. But I find it strange that Martov, who admitted that the dispute became a matter of principle, made absolutely no attempt to analyse what this principle was and what shades of opinion found expression here, but confined himself to talking about the \u201charmfulness\u201d of witticisms. This is indeed a bureaucratic and formalistic attitude! It is true that \u201cmuch harm was done at the Congress\u201d by cutting witticisms, levelled not only at the Bundists, but also at those whom the Bundists sometimes supported and even saved from defeat. However, once you admit that the incident involved principles, you cannot confine yourself to phrases about the \u201cimpermissibility\u201d (League Minutes, p. ) of certain witticisms. \u2014LeninThe immediate cause of the conflict was indeed trifling, yet it did become a matter of principle and consequently assumed terribly bitter forms, even to the point of attempts to \u201coverthrow\u201d the Programme Committee, of suspecting people of a desire to \u201cmislead the Congress\u201d (as Egorov suspected Martov!), and of personal remarks of the most . . . abusive kind (p. ). Even Comrade Popov \u201cexpressed regret that mere trifles had given rise to such an atmosphere\u201d (my italics, p. ) as prevailed during the course of three sittings (the th, th and th).\n\nAll these expressions very definitely and categorically point to the extremely important fact that the atmosphere of \u201csuspicion\u201d and of the most bitter forms of conflict (\u201cover throwing\u201d)\u2014for which later, at the League Congress, the Iskra-ist majority were held responsible!\u2014actually arose long before we split into a majority and minority. I repeat, this is a fact of enormous importance, a fundamental fact, and failure to understand it leads a great many people to very thoughtless conclusions about the majority at the end of the Congress having been artificial. From the present point of view of Comrade Martov, who asserts that nine-tenths of the Congress delegates were Iskra-ists, the fact that \u201cmere trifles\u201d, a \u201ctrivial\u201d cause, could give rise to a conflict which became a \u201cmatter of principle\u201d and nearly led to the overthrow of a Congress commission is absolutely inexplicable and absurd. It would be ridiculous to evade this fact with lamentations and regrets about \u201charmful\u201d witticisms. No cutting witticisms could have made the conflict a matter of principle; it could become that only because of the character of the political groupings at the Congress. It was not cutting remarks and witticisms that gave rise to the conflict\u2014they were only a symptom of the fact that the Congress political grouping itself harboured a \u201ccontradiction\u201d, that it harboured all the makings of a conflict, that it harboured an internal heterogeneity which burst forth with immanent force at the least cause, even the most trifling.\n\nOn the other hand, from the point of view from which I regard the Congress, and which I deem it my duty to uphold as a definite political interpretation of the events, even though this interpretation may seem offensive to some\u2014from this point of view the desperately acute conflict of principle that arose from a \u201ctrifling\u201d cause is quite explicable and inevitable. Since a struggle between the Iskra-ists and the anti-Iskra-ists went on all the time at our Congress, since between them stood unstable elements, and since the latter, together with the anti-Iskra-ists, controlled one-third of the votes (+=, out of , according to my calculation, an approximate one, of course), it is perfectly clear and natural that any falling away from the \"Iskra \"-ists of even a small minority created the possibility of a victory for the anti-Iskra trend and therefore evoked a \u201cfrenzied\u201d struggle. This was not the result of improper cutting remarks and attacks, but of the political combination. It was not cutting remarks that gave rise to the political conflict; it was the existence of a political conflict in the very grouping at the Congress that gave rise to cutting remarks and attacks\u2014this contrast expresses the cardinal disagreement in principle between Martov and myself in appraising the political significance of the Congress and its results.\n\nIn all, there were during the Congress three major cases of a small number of Iskra-ists falling away from the majority\u2014over the equality of languages question, over Paragraph  of the Rules, and over the elections\u2014and in all three cases a fierce struggle ensued, finally leading to the severe crisis we have in the Party today. For a political understanding of this crisis and this struggle, we must not confine ourselves to phrases about the impermissibility of witticisms, but must examine the political grouping of the shades that clashed at the Congress. The \u201cequality of languages\u201d incident is therefore doubly interesting as far as ascertaining the causes of the divergence is concerned, for here Martov was (still was!) an Iskra-ist and fought the anti-Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d harder perhaps than anybody else.\n\nThe war opened with an argument between Comrade Martov and Comrade Lieber, the leader of the Bundists (pp. -). Martov argued that the demand for \u201cequality of citizens\u201d was enough. \u201cFreedom of language\u201d was rejected, but \u201cequality of languages\u201d was forthwith proposed, and Comrade Egorov joined Lieber in the fray. Martov declared that it was fetishism \u201cwhen speakers insist that nationalities are equal and transfer inequality to the sphere of language, whereas the question should be examined from just the opposite angle: inequality of nationalities exists, and one of its expressions is that people belonging to certain nations are deprived of the right to use their mother tongue\u201d (p. ). There Martov was absolutely right. The totally baseless attempt of Lieber and Egorov to insist on the correctness of their formulation and make out that we were unwilling or unable to uphold the principle of equality of nationalities was indeed a sort of fetishism. Actually, they were, like \u201cfetish-worshippers\u201d, defending the word and not the principle, acting not from fear of committing an error of principle, but from fear of what people might say. This shaky mentality (what if \u201cothers\u201d blame us for this?)\u2014which we already noted in connection with the Organising Committee incident\u2014was quite clearly displayed here by our entire \u201cCentre\u201d. Another of its spokesmen, the Mining Area delegate Lvov, who stood close to Yuzhny Rabochy, declared that \"the question of the suppression of languages which has been raised by the border districts is a very serious one. It is important to include a point on language in our programme and thus obviate any possibility of the Social-Democrats being suspected of Russifying tendencies.\" A remarkable explanation of the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the question. It is very serious because possible suspicions on the part of the border districts must be obviated! The speaker says absolutely nothing on the substance of the question, he does not rebut the charge of fetishism but entirely confirms it, for he shows a complete lack of arguments of his own and merely talks about what the border districts may say. Everything they may say will be untruehe is told. But instead of examining whether it is true or not, he replies: \u201cThey may suspect.\u201d\n\nSuch a presentation of the question, coupled with the claim that it is serious and important, does indeed raise an issue of principle, but by no means the one the Liebers, Egorovs, and Lvovs would discern in it. The principle involved is: should we leave it to the organisations and members of the Party to apply the general and fundamental theses of the programme to their specific conditions, and to develop them for the purpose of such application, or are we, merely out of fear of suspicion, to fill the programme with petty details, minutiae, repetitions, and casuistry? The principle involved is: how can Social-Democrats discern (\u201csuspect\u201d) in a fight against casuistry an attempt to restrict elementary democratic rights and liberties? When are we going to wean ourselves at last from this fetishist worship of casuistry?\u2014that was the thought that occurred to us when watching this struggle over \u201clanguages\u201d.\n\nThe grouping of the delegates in this struggle is made particularly clear by the abundant roll-call votes. There were as many as three. All the time the Iskra core was solidly opposed by the anti-Iskra-ists (eight votes) and, with very slight fluctuations, by the whole Centre (Makhov, Lvov, Egorov, Popov, Medvedev, Ivanov, Tsaryov, and Byelov\u2014only the last two vacillated at first, now abstaining, now voting with us, and it was only during the third vote that their position became fully defined). Of the Iskra-ists, several fell away\u2014chiefly the Caucasians (three with six votes)\u2014and thanks to this the \u201cfetishist\u201d trend ultimately gained the upper hand. During the third vote, when the followers of both trends had clarified their position most fully, the three Caucasians, with six votes, broke away from the majority Iskra-ists and went over to the other side; two delegates\u2014Posadovsky and Kostich\u2014with two votes, fell away from the minority Iskra-ists. During the first two votes, the following had gone over to the other side or abstained: Lensky, Stepanov, and Gorsky of the Iskra-ist majority, and Deutsch of the minority. The falling away of eight \u201cIskra\u201d-ist votes (out of a total of thirty-three) gave the superiority to the coalition of the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists and the unstable elements. It was just this fundamental fact of the Congress grouping that was repeated (only with other Iskra-ists falling away) during the vote on Paragraph  of the Rules and during the elections. It is not surprising that those who were defeated in the elections now carefully close their eyes to the political reasons for that defeat, to the starting-points of that conflict of shades which progressively revealed the unstable and politically spineless elements and exposed them ever more relentlessly in the eyes of the Party. The equality of languages incident shows us this conflict all the more clearly because at that time Comrade Martov had not yet earned the praises and approval of Akimov and Makhov.\n\nF. The Agrarian Programme\nThe inconsistency of principle of the anti-Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d was also clearly brought out by the debate on the agrarian programme, which took up so much time at the Congress (see Minutes, pp. -) and raised quite a number of extremely interesting points. As was to be expected, the campaign against the programme was launched by Comrade Martynov (after some minor remarks by Comrades Lieber and Egorov). He brought out the old argument about redressing \u201cthis particular historical injustice\u201d, whereby, he claimed, we were indirectly \u201csanctifying other historical injustices\u201d, and so on. He was joined by Comrade Egorov, who even found that \u201cthe significance of this programme is unclear. Is it a programme for ourselves, that is, does it define our demands, or do we want to make it popular?\u201d (!?!?) Comrade Lieber said he \u201cwould like to make the same points as Gomrade Egorov\u201d. Comrade Makhov spoke up in his usual positive manner and declared that \u201cthe majority [?] of the speakers positively cannot understand what the programme submitted means and what its aims are\u201d. The proposed programme, you see, \u201ccan hardly be considered a Social-Democratic agrarian programme\u201d; it . . . \u201csmacks somewhat of a game at redressing historical injustices\u201d; it bears \u201cthe trace of demagogy and adventurism\u201d. As a theoretical justification of this profundity came the caricature and over simplification so customary in vulgar Marxism: the Iskra-ists, we were told, \u201cwant to treat the peasants as something homogeneous in composition; but as the peasantry split up into classes long ago [?], advancing a single programme must inevitably render the whole programme demagogic and make it adventurist when put into practice\u201d (p. ). Comrade Makhov here \u201cblurted out\u201d the real reason why our agrarian programme meets with the disapproval of many Social-Democrats, who are prepared to \u201crecognise\u201d Iskra (as Makhov himself did) but who have absolutely failed to grasp its trend, its theoretical and tactical position. It was the vulgarisation of Marxism as applied to so complex and many-sided a phenomenon as the present-day system of Russian peasant economy, and not differences over particulars, that was and is responsible for the failure to understand this programme. And on this vulgar-Marxist standpoint the leaders of the anti-Iskra elements (Lieber and Martynov) and of the \u201cCentre\u201d (Egorov and Makhov) quickly found themselves in harmony. Comrade Egorov gave frank expression also to one of the characteristic features of Yuzhny Rabochy and the groups and circles gravitating towards it, namely, their failure to grasp the importance of the peasant movement, their failure to grasp that it was not overestimation, but, on the contrary, underestimation of its importance (and a lack of forces to utilise it) that was the weak side of our Social-Democrats at the time of the first famous peasant revolts. \u201cI am far from sharing the infatuation of the editorial board for the peasant movement,\u201d said Comrade Egorov, \u201can infatuation to which many Social Democrats have succumbed since the peasant disturbances.\u201d But, unfortunately, Comrade Egorov did not take the trouble to give the Congress any precise idea of what this infatuation of the editorial board consisted in; he did not take the trouble to make specific reference to any of the material published by Iskra. Moreover, he forgot that all the fundamental points of our agrarian programme had already been developed by Iskra in its third issue,[] that is, long before the peasant disturbances. Those whose \u201crecognition\u201d of Iskra was not merely verbal might well have given a little more attention to its theoretical and tactical principles!\n\n\u201cNo, we cannot do much among the peasants!\u201d Comrade Egorov exclaimed, and he went on to indicate that this exclamation was not meant as a protest against any particular \u201cinfatuation\u201d, but as a denial of our entire position: \u201cIt means that our slogan cannot compete with the slogan of the adventurists.\u201d A most characteristic formulation of an unprincipled attitude, which reduces everything to \u201ccompetition\u201d between the slogans of different parties! And this was said after the speaker had pronounced himself \u201csatisfied\u201d with the theoretical explanations, which pointed out that we strove for lasting success in our agitation, undismayed by temporary failures, and that lasting success (as against the resounding clamour of our \u201ccompetitors\u201d . . . for a short time) was impossible unless the programme had a firm theoretical basis (p. ). What confusion is disclosed by this assurance of \u201csatisfaction\u201d followed by a repetition of the vulgar precepts inherited from the old Economism, for which the \u201ccompetition of slogans\u201d decided everything\u2014not only the agrarian question, but the entire programme and tactics of the economic and political struggle! \u201cYou will not induce the agricultural labourer,\u201d Comrade Egorov said, \u201cto fight side by side with the rich peasant for the cut-off lands, which to no small extent are already in this rich peasant\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nThere again you have the same over-simplification, undoubtedly akin to our opportunist Economism, which insisted that it was impossible to \u201cinduce\u201d the proletarian to fight for what was to no small extent in the hands of the bourgeoisie and would fall into its hands to an even larger extent in the future. There again you have the vulgarisation that forgets the Russian peculiarities of the general capitalist relations between the agricultural labourer and the rich peasant. Actually, the cut-off lands today oppress the agricultural labourer as well, and he does not have to be \u201cinduced\u201d to fight for emancipation from his state of servitude. It is certain intellectuals who have to be \u201cinduced\u201d\u2014induced to take a wider view of their tasks, induced to renounce stereotyped formulas when discussing specific questions, induced to take account of the historical situation, which complicates and modifies our aims. It is only the superstition that the muzhik is stupid\u2014a superstition which, as Comrade Martov rightly remarked (p. ), was to be detected in the speeches of Comrade Makhov and the other opponents of the agrarian programme\u2014only this superstition explains why these opponents forget our agricultural labourer\u2019s actual conditions of life.\n\nHaving simplified the question into a naked contrast of worker and capitalist, the spokesmen of our \u201cCentre\u201d tried, as often happens, to ascribe their own narrow-mindedness to the muzhik. \u201cIt is precisely because I consider the muzhik, within the limits of his narrow class outlook, a clever fellow,\u201d Comrade Makhov remarked, \u201cthat I believe he will stand for the petty-bourgeois ideal of seizure and division.\u201d Two things are obviously confused here: the definition of the class outlook of the muzhik as that of a petty bourgeois, and the restriction, the reduction of this outlook to \u201cnarrow limits\u201d. It is in this reduction that the mistake of the Egorovs and Makhovs lies (just as the mistake of the Martynovs and Akimovs lay in reducing the outlook of the proletarian to \u201cnarrow limits\u201d). For both logic and history teach us that the petty-bourgeois class outlook may be more or less narrow, and more or less progressive, precisely because of the dual status of the petty bourgeois. And far from dropping our hands in despair because of the narrowness (\u201cstupidity\u201d) of the muzhik or because he is governed by \u201cprejudice\u201d, we must work unremittingly to widen his outlook and help his reason to triumph over his prejudice.\n\nThe vulgar-\u201cMarxist\u201d view of the Russian agrarian question found its culmination in the concluding words of Comrade Makhov\u2019s speech, in which that faithful champion of the old Iskra editorial board set forth his principles. It was not for nothing that these words were greeted with applause ... true, it was ironical applause. \u201cI do not know, of course, what to call a misfortune,\u201d said Comrade Makhov, outraged by Plekhanov\u2019s statement that we were not at all alarmed by the movement for a General Redistribution,[] and that we would not be the ones to hold back this progressive (bourgeois progressive) movement. \"But this revolution, if it can be called such, would not be a revolutionary one. It would be truer to call it, not revolution, but reaction (laughter ), a revolution that was more like a riot.... Such a revolution would throw us back, and it would require a certain amount of time to get back to the position we have today. Today we have far more than during the French Revolution (ironical applause ), we have a Social-Democratic Party (laughter )....\" Yes, a Social-Democratic Party which reasoned like Makhov, or which had central institutions of the Makhov persuasion, would indeed only deserve to be laughed at....\n\nThus we see that even on the purely theoretical questions raised by the agrarian programme, the already familiar grouping at once appeared. The anti-Iskra-ists (eight votes) rushed into the fray on behalf of vulgar Marxism, and the leaders of the \u201cCentre\u201d, the Egorovs and Makhovs, trailed after them, constantly erring and straying into the same narrow outlook. It is quite natural, therefore, that the voting on certain points of the agrarian programme should have resulted in thirty and thirty-five votes in favour (pp.  and ), that is, approximately the same figure as we observed in the dispute over the place of the Bund question on the agenda, in the Organising Committee incident, and in the question of shutting down Yuzhny Rabochy. An issue had only to arise which did not quite come within the already established and customary pattern, and which called for some independent application of Marx\u2019s theory to peculiar and new (new to the Germans) social and economic relations, and Iskra-ists who proved equal to the problems only made up three-fifths of the vote, while the whole \u201cCentre\u201d turned and followed the Liebers and Martynovs. Yet Comrade Martov strives to gloss over this obvious fact, fearfully avoiding all mention of votes where the shades of opinion were clearly revealed!\n\nIt is clearly evident from the debate on the agrarian programme that the Iskra-ists had to fight against a good two-fifths of the Congress. On this question the Caucasian delegates took up an absolutely correct stand\u2014due largely, in all probability, to the fact that first-hand knowledge of the forms taken by the numerous remnants of feudalism in their localities kept them from the school-boyishly abstract and bare contrasts that satisfied the Makhovs. Martynov and Lieber, Makhov and Egorov were combated by Plekhanov, by Gusev (who declared that he had \u201cfrequently encountered such a pessimistic view of our work in the countryside\u201d as Comrade Egorov\u2019s \u201camong the comrades active in Russia\u201d), by Kostrov,[] by Karsky and by Trotsky. The latter rightly remarked that the \u201cwell-meant advice\u201d of the critics of the agrarian programme \u201csmacked too much of philistinism\u201d. It should only be said, since we are studying the political grouping at the Congress, that he was hardly correct when in this part of his speech (p. ) he ranked Comrade Lange with Egorov and Makhov. Anyone who reads the minutes carefully will see that Lange and Gorin took quite a different stand from Egorov and Makhov. Lange and Gorin did not like the formulation of the point on the cut off lands; they fully understood the idea of our agrarian programme, but tried to apply it in a different way, worked constructively to find what they considered a more irreproachable formulation, and in submitting their motions had in view either to convince the authors of the programme or else to side with them against all the non-Iskra-ists. For example, one has only to compare Makhov\u2019s motions to reject the whole agrarian programme (p. ; nine for, thirty-eight against) or individual points in it (p. , etc.) with the position of Lange, who moved his own formulation of the point on the cut-off lands (p. ), to become convinced of the radical difference between them.[]\n\nReferring to the arguments which smacked of \u201cphilistinism\u201d, Comrade Trotsky pointed out that \u201cin the approaching revolutionary period we must link ourselves with the peasantry\u201d.... \u201cIn face of this task, the scepticism and political \u2019far-sightedness\u2019 of Makhov and Egorov are more harmful than any short-sightedness.\u201d Comrade Kostich, another minority Iskra-ist, very aptly pointed to Comrade Makhov\u2019s \u201cunsureness of himself, of the stability of his principles\u201d\u2014a description that fits our \u201cCentre\u201d to a tittle. \u201cIn his pessimism Comrade Makhov is at one with Comrade Egorov, although they differ in shade,\u201d Comrade Kostich continued. \u201cHe forgets that the Social-Democrats are already working among the peasantry, are already directing their movement as far as possible. And this pessimism narrows the scope of our work\u201d (p. ).\n\nTo conclude our examination of the Congress discussion of the programme, it is worth while mentioning the brief debate on the subject of supporting oppositional trends. Our programme clearly states that the Social-Democratic Party supports \u201cevery oppositional and revolutionary movement directed against the existing social and political order in Russia\u201d. One would think that this last reservation made it quite clear exactly which oppositional trends we support. Nevertheless, the different shades that long ago developed in our Party at once revealed themselves here too, difficult as it was to suppose that any \u201cperplexity or misunderstanding\u201d was still possible on a question which had been chewed over so thoroughly! Evidently, it was not a matter of misunderstandings, but of shades. Makhov, Lieber, and Martynov at once sounded the alarm and again proved to be in so \u201ccompact\u201d a minority that Comrade Martov would most likely have to attribute this too to intrigue, machination, diplomacy, and the other nice things (see his speech at the League Congress) to which people resort who are incapable of understanding the political reasons for the formation of \u201ccompact\u201d groups of both minority and majority.\n\nMakhov again began with a vulgar simplification of Marxism. \u201cOur only revolutionary class is the proletariat,\u201d he declared, and from this correct premise he forthwith drew an incorrect conclusion: \u201cThe rest are of no account, they are mere hangers-on (general laughter ).... Yes, they are mere hangers-on and only out to reap the benefits. I am against supporting them\u201d (p. ). Comrade Makhov\u2019s inimitable formulation of his position embarrassed many (of his supporters), but as a matter of fact Lieber and Martynov agreed with him when they proposed deleting the word \u201coppositional\u201d or restricting it by an addition: \u201cdemocratic-oppositional.\u201d Plekhanov quite rightly took the field against this amendment of Martynov\u2019s. \u201cWe must criticise the liberals,\u201d he said, \"expose their half-heartedness. That is true.... But, while exposing the narrowness and limitations of all movements other than the Social-Democratic, it is our duty to explain to the proletariat that even a constitution which does not confer universal suffrage would be a step forward compared with absolutism, and that therefore it should not prefer the existing order to such a constitution.\" Comrades Martynov, Lieber, and Makhov would not agree with this and persisted in their position, which was attacked by Axelrod, Starover, and Trotsky and once more by Plekhanov. Comrade Makhov managed on this occasion to surpass himself. First he had said that the other classes (other than the proletariat) were \u201cof no account\u201d and that he was \u201cagainst supporting them\u201d. Then he condescended to admit that \u201cwhile essentially it is reactionary, the bourgeoisie is often revolutionary\u2014for example, in the struggle against feudalism and its survivals\u201d. \u201cBut there are some groups,\u201d he continued, going from bad to worse, \u201cwhich are always [?] reactionary\u2014such are the handicraftsmen.\u201d Such were the gems of theory arrived at by those very leaders of our \u201cCentre\u201d who later foamed at the mouth in defence of the old editorial board! \"Even in Western Europe, where the guild system was so strong, it was the handicraftsmen, like the other petty bourgeois of the towns, who displayed an exceptionally revolutionary spirit in the era of the fall of absolutism. And it is particularly absurd of a Russian Social-Democrat to repeat without reflection what our Western comrades say about the handicraftsmen of today, that is, of an era separated by a century or half a century from the fall of absolutism. To speak of the handicraftsmen in Russia being politically reactionary as compared with the bourgeoisie is merely to repeat a set phrase learnt by rote.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no record in the minutes of the number of votes cast for the rejected amendments of Martynov, Makhov, and Lieber on this question. All we can say is that, here too, the leaders of the anti-Iskra elements and one of the leaders of the \u201cCentre\u201d[] [] Another leader of this same group, the \u201cCentre\u201d, Comrade Egorov, spoke on the question of supporting the oppositional trends on a different occasion, in connection with Axelrod\u2019s resolution on the Socialist-Revolutionaries (p. ). Comrade Egorov detected a \u201ccontradiction\u201d between the demand in the programme for support of every oppositional and revolutionary movement and the antagonistic attitude towards both the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the liberals. In another form, and approaching the question from a somewhat different angle, Comrade Egorov here revealed the same narrow conception of Marxism, and the same unstable, semi-hostile attitude towards the position of Iskra (which he had \"recognised\"?), as Comrades Makhov, Lieber, and Martynov had done. \u2014Leninjoined forces in the already familiar grouping against the Iskra-ists. Summing up the whole discussion on the programme, one cannot help seeing that of the debates which were at all animated and evoked general interest there was not one that failed to reveal the difference of shades which Comrade Martov and the new Iskra editorial board now so carefully ignore.\n\nG. The Party Rules. Comrade Martov\u2019s Draft\nFrom the programme, the Congress passed to the Party Rules (we leave out the question of the Central Organ, already touched on above, and the delegates\u2019 reports, which the majority of the delegates were unfortunately unable to present in a satisfactory form). Needless to say, the question of the Rules was of tremendous importance to all of us. After all, Iskra had acted from the very outset not only as a press organ but also as an organisational nucleus. In an editorial in its fourth issue (\u201cWhere To Begin\u201d) Iskra had put forward a whole plan of organisation,[] [] In his speech on the adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ, Comrade Popov said, inter alia: \u201cI recall the article \u2019Where To Begin\u2019 in No.  or No.  of Iskra. Many of the comrades active in Russia found it a tactless article; others thought this plan was fantastic, and the majority [?\u2014probably the majority around Comrade Popov] attributed it solely to ambition\u201d (p. ). As the reader sees, it is no new thing for me to hear my political views attributed to ambition\u2014an explanation now being rehashed by Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martov. \u2014Leninwhich it pursued systematically and steadily over a period of three years. When the Second Party Congress adopted Iskra as the Central Organ, two of the three points of the preamble of the resolution on the subject (p. ) were devoted precisely to this organisational plan and to \u201cIskra\u2019s\u201d organisational ideas: its role in directing the practical work of the Party and the leading part it had played in the work of attaining unity. It is quite natural, therefore, that the work of Iskra and the entire work of organising the Party, the entire work of actually restoring the Party, could not be regarded as finished until definite ideas of organisation had been adopted by the whole Party and formally enacted. This task was to be performed by the Party\u2019s Rules of Organisation.\n\nThe principal ideas which Iskra strove to make the basis of the Party\u2019s organisation amounted essentially to the following two: first, the idea of centralism, which defined in principle the method of deciding all particular and detail questions of organisation; second, the special function of an organ, a newspaper, for ideological leadership\u2014an idea which took into account the temporary and special requirements of the Russian Social-Democratic working-class movement in the existing conditions of political slavery, with the initial base of operations for the revolutionary assault being set up abroad. The first idea, as the one matter of principle, had to pervade the entire Rules; the second, being a particular idea necessitated by temporary circumstances of place and mode of action, took the form of a seeming departure from centralism in the proposal to set up two centres, a Central Organ and a Central Committee. Both these principal Iskra ideas of Party organisation had been developed by me in the Iskra editorial (No. ) \u201cWhere To Begin\u201d[] and inWhat Is To Be Done?[] and, finally, had been explained in detail, in a form that was practically a finished set of Rules, inA Letter to a Comrade.[] Actually, all that remained was the work of formulating the paragraphs of the Rules, which were to embody just those ideas if the recognition of Iskra was not to be merely nominal, a mere conventional phrase. In the preface to the new edition of my Letter to a Comrade I have already pointed out that a simple comparison of the Party Rules with that pamphlet is enough to establish the complete identity of the ideas of organisation contained in the two.[]\n\nA propos of the work of formulating Iskra\u2019s ideas of organisation in the Rules, I must deal with a certain incident mentioned by Comrade Martov. \u201c. . . A statement of fact,\u201d said Martov at the League Congress (p. ), \"will show you how far my lapse into opportunism on this paragraph [i.e., Paragraph ] was unexpected by Lenin. About a month and a half or two months before the Congress I showed Lenin my draft, in which Paragraph  was formulated just in the way I proposed it at the Congress. Lenin objected to my draft on the ground that it was too detailed, and told me that all he liked was the idea of Paragraph \u2014the definition of Party membership\u2014which he would incorporate in his Rules with certain modifications, because he did not think my formulation was a happy one. Thus, Lenin had long been acquainted with my formulation, he knew my views on this subject. You thus see that I came to the Congress with my visor up, that I did not conceal my views. I warned him that I would oppose mutual co-optation, the principle of unanimity in cases of co-optation to the Central Committee and the Central Organ, and so on.\"\n\nAs regards the warning about opposing mutual co-optation, we shall see in its proper place how matters really stood. At present let us deal with this \u201copen visor\u201d of Martov\u2019s Rules. At the League Congress, recounting from memory this episode of his unhappy draft (which he himself withdrew at the Congress because it was an unhappy one, but after the Congress, with his characteristic consistency, again brought out into the light of day), Martov, as so often happens, forgot a good deal and therefore again got things muddled. One would have thought there had already been cases enough to warn him against quoting private conversations and relying on his memory (people involuntarily recall only what is to their advantage!)\u2014nevertheless, for want of any other, Comrade Martov used unsound material. Today even Comrade Plekhanov is beginning to imitate him\u2014evidently, a bad example is contagious.\n\nI could not have \u201cliked\u201d the \u201cidea\u201d of Paragraph  of Martov\u2019s draft, for that draft contained no idea that came up at the Congress. His memory played him false. I have been fortunate enough to find Martov\u2019s draft among my papers, and in it \u201cParagraph  is formulated n o t in the way he proposed it at the Congress\u201d! So much for the \u201copen visor\u201d!\n\nParagraph is clearly evident from this juxtaposition that there is no idea in Martov\u2019s draft, but only an empty phrase. That Party members must work under the control and direction of the organs of the Party goes without saying; it cannot be otherwise, and only those talk about it who love to talk without saying anything, who love to drown \u201cRules\u201d in a flood of verbiage and bureaucratic formulas (that is, formulas useless for the work and supposed to be useful for display). The idea of Paragraph  appears only when the question is asked: can the organs of the Party exercise actual direction over Party members who do not belong to any of the Party organisations? There is not even a trace of this idea in Comrade Martov\u2019s draft. Consequently, I could not have been acquainted with the \u201cviews\u201d of Comrade Martov \u201con this subject\u201d, for in Comrade Martov\u2019s draft there are no views on this subject. Comrade Martov\u2019s statement of fact proves to be a muddle.\n\nAbout Comrade Martov, on the other hand, it does have to be said that from my draft \u201che knew my views on this subject\u201d and did not protest against them, did not reject them, either on the editorial board, although my draft was shown to everyone two or three weeks before the Congress, or in talking to the delegates, who were acquainted only with my draft. More, even at the Congress, when I moved my draft Rules[] [] Incidentally, the Minutes Committee, in Appendix XI, has published the draft Rules \u201cmoved at the Congress by Lenin\u201d (p. ). Here the Minutes Committee has also muddled things a little. It has confused my original draft (see present edition, Vol. , pp. -.\u2014Ed.), which was shown to all the delegates (and to many before the Congress), with the draft moved at the Congress, and published the former under the guise of the latter. Of course, I have no objection to my drafts being published, even in all their stages of preparation, but there was no need to cause confusion. And confusion has been caused, for Popov and Martov (pp.  and ) criticised formulations in the draft I actually moved at the Congress which are not in the draft published by the Minutes Committee (cf. p. , Paragraphs  and ). With a little more care, the mistake could easily have been detected simply by comparing the pages I mention. \u2014Leninand defended them before the election of the Rules Committee, Comrade Martov distinctly stated: \u201cI associate myself with Comrade Lenin\u2019s conclusions. Only on two points do I disagree with him\u201d (my italics)\u2014on the mode of constituting the Council and on unanimous co-optation (p. ). Not a word was yet said about any difference over Paragraph .\n\nIn his pamphlet on the state of siege, Comrade Martov saw fit to recall his Rules once more, and in great detail. He assures us there that his Rules, to which, with the exception of certain minor particulars, he would be prepared to subscribe even now (February \u2014we cannot say how it will be three months hence), \u201cquite clearly expressed his disapproval of hypertrophy of centralism\u201d (p. iv). The reason he did not submit this draft to the Congress, Comrade Martov now explains, was, firstly, that \u201chis Iskra training had imbued him with disdain for Rules\u201d (when it suits Comrade Martov, the word Iskra means for him, not a narrow circle spirit, but the most steadfast of trends! It is a pity, however, that Comrade Martov\u2019s Iskra training did not imbue him in three years with disdain for the anarchistic phrases by which the unstable mentality of the intellectual is capable of justifying the violation of Rules adopted by common consent). Secondly, that, don\u2019t you see, he, Comrade Martov, wanted to avoid \u201cintroducing any dissonance into the tactics of that basic organisational nucleus which Iskra constituted\u201d. Wonderfully consistent, isn\u2019t it? On a question of principle regarding an opportunist formulation of Paragraph  or hypertrophy of centralism, Comrade Martov was so afraid of any dissonance (which is terrible only from the narrowest circle point of view) that he did not set forth his disagreement even to a nucleus like the editorial board! On the practical question of the composition of the central bodies, Comrade Martov appealed for the assistance of the Bund and the Rabocheye Dyelo-ist! against the vote of the majority of the Iskra organisation (that real basic organisational nucleus ). The \u201cdissonance\u201d in his phrases, which smuggle in the circle spirit in defence of the quasi-editorial board only to repudiate the \u201ccircle spirit\u201d in the appraisal of the question by those best qualfied to judge\u2014this dissonance Comrade Martov does not notice. To punish him, we shall quote his, draft Rules in full, noting for our part what views and what hypertrophy they reveal[]:\n\n\"Draft of Party Rules.\u2014I. Party membership.\u2014) A member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who, accepting its programme, works actively to accompish its aims under the control and direction of the organs of the Party.\u2014) Expulsion of a member from the Party for conduct incompatible with the interests of the Party shall be decided by the Central Committee. [The sentence of expulsion, giving the reasons, shall be preserved in the Party files and shall be communicated, on request, to every Party committee. The Central Committee\u2019s decision to expel a member may be appealed against to the Congress on the demand of two or more committees.]\" I shall indicate by square brackets the provisions in Martov\u2019s draft which are obviously meaningless, failing to contan not only \u201cideas\u201d, but even any definite conditions or requirements\u2014like the inimitable specification in the \u201cRules\u201d as to where exactly a sentence of expulsion is to be preserved, or the provision that the Central Committee\u2019s decision to expel a member (and not all its decision in general?) may be appealed against to the Congress. This, indeed, is hypertrophy of verbiage, or real bureaucratic formalism, which frames superfluous, patently useless or red-tapist, points and paragraphs. \u201cII. Local Committees.\u2014) In its local work, the Party is represented by the Party committees\u201d (how new and clever!). \") [As Party committees are recognised all those existing at the time of the Second Congress and represented at the Congress.]\u2014) New Party committees, in addition to those mentioned in Paragraph , shall be appointed by the Central Committee [which shall either endorse as a committee the existing membership of the given local organisation, or shall set up a local committee by reforming the latter].\u2014) The committees may add to their membership by means of co-optation.\u2014) The Central Committee has the right to augment the membership of a local committee with such numbers of comrades (known to it) as shall not exceed one-third of the total membership of the committee.\" A perfect sample of bureaucracy. Why not exceeding one-third? What is the purpose of this? What is the sense of this restriction which restricts nothing, seeing that the augmenting may be repeated over and over again? \") [In the event of a local committee falling apart or being broken up by persecution\" (does this mean that not all the members have been arrested?), \"the Central Committee shall re-establish it.]\" (Without regard to Paragraph ? Does not Comrade Martov perceive a similarity between Paragraph  and those Russian laws on orderly conduct which command citizens to work on weekdays and rest on holidays?) \") [A regular Party Congress may instruct the Central Committee to reform the composition of any local committee if the activities of the latter are found incompatible with the interests of the Party. In that event the existing committee shall be deemed dissolved and the comrades in its area of operation exempt from subordination[] to it.]\u201d The provision contained in this paragraph is as highly useful as the provision contained to this day in the Russian law which reads: \u201cDrunkenness is forbidden to all and sundry.\u201d \") [The local Party committees shall direct all the propagandist, agitational, and organisational activities of the Party in their localities and shall do all in their power to assist the Central Committee and the Central Organs of the Party in carrying out the general Party tasks entrusted to them.]\" Phew! What in the name of all that\u2019s holy is the purpose of this? \") [The internal arrangements of a local organisation, the mutual relations between a committee and the groups subordinate to it\" (do you hear that, Comrade Axelrod?), \"and the limits of the competence and autonomy\" (are not the limits of competence the same as the limits of autonomy?) \"of these groups shall be determined by the committee itself and communicated to the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organs.]\" (An omission: it is not stated where these communications are to be filed.) \") [All groups subordinate to committees, and individual Party members, have the right to demand that their opinions and recommendations on any subject be communicated to the Central Committee of the Party and its Central Organs.]\u2014) The local Party committees shall contribute from their revenues to the funds of the Central Committee such sums as the Central Committee shall assign to their share.\u2014III. Organisations for the Purpose of Agitation in Languages Other than Russian.\u2014) [For the purpose of carrying on agitation in any non-Russian language and of organising the workers among whom such agitation is carried on, separate organisations may be set up in places where such specialised agitation and the setting up of such organisations are deemed necessary.]\u2014) The question as to whether such a necessity exists shall be decided by the Central Committee of the Party, and in disputed cases by the Party Congress.\" The first part of this paragraph is superfluous in view of subsequent provisions in the Rules, and the second part, concerning disputed cases, is simply ludicrous. \") [The local organisations mentioned in Paragraph  shall be autonomous in their special affairs but shall act under the control of the local committee and be subordinate to it, the forms of this control and the character of the organisational relations between the committee and the special organisation being determined by the local committee.\" (Well, thank God!

First conclusion: the Rules suffer from almost incurable dropsy. Second conclusion: it is impossible to discover in these Rules any special shade of organisational views evincing a disapproval of hypertrophy of centralism. Third conclusion: Comrade Martov acted very wisely indeed in concealing from the eyes of the world (and withholding from discussion at the Congress) more than / of his Rules. Only it is rather odd that \u00e0 propos of this concealment he should talk about an open visor.\n\nH. Discussion on Centralism Prior to the Split Among the Iskra-ists\nBefore passing to the really interesting question of the formulation of Paragraph  of the Rules, a question which undoubtedly disclosed the existence of different shades of opinion, let us dwell a little on that brief general discussion of the Rules which occupied the th and part of the th Congress sittings. This discussion is of some significance inasmuch as it preceded the complete divergence within the Iskra organisation over the composition of the central bodies, whereas the subsequent debate on the Rules in general, and on co-optation in particular, took place after this divergence in the Iskra organisation. Naturally, before the divergence we were able to express our views more impartially, in the sense that they were more independent of views about the personal composition of the Central Committee, which became such a keen issue with us all. Comrade Martov, as I have already remarked, associated himself (p. ) with my views on organisation, only making the reservation that he differed on two points of detail. Both the anti-Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d, on the contrary, at once took the field against both fundamental ideas of the whole Iskra organisational plan (and, consequently, against the Rules in their entirety): against centralism and against \u201ctwo centres\u201d Comrade Lieber referred to my Rules as \u201corganised distrust\u201d and discerned decentralism in the proposal for two centres (as did Comrades Popov and Egorov). Comrade Akimov wanted to broaden the jurisdiction of the local committees, and, in particular, to grant them themselves \u201cthe right to alter their composition\u201d. \u201cThey should be allowed greater freedom of action.... The local committees should be elected by the active workers in their localities, just as the Central Committee is elected by the representatives of all the active organisations in Russia. And if even this cannot be allowed, let the number of members that the Central Committee may appoint to local committees be limited. . .\u201d (p. ). Comrade Akimov, as you see, suggested an argument against \u201chypertrophy of centralism\u201d, but Comrade Martov remained deaf to these weighty arguments, not yet having been induced by his defeat over the composition of the central bodies to follow in Akimov\u2019s wake. He remained deaf even when Comrade Akimov suggested to him the \" idea\" of his own Rules (Paragraph \u2014restriction of the Central Committee\u2019s right to appoint members to the committees)! At that time Comrade Martov still did not want any \u201cdissonance\u201d with us, and for that reason tolerated a dissonance both with Comrade Akimov and with himself.... At that time the only opponents of \u201cmonstrous centralism\u201d were those to whom Iskra\u2019s centralism was clearly disadvantageous: it was opposed by Akimov, Lieber, and Goldblatt, followed, cautiously and circumspectly (so that they could always turn back), by Egorov (see pp.  and ) and such like. At that time it was still clear to the vast majority of the Party that it was the parochial, circle interests of the Bund, Yuzhny Rabochy, etc., that evoked the protest against centralism. For that matter, now too it is clear to the majority of the Party that it is the circle interests of the old Iskra editorial board that cause it to protest against centralism....\n\nTake, for example, Comrade Goldblatt\u2019s speech (pp. -). He inveighs against my \u201cmonstrous\u201d centralism and claims that it would lead to the \u201cdestruction\u201d of the lower organisations, that it is \u201cpermeated through and through with the desire to give the centre unrestricted powers and the unrestricted right to interfere in everything\u201d, that it allows the organisations \u201conly one right\u2014to submit without a murmur to orders from above\u201d, etc. \u201cThe centre proposed by the draft would find itself in a vacuum, it would have no peripheral organisations around it, but only an amorphous mass in which its executive agents would move.\u201d Why, this is exactly the kind of false phrase-mongering to which the Martovs and Axelrods proceeded to treat us after their defeat at the Congress. The Bund was laughed at when it fought our centralism while granting its own central body even more definite unrestricted rights (e.g., to appoint and expel members, and even to refuse to admit delegates to congresses). And when people sort things out, the howls of the minority will also be laughed at, for they cried out against centralism and against the Rules when they were in the minority, but lost no time in taking advantage of the Rules once they had managed to make themselves the majority.\n\nOver the question of two centres, the grouping was also clearly evident: all the Iskra-ists were opposed by Lieber, by Akimov (the first to strike up the now favourite Axelrod Martov tune about the Central Organ predominating over the Central Committee on the Council), by Popov, and by Egorov. From the ideas of organisation which the old Iskra had always advocated (and which the Popovs and Egorovs had verbally approved!), the plan for two centres followed of itself. The policy of the old Iskra cut across the plans of Yuzhny Rabochy, the plans to create a parallel popular organ and to convert it virtually into the dominant organ. There lies the root of the paradox, so strange at first glance, that all the anti-Iskra-ists and the entire Marsh were in favour of one central body, that is, of seemingly greater centralism. Of course, there were some delegates (especially among the Marsh) who probably did not have a clear idea where the organisational plans of Yuzhny Rabochy would lead, and were bound to lead in the nature of things, but they were impelled to follow the anti-Iskra-ists by their very irresoluteness and unsureness of themselves.\n\nOf the speeches by Iskra-ists during this debate on the Rules (the one preceding the split among the Iskra-ists), particularly noteworthy were those of Comrades Martov (\u201cassociation\u201d with my ideas of organisation) and Trotsky. Every word of the answer the latter gave Comrades Akimov and Lieber exposes the utter falsity of the \u201cminority\u2019s\u201d post-Congress conduct and theories. \"The Rules, he [Comrade Akimov] said, do not define the jurisdiction of the Central Committee with enough precision. I cannot agree with him. On the contrary, this definition is precise and means that inasmuch as the Party is one whole, it must be ensured control over the local committees. Comrade Lieber said, borrowing my expression, that the Rules were \u2019organised distrust\u2019. That is true. But I used this expression in reference to the Rules proposed by the Bund spokesmen, which represented organised distrust on the part of a section of the Party towards the whole Party. Our Rules, on the other hand\" (at that time, before the defeat over the composition of the central bodies, the Rules were \u201cours\u201d!), \u201crepresent the organised distrust of the Party towards all its sections, that is, control over all local, district, national, and other organisations\u201d (p. ). Yes, our Rules are here correctly described, and we would advise those to bear this more constantly in mind who are now assuring us with an easy conscience that it was the intriguing majority who conceived and introduced the system of \u201corganised distrust\u201d or, which is the same thing, the \u201cstate of siege\u201d. One has only to compare this speech with the speeches at the Congress of the League Abroad to get a specimen of political spinelessness, a specimen of how the views of Martov and Co. changed depending on whether the matter concerned their own group of a lower order or someone else\u2019s.\n\nI. Paragraph One of the Rules\nWe have already cited the different formulations around which an interesting debate flared up at the Congress. This debate took up nearly two sittings and ended with two roll-call votes (during the entire Congress there were, if I am not mistaken, only eight roll-call votes, which were resorted to only in very important cases because of the great loss of time they involved). The question at issue was undoubtedly one of principle. The interest of the Congress in the debate was tremendous. All the delegates voted\u2014a rare occurrence at our Congress (as at any big congress) and one that likewise testifies to the interest displayed by the disputants.\n\nWhat, then, was the substance of the matter in dispute? I already said at the Congress, and have since repeated it time and again, that \u201cI by no means consider our difference [over Paragraph ] so vital as to be a matter of life or death to the Party. We shall certainly not perish because of an unfortunate clause in the Rules!\u201d (p. .)[] Taken by itself, this difference, although it did reveal shades of principle, could never have called forth that divergence (actually, to speak unreservedly, that split) which took place after the Congress. But every little difference may become a big one if it is insisted on, if it is put into the foreground, if people set about searching for all the roots and branches of the difference. Every little difference may assume tremendous importance if it serves as the starting-point for a swing towards definite mistaken views, and if these mistaken views are combined, by virtue of new and additional divergences, with anarchistic actions which bring the Party to the point of a split.\n\nAnd that is just what happened in the present case. The comparatively slight difference over Paragraph  has now acquired tremendous importance, because it was this that started the swing towards the opportunist profundities and anarchistic phrase-mongering of the minority (especially at the League Congress, and subsequently in the columns of the new Iskra as well). It was this that marked the beginning of the coalition of the Iskra-ist minority with the anti-Iskra-ists and the Marsh, which assumed final and definite shape by the time of the elections, and without understanding which it is impossible to understand the major and fundamental divergence over the composition of the central bodies. The slight mistake of Martov and Axelrod over Paragraph  was a slight crack in our pot (as I put it at the League Congress). The pot could be bound tight with a hard knot (and not a hangman\u2019s knot, as it was misunderstood by Martov, who during the League Congress was in a state bordering on hysteria); or all efforts could be directed towards widening the crack and breaking the pot in two. And that is what happened, thanks to the boycott and similar anarchistic moves of the zealous Martovites. The difference over Paragraph  played no small part in the elections to the central bodies, and Martov\u2019s defeat in the elections led him into a \u201cstruggle over principles\u201d with the use of grossly mechanical and even brawling methods (such as his speeches at the Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad).\n\nNow, after all these happenings, the question of Paragraph  has thus assumed tremendous importance, and we must clearly realise both the character of the Congress groupings in the voting on this paragraph and\u2014far more important still\u2014the real nature of those shades of opinion which revealed or began to reveal themselves over Paragraph . Now, after the events with which the reader is familiar, the question stands as follows: Did Martov\u2019s formulation, which was supported by Axelrod, reflect his (or their) instability, vacillation, and political vagueness, as I expressed it at the Party Congress (p. ), his (or their) deviation towards Jaur\u00e8sism and anarchism, as Plekhanov suggested at the League Congress (League Minutes, p.  and elsewhere)? Or did my formulation, which was supported by Plekhanov, reflect a wrong, bureaucratic, formalistic, Jack-in-office, un-Social-Democratic conception of centralism? Opportunism and anarchism, or bureaucracy and formalism?\u2014that is the way the question stands now, when the little difference has become a big one. And when discussing the pros and cons of my formulation on their merits, we must bear in mind just this presentation of the question, which has been forced upon us all by the events, or, I would say if it did not sound too pompous, has been evolved by history.\n\nLet us begin the examination of these pros and cons with an analysis of the Congress debate. The first speech, that of Comrade Egorov, is interesting only for the fact that his attitude (non liquet, it is not yet clear to me, I do not yet know where the truth lies) was very characteristic of the attitude of many delegates, who found it difficult to grasp the rights and wrongs of this really new and fairly complex and detailed question. The next speech, that of Comrade Axelrod, at once made the issue one of principle. This was the first speech Comrade Axelrod made at the Congress on questions of principle, one might even say the first speech he made at all, and it can scarcely be claimed that his debut with the celebrated \u201cprofessor\u201d was particularly fortunate. \u201cI think,\u201d Comrade Axelrod said, \u201cthat we must draw a distinction between the concepts party and organisation. These two concepts are being confused here. And the confusion is dangerous.\u201d That was the first argument against my formulation. Examine it more closely. When I say that the Party should be the sum (and not the mere arithmetical sum, but a complex) of organisations,[] [] The word \u201corganisation\u201d is commonly employed in two senses, a broad and a narrow one. In the narrow sense it signifles an individual nucleus of a collective of people with at least a minimum degree of coherent form. In the broad sense it signifies the sum of such nuclei united into a whole. For example, the navy, the army, or the state is at one and the same time a sum of organisations (in the narrow sense of the word) and a variety of social organisation (in the broad sense of the word). The Department of Education is an organisation (in the broad sense of the word) and consists of a number of organisations (in the narrow sense of the word). Similarly, the Party is an organisation, should be an organisation (in the broad sense of the word); at the same time, the Party should consist of a whole number of diversified organisations (in the narrow sense of the word). Therefore, when he spoke of drawing a distinction between the concepts party and organisation, Comrade Axelrod, firstly, did not take account of the difference between the broad and the narrow sense of the word \u201corganisation\u201d, and, secondly, did not observe that he was himself confusing organised and unorganised elements. \u2014Lenindoes that mean that I \u201cconfuse\u201d the concepts party and organisation? Of course not. I thereby express clearly and precisely my wish, my demand, that the Party, as the vanguard of the class, should be as organised as possible, that the Party should admit to its ranks only such elements as allow of at least a minimum of organisation.My opponent, on the contrary, lumps together in the Party organised and unorganised elements, those who lend themselves to direction and those who do not, the advanced and the incorrigibly backward\u2014for the corrigibly backward can join an organisation. This confusion is indeed dangerous. Comrade Axelrod further cited the \u201cstrictly secret and centralised organisations of the past\u201d (Zemlya i Volya[] and Narodnaya Voly[]): around them, he said, \u201cwere grouped a large number of people who did not belong to the organisation but who helped it in one way or another and who were regarded as Party members.... This principle should be even more strictly observed in the Social-Democratic organisation.\u201d Here we come to one of the key points of the matter: is \u201cthis principle\u201d really a Social-Democratic one\u2014this principle which allows people who do not belong to any of the organisations of the Party, but only \u201chelp it in one way or another\u201d, to call themselves Party members? And Plekhanov gave the only possible reply to this question when he said: \u201cAxelrod was wrong in citing the seventies. At that time there was a well-organised and splendidly disciplined centre; around it there were the organisations of various categories, which it had created; and what remained outside these organisations was chaos, anarchy. The component elements of this chaos called themselves Party members, but this harmed rather than benefited the cause. We should not imitate the anarchy of the seventies, but avoid it.\u201d Thus \u201cthis principle\u201d, which Comrade Axelrod wanted to pass off as a Social-Democratic one, is in reality an anarchistic principle. To refute this, one would have to show that control, direction, and discipline are possible outside an organisation, and that conferring the title of Party members on \u201celements of chaos\u201d is necessary. The supporters of Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation did not show, and could not show, either of these things. Comrade Axelrod took as an example \u201ca professor who regards himself as a Social-Democrat and declares himself such\u201d. To complete the thought contained in this example, Comrade Axelrod should have gone on to tell us whether the organised Social-Democrats themselves regard this professor as a Social-Democrat. By failing to raise this further question, Comrade Axelrod abandoned his argument half-way. After all, one thing or the other. Either the organised Social-Democrats regard the professor in question as a Social-Democrat, in which case why should they not enrol him in one of the Social-Democratic organisations? For only if the professor is thus enrolled will his \u201cdeclaration\u201d answer to his actions, and not be empty talk (as professorial declarations all too frequently are). Or the organised Social Democrats do not regard the professor as a Social-Democrat, in which case it would be absurd, senseless and harmful to allow him the right to bear the honourable and responsible title of Party member. The matter therefore reduces itself to the alternative: consistent application of the principle of organisation, or the sanctification of disunity and anarchy? Are we to build the Party on the basis of that already formed and welded core of Social-Democrats which brought about the Party Congress, for instance, and which should enlarge and multiply Party organisations of all kinds; or are we to content ourselves with the soothing phrase that all who help are Party members? \u201cIf we adopt Lenin\u2019s formula,\u201d Comrade Axelrod continued, \u201cwe shall be throwing overboard a section of those who, even if they cannot be directly admitted to an organisation, are nevertheless Party members.\u201d The confusion of concepts of which Comrade Axelrod wanted to accuse me stands out here quite clearly in his own case: he already takes it for granted that all who help are Party members, whereas that is what the whole argument is about and our opponents have still to prove the necessity and value of such an interpretation. What is the meaning of the phrase \u201cthrowing over board\u201d, which at first glance seems so terrible? Even if only members of organisations recognised as Party organisations are regarded as Party members, people who cannot \u201cdirectly\u201d join any Party organisation can still work in an organisation which does not belong to the Party but is associated with it. Consequently, there can be no talk of throwing anyone overboard in the sense of preventing them from working, from taking part in the movement. On the contrary, the stronger our Party organisations, consisting of real Social-Democrats, the less wavering and instability there is within the Party, the broader, more varied, richer, and more fruitful will be the Party\u2019s influence on the elements of the working-class masses surrounding it and guided by it. The Party, as the vanguard of the working class, must not be confused, after all, with the entire class. And Comrade Axelrod is guilty of just this confusion (which is characteristic of our opportunist Economism in general) when he says: \u201cFirst and foremost we are, of course, creating an organisation of the most active elements of the Party, an organisation of revolutionaries; but since we are the Party of a class, we must take care not to leave outside the Party ranks people who consciously, though perhaps not very actively, associate themselves with that Party.\u201d Firstly, the active elements of the Social-Democratic working-class party will include not only organisations of revolutionaries, but a whole number of workers\u2019 organisations recognised as Party organisations. Secondly, how, by what logic, does the fact that we are the party of a class warrant the conclusion that it is unnecessary to make a distinction between those who belong to the Party and those who associate themselves with it? Just the contrary: precisely because there are differences in degree of consciousness and degree of activity, a distinction must be made in degree of proximity to the Party. We are the party of a class, and therefore almost the entire class (and in times of war, in a period of civil war, the entire class) should act under the leadership of our Party, should adhere to our Party as closely as possible. But it would be Manilovism[] and \u201ctail-ism\u201d to think that the entire class, or almost the entire class, can ever rise, under capitalism, to the level of consciousness and activity of its vanguard, of its Social-Democratic Party. No sensible Social-Democrat has ever doubted that under capitalism even the trade union organisations (which are more primitive and more comprehensible to the undeveloped sections) are incapable of embracing the entire, or almost the entire, working class. To forget the distinction between the vanguard and the whole of the masses gravitating towards it, to forget the vanguard\u2019s constant duty of raising ever wider sections to its own advanced level, means simply to deceive oneself, to shut one\u2019s eyes to the immensity of our tasks, and to narrow down these tasks. And it is just such a shutting of one\u2019s eyes, it is just such forgetfulness, to obliterate the difference between those who associate themselves and those who belong, those who are conscious and active and those who only help.\n\nTo argue that we are the party of a class in justification of organisational looseness, in justification of confusing organisation with disorganisation, is to repeat the mistake of Nadezhdin, who confused \u201cthe philosophical and social historical question of the \u2019depth\u2019 of the \u2019roots\u2019 of the movement with the technical and organisational question\u201d (What Is To Be Done?, p. ).[] It is this confusion, wrought by the deft hand of Comrade Axelrod, that was then repeated dozens of times by the speakers who defended Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation. \u201cThe more widespread the title of Party member, the better,\u201d said Martov, without, however, explaining the benefit of a widespread title which did not correspond to fact. Can it be denied that control over Party members who do not belong to a Party organisation is a mere fiction? A widespread fiction is not beneficial, but harmful. \u201cWe could only rejoice if every striker, every demonstrator, answering for his actions, could proclaim himself a Party member\u201d (p. ). Is that so? Every striker should have the right to proclaim himself a Party member? In this statement Comrade Martov instantly carries his mistake to the point of absurdity, by lowering Social-Democracy to the level of mere strike-making, thereby repeating the misadventures of the Akimovs. We could only rejoice if the Social-Democrats succeeded in directing every strike, for it is their plain and unquestionable duty to direct every manifestation of the class struggle of the proletariat, and strikes are one of the most profound and most powerful manifestations of that struggle. But we should be tail-enders if we were to identify this primary form of struggle, which ipso facto is no more than a trade unionist form, with the all-round and conscious Social Democratic struggle. We should be opportunistically legitimising a patent falsehood if we were to allow every striker the right to \u201cproclaim himself a Party member\u201d, for in the majority of cases such a \u201cproclamation\u201d would be false. We should be indulging in complacent daydreaming if we tried to assure ourselves and others that every striker can be a Social-Democrat and a member of the Social-Democratic Party, in face of that infinite disunity, oppression, and stultification which under capitalism is bound to weigh down upon such very wide sections of the \u201cuntrained\u201d, unskilled workers. This example of the \"striker \" brings out with particular clarity the difference between the revolutionary striving to direct every strike in a Social-Democratic way and the opportunist phrase-mongering which proclaims every striker a Party member. We are the Party of a class inasmuch as we in fact direct almost the entire, or even the entire, proletarian class in a Social-Democratic way; but only Akimovs can conclude from this that we must in word identify the Party and the class.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid of a conspiratorial organisation,\u201d said Comrade Martov in this same speech; but, he added, \u201cfor me a conspiratorial organisation has meaning only when it is enveloped by a broad Social-Democratic working-class party\u201d (p. ). To be exact he should have said: when it is enveloped by a broad Social-Democratic working-class movement. And in that form Comrade Martov\u2019s proposition would have been not only indisputable, but a plain truism. I dwell on this point only because subsequent speakers turned Comrade Martov\u2019s truism into the very prevalent and very vulgar argument that Lenin wants \u201cto confine the sum-total of Party members to the sum-total of conspirators\u201d. This conclusion, which can only provoke a smile, was drawn both by Comrade Posadovsky and by Comrade Popov; and when it was taken up by Martynov and Akimov, its true character of an opportunist phrase became altogether manifest. Today Comrade Axelrod is developing this same argument in the new Iskra by way of acquainting the reading public with the new editorial board\u2019s new views on organisation. Already at the Congress, at the very first sitting where Paragraph  was discussed, I noticed that our opponents wanted to avail themselves of this cheap weapon, and therefore warned in my speech (p. ): \u201cIt should not be imagined that Party organisations must consist solely of professional revolutionaries. We need the most diverse organisations of all types, ranks, and shades, beginning with extremely limited and secret and ending with very broad, free, lose Organisationen.\u201d This is such an obvious and self-evident truth that I did not think it necessary to dwell on it. But today, when we have been dragged back in so many respects, one has to \u201crepeat old lessons\u201d on this subject too. In order to do so, I shall quote certain passages from What Is To Be Done? and A Letter to a Comrade.\n\n\u201c. . . A circle of leaders of the type of Alexeyev and Myshkin, of Khalturin and Zhelyabov, is capable of coping with political tasks in the genuine and most practical sense of the term, for the reason and to the extent that their impassioned propaganda meets with response among the spontaneously awakening masses, and their sparkling energy is answered and supported by the energy of the revolutionary class.\u201d[] In order to be a Social-Democratic party, we must win the support precisely of the class. It is not that the Party should envelop the conspiratorial organisation, as Comrade Martov thought, but that the revolutionary class, the proletariat, should envelop the Party, the latter to include both conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial organisations.\n\n\u201c. . . The workers\u2019 organisations for the economic struggle should be trade union organisations. Every Social-Democratic worker should as far as possible assist and actively work in these organisations. But . . . it is certainly not in our interest to demand that only Social-Democrats should be eligible for membership in the trade unions since that would only narrow the scope of our influence upon the masses. Let every worker who understands the need to unite for the, struggle against the employers and the government join the trade unions. The very aim of the trade unions would be impossible of achievement if they did not unite all who have attained at least this elementary degree of understanding\u2014if they were not very broad organisations. The broader these organisations, the broader will be our influence over them\u2014an influence due, not only to the \u2019spontaneous\u2019 development of the economic struggle, but to the direct and conscious effort of the socialist trade union members to influence their comrades\u201d (p. ).[] Incidentally, the example of the trade unions is particularly significant for an assessment of the controversial question of Paragraph . That these unions should work \u201cunder the control and direction\u201d of the Social-Democratic organisations, of that there can be no two opinions among Social-Democrats. But on those grounds to confer on all members of trade unions the right to \u201cproclaim themselves\u201d members of the Social-Democratic Party would be an obvious absurdity and would constitute a double danger: on the one hand, of narrowing the dimensions of the trade union movement and thus weakening the solidarity of the workers; and, on the other, of opening the door of the Social-Democratic Party to vagueness and vacillation. The German Social-Democrats had occasion to solve a similar problem in a practical instance, in the celebrated case of the Hamburg bricklayers working on piece rates.[] The Social-Democrats did not hesitate for a moment to proclaim strike breaking dishonourable in Social-Democratic eyes, that is, to acknowledge that to direct and support strikes was their own vital concern; but at the same time they just as resolutely rejected the demand for identifying the interests of the Party with the interests of the trade unions, for making the Party responsible for individual acts of individual trade unions. The Party should and will strive to imbue the trade unions with its spirit and bring them under its influence; but precisely in order to do so it must distinguish the fully Social-Democratic elements in these unions (the elements belonging to the Social-Democratic Party) from those which are not fully class-conscious and politically active, and not confuse the two, as Comrade Axelrod would have us do.\n\n\u201c... Centralisation of the most secret functions in an organisation of revolutionaries will not diminish, but rather increase the extent and enhance the quality of the activity of a large number of other organisations that are intended for a broad public and are therefore as loose and as non-secret as possible, such as workers\u2019 trade unions; workers\u2019 self-education circles and circles for reading illegal literature; and socialist, as well as democratic, circles among all other sections of the population; etc., etc. We must have such circles, trade unions, and organisations everywhere in as large a number as possible and with the widest variety of functions; but it would be absurd and harmful to confound them with the organisation of revolutionaries, to efface the border-line between them . . .\u201d (p. ).[] This quotation shows how out of place it was for Comrade Martov to remind me that the organisation of revolutionaries should be enveloped by broad organisations of workers. I had already pointed this out inWhat Is To Be Done?\u2014and inA Letter to a Comrade I developed this idea more concretely. Factory circles, I wrote there, \u201care particularly important to us: the main strength of the movement lies in the organisation of the workers at the large factories, for the large factories (and mills) contain not only the predominant part of the working class, as regards numbers, but even more as regards influence, development, and fighting capacity. Every factory must be our fortress.... The factory subcommittee should endeavour to embrace the whole factory, the largest possible number of the workers, with a network of all kinds of circles (or agents).... All groups, circles, subcommittees, etc., should enjoy the status of committee institutions or branches of a committee. Some of them will openly declare their wish to join the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and, if endorsed by the committee, will join the Party, and will assume definite functions (on the instructions of, or in agreement with, the committee), will undertake to obey the orders of the Party organs, receive the same rights as all Party members, and be regarded as immediate candidates for membership of the committee, etc. Others will not join the R.S.D.L.P., and will have the status of circles formed by Party members, or associated with one Party group or another, etc.\u201d (pp. -).[] The words I have underlined make it particularly clear that the idea of my formulation of Paragraph  was already fully expressed in A Letter to a Comrade. The conditions for joining the Party are directly indicated there, namely: ) a certain degree of organisation, and ) endorsement by a Party committee. A page later I roughly indicate also what groups and organisations should (or should not) be admitted to the Party, and for what reasons: \u201cThe distributing groups should belong to the R.S.D.L.P. and know a certain number of its members and functionaries. The groups for studying labour conditions and drawing up trade union demands need not necessarily belong to the R.S.D.L.P. Groups of students, officers, or office employees engaged in self-education in conjunction with one or two Party members should in some cases not even be aware that these belong to the Party, etc.\u201d (pp. -).[]\n\nThere you have additional material on the subject of the \u201copen visor\u201d! Whereas the formula of Comrade Martov\u2019s draft does not even touch on relations between the Party and the organisations, I pointed out nearly a year before the Congress that some organisations should belong to the Party, and others not. In A Letter to a Comrade the idea I advocated at the Congress was already clearly outlined. The matter might be put graphically in the following way. Depending on degree of organisation in general and of secrecy of organisation in particular, roughly the following categories may be distinguished: ) organisations of revolutionaries; ) organisations of workers, as broad and as varied as possible (I confine myself to the working class, taking it as self-evident that, under certain conditions, certain elements of other classes will also be included here). These two categories constitute the Party. Further, ) workers\u2019 organisations associated with the Party; ) workers\u2019 organisations not associated with the Party but actually under its control and direction; ) unorganised elements of the working class, who in part also come under the direction of the Social-Democratic Party, at any rate during big manifestations of the class struggle. That, approximately, is how the matter presents itself to me. As Comrade Martov sees it, on the contrary, the border-line of the Party remains absolutely vague, for \u201cevery striker\u201d can \u201cproclaim himself a Party member\u201d. What benefit is there in this looseness? A widespread \u201ctitle\u201d. Its harm is that it introduces a disorganising idea, the confusing of class and party.\n\nIn illustration of the general propositions we have adduced, let us take a cursory glance at the further discussion of Paragraph  at the Congress. Comrade Brouck\u00e8re (to the great glee of Comrade Martov) pronounced in favour of my formulation, but his alliance with me, unlike Comrade Akimov\u2019s with Martov, turned out to be based on a misunderstanding. Comrade Brouck\u00e8re did \u201cnot agree with the Rules as a whole, with their entire spirit\u201d (p. ), and defended my formulation as the basis of the democracy which the supporters of Rabocheye Dyelo desired. Comrade Brouck\u00e8re had not yet risen to the view that in a political struggle it is sometimes necessary to choose the lesser evil; Comrade Brouck\u00e8re did not realise that it was useless to advocate democracy at a Congress like ours. Comrade Akimov was more perspicacious. He put the question quite rightly when he stated that \u201cComrades Martov and Lenin are arguing as to which [formulation] will best achieve their common aim\u201d (p. ); \u201cBrouck\u00e8re and I,\u201d he continued, \u201cwant to choose the one which will least achieve that aim. From this angle I choose Martov\u2019s formulation.\u201d And Comrade Akimov frankly explained that he considered \u201ctheir very aim\u201d (that is, the aim of Plekhanov, Martov, and myself\u2014the creation of a directing organisation of revolutionaries) to be \u201cimpracticable and harmful\u201d; like Comrade Martynov,[] [] Comrade Martynov, it is true, wanted to be different from Comrade Akimov, he wanted to show that conspiratorial did not mean secret, that behind the two different words were two different concepts. What the difference is, neither Comrade Martynov nor Comrade Axelrod, who is now following in his footsteps, ever did explain. Comrade Martynov \u201cacted\u201d as if I had not\u2014for example in What Is To Be Done? (as well as in the Tasks [see present edition, Vol. , pp. -.\u2014Ed.])\u2014resolutely opposed \u201cconfining the political struggle to conspiracy\u201d. Comrade Martynov was anxious to have his hearers forget that the people I had been fighting had not seen any necessity for an organisation of revolutionaries, just as Comrade Akimov did not see it now. \u2014Leninhe advocated the Economist idea that \u201can organisation of revolutionaries\u201d was unnecessary. He was \u201cconfident that in the end the realities of life will force their way into our Party organisation, whether you bar their path with Martov\u2019s formulation or with Lenin\u2019s\u201d. It would not be worth while dwelling on this \u201ctail-ist\u201d conception of the \u201crealities of life\u201d if we did not encounter it in the case of Comrade Martov too. In general, Comrade Martov\u2019s second speech (p. ) is so interesting that it deserves to be examined in detail.\n\nComrade Martov\u2019s first argument: control by the Party organisations over Party members not belonging to them \u201cis practicable, inasmuch as, having assigned a function to someone, the committee will be able to watch over it\u201d (p. ). This thesis is remarkably characteristic, for it \u201cbetrays\u201d, if one may so put it, who needs Martov\u2019s formulation and whom it will serve in actual fact\u2014free-lance intellectuals or workers\u2019 groups and the worker masses. The fact is that there are two possible interpretations of Martov\u2019s formulation: ) that anyone who renders the Party regular personal assistance under the direction of one of its organisations is entitled to \"proclaim himself \" (Comrade Martov\u2019s own words) a Party member; ) that a Party organisation is entitled to regard as a Party member anyone who renders it regular personal assistance under its direction. It is only the first interpretation that really gives \u201cevery striker\u201d the opportunity to call himself a Party member, and accordingly it alone immediately won the hearts of the Liebers, Akimovs, and Martynovs. But this interpretation is manifestly no more than a phrase, because it would apply to the entire working class, and the distinction between Party and class would be obliterated; control over and direction of \u201cevery striker\u201d can only be spoken of \u201csymbolically\u201d. That is why, in his second speech, Comrade Martov at once slipped into the second interpretation (even though, be it said in parenthesis, it was directly rejected by the Congress when it turned down Kostich\u2019s resolution\u2014p. ), namely, that a committee would assign functions and watch over their fulfilment. Such special assignments will never, of course, be made to the mass of the workers, to the thousands of proletarians (of whom Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martynov spoke)\u2014they will frequently be given precisely to those professors whom Comrade Axelrod mentioned, to those high-school students for whom Comrade Lieber and Comrade Popov were so concerned (p. ), and to the revolutionary youth to whom Comrade Axelrod referred in his second speech (p. ). In a word, Comrade Martov\u2019s formula will either remain a dead letter, an empty phrase, or it will be of benefit mainly and almost exclusively to \u201cintellectuals who are thoroughly imbued with bourgeois individualism\u201d and do not wish to join an organisation. In words, Martov\u2019s formulation defends the interests of the broad strata of the proletariat, but in fact it serves the interests of the bourgeois intellectuals, who fight shy of proletarian discipline and organisation. No one will venture to deny that the intelligentsia, as a special stratum of modern capitalist society, is characterised, by and large, precisely by individualism and incapacity for discipline and organisation (cf., for example, Kautsky\u2019s well-known articles on the intelligentsia). This, incidentally, is a feature which unfavourably distinguishes this social stratum from the proletariat; it is one of the reasons for the flabbiness and instability of the intellectual, which the proletariat so often feels; and this trait of the intelligentsia is intimately bound up with its customary mode of life, its mode of earning a livelihood, which in a great many respects approximates to the petty-bourgeois mode of existence (working in isolation or in very small groups, etc.). Nor is it fortuitous, lastly, that the defenders of Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation were the ones who had to cite the example of professors and high school students! It was not champions of a broad proletarian struggle who, in the controversy over Paragraph , took the field against champions of a radically conspiratorial organisation, as Comrades Martynov and Axelrod thought, but the supporters of bourgeois-intellectual individualism who clashed with the supporters of proletarian organisation and discipline.\n\nComrade Popov said: \u201cEverywhere, in St. Petersburg as in Nikolayev or Odessa, as the representatives from these towns testify, there are dozens of workers who are distributing literature and carrying on word-of-mouth agitation but who cannot be members of an organisation. They can be attached to an organisation, but not regarded as members\u201d (p. ). Why they cannot be members of an organisation remained Comrade Popov\u2019s secret. I have already quoted the passage from A Letter to a Comrade showing that the admission of all such workers (by the hundred, not the dozen) to an organisation is both possible and necessary, and, more over, that a great many of these organisations can and should belong to the Party.\n\nComrade Martov\u2019s second argument: \u201cIn Lenin\u2019s opinion there should be no organisations in the Party other than Party organisations....\u201d Quite true! \u201cIn my opinion, on the contrary, such organisations should exist. Life creates and breeds organisations faster than we can include them in the hierarchy of our militant organisation of professional revolutionaries....\u201d That is untrue in two respects: ) the number of effective organisations of revolutionaries that \u201clife\u201d breeds is far less than we need, than the working-class movement requires; ) our Party should be a hierarchy not only of organisations of revolutionaries, but of a mass of workers\u2019 organisations as well.... \"Lenin thinks that the Central Committee will confer the title of Party organisations only on such as are fully reliable in the matter of principles. But Comrade Brouck\u00e8re understands very well that life [sic!] will assert itself and that the Central Committee, in order not to leave a multitude of organisations outside the Party, will have to legitimise them despite their not quite reliable character; that is why Comrade Brouck\u00e8re associates himself with Lenin....\" What a truly tail-ist conception of \u201clife\u201d! Of course, if the Central Committee had necessarily to consist of people who were not guided by their own opinions, but by what others might say (vide the Organising Committee incident), then \u201clife\u201d would \u201cassert itself\u201d in the sense that the most backward elements in the Party would gain the upper hand (as has in fact happened now when the backward elements have taken shape as the Party \u201cminority\u201d ). But no intelligent reason can be given which would induce a sensible Central Committee to admit \u201cunreliable\u201d elements to the Party. By this reference to \u201clife\u201d, which \u201cbreeds\u201d unreliable elements, Comrade Martov patently revealed the opportunist character of his plan of organisation! . . . \u201cI for my part think,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat if such an organisation [one that is not quite reliable] is prepared to accept the Party programme and Party control, we may admit it to the Party, without thereby making it a Party organisation. I would consider it a great triumph for our Party if, for example, some union of \u2019independents\u2019 were to declare that they accepted the views of Social-Democracy and its programme and were joining the Party; which does not, however, mean that we would include the union in the Party organisation....\u201d Such is the muddle Martov\u2019s formulation leads to: non-Party organisations belonging to the Party! Just imagine his scheme: the Party = ) organisations of revolutionaries, + ) workers\u2019 organisations recognised as Party organisations, + ) workers\u2019 organisations not recognised as Party organisations (consisting principally of \u201cindependents\u201d), + ) individuals performing various functions\u2014professors, high-school students, etc., + ) \u201cevery striker\u201d. Alongside of this remarkable plan one can only put the words of Comrade Lieber: \u201cOur task is not only to organise an organisation [!!]; we can and should organise a party\u201d (p. ). Yes, of course, we can and should do that, but what it requires is not meaningless words about \u201corganising organisations\u201d, but the unequivocal demand that Party members should work to create an organisation in fact. Me who talks about \u201corganising a party\u201d and yet defends using the word party to cover disorganisation and disunity of every kind is just indulging in empty words.\n\n\u201cOur formulation,\u201d Comrade Martov said, \u201cexpresses the desire to have a series of organisations between the organisation of revolutionaries and the masses.\u201d It does not. This truly essential desire is just what Martov\u2019s formulation does not express, for it does not offer an incentive to organise, does not contain a demand for organisation, does not separate organised from unorganised. All it offers is a title,[] [] At the League Congress, Comrade Martov adduced one more argument in support of his formulation an argument that deserves to be laughed at. \u201cWe might point out,\u201d he said, \u201cthat, taken literally Lenin\u2019s formulation excludes the agents of the Central Committee from the Party, for they do not constitute an organisation\u201d (p. ). Even at the League Congress this argument was greeted with laughter, as the minutes record. Comrade Martov supposes that the \u201cdifficulty\u201d he mentions can only be solved by including the Central Committee agents in \u201cthe organisation of the Central Committee\u201d. But that is not the point. The point is, that Comrade Martov\u2019s example saliently demonstrates that he completely fails to understand the idea of Paragraph ; it was a sheer specimen of pedantic criticism that did indeed deserve to be laughed at. Formally speaking, all that would be required would be to form an \u201corganisation of Central Committee agents\u201d pass a resolution to include it in the Party, and the \u201cdifficulty\u201d which caused Comrade Martov so much brain-racking would immediately vanish. The idea of Paragraph  as formulated by me consists in the incentive to organise; it consists in guaranteeing actual control and direction. Essentially, the very question whether the Central Committee agents will belong to the Party is ridiculous, for actual control over them is fully and absolutely guaranteed by the very fact that they have been appointed agents and that they are kept on as agents. Consequently, here there can be no question of any confusion of organised and unorganised (which is the root mistake in Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation). Why Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation is no good is that it allows anyone, any opportunist, any windbag, any \u201cprofessor\u201d, and any \u201chigh-school student\u201d to proclaim himself a Party member. It is in vain for Comrade Martov to try to talk away this Achilles heel of his formulation by examples in which there can be no auestion of people arbitrarily styling or proclaiming themselves members. \u2014Leninand in this connection we cannot but recall Comrade Axelrod\u2019s words: \u201cNo decree can forbid them [circles of revolutionary youth and the like] or individuals to call themselves Social-Democrats [true enough!] and even to regard themselves as part of the Party\u201d\u2014now that is not true at all ! It is impossible and pointless to forbid anyone to call himself a Social-Democrat, for in its direct sense this word only signifies a system of convictions, and not definite organisational relations. But as to forbidding various circles and persons to \u201cregard themselves as part of the Party\u201d, that can and should be done if these circles and persons injure the Party, corrupt or disorganise it. It would be absurd to speak of the Party as of a whole, as of a political entity, if it could not \u201cby decree forbid\u201d a circle to \u201cregard itself as part\u201d of the whole! What in that case would be the point of defining the procedure and conditions of expulsion from the Party? Comrade Axelrod reduced Comrade Martov\u2019s fundamental mistake to an obvious absurdity; he even elevated this mistake to an opportunist theory when he added: \u201cAs formulated by Lenin, Paragraph  directly conflicts in principle with the very nature [!!] and aims of the Social-Democratic Party of the proletariat\u201d (p. ). This means nothing less than that making higher demands of the Party than of the class conflicts in principle with the very nature of the aims of the proletariat. It is not surprising that Akimov was heart and soul in favour of such a theory.\n\nIt should be said in fairness that Comrade Axelrod\u2014who now wants to convert this mistaken formulation, one obviously tending towards opportunism, into the germ of new views\u2014at the Congress, on the contrary, expressed a readiness to \u201cbargain\u201d, saying: \u201cBut I observe that I am knocking at an open door\u201d (I observe this in the new Iskra too), \u201cbecause Comrade Lenin, with his peripheral circles which are to be regarded as part of the Party organisation, goes out to meet my demand.\u201d (And not only with the peripheral circles, but with every kind of workers\u2019 union: cf. p.  of the Minutes, the speech of Comrade Strakhov, and the passages from What Is To Be Done? and A Letter to a Comrade quoted above.) \u201cThere still remain the individuals, but here, too, we could bargain.\u201d I replied to Comrade Axelrod that, generally speaking, I was not averse to bargaining, and I must now explain in what sense this was meant. As regards the individuals\u2014all those professors, high-school students, etc.\u2014I would least of all have agreed to make concessions; but if doubts had been aroused as to the workers\u2019 organisations, I would have agreed (despite the utter groundlessness of such doubts, as I have proved above) to add to my Paragraph  a note to the following effect: \u201cWorkers\u2019 organisations which accept the Programme and Rules of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party should be included in the largest possible numbers among the Party organisations.\u201d Strictly speaking, of course, the place for such a recommendation is not in the Rules, which should be confined to statutory definitions, but in explanatory commentaries and pamphlets (and I have already pointed out that I gave such explanations in my pamphlets long before the Rules were drawn up); but at least such a note would not contain even a shadow of wrong ideas capable of leading to disorganisation, not a shadow of the opportunist arguments[] [] To this category of arguments, which inevitably crop up when attempts are made to justify Martov\u2019s formulation belongs, in particular, Comrade Trotsky\u2019s statement (pp.  and ) that \u201copportunism is produced by more complex [or: is determined by deeper] causes than one or another clause in the Rules; it is brought about by the relative level of development of bourgeois democracy and the proletariat....\u201d The point is not that clauses in the Rules may produce opportunism, but that with their help a more or a less trenchant weapon against opportunism can be forged. The deeper its causes, the more trenchant should this weapon be. Therefore, to justify a formulation which opens the door to opportunism on the grounds that opportunism has deep causes is tail-ism of the first water. When Comrade Trotsky was opposed to Comrade Lieber, he understood that the Rules constitute the \u201corganised distrust\u201d of the whole towards the part, of the vanguard towards the backward contingent, but when Comrade Trotsky came to be on Comrade Lieber\u2019s side, he forgot this and even began to justify the weakness and instability of our organisation of this distrust (distrust of opportunism) by talking about \u201ccomplex causes\u201d, the \u201clevel of development of the proletariat\u201d, etc. Here is another of Comrade Trotsky\u2019s arguments: \u201cIt is much easier for the intellectual youth, organised in one way or another, to enter themselves [my italics ] on the rolls of the Party.\u201d Just so. That is why it is the formulation by which even unorganised elements may proclaim themselves Party members that suffers from intellectualist vagueness, and not my formulation, which obviates the right to \u201center oneself\u201d on the rolls. Comrade Trotsky said that if the Central Committee \u201crefused to recognise\u201d an organisation of opportunists, it would only be because of the character of certain individuals, and that since these individuals would be known, as political personalities, they would not be dangerous and could be removed by a general Party boycott. This is only true of cases when people have to be removed from the Party (and only half true at that, because an organised party removes members by a vote and not by a boycott). It is absolutely untrue of the far more frequent cases when removal would be absurd, and when all that is required is control. For purposes of control, the Central Committee might, on certain conditions, deliberately admit to the Party an organisation which was not quite reliable but which was capable of working; it might do so with the object of testing it, of trying to direct it on to the right path, of correcting its partial aberrations by guidance etc. This would not be dangerous if in general \u201cself-entering\u201d on the Party rolls were not allowed. It would often be useful for an open and responsible, controlled expression (and discussion) of mistaken views and mistaken tactics. \u201cBut if statutory definitions are to correspond to actual relations, Comrade Lenin\u2019s formulation must be rejected,\u201d said Comrade Trotsky, and again he spoke like an opportunist. Actual relations are not a dead thing, they live and develop. Statutory definitions may correspond to the progressive development of those relations, but they may also (if the definitions are bad ones) \u201ccorrespond\u201d to retrogression or stagnation. The latter case is the \u201ccase\u201d of Comrade Martov. \u2014Leninand \u201canarchistic conceptions\u201d that are undoubtedly inherent in Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation.\n\nThis last expression, given by me in quotation marks, is that of Comrade Pavlovich, who quite justly characterised as anarchism the recognition of \u201cirresponsible and self-enrolled Party members\u201d. \u201cTranslated into simple terms,\u201d said Comrade Pavlovich, explaining my formulation to comrade Lieber, \u201cit means: \u2019if you want to be a Party member, your acceptance of organisational relations too must be not merely platonic\u2019.\u201d Simple as this \u201ctranslation\u201d was, it seems it was not superfluous (as events since the Congress have shown) not only for various dubious professors and high-school students, but for honest-to-goodness Party members, for people at the top.... With no less justice, Comrade Pavlovich pointed to the contradiction between Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation and the indisputable precept of scientific socialism which Comrade Martov quoted so unhappily: \u201cOur Party is the conscious spokesman of an unconscious process.\u201d Exactly. And for that very reason it is wrong to want \u201cevery striker\u201d to have the right to call himself a Party member, for if \u201cevery strike\u201d were not only a spontaneous expression of the powerful class instinct and of the class struggle which is leading inevitably to the social revolution, but a conscious expression of that process, then . . . then the general strike would not be an anarchist phrase, then our Party would forthwith and at once embrace the whole working class, and, consequently, would at once put an end to bourgeois society as a whole. If it is to be a conscious spokesman in fact, the Party must be able to work out organisational relations that will ensure a definite level of consciousness and systematically raise this level. \u201cIf we are to go the way of Martov.\u201d Comrade Pavlovich said, \u201cwe should first of all delete the clause on accepting the programme, for before a programme can be accepted it must be mastered and understood.... Acceptance of the programme presupposes a fairly high level of political consciousness.\u201d We shall never allow support of Social-Democracy, participation in the struggle it directs, to be artificially restricted by any requirements (mastery, understanding, etc.), for this participation itself, the very fact of it, promotes both consciousness and the instinct for organisation; but since we have joined together in a party to carry on systematic work, we must see to it that it is systematic.\n\nThat Comrade Pavlovich\u2019s warning regarding the programme was not superfluous became apparent at once, during that very same sitting. Comrades Akimov and Lieber, who secured the adoption of Comrade Martov\u2019s formulation,[] [] The vote was twenty-eight for and twenty-two against. Of the eight anti-Iskra-ists, seven were for Martov and one for me. Without the aid of the opportunists, Comrade Martov would not have secured adoption of his opportunist formulation. (At the League Congress Comrade Martov tried very unsuccessfully to refute this undoubted fact, for some reason mentioning only the votes of the Bundists and forgetting about Comrade Akimov and his friends\u2014or rather remembering them only when it could serve against me: Comrade Brouck\u00e8re\u2019s agreement with me.) \u2014Leninat once betrayed their true nature by demanding (pp. -) that in the case of the programme too only platonic acceptance, acceptance only of its \u201cbasic principles\u201d, should be required (for \u201cmembership\u201d in the Party). \u201cComrade Akimov\u2019s proposal is quite logical from Comrade Martov\u2019s standpoint,\u201d Comrade Pavlovich remarked. Unfortunately, we cannot see from the minutes how many votes this proposal of Akimov\u2019s secured\u2014in all probability, not less than seven (five Bundists, Akimov, and Brouck\u00e8re). And it was the withdrawal of seven delegates from the Congress that converted the \u201ccompact majority\u201d (anti-Iskra-ists, \u201cCentre\u201d, and Martovites) which began to form over Paragraph  of the Rules into a compact minority! It was the withdrawal of seven delegates that resulted in the defeat of the motion to endorse the old editorial board\u2014that supposed howling violation of \u201ccontinuity\u201d in the Iskra editorship! A curious seven it was that constituted the sole salvation and guarantee of Iskra \u201ccontinuity\u201d: the Bundists, Akimov and Brouck\u00e8re, that is, the very delegates who voted against the motives for adopting Iskra as the Central Organ, the very delegates whose opportunism was acknowledged dozens of times by the Congress, and acknowledged in particular by Martov and Plekhanov in the matter of toning down Paragraph  in reference to the programme. The \u201ccontinuity\u201d of Iskra guarded by the anti-Iskra-ists!\u2014this brings us to the starting-point of the post-Congress tragicomedy.\n\n*     *\n*\nThe grouping of votes over Paragraph  of the Rules revealed a phenomenon of exactly the same type as the equality of languages incident: the falling away of one-quarter (approximately) of the Iskra majority made possible the victory of the anti-Iskra-ists, who were backed by the \u201cCentre\u201d. Of course, here too there were individual votes which disturbed the full symmetry of the picture\u2014in so large an assembly as our Congress there are bound to be some \u201cstrays\u201d who shift quite fortuitously from one side to the other, especially on a question like Paragraph , where the true character of the divergence was only beginning to emerge and many delegates had simply not yet found their bearings (considering that the question had not been discussed before hand in the press). Five votes fell away from the majority Iskra-ists (Rusov and Karsky with two votes each, and Lensky with one); on the other hand, they were joined by one anti-Iskra-ist (Brouck\u00e8re) and by three from the Centre (Medvedev, Egorov and Tsaryov); the result was a total of twenty-three votes ( -  + ), one vote less than in the final grouping in the elections. It was the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists who gave Martov his majority, seven of them voting for him and one for me (of the \u201cCentre\u201d too, seven voted for Martov, and three for me). That coalition of the minority Iskra-ists with the anti-Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d which formed a compact minority at the end of the Congress and after the Congress was beginning to take shape. The political error of Martov and Axelrod, who undoubtedly took a step towards opportunism and anarchistic individualism in their formulation of Paragraph , and especially in their defence of that formulation, was revealed at once and very clearly thanks to the free and open arena offered by the Congress; it was revealed in the fact that the least stable elements, the least steadfast in principle, at once employed all their forces to widen the fissure, the breach, that appeared in the views of the revolutionary Social-Democrats. Working together at the Congress were people who in matters of organisation frankly pursued different aims (see Akimov\u2019s speech)\u2014a circumstance which at once induced those who were in principle opposed to our organisational plan and our Rules to support the error of Comrades Martov and Axelrod. The Iskra-ists who on this question too remained faithful to the views of revolutionary Social-Democracy found themselves in the minority. This is a point of the utmost importance, for unless it is grasped it is absolutely impossible to understand either the struggle over the details of the Rules or the struggle over the personal composition of the Central Organ and the Central Committee.\n\nJ. Innocent Victims of a False Accusation of Opportunism\nBefore passing on to the subsequent discussion of the Rules, it is necessary, in order to elucidate our difference over the personal composition of the central institutions, to touch on the private meetings of the Iskra organisation during the Congress. The last and most important of these four meetings was held just after the vote on Paragraph  of the Rules\u2014and thus the split in the Iskra organisation which took place at this meeting was in point of both time and logic a prelude to the subsequent struggle.\n\nThe Iskra organisation began to hold private meetings[] [] I have already tried at the League Congress to give an account of what took place at the private meetings, keeping to the barest essentials in order to avoid hopeless arguments. The principal facts are also set out in my Letter to the Editors of \u201cIskra\u201d (p. ). Comrade Martov did not challenge them in his Reply. \u2014Leninsoon after the Organising Committee incident, which gave rise to a discussion of possible candidates for the Central Committee. It stands to reason that, since binding instructions had been abolished, these meetings were purely in the nature of consultations and their decisions were not binding on any one; but their importance was nevertheless immense. The, selection of candidates for the Central Committee was a matter of considerable difficulty to delegates who were acquainted neither with the secret names nor with the inner work of the Iskra organisation, the organisation that had brought about actual Party unity and whose leadership of the practical movement was one of the motives for the official adoption of Iskra. We have already seen that, united, the Iskra-ists were fully assured a big majority at the Congress, as much as three-fifths, and all the delegates realised this very well. All the Iskra-ists, in fact, expected the \u201cIskra\u201d organisation to make definite recommendations as to the personal composition of the Central Committee, and not one member of that organisation raised any objection to a preliminary discussion of the Central Committee\u2019s composition within it; not one of them so much as hinted at endorsing the entire membership of the Organising Committee that is converting that body into the Central Committee, or even at conferring with the Organising Committee as a whole regarding candidates for the Central Committee. This circumstance is also highly significant, and it is extremely important to bear it in mind, for now, after the event, the Martovites are zealously defending the Organising Committee, thereby only proving their political spinelessness for the hundredth and thousandth time.[] [] Just reflect on this \u201cpicture of morals\u201d: the delegate from the Iskra organisation confers at the Congress with it alone and does not hint, even, at conferring with the Organising Committee. But after he is defeated both in this organisation and at the Congress, he begins to regret that the Organising Committee way not endorsed, to extol it retrospectively, and loftily to ignore the organisation that gave him his mandate! It may safely be vouched that no analogous instance will be found in the history of any really Social-Democratic and really working-class party. \u2014LeninUntil the split over the composition of the central bodies led Martov to join forces with the Akimovs, everyone at the Congress clearly realised what any impartial person may easily ascertain from the Congress minutes and from the entire history of Iskra, namely, that the Organising Committee was mainly a commission set up to convene the Congress, a commission deliberately composed of representatives of different shades, including even the Bundists; while the real work of creating the organised unity of the Party was done entirely by the Iskra organisation. (It should be remembered also that quite by chance several Iskra-ists on the Organising Committee were absent from the Congress, either because they had been arrested or for other reasons \u201cbeyond their control\u201d.) The members of the Iskra organisation present at the Congress have already been enumerated in Comrade Pavlovich\u2019s pamphlet (see his Letter on the Second Congress, p. ).[]\n\nThe ultimate result of the heated debates in the Iskra organisation was the two votes I have already mentioned in my Letter to the Editors. The first vote: \u201cby nine votes to four, with three abstentions, one of the candidates supported by Martov was rejected.\u201d What could be simpler and more natural, one would think, than such a fact: by the common consent of all the sixteen Iskra organisation members at the Congress, the possible candidates are discussed, and one of Comrade Martov\u2019s candidates is rejected by the majority (it was Comrade Stein, as Comrade Martov himself has now blurted out\u2014State of Siege, p. ). After all, one of the reasons why we assembled at the Party Congress was to discuss and decide to whom to entrust the \u201cconductor\u2019s baton\u201d\u2014and it was the common duty of us all as Party members to give this item on the agenda the most serious attention, to decide this question from the standpoint of the interests of the work, and not of \u201cphilistine sentimentality\u201d, as Comrade Rusov quite rightly expressed it later. Of course, in discussing candidates at the Congress, we were bound to touch upon certain personal qualities, were bound to express our approval or disapproval,[] [] Comrade Martov bitterly complained at the League of the vehemence of my disapproval, failing to see that his complaint turned into an argument against himself. Lenin behaved\u2014to use his own expression\u2014frenziedly (League Minutes, p. ). That is so. He banged the door. True. His conduct (at the second or third meeting of the Iskra organisation) aroused the indignation of the members who remained at the meeting. It did. But what follows? Only that my arguments on the substance of the questions in dispute were convincing and were borne out by the course of the Congress. For if, in fact, nine of the sixteen members of the Iskra organisation in the end sided with me, clearly this was so notwithstanding and in spite of my reprehensible vehemence. Hence, had it not been for this \u201cvehemence\u201d, perhaps even more than nine would have sided with me. The more \u201cindignation\u201d my arguments and facts had to overcome, the more convincing they must have been. \u2014Leninespecially at an unofficial and intimate meeting. And I have already pointed out at the League Congress that it is absurd to think that a candidate is \u201cdisgraced\u201d when he is not approved (League Minutes, p. ), absurd to make a \u201cscene\u201d and go into hysterics over what forms part of a Party member\u2019s direct duty to select officials conscientiously and judiciously. And yet this was what put the fat in the fire as far as our minority are concerned, and they began after the Congress to clamour about \u201cdestroying reputations\u201d (League Minutes, p. ) and to assure the broad public in print that Comrade Stein had been the \u201cchief figure\u201d on the former Organising Committee and that he had been groundlessly accused of \u201cdiabolical schemes\u201d (State of Siege, p. ). Is it not hysterics to shout about \u201cdestroying reputations\u201d in connection with the approval or disapproval of candidates? Is it not squabbling when people who have been defeated both at a private meeting of the Iskra organisation and at the official supreme assembly of the Party, the Congress, begin to complain to all and sundry and recommend rejected candidates to the worthy public as \u201cchief figures\u201d, and when they then try to force their candidates upon the Party by causing a split and demanding co-optation? In our musty \u00e9migr\u00e9 atmosphere political concepts have become so confused that Comrade Martov is no longer able to distinguish Party duty from personal and circle allegiance! It is bureaucracy and formalism, we are to believe, to think it proper to discuss and decide upon candidates only at congresses, where delegates assemble primarily for the discussion of important questions of principle, where representatives of the movement assemble who are able to treat the question of personalities impartially, and who are able (and in duty bound) to demand and gather all necessary information about the candidates before casting their decisive votes, and where the assignment of a certain place to arguments over the conductor\u2019s baton is natural and essential. Instead of this bureaucratic and formal view, new usages and customs have now become the thing: we are, after congresses, to talk right and left about the political burial of Ivan Ivanovich or the destroyed reputation of Ivan Nikiforovich; writers are to recommend candidates in pamphlets, the while beating their breasts and hypocritically asserting: \u201cThis is not a circle, it is a party....\u201d Those of the reading public who have a taste for scandal will eagerly savour the sensational news that, on the assurance of Martov himself,[] so-and-so was the chief figure on the Organising Committee. This reading public is far more competent to discuss and decide the question than formalistic institutions like congresses, with their grossly mechanical decisions by majority vote.... Yes, there are still veritable Augean stables of \u00e9migr\u00e9 squabbling for our real Party workers to clean up!\n\nSecond vote of the Iskra organisation: \u201cby ten votes to two, with four abstentions, a list of five [candidates for the Central Committee] was adopted which, on my proposal, included one leader of the non-Iskra-ist elements and one leader of the Iskra-ist minority.\u201d[] This vote is of the utmost importance, for it clearly and irrefutably proves the utter falsity of the fables which were built up later, in the atmosphere of squabbling, to the effect that we wanted to eject the non-Iskra-ists from the Party or set them aside, that what the majority did was to pick candidates from only one half of the Congress and have them elected by that half, etc. All this is sheer falsehood. The vote I have cited shows that we did not exclude the non-Iskra-ists even from the Central Committee, let alone the Party, and that we allowed our opponents a very substantial minority. The whole point is that they wanted to have a majority, and when this modest wish was not gratified, they started a row and refused to be represented on the central bodies at all. That such was the case, Comrade Martov\u2019s assertions at the League notwithstanding, is shown by the following letter which the minority of the Iskra organisation addressed to us, the majority of the Iskra-ists (and the majority at the Congress after the withdrawal of the seven), shortly after the Congress adopted Paragraph  of the Rules (it should be noted that the Iskra organisation meeting I have been speaking of was the last: after it, the organisation actually broke up and each side tried to convince the other Congress delegates that it was in the right).\n\nHere is the text of the letter:\n\n\u201cHaving heard the explanation of delegates Sorokin and Sablina[] regarding the wish of the majority of the editorial board and the Emancipation of Labour group to attend the meeting [on such and such a date],[] and having with the help of these delegates established that at the previous meeting a list of Central Committee candidates was read which was supposed to have come from us, and which was used to misrepresent our whole political position; and bearing in mind also that, firstly, this list was attributed to us without any attempt to ascertain its real origin; that, secondly, this circumstance is undoubtedly connected with the accusation of opportunism openly circulated against the majority of the Iskra editorial board and of the Emancipation of Labour group, and that, thirdly, this accusation is, as is perfectly clear to us, connected with a quite definite plan to change the composition of the \u2019 Iskra\u2019 editorial board\u2014we consider that the explanation given us of the reasons for excluding us from the meeting is unsatisfactory, and that the refusal to admit us to the meeting is proof of not wanting to give us the opportunity to refute the above mentioned false accusations.\n\n\u201cAs to the possibility of our reaching agreement on a joint list of candidates for the Central Committee, we declare that the only list we can accept as the basis for agreement is: Popov, Trotsky, and Glebov. Furthermore, we emphasise that this is a compromise list, since the inclusion of Comrade Glebov is to be viewed only as a concession to the wishes of the majority; for now that the role he has played at the Congress is clear to us, we do not consider Comrade Glebov a person satisfying the requirements that should be made of a candidate for the Central Committee.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we stress that our entering into negotiations regarding the candidates for the Central Committee has no bearing whatever on the question of the composition of the editorial board of the Central Organ, as on this question (the composition of the editorial board) we are not prepared to enter into any negotiations.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Comrades,\n\n\u201cMartov and Starover\u201d\n\nThis letter, which accurately reproduces the frame of mind of the disputing sides and the state of the dispute, takes us at once to the \u201cheart\u201d of the incipient split and reveals its real causes. The minority of the Iskra organisation, having refused to agree with the majority and preferred freedom of agitation at the Congress (to which they were, of course, fully entitled), nevertheless tried to induce the \u201cdelegates\u201d of the majority to admit them to their private meeting! Naturally, this amusing demand only met with a smile and a shrug at our meeting (where the letter was of course read), and the outcry, bordering on hysterics, about \u201cfalse accusations of opportunism\u201d evoked outright laughter. But let us first examine Martov\u2019s and Starover\u2019s bitter complaints point by point.\n\nThe list had been wrongly attributed to them; their political position was being misrepresented.\u2014But, as Martov himself has admitted (League Minutes, p. ), it never occurred to me to doubt the truth of his statement that he was not the author of the list. In general, the authorship of the list has nothing to do with the case, and whether the list was drawn up by some Iskra-ist or by some representative of the \u201cCentre\u201d, etc., is of absolutely no importance. The important thing is that this list, which consisted entirely of members of the present minority, circulated at the Congress, if only as a mere guess or conjecture. Lastly, the most important thing of all is that at the Congress Comrade Martov was obliged to dissociate himself with the utmost vehemence from such a list, a list which he now would be bound to greet with delight. Nothing could more saliently exemplify instability in the evaluation of people and shades than this right-about-face in the course of a couple of months from howling about \u201cdefamatory rumours\u201d to forcing on the Party central body the very candidates who figure in this supposedly defamatory list![]\n\nThis list, Comrade Martov said at the League Congress, \u201cpolitically implied a coalition between us and Yuzhny Rabochy, on the one hand, and the Bund, on the other, a coalition in the sense of a direct agreement\u201d (p. ). That is not true, for, firstly, the Bund would never have entered into an \u201cagreement\u201d about a list which did not include a single Bundist; and, secondly, there was and could have been no question of a direct agreement (which was what Martov thought disgraceful) even with the Yuzhny Rabochy group, let alone the Bund. It was not an agreement but a coalition that was in question; not that Comrade Martov had made a deal, but that he was bound to have the support of those very anti-Iskra-ists and unstable elements whom he had fought during the first half of the Congress and who had seized upon his error over Paragraph  of the Rules. The letter I have quoted proves incontrovertibly that the root of the \u201cgrievance\u201d lay in the open, and moreover false, accusation of opportunism. This \u201caccusation\u201d which put the fat in the fire, and which Comrade Martov now so carefully steers clear of, in spite of my reminder in the Letter to the Editors, was twofold. Firstly, during the discussion of Paragraph  of the Rules Plekhanov bluntly declared that Paragraph  was a question of \u201ckeeping away\u201d from us \u201cevery kind of representative of opportunism\u201d, and that my draft, as a bulwark against their invading the Party, \u201cshould, if only for that reason, receive the votes of all enemies of opportunism\u201d (Congress Minutes, p. ). These vigorous words, even though I softened them down a little (p. ),[] caused a sensation, which was clearly expressed in the speeches of Comrades Rusov (p. ), Trotsky (p. ), and Akimov (p. ). In the \u201clobby\u201d of our \u201cparliament\u201d, Plekhanov\u2019s thesis was keenly commented on and varied in a thousand ways in endless arguments over Paragraph . But instead of defending their case on its merits, our dear comrades assumed a ludicrous air of injury and even went to the length of complaining in writing about a \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d!\n\nTheir narrow circle mentality and astonishing immaturity as Party members, which cannot stand the fresh breeze of open controversy in the presence of all, is here clearly revealed. It is the mentality so familiar to the Russian, as expressed in the old saying: either coats off, or let\u2019s have your hand! These people are so accustomed to the bell-jar seclusion of an intimate and snug little circle that they almost fainted as soon as a person spoke up in a free and open arena on his own responsibility. Accusations of opportunism!\u2014against whom? Against the Emancipation of Labour group, and its majority at that\u2014can you imagine anything more terrible? Either split the Party on account of this ineffaceable insult, or hush up this \u201cdomestic unpleasantness\u201d by restoring the \u201ccontinuity\u201d of the bell-jar\u2014this alternative is already pretty clearly indicated in the letter we are examining. Intellectualist individualism and the circle mentality had come into conflict with the requirement of open speaking before the Party. Can you imagine such an absurdity, such a squabble, such a complaint about \u201cfalse accusations of opportunism\u201d in the German party? There, proletarian organisation and discipline weaned them from such intellectualist flabbiness long ago. Nobody has anything but the profoundest respect for Liebknecht, let us say; but how they would have laughed over there at complaints that he (together with Bebel) was \u201copenly accused of opportunism\u201d at the  Congress, when, on the agrarian question, he found himself in the bad company of the notorious opportunist Vollmar and his friends. Liebknecht\u2019s name is inseparably bound up with the history of the German working-class movement not, of course, because he happened to stray into opportunism on such a comparatively minor and specific question, but in spite of it. And similarly, in spite of all the acrimony of the struggle, the name of Comrade Axelrod, say, inspires respect in every Russian Social-Democrat, and always will; but not because Comrade Axelrod happened to defend an opportunist idea at the Second Congress of our Party, happened to dig out old anarchistic rubbish at the Second Congress of the League, but in spite of it. Only the most hidebound circle mentality, with its logic of \u201ceither coats off, or let\u2019s have your hand\u201d, could give rise to hysterics, squabbles, and a Party split because of a \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism against the majority of the Emancipation of Labour group\u201d.\n\nThe other element of this terrible accusation is intimately connected with the preceding (Comrade Martov tried in vain at the League Congress [p. ] to evade and hush up one side of this incident). It relates in fact to that coalition of the anti-Iskra-ist and wavering elements with Comrade Martov which began to emerge in connection with Paragraph  of the Rules. Naturally, there was no agreement, direct or indirect, between Comrade Martov and the anti-Iskra-ists, nor could there have been, and nobody suspected him of it: it only seemed so to him in his fright. But politically his error was revealed in the fact that people who undoubtedly gravitated towards opportunism began to form around him an ever more solid and \u201ccompact\u201d majority (which has now become a minority only because of the \u201caccidental\u201d withdrawal of seven-delegates). We pointed to this \u201ccoalition\u201d, also openly, of course, immediately after the matter of Paragraph \u2014both at the Congress (see Comrade Pavlovich\u2019s remark already quoted: Congress Minutes, p. ) and in the Iskra organisation (Plekhanov, as I recall, pointed to it in particular). It is literally the same point and the same jibe as was addressed by Clara Zetkin to Bebel and Liebknecht in , when she said: \"Es tut mir in der Seele weh, dass ich dich in der Gesellschaft seh \u2019\" (\u201cIt cuts me to the quick to see you [i.e., Bebel] in such company [i.e., of Vollmar and Co.]\u201d). It is strange, to be sure, that Bebel and Liebknecht did not send a hysterical message to Kautsky and Zetkin complaining of a false accusation of opportunism....\n\nAs to the list of candidates for the Central Committee, this letter shows that Comrade Martov was mistaken in declaring at the League that the refusal to come to an agreement with us was not yet final\u2014another example of how unwise it is in a political struggle to attempt to reproduce the spoken word from memory, instead of relying on documents. Actually, the \u201cminority\u201d were so modest as to present the \u201cmajority\u201d with an ultimatum: take two from the \u201cminority\u201d and one (by way of compromise and only as a concession, properly speaking!) from the \u201cmajority\u201d. This is monstrous, but it is a fact. And this fact clearly shows how absurd are the fables now being spread to the effect that the \u201cmajority\u201d picked representatives of only one half of the Congress and got them elected by that one half. Just the opposite: the Martovites offered us one out of three only as a concession, consequently, in the event of our not agreeing to this unique \u201cconcession\u201d, they wanted to get all the seats filled by their own candidates! At our private meeting we had a good laugh at the Martovites\u2019 modesty and drew up a list of our own: Glebov-Travinsky (subsequently elected to the Central Committee)-Popov. For the latter we then substituted (also at a private meeting of the twenty-four) Comrade Vasilyev (subsequently elected to the Central Committee) only because Comrade Popov refused, first in private conversation and then openly at the Congress (p. ), to be included in our list.\n\nThat is how matters really stood.\n\nThe modest \u201cminority\u201d modestly wished to be in the majority. When this modest wish was not met, the \u201cminority\u201d were pleased to decline altogether and to start a row. Yet there are people who now talk pontifically about the \u201cintransigence\u201d of the \u201cmajority\u201d!\n\nEntering the fray in the arena of free agitation at the Congress, the \u201cminority\u201d presented the \u201cmajority\u201d with amusing ultimatums. Having suffered defeat, our heroes burst into tears and began to cry out about a state of siege. Voil\u00e0 tout.\n\nThe terrible accusation that we intended to change the composition of the editorial board was also greeted with a smile (at our private meeting of the twenty-four): from the very beginning of the Congress, and even before the Congress, everybody had known perfectly well of the plan to reconstitute the editorial board by electing an initial trio (I shall speak of this in greater detail when I come to the election of the editorial board at the Congress). That the \u201cminority\u201d took fright at this plan after they saw its correctness splendidly confirmed by their coalition with the anti-Iskra-ists did not surprise us\u2014it was quite natural. Of course, we could not take seriously the proposal that we should of our own free will, without a fight at the Congress, convert ourselves into a minority; nor could we take seriously this whole letter, the authors of which had reached such an incredible state of exasperation as to speak of \u201cfalse accusations of opportunism\u201d. We confidently hoped that their sense of Party duty would very soon get the better of the natural desire to \u201cvent their spleen\u201d.\n\nK. Continuation of the Debate on the Rules. Composition of the Council.\nThe succeeding clauses of the Rules aroused far more controversy over details than over principles of organisation. The th sitting of the Congress was entirely devoted to the question of representation at Party congresses, and again a decided and definite struggle against the common plans of all the Iskra-ists was waged only by the Bundists (Goldblatt and Lieber, pp. -) and Comrade Akimov, who with praiseworthy frankness admitted his role at the Congress: \u201cEvery time I speak, I do so fully realising that my arguments will not influence the comrades, but will on the contrary damage the point I am trying to defend\u201d (p. ). Coming just after Paragraph  of the Rules, this apt remark was particularly appropriate; only the words \u201con the contrary\u201d were not quite in order here, for Comrade Akimov was able not only to damage various points, but at the same time, and by so doing, to \u201cinfluence the comrades\u201d . . . those very inconsistent Iskra-ists who inclined towards opportunist phrase-mongering.\n\nWell, in the upshot Paragraph  of the Rules, which defines the conditions of representation at congresses, was adopted by a majority with seven abstentions (p. )\u2014anti-Iskra-ists, evidently.\n\nThe arguments over the composition of the Council, which took up the greater part of the th Congress sitting, revealed an extraordinary number of groupings around a multitude of proposals. Abramson and Tsaryov rejected the plan for a Council altogether. Panin insisted on making the Council a court of arbitration exclusively, and therefore quite consistently moved to delete the definition that the Council is the supreme institution and that it may be summoned by any two of its members.[] [] Apparently, Comrade Starover also inclined to the view of Comrade Panin, only with the difference that the latter knew what he wanted and quite consistently moved resolutions aimed at converting the Council into a pure arbitration or conciliation body, whereas Comrade Starover did not know what he wanted when he said that according to the draft the Council could meet \u201conly on the wish of the parties\u201d (p. ). That was quite incorrect. \u2014LeninHertz[] and Rusov advocated differing methods of constituting the Council, in addition to the three methods proposed by the five members of the Rules Committee.\n\nThe questions in dispute reduced themselves primarily to definition of the Council\u2019s functions: whether it was to be a court of arbitration or the supreme institution of the Party. Comrade Panin, as I have said, was consistently in favour of the former. But he stood alone. Comrade Martov vigorously opposed this: \u201cI propose that the motion to delete the words, \u2019the Council is the supreme institution\u2019, be rejected. Our formulation [i. e., the formulation of the Council\u2019s functions that we had agreed on in the Rules Committee] deliberately leaves open the possibility of the Council developing into the supreme Party institution. For us, the Council is not merely a conciliation board.\u201d Yet the composition of the Council as proposed by Comrade Martov was solely and exclusively that of a \u201cconciliation board\u201d or court of arbitration: two members from each of the central bodies and a fifth to be invited by these four. Not only such a composition of the Council, but even that adopted by the Congress on the motion of Comrades Rusov and Hertz (the fifth member to be appointed by the Congress), answers the sole purpose of conciliation or mediation. Between such a composition of the Council and its mission of becoming the supreme Party institution there is an irreconcilable contradiction. The composition of the supreme Party institution should be constant, and not dependent on chance changes (sometimes owing to arrests) in the composition of the central bodies. The supreme institution should stand in direct relation to the Party Congress, receiving its powers from the latter, and not from two other Party institutions subordinate to the Congress. The supreme institution should consist of persons known to the Party Congress. Lastly, the supreme institution should not be organised in a way that makes its very existence dependent on chance\u2014the two bodies fail to agree on the selection of the fifth member, and the Party is left without a supreme institution! To this it was objected: ) that if one of the five were to abstain and the remaining four were to divide equally, the position might also prove a hopeless one (Egorov). This objection is unfounded, for the impossibility of adopting a decision is something that is inevitable at times in the case of any body, but that is quite different from the impossibility of forming the body. Second objection: \u201cif an institution like the Council proves incapable of selecting the fifth member, it will mean that it is ineffectual in general\u201d (Zasulich). But the point here is not that it will be ineffectual, but that there will be no supreme institution at all: without the fifth member, there will be no Council, there will be no \"institution \", and the question of whether it is effectual or not will not even arise. Lastly, if the trouble were that it might not be possible to form some Party body over which stood another, higher, body, that would be remediable, for in urgent cases the higher body could fill the gap in one way or another. But there is no body above the Council except the Congress, and therefore to frame the Rules in such a way that it might not even be possible to form the Council would obviously be illogical.\n\nBoth my brief speeches at the Congress on this question were devoted to an examination (pp.  and ) only of these two wrong objections which Martov and other comrades adduced in defence of his proposal. As to the question of the Central Organ or the Central Committee predominating on the Council, I did not even touch on it. This question was brought up, as early as the th sitting of the Congress (p. ), by Comrade Akimov, he being the first to talk of the danger of the Central Organ predominating; and Comrades Martov, Axelrod, and others, after the Congress, were only following in Akimov\u2019s footsteps when they invented the absurd and demagogic story that the \u201cmajority\u201d wanted to convert the Central Committee into a tool of the editorial board. When he dealt with this question in his State of Siege, Comrade Martov modestly avoided mentioning its real initiator!\n\nAnybody who cares to acquaint himself with the entire treatment at the Party Congress of the question of the Central Organ predominating over the Central Committee, and is not content with isolated quotations torn from their context, will easily perceive how Comrade Martov has distorted the matter. It was none other than Comrade Popov who, as early as the th sitting, started a polemic against the views of Comrade Akimov, who wanted \u201cthe \u2019strictest centralisation\u2019 at the top of the Party in order to weaken the influence of the Central Organ\u201d (p. ; my italics), \u201cwhich in fact is the whole meaning of this [Akimov\u2019s] system.\u201d \u201cFar from defending such centralisation,\u201d Comrade Popov added, \u201cI am prepared to combat it with every means in my power, because it is the banner of opportunism.\u201d There you have the root of the famous question of the Central Organ predominating over the Central Committee, and it is not surprising that Comrade Martov is now obliged to pass over the true origin of the question in silence. Even Comrade Popov could not fail to discern the opportunist character of Akimov\u2019s talk about the predominance of the Central Organ,[] [] Neither Comrade Popov nor Comrade Martov hesitated to call Comrade Akimov an opportunist, they only began to take exception and grow indignant when this appellation was applied to them, and applied justly, in connection with \u201cequality of languages\u201d or Paragraph . Comrade Akimov, in whose footsteps Comrade Martov has followed, was however able to conduct himself with greater dignity and manhood at the Party Congress than Comrade Martov and Co. at the League Congress. \u201cI have been called an opportunist here,\u201d said Comrade Akimov at the Party Congress. \u201cI personally consider this an abusive and offensive term and believe that I have done nothing to deserve it. However, I am not protesting\u201d (p. ). Can it be that Comrades Martov and Starover invited Comrade Akimov to subscribe to their protest against the false accusation of opportunism, but that Comrade Akimov declined? \u2014Leninand in order thoroughly to dissociate himself from Comrade Akimov, Comrade Popov categorically declared: \u201cLet there be three members from the editorial board on this central body [the Council] and two from the Central Committee. That is a secondary question. [My italics.] The important thing is that the leadership, the supreme leadership of the Party, should proceed from one source\u201d (p. ). Comrade Akimov objected: \u201cUnder the draft, the Central Organ is ensured predominance on the Council if only because the composition of the editorial board is constant whereas that of the Central Committee is changeable\u201d (p. )\u2014an argument which only relates to \u201cconstancy\u201d of leadership in matters of principle (which is a normal and desirable thing), and certainly not to \u201cpredominance\u201d in the sense of interference or encroachment on independence. And Comrade Popov, who at that time did not yet belong to a \u201cminority\u201d which masks its dissatisfaction with the composition of the central bodies by spreading tales of the Central Committee\u2019s lack of independence, told Comrade Akimov quite logically: \u201cI propose that it [the Council] be regarded as the directing centre of the Party, in which case it will be entirely unimportant whether there are more representatives on the Council from the Central Organ or from the Central Committee\u201d (pp. -; my italics).\n\nWhen the discussion of the composition of the Council was resumed at the th sitting, Comrade Pavlovich, continuing the old debate, pronounced in favour of the predominance of the Central Organ over the Central Committee \u201cin view of the former\u2019s stability\u201d (p. ). It was stability in matters of principle that he had in mind, and that was how he was understood by Comrade Martov, who, speaking immediately after Comrade Pavlovich, considered it unnecessary to \u201cfix the preponderance of one institution over the other\u201d and pointed to the possibility of one of the Central Committee members residing abroad, \u201cwhereby the stability of the Central Committee in matters of principle would to some extent be preserved\u201d (p. ).Here there is not yet even a trace of the demagogic confusion of stability in matters of principle, and its preservation, with the preservation of the independence and initiative of the Central Committee. At the Congress this confusion, which since the Congress has practically become Comrade Martov\u2019s trump card, was furthered only by Comrade Akimov, who already at that time spoke of the \u201cArakcheyev[] spirit of the Rules\u201d (p. ), and said that \"if three members of the Party Council were to be from the Central Organ, the Central Committee would be converted into a mere tool of the editorial board. [My italics.] Three persons residing abroad would obtain the unrestricted [!!] right to order the work of the entire [!!] Party. Their security would be guaranteed, and their power would therefore be lifelong\" (p. ). It was with this absolutely absurd and demagogic talk, in which ideological leadership is called interference in the work of the entire Party (and which after the Congress provided a cheap slogan for Comrade Axelrod with his talk about \u201ctheocracy\u201d)\u2014it was with this that Comrade Pavlovich again took issue when he stressed that he stood \u201cfor the stability and purity of the principles represented by Iskra. By giving preponderance to the editorial board of the Central Organ I want to fortify these principles\u201d (p. ).\n\nThat is how the celebrated question of the predominance of the Central Organ over the Central Committee really stands. This famous \u201cdifference of principle\u201d on the part of Comrades Axelrod and Martov is nothing but a repetition of the opportunist and demagogic talk of Comrade Akimov, the true character of which was clearly detected even by Comrade Popov, in the days when he had not yet suffered defeat over the composition of the central bodies!\n\n*     *\n*\nTo sum up the question of the composition of the Council: despite Comrade Martov\u2019s attempts in his State of Siege to prove that my statement of the case in the Letter to the Editors is contradictory and incorrect, the minutes of the Congress clearly show that, in comparison with Paragraph , this question was indeed only a detail, and that the assertion in the article \u201cOur Congress\u201d (Iskra, No. ) that we argued \u201calmost exclusively\u201d about the organisation of the Party\u2019s central institutions is a complete distortion. It is a distortion all the more outrageous since the author of the article entirely ignores the controversy over Paragraph . Further, that there was no definite grouping of the Iskra-ists over the composition of the Council is also borne out by the minutes: there were no roll-call votes; Martov differed with Panin; I found common ground with Popov; Egorov and Gusev took up a separate stand, and so on. Finally, my last statement (at the Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad), to the effect that the Martovites\u2019 coalition with the anti-Iskra-ists grew steadily stronger, is also borne out by Comrade Martov\u2019s and Comrade Axelrod\u2019s swing towards Comrade Akimov\u2014now apparent to everyone\u2014on this question as well.\n\nL. Conclusion of the Debate On The Rules. Co-Optation To The Central Bodies. Withdrawal of the Rabocheye Dyelo Delegates\nOf the subsequent debate on the Rules (th sitting of the Congress), only the question of restricting the powers of the Central Committee is worth mentioning, for it throws light on the character of the attacks the Martovites are now making on hypercentralism. Comrades Egorov and Popov strove for the restriction of centralism with rather more conviction, irrespective of their own candidature or that of those they supported. When the question was still in the Rules Commission, they moved that the right of the Central Committee to dissolve local committees be made contingent on the consent of the Council and, in addition, be limited to cases specially enumerated (p. , note ). This was opposed by three members of the Rules Commission (Glebov, Martov, and myself), and at the Congress Comrade Martov upheld our view (p. ) and answered Egorov and Popov by saying that \"the Central Committee would in any case deliberate before deciding on so serious a step as the dissolution of an organisation\". As you see, at that time Comrade Martov still turned a deaf ear to every anti-centralist scheme, and the Congress rejected the proposal of Egorov and Popov\u2014only unfortunately the minutes do not tell us by how many votes.\n\nAt the Party Congress, Comrade Martov was also \"against substituting the word \u2019endorses\u2019 for the word \u2019organises\u2019 [the Central Committee organises committees, etc.\u2014Paragraph  of the Party Rules]. It must be given the right to organise as well.\" That is what Comrade Martov said then, not having yet hit on the wonderful idea that the concept \"organise\" does not include endorsement, which he discovered only at the League Congress.\n\nApart from these two points, the debate over Paragraphs - of the Rules (Minutes, pp. -) is hardly of any interest, being confined to quite minor arguments over details. Then came Paragraph \u2014the question of co-optation to all Party bodies in general and to the central bodies in particular. The commission proposed raising the majority required for co-optation from two-thirds to four-fifths. Glebov, who presented its report, moved that decisions to co-opt to the Central Committee must be unanimous. Comrade Egorov, while acknowledging dissonances undesirable, stood for a simple majority in the absence of a reasoned veto. Comrade Popov agreed neither with the commission nor with Comrade Egorov and demanded either a simple majority (without the right of veto) or unanimity. Comrade Martov agreed neither with the commission, nor with Glebov, nor with Egorov, nor with Popov, declaring against unanimity, against four-fifths (in favour of two-thirds), and against \"mutual co-optation \", that is, the right of the editorial board of the Central Organ to protest a co-optation to the Central Committee and vice versa (\"the right of mutual control over co-optation\").\n\nAs the reader sees, the groupings were highly variegated and the differences so numerous as almost to lend \"uniqueness\" to the views of each delegate!\n\nComrade Martov said: \"I admit the psychological impossibility of working with unpleasant persons. But it is also important for our organisation to be virile and effectual.... The right of the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ to mutual control in cases of co-optation is unnecessary. It is not because I think that one is not competent in the sphere of the other that I am against it. No! The editorial board of the Central Organ, for instance, might give the Central Committee sound advice as to whether Mr. Nadezhdin, say, should be admitted to the Central Committee. I object because I do not want to create mutually exasperating red tape.\"\n\nI objected: \"There are two questions here. The first is that of the required majority, and I am against lowering it from four-fifths to two-thirds. The stipulation for a reasoned protest is not expedient, and I am against it. Incomparably more important is the second question, the right of the Central Committee and the Central Organ to mutual control over co-optation. The mutual consent of the two central bodies is an essential condition for harmony. What is involved here is a possible rupture between the two central bodies. Whoever does not want a split should be concerned to safeguard harmony. We know from the history of the Party that there have been people who caused splits. It is a question of principle, a very important question, one on which the whole future of the Party may depend\" (pp. -). That is the full text of the summary of my speech as recorded at the Congress, a speech to which Comrade Martov attaches particularly serious importance. Unfortunately, although attaching serious importance to it, he did not take the trouble to consider it in connection with the whole debate and the whole political situation at the Congress at the moment it was made.\n\nThe first question that arises is why, in my original draft (see p. , Paragraph ),[] I stipulated a majority of only two-thirds and did not demand mutual control over co optation to the central bodies. Comrade Trotsky, who spoke after me (p. ), did in fact at once raise this question.\n\nThe answer to it is given in my speech at the League Congress and in Comrade Pavlovich\u2019s letter on the Second Congress. Paragraph  of the Rules \"broke the pot\" and it had to be bound tight with a \"double knot\"\u2014I said at the League Congress. That meant, firstly, that on a purely theoretical question Martov had proved to be an opportunist, and his mistake had been upheld by Lieber and Akimov. It meant, secondly, that the coalition of the Martovites (that is, an insignificant minority of the Iskra-ists) with the anti-Iskra-ists ensured them a majority at the Congress in the voting on the personal composition of the central bodies. And it was about the personal composition of the central bodies that I was speaking here, emphasising the need for harmony and warning against \"people who cause splits\". This warning was indeed of important significance in principle, for the Iskra organisation (which was undoubtedly best qualified to judge about the personal composition of the central bodies, having as it did the closest practical acquaintance with all affairs and with all the candidates) had already made its recommendations on this subject and had taken the decision we know regarding the candidates who aroused its misgivings. Both morally and on its merits (that is, its competence to judge), the Iskra organisation should have had the decisive say in this delicate matter. But formally speaking, of course, Comrade Martov had every right to appeal to the Liebers and Akimovs against the majority of the Iskra organisation. And in his brilliant speech on Paragraph , Comrade Akimov had said with remarkable explicitness and sagacity that whenever he perceived a difference among the Iskra-ists over the methods of achieving their common Iskra aim, he consciously and deliberately voted for the worse method, because his, Akimov\u2019s, aims were diametrically opposed to those of the Iskra-ists. There could not be the slightest doubt therefore that, quite irrespective of the wishes and intentions of Comrade Martov, it was the worse composition of the central bodies that would obtain the support of the Liebers and Akimovs. They could vote, they were bound to vote (judging by their deeds, by their vote on Paragraph , and not by their words) precisely for that list which would promise the presence of \"people who cause splits\", and would do so in order to \"cause splits\". Is it surprising, in view of this situation, that I said that it was an important question of principle (harmony between the two central bodies), one on which the whole future of the Party might depend?\n\nNo Social-Democrat at all acquainted with the Iskra ideas and plans and with the history of the movement, and at all earnest in sharing those ideas, could doubt for a moment that while formally it was quite right and proper for the dispute within the Iskra organisation over the composition of the central bodies to be decided by the Liebers and Akimovs, this would ensure the worst possible results. It was imperative to fight to avert these worst possible results.\n\nHow were we to fight them? We did not fight by hysterics and rows, of course, but by methods which were quite loyal and quite legitimate: perceiving that we were in the minority (as on the question of Paragraph ), we appealed to the Congress to protect the rights of the minority. Greater strictness as regards the majority required for adoption of members (four-fifths instead of two-thirds), the requirement of unanimity for co-optation, mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies\u2014all this we began to advocate when we found ourselves in the minority on the question of the personal composition of the central bodies. This fact is constantly ignored by the Ivans and Peters who are so ready to give opinions on the Congress lightly, after a couple of chats with friends, without seriously studying all the minutes and all the \"testimony\" of the persons concerned. Yet anybody who cares to make a conscientious study of these minutes and this testimony will inevitably encounter the fact I have mentioned, namely, that the root of the dispute at that moment of the Congress was the personal composition of the central bodies, and that we strove for stricter conditions of control just because we were in the minority and wanted \"a double knot to bind tight the pot\" broken by Martov amid the jubilation and with the jubilant assistance of the Liebers and the Akimovs.\n\n\"If it were not so,\" Comrade Pavlovich says, speaking of this moment of the Congress, \"one would have to assume that in moving the point about unanimity in cases of co-optation, we were concerned for the interests of our adversaries; for to the side which predominates in any institution unanimity is unnecessary and even disadvantageous.\" (Letter on the Second Congress, p. .) But today the chronological aspect of the events is all too often forgotten; it is forgotten that there wasa whole period at the Congress when the present minority was the majority (thanks to the participation of the Liebers and Akimovs), and that it was precisely at this period that the controversy over co-optation to the central bodies took place, the underlying reason for which was the difference within the Iskra organisation over the personal composition of the central bodies. Whoever grasps this fact will understand the passion that marked our debates and will not be surprised by the seeming paradox that petty differences over details gave rise to really important issues of principle.\n\nComrade Deutsch, speaking at this same sitting (p. ), was in many respects right when he said: \"This motion is undoubtedly designed for the given moment.\" Yes, indeed, it is only when we have understood the given moment, in all its complexity, that we can understand the true meaning of the controversy. And it is highly important to bear in mind that when we were in the minority, we defended the rights of the minority by such methods as will be acknowledged legitimate and permissible by any European Social-Democrat, namely, by appealing to the Congress for stricter control over the personal composition of the central bodies. Similarly, Comrade Egorov was in many respects right when he said at the Congress, but at a different sitting: \"I am exceedingly surprised to hear reference to principles again being made in the debate. [This was said in reference to the elections to the Central Committee, at the st sitting of the Congress, that is, if I am not mistaken, on Thursday morning, whereas the th sitting, of which we are now speaking, was held on Monday evening.] I think it is clear to everyone that during the last few days the debate has not revolved around any question of principle, but exclusively around securing or preventing the inclusion of one or another person in the central institutions. Let us acknowledge that principles have been lost at this Congress long since, and call a spade a spade. (General laughter. Murauyov: \u2019I request to have it recorded in the minutes that Comrade Martov smiled\u2019)\" (p. ). It is not surprising that Comrade Martov, like the rest of us, laughed at Comrade Egorov\u2019s eomplaints, which were indeed ludicrous. Yes, \"during the last few days \" a very great deal did revolve around the personal composition of the central bodies. That is true. That was indeed clear to everyone at the Congress (and it is only now that the minority is trying to obscure this clear fact). And it is true, lastly, that a spade should be called a spade. But, for God\u2019s sake, where is the \"loss of principles\" here? After all, we assembled at the Congress in order, in the first days (see p.  the Congress agenda), to discuss the programme, tactics, and Rules and to decide the questions relating to them, and the last days (Items  and  of the agenda) to discuss the personal composition of the central bodies and to decide those questions. When the last days of congresses are devoted to a struggle over the conductor\u2019s baton, that is natural and absolutely legitimate. (But when a fight over the conductor\u2019s baton is waged after congresses, that is squabbling.) If someone suffers defeat at the congress over the personal composition of the central bodies (as Comrade Egorov did), it is simply ludicrous of him, after that, to speak of \"loss of principles\". It is therefore understandable why everybody laughed at Comrade Egorov. And it is also understandable why Comrade Muravyov requested to have it recorded in the minutes that Comrade Martov shared in the laughter: in laughing at Comrade Egorov, Comrade Martov was laughing at himself....\n\nIn addition to Comrade Muravyov\u2019s irony, it will not be superfluous, perhaps, to mention the following fact. As we know, after the Congress Comrade Martov asserted right and left that it was the question of co-optation to the central bodies that played the cardinal role in our divergence, and that \"the majority of the old editorial board\" was emphatically opposed to mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies. Before the Congress, when accepting my plan to elect two trios, with mutual co-optation by a two-thirds majority, Comrade Martov wrote to me on the subject: \"In adopting this form of mutual co-optation, it should be stressed that after the Congress additions to each body will be effected on somewhat different lines. (I would advise the following: each body co-opts new members, informing the other body of its intention; the latter may enter a protest, in which case the dispute shall be settled by the Council. To avoid delays, this procedure should be followed in relation to candidates nominated in advance\u2014at least in the case of the Central Committee\u2014from whose number the additions may then be made more expeditiously.) In order to stress that subsequent co-optation will be effected in the manner provided by the Party Rules, the following words should be added to Item :[] \u2019. . . by which the decisions taken must be endorsed\u2019.\" (My italics.)\n\nComment is superfluous.\n\nHaving explained the significance of the moment when the controversy over co-optation to the central bodies took place, we must dwell a little on the votings on the subject\u2014it is unnecessary to dwell on the discussion, as the speeches of Comrade Martov and myself, already quoted, were followed only by brief interchanges in which very few of the delegates took part (see Minutes, pp. -). In relation to the voting, Comrade Martov asserted at the League Congress that in my account of the matter I was guilty of \"the greatest distortion\" (League Minutes, p. ) \"in representing the struggle around the Rules [Comrade Martov unwittingly uttered a profound truth: after Paragraph , the heated disputes were indeed around the Rules] as a struggle of Iskra against the Martovites joined in coalition with the Bund.\"\n\nLet us examine this interesting \"greatest distortion\". Comrade Martov added together the votings on the composition of the Council and the votings on co-optation and listed eight in all: ) election to the Council of two members each from the Central Organ and the Central Committee\u2014 for (M),  against (L),  abstentions.[] (Let me say parenthetically that the number of abstentions is shown in the Minutes\u2014p. \u2014as , but that is a detail.) ) election of the fifth Council member by the Congress\u2014 for (L),  against (M),  abstentions. ) replacement of lapsed Council members by the Council itself\u2014 against (M),  for (L),  abstentions. ) unanimity for co-optation to the Central Committee\u2014 for (L),  against (M),  abstentions. ) the stipulation for one reasoned protest for non-co-optation\u2014 for (L),  against (M),  abstentions. ) unanimity for co-optation to the Central Organ\u2014 for (L),  against (M),  abstentions. ) votability of a motion giving the Council the right to annul a Central Organ or Central Committee decision not to co-opt a new member\u2014 for (M),  against (L),  abstentions. ) this motion itself\u2014 for (M),  against (L),  abstentions. \"Here, evidently, \" Comrade Martov concluded (League Minutes, p. ), \"one Bund delegate voted for the motion while the rest abstained.\" (My italics.)\n\nWhy, may one ask, did Comrade Martov consider it evident that the Bundist had voted for him, Martov, when there were no roll-call votes?\n\nBecause he counted the number of votes cast, and when it indicated that the Bund had taken part in the voting, he, Comrade Martov, did not doubt that it had been on his, Martov\u2019s, side.\n\nWhere, then, is the \"greatest distortion\" on my part?\n\nThe total votes were , without the Bundists , without the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists . In seven of the eight votings mentioned by Comrade Martov, , , , , , , and  delegates took part; in one,  delegates (or rather votes), and here Comrade Martov himself admitted that he was supported by a Bundist. We thus find that the picture sketched by Martov (and sketched incompletely, as we shall soon see) only confirms and strengthens my account of the struggle! We find that in a great many cases the number of abstentions was very high: this points to the slight\u2014relatively slight\u2014interest shown by the Congress as a whole in certain minor points, and to the absence of any definite grouping of the Iskra-ists on these questions. Martov\u2019s statement that the Bundists \"manifestly helped Lenin by abstaining\" (League Minutes, p. ) in fact speaks against Martov: it means that it was only when the Bundists were absent or abstained that I could sometimes count upon victory. But whenever the Bundists thought it worth while to intervene in the struggle, they supported Comrade Martov; and the above-mentioned case when  delegates voted was not the only time they intervened. Whoever cares to refer to the Congress Minutes will notice a very strange incompleteness in Comrade Martov\u2019s picture. Comrade Martov simply omitted three cases when the Bund did take part in the voting, and it goes without saying that in all these cases Comrade Martov was the victor. Here are the three cases: ) adoption of Comrade Fomin\u2019s amendment to lower the required majority from four-fifths to two-thirds\u2014 for,  against (p. ), that is,  votes. ) adoption of Comrade Martov\u2019s motion to delete mutual co-optation\u2014 for,  against (p. ), that is,  votes. Lastly, ) rejection of my motion to permit co-optation to the Central Organ or the Central Committee only with the consent of all members of the Council (p. )\u2014 against,  for (there was even a roll-call vote, of which, unfortunately, there is no record in the minutes), that is,  votes.\n\nTo sum up: on the question of co-optation to the central bodies the Bundists took part in only four votings (the three I have just mentioned, with , , and  votes, and the one mentioned by Comrade Martov, with  votes). In all these votings Comrade Martov was the victor. My statement of the case proves to be right in every particular: in declaring that there was a coalition with the Bund, in noting the relatively minor character of the questions (a large number of abstentions in very many cases), and in pointing to the absence of any definite grouping of the Iskra-ists (no roll-call votes; very few speakers in the debates).\n\nComrade Martov\u2019s attempt to detect a contradiction in my statement of the case turns out to have been made with unsound means, for he tore isolated words from their context and did not trouble to reconstruct the complete picture.\n\nThe last paragraph of the Rules, dealing with the organisation abroad, again gave rise to debates and votings which were highly significant from the point of view of the groupings at the Congress. The question at issue was recognition of the League as the Party organisation abroad. Comrade Akimov, of course, at once rose up in arms, reminding the Congress of the Union Abroad, which had been endorsed by the First Congress, and pointing out that the question was one of principle. \"Let me first make the reservation,\" he said, \"that I do not attach any particular practical significance to which way the question is decided. The ideological struggle which has been going on in our Party is undoubtedly not over yet; but it will be continued on a different plane and with a different alignment of forces.... Paragraph  of the Rules once more reflects, and in a very marked way, the tendency to convert our Congress from a Party congress into a factional congress. Instead of causing all Social-Democrats in Russia to defer to the decisions of the Party Congress in the name of Party unity, by uniting all Party organisations, it is proposed that the Congress should destroy the organisation of the minority and make the minority disappear from the scene\" (p. ). As the reader sees, the \"continuity\" which became so dear to Comrade Martov after his defeat over the composition of the central bodies was no less dear to Comrade Akimov. But at the Congress these people who apply different standards to themselves and to others rose up in heated protest against Comrade Akimov. Although the programme had been adopted, Iskra endorsed, and nearly the entire Rules passed, that \"principle\" which \"in principle\" distinguished the League from the Union was brought to the fore. \"If Comrade Akimov is anxious to make the issue one of principle,\" exclaimed Comrade Martov, \"we have nothing against it; especially since Comrade Akimov has spoken of possible combinations in a struggle with two trends. The victory of one trend must be sanctioned [this, mark, was said at the th sitting of the Congress!] not in the sense that we make another bow to Iskra, but in the sense that we bow a last farewell to all the possible combinations Comrade Akimov spoke of \" (p. ; my italics).\n\nWhat a picture! When all the Congress arguments regarding the programme were already over, Comrade Martov continued to bow a last farewell to all possible combinations . . . until he suffered defeat over the composition of the central bodies! Comrade Martov \"bowed a last farewell\" at the Congress to that possible \"combination\" which he cheerfully brought to fruition on the very morrow of the Congress. But Comrade Akimov proved even then to be much more far-sighted than Comrade Martov; Comrade Akimov referred to the five years\u2019 work of \"an old Party organisation which, by the will of the First Congress, bears the name of a committee\", and concluded with a most venomous and prescient stab: \"As to Comrade Martov\u2019s opinion that my hopes of a new trend appearing in our Party are in vain, let me say that even he himself inspires me with such hopes\" (p. ; my italics).\n\nYes, it must be confessed, Comrade Martov has fully justified Comrade Akimov\u2019s hopes!\n\nComrade Martov became convinced that Comrade Akimov was right, and joined him, after the \"continuity\" had been broken of an old Party body deemed to have been working for three years. Comrade Akimov\u2019s victory did not cost him much effort.\n\nBut at the Congress Comrade Akimov was backed\u2014and backed consistently\u2014only by Comrades Martynov and Brouckere and the Bundists (eight votes). Comrade Egorov, like the real leader of the \"Centre\" that he is, adhered to the golden mean: he agreed with the Iskra-ists, you see, he \"sympathised\" with them (p. ), and proved his sympathy by the proposal (p. ) to avoid the question of principle altogether and say nothing about either the League or the Union. The proposal was rejected by twenty-seven votes to fifteen. Apparently, in addition to the anti-Iskra-ists (eight), nearly the entire \"Centre\" (ten) voted with Comrade Egorov (the total vote was forty-two, so that a large number abstained or were absent, as often happened during votes which were uninteresting or whose result was a foregone conclusion ). Whenever the question arose of carrying out the \"Iskra \" principles in practice, it turned out that the \"sympathy\" of the \"Centre\" was purely verbal, and we secured only thirty votes or a little over. This was to be seen even more graphically in the debate and votes on Rusov\u2019s motion (??) recognise the League as the sole organisation abroad). Here the anti-Iskra-ists and the \"Marsh\" took up an outright position of principle, and its champions, Comrades Lieber and Egorov, declared Comrade Rusov\u2019s motion unvotable, impermissible: \"It slaughters all the other organisations abroad\" (Egorov). And, not desiring to have any part in \"slaughtering organisations\", the speaker not only refused to vote, but even left the hall. But the leader of the \"Centre\" must be given his due: he displayed ten times more political manhood and strength of conviction (in his mistaken principles) than did Comrade Martov and Co., for he stood up for an organisation being \"slaughtered\" not only when that organisation was his own circle, defeated in open combat.\n\nComrade Rusov\u2019s motion was deemed votable by twenty seven votes to fifteen, and was then adopted by twenty five votes to seventeen. If we add to these seventeen the absent Comrade Egorov, we get the full complement (eighteen ) of the anti-\"Iskra\"-ists and the \"Centre\".\n\nAs a whole Paragraph  of the Rules, dealing with the organisation abroad, was adopted by only thirty-one votes to twelve, with six abstentions. This figure, thirty-one\u2014showing the approximate number of Iskra-ists at the Congress, that is, of people who consistently advocated Iskra\u2019s views and applied them in practice\u2014we are now encountering for no less than the sixth time in our analysis of the voting at the Congress (place of the Bund question on the agenda, the Organising Committee incident, the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, and two votes on the agrarian programme). Yet Comrade Martov seriously wants to assure us that there are no grounds for picking out such a \"narrow\" group of Iskra-ists!\n\nNor can we omit to mention that the adoption of Paragraph  of the Rules evoked an extremely characteristic discussion in connection with a statement by Comrades Akimov and Martynov that they \"refused to take part in the voting\" (p. ). The Bureau of the Congress discussed this statement and found\u2014with every reason\u2014that not even the direct closing down of the Union would entitle its delegates to refuse to take part in the Congress proceedings. Refusal to vote is absolutely abnormal and impermissible\u2014such was the view of the Bureau, which was shared by the whole Congress, including the Iskra-ists of the minority, who at the th sitting hotly condemned what they themselves were guilty of at the st! When Comrade Martynov proceeded to defend his statement (p. ), he was opposed alike by Pavlovich, by Trotsky, by Karsky, and by Martov. Comrade Martov was particularly clear on the duties of a dissatisfied minority (until he found himself in the minority!) and held forth on the subject in a very didactic manner. \"Either you are delegates to the Congress,\" he told Comrades Akimov and Martynov, \"in which case you must take part in all its proceedings [my italics; Comrade Martov did not yet perceive any formalism and bureaucracy in subordination of the minority to the majority!]; or you are not delegates, in which case you cannot remain at the sitting.... The statement of the Union delegates compels me to ask two questions: are they members of the Party, and are they delegates to the Congress?\" (P. .)\n\nComrade Martov instructing Comrade Akimov in the duties of a Party member! But it was not without reason that Comrade Akimov had said that he had some hopes in Comrade Martov.... These hopes were to come true, however, only after Martov was defeated in the elections. When the matter did not concern himself, but others, Comrade Martov was deaf even to the terrible catchword \"emergency law\", first launched (if I am not mistaken) by Comrade Martynov. \"The explanation given us,\" Comrade Martynov replied to those who urged him to withdraw his statement, \"has not made it clear whether the decision was one of principle or an emergency measure against the Union. If the latter, we consider that the Union has been insulted. Comrade Egorov got the same impression as we did, namely, that it was an emergency law [my italics] against the Union, and therefore even left the hall\" (p. ). Both Comrade Martov and Comrade Trotsky protested vigorously, along with Plekhanov, against the absurd, truly absurd, idea of regarding a vote of the Congress as an insult; and Comrade Trotsky, defending a resolution adopted by the Congress on his motion (that Comrades Akimov and Martynov could consider that full satisfaction had been given them), declared that \"the resolution is one of principle, not a philistine one, and it is no business of ours if anybody takes offence at it\" (p. ). But it very soon became apparent that the circle mentality and the philistine outlook are still all too strong in our Party, and the proud words I have italicised proved to be merely a high-sounding phrase.\n\nComrades Akimov and Martynov refused to withdraw their statement, and walked out of the Congress, amidst the delegates\u2019 general cry: \"Absolutely unwarranted!\"\n\nM. The Elections. End of the Congress\nAfter adopting the Rules, the Congress passed a resolution on district organisations and a number of resolutions on particular Party organisations, and, following the extremely instructive debate on the Yuzhny Rabochy group which I have analysed above, proceeded to discuss the election of the Party\u2019s central institutions.\n\nWe already know that the Iskra organisation, from which the entire Congress had expected an authoritative recommendation, had split over this question, for the minority of the organisation wanted to test in free and open combat whether it could not win a majority at the Congress. We also know that a plan was known long before the Congress\u2014and to all the delegates at the Congress itself\u2014for reconstituting the editorial board by the election of two trios, one to the Central Organ and one to the Central Committee. Let us dwell on this plan in greater detail in order to throw light on the Congress debate.\n\nHere is the exact text of my commentary to the draft Tagesordnung of the Congress where this plan was set forth:[] \u201cThe Congress shall elect three persons to the editorial board of the Central Organ and three to the Central Committee. These six persons in conjunction shall, if necessary, co-opt by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the editorial board of the Central Organ and to the Central Committee and report to this effect to the Congress. After the report has been endorsed by the Congress, subsequent co-optation shall be effected by the editorial board of the Central Organ and by the Central Committee separately.\u201d\n\nThe plan stands out in this text quite definitely and unambiguously: it implies a reconstitution of the editorial board, effected with the participation of the most influential leaders of the practical work. Both the features of this plan which I have emphasised are apparent at once to anyone who takes the trouble to read the text at all attentively. But nowadays one has to stop and explain the most elementary things. It was precisely a reconstitution of the editorial board that the plan implied\u2014not necessarily an enlargement and not necessarily a reduction of its membership, but its reconstitution; for the question of a possible enlargement or reduction was left open: co-optation was provided for only if necessary. Among the suggestions for such reconstitution made by various people, some provided for a possible reduction of the number of editors, and some for increasing it to seven (I personally had always regarded seven as far preferable to six), and even to eleven (I considered this possible in the event of peaceful union with all Social-Democratic organisations in general and with the Bund and the Polish Social-Democrats in particular). But what is most important, and this is usually overlooked by people talking about the \u201ctrio\u201d, is that the matter of further co-optation to the Central Organ was to be decided with the participation of the members of the Central Committee. Not one comrade of all the \u201cminority\u201d members of the organisation or Congress delegates, who knew of this plan and approved it (either explicitly or tacitly), has taken the trouble to explain the meaning of this point. Firstly, why was a trio, and only a trio, taken as the starting-point for reconstituting the editorial board? Obviously, this would have been absolutely senseless if the sole, or at least the main, purpose had been to enlarge the board, and if that board had really been considered a \u201charmonious\u201d one. If the purpose is to enlarge a \u201charmonious\u201d body, it would be strange to start, not with the whole body, but with only a part. Obviously, not all members of the board were considered quite suitable for discussing and deciding the matter of reconstituting it, of converting the old editorial circle into a Party institution. Obviously, even those who personally desired the reconstitution to be an enlargement recognised that the old composition of the board was not harmonious and did not answer to the ideal of a Party institution, for otherwise there would be no reason first to reduce the six to three in order to enlarge it. I repeat, this is self-evident, and only the temporary confusion of the issue by \u201cpersonalities\u201d could have caused it to be forgotten.\n\nSecondly, it will be seen from the above-quoted text that even the agreement of all three members of the Central Organ would not by itself be enough for the enlargement of the trio. This, too, is always lost sight of. Two-thirds of six, that is, four votes, were to be required for co-optation; hence it would only be necessary for the three members elected to the Central Committee to exercise their veto, and no enlargement of the trio would be possible. Conversely, even if two of the three members of the editorial board of the Central Organ were opposed to further co-optation, it would nevertheless be possible if all three members of the Central Committee were in favour of it. It is thus obvious that the intention was, in converting the old circle into a Party institution, to grant the deciding voice to the Congress-elected leaders of the practical work. Which comrades we roughly had in mind may be seen from the fact that prior to the Congress the editorial board unanimously elected Comrade Pavlovich a seventh member of their body, in case it should be necessary to make a statement at the Congress on behalf of the board; in addition to Comrade Pavlovich, a certain old member of the Iskra organisation and member of the Organising Committee, who was subsequently elected to the Central Committee, was proposed for the seventh place.\n\nThus the plan for the election of two trios was obviously designed: ) to reconstitute the editorial board; ) to rid it of certain elements of the old circle spirit, which is out of place in a Party institution (if there had been nothing to get rid of there would have been no point in the idea of an initial trio!); and, lastly, ) to get rid of the \u201ctheocratic\u201d features of a body of writers (getting rid of them by enlisting the services of prominent practical workers in deciding the question of enlarging the trio). This plan, with which all the editors were acquainted, was, clearly, based on three years\u2019 experience of work and fully accorded with the principles of revolutionary organisation that we were consistently introducing. In the period of disunity in which Iskra entered the arena, groups were often formed haphazardly and spontaneously, and inevitably suffered from certain pernicious manifestations of the circle spirit. The creation of a Party presupposed and demanded the elimination of these features; the participation of prominent practical workers in this elimination was essential, for certain members of the editorial board had always dealt with organisational affairs, and the body to enter the system of Party institutions was to be a body not merely of writers, but of political leaders. It was likewise natural, from the standpoint of the policy Iskra had always pursued, to leave the selection of the initial trio to the Congress: we had observed the greatest caution in preparing for the Congress, waiting until all controversial questions of principle relating to programme, tactics, and organisation had been fully clarified; we had no doubt that the Congress would be an \u201cIskra\u201d-ist one in the sense that its overwhelming majority would be solid on these fundamental questions (this was also indicated in part by the resolutions recognising Iskra as the leading organ); we were bound therefore to leave it to the comrades who had borne the whole brunt of the work of disseminating Iskra\u2019s ideas and preparing for its conversion into a party to decide for themselves who were the most suitable candidates for the new Party institution. It is only by the fact that this plan for \u201ctwo trios\u201d was a natural one, only by the fact that it fully accorded with Iskra\u2019s whole policy and with every thing known about Iskra to people at all closely acquainted with the work, that the general approval of this plan and the absence of any rival plan is to be explained.\n\nAnd so, at the Congress, Comrade Rusov first of all moved the election of two trios. It never even occurred to the followers of Martov, who had informed us in writing that this plan was connected with the false accusation of opportunism, to reduce the dispute over a board of six or three to the question whether this accusation was right or wrong. Not one of them even hinted at it! None of them ventured to say a single word about the differing shades of principle involved in the dispute over six or three. They preferred a commoner and cheaper method, namely, to evoke pity, to speak of possible injured feelings, to pretend that the question of the editorial board had already been settled by appointing Iskra the Central Organ. This last argument, adduced by Comrade Koltsov against Comrade Rusov, was a piece of downright falsity. Two separate items were included\u2014not fortuitously, of course\u2014in the Congress agenda (see Minutes, p. ): Item \u2014\u201cCentral Organ of the Party\u201d, and Item \u2014\u201cElection of the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ\u201d. That in the first place. In the second place, when the Central Organ was being appointed, all the delegates categorically declared that this did not mean the endorsement of the editorial board, but only of the trend,[] [] See Minutes, p. , Akimov\u2019s speech: \u201c. . . I am told that we shall discuss the election of the Central Organ at the end\u201d; Muravyov\u2019s speech against Akimov, \u201cwho takes the question of the future editorial board of the Central Organ very much to heart\u201d (p. ); Pavlovich\u2019s speech to the effect that, having appointed the organ, we had obtained \u201cthe concrete material on which to perform the operations Comrade Akimov is so much concerned about\u201d, and that there could not be a shadow of doubt about Iskra\u2019s \u201csubmitting\u201d to \u201cthe decisions of the Party\u201d (p. ), Trotsky\u2019s speech: \u201cSince we are not endorsing the editorial board, what is it that we are endorsing in Iskra? . . . Not the name, but the trend . . . not the name, but the banner\u201d (p. ), Martynov\u2019s speech: \u201c. . . Like many other comrades, I consider that while discussing the adoption of Iskra, as a newspaper of a definite trend, as our Central Organ, we should not at this juncture discuss the method of electing or endorsing its editorial board, we shall discuss that later in its proper order on the agenda . . . \u201d (p. ). \u2014Leninand not a single protest was raised against these declarations.\n\nThus the statement that by endorsing a definite organ the Congress had in effect endorsed the editorial board\u2014a statement many times reiterated by the adherents of the minority (by Koltsov, p. , by Posadovsky, p. , by Popov, p. , and by many others)\u2014was simply untrue in fact. It was a perfectly obvious manoeuvre to cover a retreat from the position held at the time when the question of the composition of the central bodies could still be regarded in a really dispassionate light by all. The retreat could not be justified either by motives of principle (for to raise the question of the \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d at the Congress was too much to the disadvantage of the minority, and they did not even hint at it), or by a reference to the factual data showing which was actually more effectual\u2014six or three (for the mere mention of these facts would have produced a heap of arguments against the minority). They had to try to burke the issue by talk about a \u201csymmetrical whole\u201d, about a \u201charmonious team\u201d, about a \u201csymmetrical and crystal-integral entity\u201d, and so on. It is not surprising that these arguments were immediately called by their true name: \"wretched words \" (p. ). The very plan for a trio clearly testified to a lack of \u201charmony\u201d, and the impressions obtained by the delegates during a month and more of work ing together obviously afforded a mass of material to enable them to judge for themselves. When Comrade Posadovsky hinted at this material (incautiously and injudiciously from his own standpoint: see pp.  and  regarding the \u201cqualified sense\u201d in which he had used the word \u201cdissonances\u201d), Comrade Muravyov bluntly declared: \"In my opinion it is now quite clear to the majority of the Congress that such [] [] What \u201cdissonances\u201d exactly Comrade Posadovsky had in mind the Congress never did learn. Comrade Muravyov, for his part, stated at this same sitting (p. ) that his meaning had been misrepresented, and when the minutes were being endorsed he plainly declared that he \u201cwas referring to the dissonances which had been revealed in the Congress debates on various points, dissonances over principle, whose existence is now unfortunately a fact that nobody will deny\u201d (p. ). \u2014Lenindissonances undoubtedly do exist\" (p. ). The minority chose to construe the word \u201cdissonances\u201d (which was given currency by Posadovsky, not Muravyov) in a purely personal sense, not daring to take up the gauntlet flung down by Comrade Muravyov, not daring to bring forward in defence of the board of six a single argument on the actual merits of the case. The result was a dispute which for its sterility was more than comic: the majority (through the mouth of Comrade Muravyov) declared that the true significance of the six or three issue was quite clear to them, but the minority persistently refused to listen and affirmed that \u201cwe are not in a position to examine it\u201d. The majority not only considered themselves in a position to examine it, but had \u201cexamined it\u201d already and announced that the results of the examination were quite clear to them, but the minority apparently feared an examination and took cover behind mere \u201cwretched words\u201d. The majority urged us to \u201cbear in mind that our Central Organ is something more than a literary group\u201d; the majority \u201cwanted the Central Organ to be headed by quite definite persons, persons known to the Congress, persons meeting the requirements I have mentioned\u201d (that is, not only literary requirements; Comrade Lange\u2019s speech, p. ). Again the minority did not dare to take up the gauntlet and did not say a word as to who, in their opinion, was suitable for what was more than a literary body, as to who was a figure of a \u201cquite definite\u201d magnitude \u201cknown to the Congress\u201d. The minority continued to take shelter behind their celebrated \u201charmony\u201d. Nor was this all. The minority even introduced into the debate arguments which were absolutely false in principle and which therefore quite rightly evoked a sharp rebuff. \u201cThe Congress,\u201d don\u2019t you see, \u201chas neither the moral nor the political right to refashion the editorial board\u201d (Trotsky, p. ); \u201cit is too delicate [sic!] a question\u201d (Trotsky again); \u201chow will the editors who are not re-elected feel about the fact that the Congress does not want to see them on the board any more?\u201d (Tsaryov, p. .)[]\n\nSuch arguments simply put the whole question on the plane of pity and injured feelings, and were a direct admission of bankruptcy as regards real arguments of principle, real political arguments. And the majority immediately gave this attitude its true name: philistinism (Comrade Rusov). \u201cWe are hearing strange speeches from the lips of revolutionaries,\u201d Comrade Rusov justly remarked, \"speeches that are in marked disharmony with the concepts Party work, Party ethics. The principal argument on which the opponents of electing trios take their stand amounts to a purely philistine view of Party affairs [my italics throughout].... If we adopt this standpoint, which is a philistine and not a Party standpoint, we shall at every election have to consider: will not Petrov be offended if Ivanov is elected and not he, will not some member of the Organising Committee be offended if another member, and not he, is elected to the Central Committee? Where is this going to land us, comrades? If we have gathered here for the purpose of creating a Party, and not of indulging in mutual compliments and philistine sentimentality, then we can never agree to such a view. We are about to elect officials, and there can be no talk of lack of confidence in any person not elected; our only consideration should be the interests of the work and a person\u2019s suitability for the post to which he is being elected \" (p. ).\n\nWe would advise all who want to make an independent examination of the reasons for the Party split and to dig down to the roots of it at the Congress to read this speech of Comrade Rusov\u2019s over and over again; his arguments were not even contested by the minority, let alone refuted. And indeed there is no contesting such elementary, rudimentary truths, which were forgotten only because of \"nervous excitement \", as Comrade Rusov himself rightly explained. And this is really the explanation least discreditable to the minority of how they could desert the Party standpoint for a philistine and circle standpoint.[]\nBut the minority were so totally unable to find sensible and business-like arguments against election that, in addition to introducing philistinism into Party affairs, they resorted to downright scandalous practices. Indeed, what other name can we give to the action of Comrade Popov when he advised Comrade Muravyov \u201cnot to undertake delicate commissions\u201d (p. )? What is this but \u201cgetting personal\u201d, as Comrade Sorokin rightly put it (p. )? What is it but speculating on \u201cpersonalities \u201d, in the absence of political arguments? Was Comrade Sorokin right or wrong when he said that \u201cwe have always protested against such practices\u201d? \u201cWas it permissible for Comrade Deutsch to try demonstratively to pillory comrades who did not agree with him?\u201d[] [] That is the way Comrade Sorokin, at this same sitting, understood Comrade Deutsch\u2019s words (cf. p. \u2014\u201csharp interchange with Orlov\u201d). Comrade Deutsch explained (p. ) that he had \u201csaid nothing like it\u201d, but in thc same breath admitted that he had said something very, very much \u201clike it\u201d. \u201cI did not say \u2019who dares\u2019,\u201d Comrade Deutsch explained; \"what I said was: \u2019I would be interested to see the people who would dare [sic!\u2014Comrade Deutsch fell out of the frying pan into the fire!] to support such a criminal [sic!] proposal as the election of a board of three\u2019\" (p. ). Comrade Deutsch did not refute, but confirmed Comrade Sorokin\u2019s words. Comrade Deutsch only confirmed the truth of Comrade Sorokin\u2019s reproach that \u201call concepts are here muddled\u201d (in the minority\u2019s arguments in favour of six). Comrade Deutsch only confirmed the pertinence of Comrade Sorokin\u2019s reminder of the elementary truth that \u201cwe are Party membors and should be guided exclucively by political considerations\u201d. To cry that election was criminal was to sink not only to philistinism, but to practices that were downright scandalous! \u2014Lenin(P. .)\n\nLet us sum up the debate on the editorial board. The minority did not refute (nor even try to refute) the majority\u2019s numerous statements that the plan for a trio was known to the delegates at the very beginning of the Congress and prior to the Congress, and that, consequently, this plan was based on considerations and facts which had no relation to the events and disputes at the Congress. In defending the board of six, the minority took up a position which was wrong and impermissible in principle, one based on philistine considerations. The minority displayed an utter forgetfulness of the Party attitude towards the election of officials, not even attempting to give an estimation of each candidate for a post and of his suitability or unsuitability for the functions it involved. The minority evaded a discussion of the question on its merits and talked instead of their celebrated harmony, \u201cshedding tears\u201d and \u201cindulging in pathos\u201d (Lange\u2019s speech, p. ), as though \u201csomebody was being murdered\u201d. In their state of \"nervous excitement \" (p. ) the minority even went to the length of \"getting personal \", of howling that election was \u201ccriminal\u201d, and similar impermissible practices.\n\nThe battle over six or three at the th sitting of our Congress was a battle between philistinism and the party spirit, between \"personalities \" of the worst kind and political considerations, between wretched words and the most elementary conception of revolutionary duty.\n\nAnd at the st sitting, when the Congress, by a majority of nineteen to seventeen with three abstentions, had rejected the motion to endorse the old editorial board as a whole (see p.  and the errata), and when the former editors had returned to the hall, Comrade Martov in his \u201cstatement on behalf of the majority of the former editorial board\u201d (pp. -) displayed this same shakiness and instability of political position and political concepts to an even greater degree. Let us examine in detail each point of this collective statement and my reply (pp. -).\n\n\u201cFrom now on,\u201d Comrade Martov said when the old editorial board was not endorsed, \u201cthe old Iskra does not exist, and it would be more consistent to change its name. At any rate, we see in the new resolution of the Congress a substantial limitation of the vote of confidence in Iskra which was passed at one of the first Congress sittings.\u201d\n\nComrade Martov and his colleagues raised a truly interesting and in many respects instructive question of political consistency. I have already replied to this by referring to what everyone said when Iskra was being endorsed (Minutes, p. , cf. above, p. ).[] What we have here is unquestionably a crying instance of political inconsistency, but whether on the part of the majority of the Congress or of the majority of the old editorial board we shall leave the reader to judge. And there are two other questions very pertinently raised by Comrade Martov and his colleagues which we shall likewise leave the reader to decide: ) Did the desire to detect a \u201climitation of the vote of confidence in Iskra\u201d in the Congress decision to elect officials to the editorial board of the Central Organ betray a philistine or aParty attitude? ) When did the old \u201cIskra\u201d really cease to exist\u2014starting from No. , when the two of us, Plekhanov and I, began to conduct it, or from No. , when the majority of the old editorial board took it over? If the first question is a most interesting question of principle, the second is a most interesting question of fact.\n\n\u201cSince it has now been decided,\u201d Comrade Martov continued, \"to elect an editorial board of three, I must declare on my own behalf and that of the three other comrades that none of us will sit on this new editorial board. For myself, I must add that if it be true that certain comrades wanted to include my name in the list of candidates for this \u2019trio\u2019, I must regard it as an insult which I have done nothing to deserve [sic!]. I say this in view of the circumstances under which it has been decided to change the editorial board. This decision was taken on the grounds of some kind of \u2018friction\u2019,[] [] Comrade Martov was probably referring to Comrade Posadovsky\u2019s expression \u201cdissonances\u201d. I repeat that Comrade Posadovsky never did explain to the Congress what he meant, while Comrade Muravyov, who had likewise used the expression, explained that he meant dissonances over principle, as revealed in the Congress debates. The reader will recall that the sole real debate over principles in which four of the editors (Plekhanov, Martov, Axelrod, and I) took part was in connection with Paragraph  of the rules, and that Comrades Martov and Starover complained in writing of a \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d as being one of the arguments for \u201cchanging\u201d the editorial board. In this letter, Comrade Martov had detected a clear connection between \u201copportunism\u201d and the plan to change the editorial board, but at the Congress he confined himself to hinting hazily at \u201csome kind of friction\u201d. The \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d had already been forgotten! \u2014Leninof the former editorial board having been ineffectual; moreover, the Congress decided the matter along definite lines without questioning the editorial board about this friction or even appointing a commission to report whether it had been ineffectual. [Strange that it never occurred to any member of the minority to propose to the Congress to \u201cquestion the editorial board\u201d or appoint a commission! Was it not because it would have been useless after the split in the Iskra organisation and the failure of the negotiations Comrades Martov and Starover wrote about?] Under the circumstances, I must regard the assumption of certain comrades that I would agree to sit on an editorial board reformed in this manner as a slur on my political reputation....\u201d[][] Comrade Martov further added: \u201cRyazanov might agree to such a role, but not the Martov whom, I think, you know by his work.\u201d Inasmuch as this was a personal attack on Ryazanov, Comrade Martov withdrew the remark. But it was not because of Ryazanov\u2019s personal qualities (to refer to them would have been out of place) that his name figured at the Congress as a byword; it was because of the political complexion of the Borba group\u2014its political mistakes. Comrade Martov does well to withdraw real or assumed personal insults, but this should not lead us to forget political mistakes, which should serve as a lesson to the Party. The Borba group was accused at our Congress of causing \u201corganisational chaos\u201d and \u201cdisunity not justifled by any considerations of principle\u201d (Comrade Martov\u2019s speech, p. ). Such political conduct does indeed deserve censure, and not only when seen in a small group prior to the Party Congress, during the period of general chaos, but also when we see it after the Party Congress, in the period when the chaos has been abolished, even if indulged in by \u201cthe majority of the Iskra editorial board and the majority of the Emancipation of Labour group\u201d. \u2014Lenin\nI have purposely quoted this argument in full to acquaint the reader with a specimen and with the beginning of what has blossomed out so profusely since the Congress and which cannot be called by any other name than squabbling. I have already employed this expression in my Letter to the Editors of \u201cIskra\u201d, and in spite of the editors\u2019 annoyance I am obliged to repeat it, for its correctness is beyond dispute. It is a mistake to think that squabbling presupposes \u201csordid motives\u201d (as the editors of the new Iskra conclude): any revolutionary at all acquainted with our colonies of exiles and political \u00e9migr\u00e9s will have witnessed dozens of cases of squabbling in which the most absurd accusations, suspicions, self-accusations, \u201cpersonalities\u201d, etc., were levelled and harped upon owing to \u201cnervous excitement\u201d and abnormal, stagnant conditions of life. No sensible person will necessarily seek for sordid motives in these squabbles, however sordid their manifestations may be. And it is only to \u201cnervous excitement\u201d that we can attribute that tangled skein of absurdities, personalities, fantastic horrors, and imaginary insults and slurs which is contained in the above-quoted passage from Comrade Martov\u2019s speech. Stagnant conditions of life breed such squabbles among us by the hundred, and a political party would be unworthy of respect if it did not have the courage to designate its malady by its true name, to make a ruthless diagnosis and search for a cure.\n\nInsofar as anything relating to principles can be extracted at all from this tangled skein, one is led inevitably to the conclusion that \u201celections have nothing to do with any slurs on political reputations\u201d, that \u201cto deny the right of the Congress to hold new elections, make new appointments of any kind, and change the composition of its authorised boards\u201d is to confuse the issue, and that \u201cComrade Martov\u2019s views on the permissibility of electing part of the old board reflect an extreme confusion of political ideas\u201d (as I expressed it at the Congress, p. ).[]\n\nI shall omit Comrade Martov\u2019s \u201cpersonal\u201d remark as to who initiated the plan for the trio, and shall pass to his \u201cpolitical\u201d characterisation of the significance attaching to the non-endorsement of the old editorial board: \". . What has now taken place is the last act of the struggle which has raged during the second half of the Congress. [Quite right! And this second half of the Congress began when Martov fell into the tight clutches of Comrade Akimov over Paragraph  of the Rules.] It is an open secret that in this reform it is not a question of being \u2019effectual\u2019, but of a struggle for influence on the Central Committee. [Firstly, it is an open secret that it was a question of being effectual, as well as of a divergence over the composition of the Central Committee, for the plan of the \u201creform\u201d was proposed at a time when that divergence was nowhere in sight and when Comrade Martov joined us in electing Comrade Pavlovich a seventh member of the editorial board] Secondly, we have already shown by documentary proofs that it was a question of the personal composition of the Central Committee, that \u00e0 la fin des fins the matter came down to a difference of lists: Glebov-Travinsky-Popov or Glebov-Trotsky-Popov.] The majority of the editorial board showed that they did not want the Central Committee to be converted into a tool of the editorial board. [That is Akimov\u2019s refrain: the question of the influence for which every majority fights at any and every party congress so as then to consolidate it with the help of a majority on the central institutions is transferred to the plane of opportunist slanders about a \u201ctool\u201d of the editorial board, about a \u201cmere appendage\u201d of the editorial board, as Comrade Martov himself put it somewhat later, p. .] That is why it was found necessary to reduce the number of members of the editorial board [!!]. And that is why I cannot join such an editorial board. [Just examine this \u201cthat is why\u201d a little more carefully. How might the editorial board have converted the Central Committee into an appendage or tool? Only if it had had three votes on the Council and had abused its superiority. Is that not clear? And is it not likewise clear that, having been elected the third member, Comrade Martov could always have prevented such an abuse and by his vote alone have destroyed all superiority of the editorial board on the Council? Consequently, the whole matter boils down to the personal composition of the Central Committee, and it is at once clear that the talk about a tool and an appendage is slander.] Together with the majority of the old editorial board, I thought that the Congress would put an end to the \u2019state of siege\u2019 in the Party and would establish a normal state of affairs. But as a matter of fact the state of siege, with its emergency laws against particular groups, still continues, and has even become more acute. Only if the old editorial board remains in its entirety can we guarantee that the rights conferred on the editorial board by the Rules will not be used to the detriment of the Party....\u201d\n\nThere you have the whole passage from Comrade Martov\u2019s speech in which he first advanced the notorious war-cry of a \u201cstate of siege\u201d. And now look at my reply to him:\n\n\u201c. . . However, in correcting Martov\u2019s statement about the private character of the plan for two trios, I have no intention of denying Martov\u2019s assertion of the \u2019political significance\u2019 of the step we took in not endorsing the old editorial board. On the contrary, I fully and unreservedly agree with Comrade Martov that this step is of great political significance\u2014only not the significance which Martov ascribes to it. He said that it was an act in a struggle for influence on the Central Committee in Russia. I go farther than Martov. The whole activity of Iskra as a separate group has hitherto been a struggle for influence; but now it is a matter of something more, namely, the organisational consolidation of this influence, and not only a struggle for it. How profoundly Comrade Martov and I differ politically on this point is shown by the fact that he blames me for this wish to influence the Central Committee, whereas I count it to my credit that I strove and still strive to consolidate this influence by organisational means. It appears that we are even talking in different languages! What would be the point of all our work, of all our efforts, if they ended in the same old struggle for influence, and not in its complete acquisition and consolidation? Yes, Comrade Martov is absolutely right: the step we have taken is undoubtedly a major political step showing that one of the trends now to be observed has been chosen for the future work of our Party. And I am not at all frightened by the dreadful words \u2019a state of siege in the Party\u2019, \u2019emergency laws against particular individuals and groups\u2019, etc. We not only can but we must create a \u2019state of siege\u2019 in relation to unstable and vacillating elements, and all our Party Rules, the whole system of centralism now endorsed by the Congress are nothing but a \u2019state of siege\u2019 in respect to the numerous sources of political vagueness. It is special laws, even if they are emergency laws, that are needed as measures against vagueness, and the step taken by the Congress has correctly indicated the political direction to be followed, by having created a firm basis for such laws and such measures.\u201d[]\n\nI have italicised in this summary of my speech at the Congress the sentence which Comrade Martov preferred to omit in his \u201cState of Siege\u201d (p. ). It is not surprising that he did not like this sentence and did not choose to understand its obvious meaning.\n\nWhat does the expression \u201cdreadful words\u201d imply, Comrade Martov?\n\nIt implies mockery, mockery of those who give big names to little things, who confuse a simple question by pretentious phrase-mongering.\n\nThe little and simple fact which alone could have given, and actually did give, Comrade Martov cause for \u201cnervous excitement\u201d was nothing but his defeat at the Congress over the personal composition of the central bodies. The political significance of this simple fact was that, having won, the majority of the Party Congress consolidated their influence by establishing their majority in the Party leadership as well, by creating an organisational basis for a struggle, with the help of the Rules, against what this majority considered to be vacillation, instability, and vagueness.[] [] How was the instability, vacillation, and vagueness of the Iskra-ist minority manifested at the Congress? Firstly, by their opportunist phrase-mongering over Paragraph  of the Rules; secondly, by their coalition with Comrades Akimov and Lieber, which during the second half of the Congress rapidly grew more pronounced; thirdly, by their readiness to degrade the question of electing officials to the Central Organ to the level of philistinism, of wretched words and even of getting personal. After the Congress all these lovely attributes developed from mere buds into blossoms and fruit. \u2014LeninTo make this an occasion for talking of a \u201cstruggle for influence\u201d with horror in one\u2019s eyes and complaining of a \u201cstate of siege\u201d was nothing but pretentious phrase-mongering, dreadful words.\n\nComrade Martov does not agree with this? Then perhaps he will try to prove to us that a party congress has ever existed, or is in general conceivable, where the majority would not proceed to consolidate the influence they had gained: ) by securing a majority on the central bodies, and ) by endowing it with powers to counteract vacillation, instability, and vagueness.\n\nBefore the elections, our Congress had to decide whether to give one-third of the votes on the Central Organ and on the Central Committee to the Party majority or the Party minority. The board of six and Comrade Martov\u2019s list meant giving one-third to us and two-thirds to his followers. A trio on the Central Organ and our list meant two-thirds for us and one-third for Comrade Martov\u2019s followers. Comrade Martov refused to make terms with us or yield, and challenged us in writing to a battle at the Congress. Having suffered defeat at the Congress, he began to weep and to complain of a \u201cstate of siege\u201d! Well, isn\u2019t that squabbling? Isn\u2019t it a new manifestation of the wishy-washiness of the intellectual?\n\nOne cannot help recalling in this connection the brilliant social and psychological characterisation of this latter quality recently given by Karl Kautsky. The Social Democratic parties of different countries suffer not infrequently nowadays from similar maladies, and it would be very, very useful for us to learn from more experienced comrades the correct diagnosis and the correct cure. Karl Kautsky\u2019s characterisation of certain intellectuals will therefore be only a seeming digression from our theme.\n\nThe problem \u201cthat again interests us so keenly today is the antagonism between the intelligentsia[] and the proletariat. My colleagues [Kautsky is himself an intellectual, a writer and editor] will mostly be indignant that I admit this antagonism. But it actually exists, and, as in other cases, it would be the most inexpedient tactics to try to overcome the fact by denying it. This antagonism is a social one, it relates to classes, not to individuals. The individual intellectual, like the individual capitalist, may identify himself with the proletariat in its class struggle. When he does, he changes his character too. It is not this type of intellectual, who is still an exception among his class, that we shall mainly speak of in what follows. Unless otherwise stated, I shall use the word intellectual to mean only the common run of intellectual who takes the stand of bourgeois society, and who is characteristic of the intelligentsia as a class. This class stands in a certain antagonism to the proletariat.\n\n\u201cThis antagonism differs, however, from the antagonism between labour and capital. The intellectual is not a capitalist. True, his standard of life is bourgeois, and he must maintain it if he is not to become a pauper; but at the same time he is compelled to sell the product of his labour, and often his labour-power, and is himself often enough exploited and humiliated by the capitalist. Hence the intellectual does not stand in any economic antagonism to the proletariat. But his status of life and his conditions of labour are not proletarian, and this gives rise to a certain antagonism in sentiments and ideas.\n\n\u201cAs an isolated individual, the proletarian is nothing. His whole strength, his whole progress, all his hopes and expectations are derived from organisation, from systematic action in conjunction with his fellows. He feels big and strong when he forms part of a big and strong organism. This organism is the main thing for him; the individual in comparison means very little. The proletarian fights with the utmost devotion as part of the anonymous mass, without prospect of personal advantage or personal glory, doing his duty in any post he is assigned to with a voluntary discipline which pervades all his feelings and thoughts.\n\n\u201cQuite different is the case of the intellectual. He does not fight by means of power, but by argument. His weapons are his personal knowledge, his personal ability, his personal convictions. He can attain to any position at all only through his personal qualities. Hence the freest play for his individuality seems to him the prime condition for successful activity. It is only with difficulty that he submits to being a part subordinate to a whole, and then only from necessity, not from inclination. He recognises the need of discipline only for the mass, not for the elect minds. And of course he counts himself among the latter....\n\n\u201cNietzsche\u2019s philosophy, with its cult of the superman, for whom the fulfilment of his own individuality is everything and any subordination of that individuality to a great social aim is vulgar and despicable, is the real philosophy of the intellectual, and it renders him totally unfit to take part in the class struggle of the proletariat.\n\n\u201cNext to Nietzsche, the most outstanding exponent of a philosophy answering to the sentiments of the intelligentsia is probably Ibsen. His Doctor Stockmann (in An Enemy of the People) is not a socialist as many have thought, but the type of the intellectual, who is bound to come into conflict with the proletarian movement, and with any movement of the people generally, as soon as he attempts to work within it. For the basis of the proletarian movement, as of every democratic[] movement, is respect for the majority of one\u2019s fellows. The typical intellectual \u00e0 la Stockmann regards a \u2019compact majority\u2019 as a monster that must be overthrown....\n\n\u201cAn ideal example of an intellectual who had become thoroughly imbued with the sentiments of the proletariat, and who, although he was a brilliant writer, had quite lost the specific mentality of the intellectual, marched cheerfully with the rank and file, worked in any post he was assigned to subordinated himself whole-heartedly to our great cause, and despised the feeble whining [weichliches Gewinsel] about the suppression of his individuality which the intellectual trained on Ibsen and Nietzsche is prone to indulge in when he happens to be in the minority\u2014an ideal example of the kind of intellectual the socialist movement needs was Liebknecht. We may also mention Marx, who never forced himself to the forefront and whose party discipline in the International, where he often found himself in the minority, was exemplary.\u201d[]\n\nJust such feeble whining of intellectuals who happened to find themselves in the minority, and nothing more, was the refusal of Martov and his friends to be named for office merely because the old circle had not been endorsed, as were their complaints of a state of siege and emergency laws \u201cagainst particular groups\u201d, which Martov cared nothing about when Yuzhny Rabochy and Rabocheye Dyelo were dissolved, but only came to care about when his group was dissolved.\n\nJust such feeble whining of intellectuals who happened to find themselves in the minority was that endless torrent of complaints, reproaches, hints, accusations, slanders, and insinuations regarding the \u201ccompact majority\u201d which was started by Martov and which poured out in such a flood at our Party Congress[] (and even more so after).\n\nThe minority bitterly complained that the compact majority held private meetings. Well, the minority had to do something to conceal the unpleasant fact that the delegates it invited to its own private meetings refused to attend, while those who would willingly have attended (the Egorovs, Makhovs, and Brouck\u00e8res) the minority could not invite after all the fighting it had done with them at the Congress.\n\nThe minority bitterly complained of the \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d. Well, it had to do something to conceal the unpleasant fact that it was opportunists, who in most cases had followed the anti-Iskra-ists\u2014and partly these anti-Iskra-ists themselves\u2014that made up the compact minority, seizing with both hands on the championship of the circle spirit in Party institutions, opportunism in arguments, philistinism in Party affairs, and the instability and wishy-washiness of the intellectual.\n\nWe shall show in the next section what is the explanation of the highly interesting political fact that a \u201ccompact majority\u201d was formed towards the end of the Congress, and why, in spite of every challenge, the minority so very, very warily evades the reasons for its formation and its history. But let us first finish our analysis of the Congress debates.\n\nDuring the elections to the Central Committee, Comrade Martov moved a highly characteristic resolution (p. ), the three main features of which I have on occasion referred to as \u201cmate in three moves\u201d. Here they are: ) to ballot lists of candidates for the Central Committee, and not the candidates individually; ) after the lists had been announced, to allow two sittings to elapse (for discussion, evidently); ) in the absence of an absolute majority, a second ballot to be regarded as final. This resolution was a most carefully conceived stratagem (we must give the adversary his due!), with which Comrade Egorov did not agree (p. ), but which would most certainly have assured a complete victory for Martov if the seven Bundists and \u201cRabocheye Dyelo\u201d-ists had not quit the Congress. The reason for this stratagem was that the Iskra-ist minority did not have, and could not have had, a \u201cdirect agreement\u201d (such as there was among the Iskra-ist majority) even with the Egorovs and Makhovs, let alone the Bund and Brouck\u00e8re.\n\nRemember that at the League Congress Comrade Martov complained that the \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d presumed a direct agreement between him and the Bund. I repeat, this only seemed so to Comrade Martov in his fright, and this very refusal of Comrade Egorov to agree to the balloting of lists (Comrade Egorov \u201chad not yet lost his principles\u201d\u2014presumably the principles that made him join forces with Goldblatt in appraising the absolute importance of democratic guarantees) graphically demonstrates the highly important fact that there could be no question of a \u201cdirect agreement\u201d even with Egorov. But a coalition there could be, and was, both with Egorov and with Brouckere, a coalition in the sense that the Martovites were sure of their support every time they, the Martovites, came into serious conflict with us and Akimov and his friends had to choose the lesser evil. There was not and is not the slightest doubt that Comrades Akimov and Lieber would certainly have voted both for the board of six on the Central Organ and for Martov\u2019s list for the Central Committee, as being the lesser evil, as being what would least achieve the \u201cIskra\u201d aims (see Akimov\u2019s speech on Paragraph  and the \u201chopes\u201d he placed in Martov). Balloting of lists, allowing two sittings to elapse, and a re-ballot were designed to achieve this very result with almost mechanical certainty without a direct agreement.\n\nBut since our compact majority remained a compact majority, Comrade Martov\u2019s flank movement would only have meant delay, and we were bound to reject it. The minority poured forth their complaints on this score in a written statement (p. ) and, following the example of Martynov and Akimov, refused to vote in the elections to the Central Committee, \u201cin view of the conditions in which they were held\u201d. Since the Congress, such complaints of abnormal conditions at the elections (see State of Siege, p. ) have been poured right and left into the ears of hundreds of Party gossips. But in what did this abnormality consist? In the secret ballot\u2014which had been stipulated beforehand in the Standing Orders of the Congress (Point , Minutes, p. ), and in which it was absurd- to detect any \u201chypocrisy\u201d or \u201cinjustice\u201d? In the formation of a compact majority\u2014that \u201cmonster\u201d in the eyes of wishy-washy intellectuals? Or in the abnormal desire of these worthy intellectuals to violate the pledge they had given before the Congress that they would recognise all its elections (p. , Point  of the Congress Regulations)?\n\nComrade Popov subtly hinted at this desire when he asked outright at the Congress on the day of the elections: \u201cIs the Bureau certain that the decision of the Congress is valid and in order when half the delegates refused to vote?\u201d[] The Bureau of course replied that it was certain, and recalled the incident of Comrades Akimov and Martynov Comrade Martov agreed with the Bureau and explicitly declared that Comrade Popov was mistaken and that \"the decisions of the Congress are valid \" (p. ). Now let the reader form his own opinion of the political consistency\u2014highly normal, we must suppose\u2014revealed by a comparison of this declaration made by him in the hearing of the Party with his behaviour after the Congress and with the phrase in his State of Siege about \"the revolt of half the Party which already began at the Congress \" (p. ). The hopes which Comrade Akimov had placed in Comrade Martov outweighed the ephemeral good intentions of Martov himself.\n\n\"You have conquered \", Comrade Akimov!\n\n*     *\n*\nCertain features, seemingly petty but actually very important, of the end of the Congress, the part of it after the elections, may serve to show how pure and simple a \u201cdreadful word\u201d was the famous phrase about a \u201cstate of siege\u201d, which has now for ever acquired a tragicomical meaning. Comrade Martov is now making great play with this tragicomical \u201cstate of siege\u201d, seriously assuring both himself and his readers that this bogey of his own invention implied some sort of abnormal persecution, hounding, bullying of the \u201cminority\u201d by the \u201cmajority\u201d. We shall presently show how matters stood after the Congress. But take even the end of the Congress, and you will find that after the elections, far from persecuting the unhappy Martovites, who are supposed to have been bullied, ill-treated, and led to the slaughter, the \u201ccompact majority\u201d itself offered them (through Lyadov) two seats out of three on the Minutes Committee (p. ). Take the resolutions on tactical and other questions (p.  et seq.), and you will find that they were discussed on their merits in a purely business-like way, and that the signatories to many of the resolutions included both representatives of the monstrous compact \u201cmajority\u201d and followers of the \u201chumiliated and insulted\u201d \u201cminority\u201d (Minutes, pp. , , ,  and ). This looks like \u201cshutting out from work\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d in general, does it not?\n\nThe only interesting\u2014but, unfortunately, all too brief\u2014controversy on the substance of a question arose in connection with Starover\u2019s resolution on the liberals. As one can see from the signatures to it (pp.  and ), it was adopted by the Congress because three of the supporters of the \u201cmajority\u201d (Braun, Orlov, and Osipov[]) voted both for it and for Plekhanov\u2019s resolution, not perceiving the irreconcilable contradiction between the two. No irreconcilable contradiction is apparent at first glance, because Plekhanov\u2019s resolution lays down a general principle, outlines a defnite attitude, as regards principles and tactics, towards bourgeois liberalism in Russia, whereas Starover\u2019s attempts to define the concrete conditions in which \u201ctemporary agreements\u201d would be permissible with \u201cliberal or liberal-democratic trends\u201d. The subjects of the two resolutions are different. But Starover\u2019s suffers from political vagueness, and is consequently petty and shallow. It does not define the class content of Russian liberalism, does not indicate the definite political trends in which this is expressed, does not explain to the proletariat the principal tasks of propaganda and agitation in relation to these definite trends; it confuses (owing to its vagueness) such different things as the student movement and Osvobozhdeniye, it too pettily and casuistically prescribes three concrete conditions under which \u201ctemporary agreements\u201d would be permissible. Here too, as in many other cases, political vagueness leads to casuistry. The absence of any general principle and the attempt to enumerate \u201cconditions\u201d result in a petty and, strictly speaking, incorrect specification of these conditions. Just examine Starover\u2019s three conditions: ) the \u201cliberal or liberal-democratic trends\u201d shall \u201cclearly and unambiguously declare that in their struggle against the autocratic government they will resolutely side with the Russian Social-Democrats\u201d. What is the difference between the liberal and liberal-democratic trends? The resolution furnishes no material for a reply to this question. Is it not that the liberal trends speak for the politically least progressive sections of the bourgeoisie, and the liberal-democratic\u2014for the more progressive sections of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie? If that is so, can Comrade Starover possibly think that the sections of the bourgeoisie which are least progressive (but progressive nevertheless, for otherwise there could be no talk of liberalism) can \u201cresolutely side with the Social-Democrats\u201d?? That is absurd, and even if the spokesmen of such a trend were to \"declare it clearly and unambiguously \" (an absolutely impossible assumption), we, the party of the proletariat, would be obliged not to believe their declarations. To be a liberal and resolutely side with the Social-Democrats\u2014the one excludes the other.\n\nFurther, let us assume a case where \u201cliberal or liberal-democratic trends\u201d clearly and unambiguously declare that in their struggle against the autocracy they will resolutely side with the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Such an assumption is far less unlikely than Comrade Starover\u2019s (owing to the bourgeois-democratic nature of the Socialist-Revolutionary trend). From his resolution, because of its vagueness and casuistry, it would appear that in a case like this temporary agreements with such liberals would be impermissible. But this conclusion, which follows inevitably from Comrade Starover\u2019s resolution, is an absolutely false one. Temporary agreements are permissible with the Socialist-Revolutionaries (see the Congress resolution on the latter), and, consequently, with liberals who side with the Socialist Revolutionaries.\n\nSecond condition: these trends \u201cshall not include in their programmes any demands running counter to the interests of the working class or the democracy generally, or obscuring their political consciousness\u201d. Here we have the same mistake again: there never have been, nor can there be, liberal-democratic trends which did not include in their programmes demands running counter to the interests of the working class and obscuring its (the proletariat\u2019s) political consciousness. Even one of the most democratic sections of our liberal-democratic trend, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, put forward in their programme\u2014a muddled one, like all liberal programmes\u2014demands that run counter to the interests of the working class and obscure its political consciousness. The conclusion to be drawn from this fact is that it is essential to \u201cexpose the limitations and inadequacy of the bourgeois emancipation movement\u201d, but not that temporary agreements are impermissible.\n\nLastly, in the general form in which it is presented, Comrade Starover\u2019s third \u201ccondition\u201d (that the liberal-democrats should make universal, equal, secret, and direct suffrage the slogan of their struggle) is likewise incorrect: it would be unwise to declare impermissible in all cases temporary and partial agreements with liberal-democratic trends whose slogan was a constitution with a qualified suffrage, or a \u201ccurtailed\u201d constitution generally. As a matter of fact, the Osvobozhdeniye \u201ctrend\u201d would fit into just this category, but it would be political short-sightedness incompatible with the principles of Marxism to tie one\u2019s hands by forbidding in advance \u201ctemporary agreements\u201d with even the most timorous liberals.\n\nTo sum up: Comrade Starover\u2019s resolution, which was signed also by Comrades Martov and Axelrod, is a mistake, and the Third Congress would be wise to rescind it. It suffers from political vagueness in its theoretical and tactical position, from casuistry in the practical \u201cconditions\u201d it stipulates. It confuses two questions: ) the exposure of the \u201canti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian\u201d features of all liberal-democratic trends, and the need to combat these features, and ) the conditions for temporary and partial agreements with any of these trends. It does not give what it should (an analysis of the class content of liberalism), and gives what it should not (prescription of \u201cconditions\u201d). It is absurd in general to draw up detailed \u201cconditions\u201d for temporary agreements at a party congress, when there is not even a definite partner to such possible agreements in view; and even if there were such a definite partner in view, it would be a hundred times more rational to leave the definition of the \u201cconditions\u201d for a temporary agreement to the Party\u2019s central institutions, as the Congress did in relation to the Socialist-Revolutionary \u201ctrend\u201d (see Plekhanov\u2019s modification of the end of Comrade Axelrod\u2019s resolution\u2014Minutes, pp.  and ).\n\nAs to the objections of the \u201cminority\u201d to Plekhanov\u2019s resolution, Comrade Martov\u2019s only argument was: Plekhanov\u2019s resolution \u201cends with the paltry conclusion that a particular writer should be exposed. Would this not be \u2019using a sledge hammer to kill a fly\u2019?\u201d (p. .) This argument, whose emptiness is concealed by a smart phrase\u2014\u201cpaltry conclusion\u201d\u2014provides a new specimen of pompous phrase-mongering. Firstly, Plekhanov\u2019s resolution speaks of \u201cexposing in the eyes of the proletariat the limitations and inadequacy of the bourgeois emancipation movement wherever these limitations and inadequacy manifest themselves\u201d. Hence Comrade Martov\u2019s assertion (at the League Congress; Minutes, p. ) that \u201call attention is to be directed only to Struve, only to one liberal\u201d is the sheerest nonsense. Secondly, to compare Mr. Struve to a \u201cfly\u201d when the possibility of temporary agreements with the Russian liberals is in question, is to sacrifice an elementary and manifest political fact for a smart phrase. No, Mr. Struve is not a fly, but a political magnitude, and not because he personally is such a big figure, but because of his position as the sole representative of Russian liberalism\u2014of at all effectual and organised liberalism\u2014in the illegal world. Therefore, to talk of the Russian liberals, and of what our Party\u2019s attitude towards them should be, without having precisely Mr. Struve and Osvobozhdeniye in mind is to talk without saying anything. Or perhaps Comrade Martov will show us even one single \u201cliberal or liberal-democratic trend\u201d in Russia which could compare even remotely today with the Osvobozhdeniye trend? It would be interesting to see him try![]\n\n\u201cStruve\u2019s name means nothing to the workers,\u201d said Comrade Kostrov, supporting Comrade Martov. I hope Comrade Kostrov and Comrade Martov will not be offended\u2014but that argument is fully in the Akimov style. It is like the argument about the proletariat in the genitive case.[]\n\nWho are the workers to whom Struve\u2019s name (and the name of Osvobozhdeniye, mentioned in Comrade Plekhanov\u2019s resolution alongside of Mr. Struve) \u201cmeans nothing\u201d? Those who know very little, or nothing at all, of the \u201cliberal and liberal-democratic trends\u201d in Russia. One asks, what should be the attitude of our Party Congress to such workers: should it instruct Party members to acquaint these workers with the only definite liberal trend in Russia; or should it refrain from mentioning a name with which the workers are little acquainted because of their little acquaintance with politics? If Comrade Kostrov, having taken one step in the wake of Comrade Akimov, does not want to take another, he will answer this question in the former sense. And having answered it in the former sense, he will see how groundless his argument was. At any rate, the words \u201cStruve\u201d and \"Osvobozhdeniye \" in Plekhanov\u2019s resolution are likely to be of much more value to the workers than the words \u201cliberal and liberal-democratic trend\u201d in Starover\u2019s resolution.\n\nExcept through Osvobozhdeniye, the Russian worker cannot at the present time acquaint himself in practice with anything like a frank expression of the political tendencies of our liberalism. The legal liberal literature is unsuitable for this purpose because it is so nebulous. And we must as assiduously as possible (and among the broadest possible masses of workers) direct the weapon of our criticism against the Osvobozhdeniye gentry, so that when the future revolution breaks out, the Russian proletariat may, with the real criticism of weapons,[] paralyse the inevitable attempts of the Osvobozhdeniye gentry to curtail the democratic character of the revolution.\n\nApart from Comrade Egorov\u2019s \u201cperplexity\u201d, mentioned above, over the question of our \u201csupporting\u201d the oppositional and revolutionary movement, the debate on the resolutions offered little of interest; in fact, there was hardly any debate at all.\n\nN. General Picture of the Struggle at the Congress. The Revolutionary and Opportunist Wings of the Party\nHaving finished our analysis of the Congress debates and voting, we must now sum up, so that we may, on the basis of the entire Congress material, answer the question: what elements, groups, and shades went to make up the final majority and minority which we saw in the elections and which were destined for a time to become the main division in our Party? A summary must be made of all the material relating to shades of principle, theoretical and tactical, which the minutes of the Congress provide in such abundance. Without a general \u201cresum\u00e9\u201d without a general picture of the Congress as a whole, and of all the principal groupings during the voting, this material is too disjointed, too disconnected, so that at first sight the individual groupings seem accidental, especially to one who does not take the trouble to make an independent and comprehensive study of the Congress Minutes (and how many readers have taken that trouble?).\n\nIn English parliamentary reports we often meet the characteristic word \u201cdivision\u201d. The House \u201cdivided\u201d into such and such a majority and minority, it is said when an issue is voted. The \u201cdivision\u201d of our Social-Democratic House on the various issues discussed at the Congress presents a picture of the struggle within the Party, of its shades of opinion and groups, that is unique of its kind and unparalleled for its completeness and accuracy. To make the picture a graphic one, to obtain a real picture instead of a heap of disconnected, disjointed, and isolated facts and incidents, to put a stop to the endless and senseless arguments over particular votings (who voted for whom and who supported whom?), I have decided to try to depict all the basic types of \u201cdivisions\u201d at our Congress in the form of a diagram. This will probably seem strange to a great many people, but I doubt whether any other method can be found that would really generalise and summarise the results in the most complete and accurate manner possible. Which way a particular delegate voted can be ascertained with absolute accuracy in cases when a roll-call vote was taken; and in certain important cases when no roll-call vote was taken it can be determined from the minutes with a very high degree of probability, with a sufficient degree of approximation to the truth. And if we take into account all the roll-call votes and all the other votes on issues of any importance (as judged, for example, by the thoroughness and warmth of the debates), we shall obtain the most objective picture of our inner Party struggle that the material at our disposal permits. In doing so, instead of giving a photograph, i.e., an image of each voting separately, we shall try to give a picture, i.e., to present all the main types of voting, ignoring relatively unimportant exceptions and variations which would only confuse matters. In any case, anybody will be able with the aid of the minutes to check every detail of our picture, to amplify it with any particular voting he likes, in short, to criticise it not only by arguing, expressing doubts, and making references to isolated incidents, but by drawing a different picture on the basis of the same material.\n\nIn marking on the diagram each delegate who took part in the voting, we shall indicate by special shading the four main groups which we have traced in detail through the whole of the Congress debates, viz., ) the Iskra-ists of the majority; ) the Iskra-ists of the minority; ) the \u201cCentre\u201d, and ) the anti-Iskra-ists. We have seen the difference in shades of principle between these groups in a host of instances, and if anyone does not like the names of the groups, which remind lovers of zigzags too much of the Iskra organisation and the Iskra trend, we can tell them that it is not the name that matters. Now that we have traced the shades through all the debates at the Congress, it is easy to substitute for the already established and familiar Party appellations (which jar on the ears of some) a characterisation of the essence of the shades between the groups. Were this substitution made, we would obtain the following names for these same four groups: ) consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats; ) minor opportunists; ) middling opportunists; and ) major opportunists (major by our Russian standards). Let us hope that these names will be less shocking to those who have latterly taken to assuring themselves and others that Iskra-ist is a name which only denotes a \u201ccircle\u201d, and not a trend.\n\nLet us now explain in detail the types of voting \u201csnapped\u201d on this diagram:\nGeneral Picture of the Struggle at the Congress, p. \nThe first type of voting (A) covers the cases when the \u201cCentre\u201d joined with the Iskra-ists against the anti-Iskra-ists or a part of them. It includes the vote on the programme as a whole (Comrade Akimov alone abstained, all the others voted for); the vote on the resolution condemning federation in principle (all voted for except the five Bundists); the vote on Paragraph  of the Bund Rules (the five Bundists voted against us; five abstained, viz.: Martynov, Akimov, Brouck\u00e8re, and Makhov with his two votes; the rest were with us); it is this vote that is represented in diagram A. Further, the three votes on the question of endorsing Iskra as the Party\u2019s Central Organ were also of this type: the editors (five votes) abstained; in all three cases there were two votes against (Akimov and Brouck\u00e8re), and, in addition, when the vote on the motives for endorsing Iskra was taken, the five Bundists and Comrade Martynov abstained.[][] Why was the vote on Paragraph  of the Bund Rules taken for depiction in the diagram? Because the votes on endorsing Iskra were not as full, while the votes on the programme and on the question of federation referred to political decisions of a less definite and specific character. Speaking generally, the choice of one or another of a number of votes of the same type will not in the least affect the main features of the picture, as anyone may easily see by making the corresponding changes. \u2014Lenin\nThis type of voting provides the answer to a very interesting and important question, namely, when did the Congress \u201cCentre\u201d vote with the Iskra-ists? It was either when the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists, too, were with us, with a few exceptions (adoption of the programme, or endorsement of Iskra without motives stated), or else when it was a question of the sort of statement which was not in itself a direct committal to a definite political position (recognition of Iskra\u2019s organising work was not in itself a committal to carry out its organisational policy in relation to particular groups; rejection of the principle of federation did not preclude abstention from voting on a specific scheme of federation, as we have seen in the case of Comrade Makhov). We have already seen, when speaking of the significance of the groupings at the Congress in general, how falsely this matter is put in the official account of the official Iskra;, which (through the mouth of Comrade Martov) slurs and glosses over the difference between the Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d, between consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats and opportunists, by citing cases when the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists, too, voted with us! Even the most \u201cRight-wing\u201d of the opportunists in the German and French Social-Democratic parties never vote against such points as the adoption of the programme as a whole.\n\nThe second type of voting (B) covers the cases when the Iskra-ists, consistent and inconsistent, voted together against all the anti-Iskra-ists and the entire \u201cCentre\u201d. These were mostly cases that involved giving effect to definite and specific plans of the Iskra policy, that is, endorsing Iskra in fact and not only in word. They include the Organising Committee incident;[] [] It is this vote that is depicted in Diagram B; the Iskra-ists secured thirty-two votes, the Bundist resolution sixteen. It should be pointed out that of the votes of this type not one was by roll-call. The way the individual delegates voted can only be established\u2014but with a very high degree of probability\u2014by two sets of evidence: ) in the debate the speakers of both groups of Iskra-ists spoke in favour those of the anti-Iskra-ists and the \u201cCentre\u201d against; ) the number of votes cast in favour was always very close to thirty-three. Nor should it be forgotten that when analysing the Congress debates we pointed out, quite apart from the voting, a number of cases when the \u201cCentre\u201d sided with the anti-Iskra-ists (the opportunists) against us. Some of these issues were: the absolute value of democratic demands, whether we should support the oppositional elements, restriction of centralism, etc. \u2014Leninthe question of making the position of the Bund in the Party the first item on the agenda; the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group; two votes on the agrarian programme, and, sixthly and lastly, the vote against the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad (Rabocheye Dyelo), that is, the recognition of the League as the only Party organisation abroad. The old, pre-Party, circle spirit, the interests of opportunist organisations or groups, the narrow conception of Marxism were fighting here against the strictly consistent and principled policy of revolutionary Social-Democracy; the Iskra-ists of the minority still sided with us in quite a number of cases, in a number of exceedingly important votes (important from the standpoint of the Organising Committee, Yuzhny Rabochy, and Rabocheye Dyelo) . . . until their own circle spirit and their own inconsistency came into question. The \u201cdivisions\u201d of this type bring out with graphic clarity that on a number of issues involving the practical application of our principles, the Centre joined forces with the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists, displaying a much greater kinship with them than with us, a much greater leaning in practice towards the opportunist than towards the revolutionary wing of Social-Democracy. Those who were Iskra-ists in name but were ashamed to be Iskra-ists revealed their true nature, and the struggle that inevitably ensued caused no little acrimony, which obscured from the less thoughtful and more impressionable the significance of the shades of principle disclosed in that struggle. But now that the ardour of battle has somewhat abated and the minutes remain as a dispassionate extract of a series of heated encounters, only those who wilfully close their eyes can fail to perceive that the alliance of the Makhovs and Egorovs with the Akimovs and Liebers was not, and could not be, fortuitous. The only thing Martov and Axelrod can do is keep well away from a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the minutes, or try at this late date to undo their behaviour at the Congress by all sorts of expressions of regret. As if regrets can remove differences of views and differences of policy! As if the present alliance of Martov and Axelrod with Akimov, Brouck\u00e8re, and Martynov can cause our Party, restored at the Second Congress, to forget the struggle which the Iskra-ists waged with the anti-Iskra-ists almost throughout the Congress!\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the third type of voting at the Congress, represented by the three remaining parts of the diagram (C, D, and E), is that a small section of the \u201cIskra\u201d-ists broke away and went over to the anti-\u201cIskra\u201d-ists, who accordingly gained the victory (as long as they remained at the Congress). In order to trace with comp]ete accuracy the development of this celebrated coalition of the Iskra-ist minority with the anti-Iskra-ists, the mere mention of which drove Martov to write hysterical epistles at the Congress, we have reproduced all the three main kinds of roll-call votes of this type. C is the vote on equality of languages (the last of the three roll-call votes on this question is given, it being the fullest). All the anti-Iskra-ists and the whole Centre stand solid against us; from the Iskra-ists a part of the majority and a part of the minority break away. It is not yet clear which of the \u201cIskra\u201d-ists are capable of forming a definite and lasting coalition with the opportunist \u201cRight wing\u201d of the Congress. Next comes type D\u2014the vote on Paragraph  of the Rules (of the two votes, we have taken the one which was more clear-cut, that is, in which there were no abstentions). The coalition stands out more saliently and assumes firmer shape[] [] Judging by all indications, four other votes on the Rules were of the same type: p. \u2014 for Fomin, as against  for us; p. \u2014 for Martov, as against  for us; p. \u2014 against me,  for; and, on the same page,  for Martov, as against  for us. These are the votes on the question of co-optation to the central bodies, which I have already dealt with. No roll-call votes are available (there was one, but the record of it has been lost). The Bundists (all or part) evidently saved Martov. Martov\u2019s erroneous statements (at the League) concerning these votes have been corrected above. \u2014Lenin: all the Iskra-ists of the minority are now on the side of Akimov and Lieber, but only a very small number of Iskra-ists of the majority, these counterbalancing three of the \u201cCentre\u201d and one anti-Iskra-ist who have come over to our side. A mere glance at the diagram suffices to show which elements shifted from side to side casually and temporarily and which were drawn with irresistible force towards a lasting coalition with the Akimovs. The last vote (E\u2014elections to the Central Organ, the Central Committee, and the Party Council), which in fact represents the final division into majority and minority, clearly reveals the complete fusion of the Iskra-ist minority with the entire \u201cCentre\u201d and the remnants of the anti-Iskra-ists. By this time, of the eight anti-Iskra-ists, only Comrade Brouck\u00e8re remained at the Congress (Comrade Akimov had already explained his mistake to him and he had taken his proper place in the ranks of the Martovites). The withdrawal of the seven most \u201cRight-wing\u201d of the opportunists decided the issue of the elections against Martov.[][] The seven opportunists who withdrew from the Second Congress were the five Bundists (the Bund withdrew from the Party after the Second Congress rejected the principle of federation) and two Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, Comrade Martynov and Comrade Akimov. These latter left the Congress after the Iskra-ist League was recognised as the only Party organisation abroad, i.e., after the Rabocheye Dyelo-ist Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was dissolved. (Author\u2019s footnote to the  edition.\u2014Ed.) \u2014Lenin\nAnd now, with the aid of the objective evidence of votes of every type, let us sum up the results of the Congress.\n\nThere has been much talk to the effect that the majority at our Congress was \u201caccidental\u201d. This, in fact, was Comrade Martov\u2019s sole consolation in his Once More in the Minority. The diagram clearly shows that in one sense, but in only one, the majority could be called accidental, viz., in the sense that the withdrawal of the seven most opportunist delegates of the \"Right \" was\u2014supposedly\u2014a matter of accident. To the extent that this withdrawal was an accident (and no more), our majority was accidental. A mere glance at the diagram will show better than any long arguments on whose side these seven would have been, were bound to have been.[] [] We shall see later that after the Congress both Comrade Akimov and the Voronezh Committee, which has the closest kinship with Comrade Akimov, explicitly expressed their sympathy with the \u201cminority\u201d. \u2014LeninBut the question is: how far was the withdrawal of the seven really an accident? That is a question which those who talk so freely about the \u201caccidental\u201d character of the majority do not like to ask themselves. It is an unpleasant question for them. Was it an accident that the most extreme representatives of the Right and not of the Left wing of our Party were the ones to withdraw? Was it an accident that it was opportunists who withdrew, and not consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats? Is there no connection between this \u201caccidental\u201d withdrawal and the struggle against the opportunist wing which was waged throughout the Congress and which stands out so graphically in our diagram?\n\nOne has only to ask these questions, which are so unpleasant to the minority, to realise what fact all this talk about the accidental character of the majority is intended to conceal. It is the unquestionable and incontrovertible fact that the minority was formed of those in our Party who gravitate most towards opportunism. The minority was formed of those elements in the Party who are least stable in theory, least steadfast in matters of principle. It was from the Right wing of the Party that the minority was formed. The division into majority and minority is a direct and inevitable continuation of that division of the Social-Democrats into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing, into a Mountain and a Gironde,[] which did not appear only yesterday, nor in the Russian workers\u2019 party alone, and which no doubt will not disappear tomorrow.\n\nThis fact is of cardinal importance for elucidating the causes and the various stages of our disagreements. Whoever tries to evade the fact by denying or glossing over the struggle at the Congress and the shades of principle that it revealed, simply testifies to his own intellectual and political poverty. And in order to disprove the fact, it would have to be shown, in the first place, that the general picture of the voting and \u201cdivisions\u201d at our Party Congress was different from the one I have drawn; and, in the second place, that it was the most consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats, those who in Russia have adopted the name of Iskra-ists,[] [] Note for Comrade Martov\u2019s benefit. If Comrade Martov has now forgotten that the term \u201cIskra\u201d-ist implies the follower of a trend and not a member of a circle, we would advise him to read in the Congress Minutes the explanation Comrade Trotsky gave Comrade Akimov on this point. There were three Iskra-ist circles (in relation to the Party) at the Congress: the Emancipation of Labour group, the Iskra editorial board, and the Iskra organisation. Two of these three circles had the good sense to dissolve themselves; the third did not display enough Party spirit to do so, and was dissolved by the Congress. The broadest of the Iskra-ist circles, the Iskra organisation (which included the editorial board and the Emancipation of Labour group), had sixteen members present at the Congress in all, of whom only eleven were entitled to vote. Iskra-ists by trend, on the other hand, not by membership in any Iskra-ist \u201ccircle\u201d, numbered, by my calculation, twenty-seven, with thirty-three votes. Hence, less than half of the Iskra-ists at the Congress belonged to Iskra-ist circles. \u2014Leninwho were in the wrong on the substance of all those issues over which the Congress \u201cdivided\u201d. Well, just try to show that, gentlemen!\n\nIncidentally, the fact that the minority was formed of the most opportunist, the least stable and consistent elements of the Party provides an answer to those numerous objections and expressions of doubt which are addressed to the majority by people who are imperfectly acquainted with the matter, or have not given it sufficient thought. Is it not petty, we are told, to account for the divergence by a minor mistake of Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod? Yes, gentlemen, Comrade Martov\u2019s mistake was a minor one (and I said so even at the Congress, in the heat of the struggle); but this minor mistake could (and did ) cause a lot of harm because Comrade Martov was pulled over to the side of delegates who had made a whole series of mistakes, had manifested an inclination towards opportunism and inconsistency of principle on a whole series of questions. That Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod should have displayed instability was an unimportant fact concerning individuals; it was not an individual fact, however, but a Party fact, and a not altogether unimportant one, that a very considerable minority should have been formed of all the least stable elements, of all who either rejected Iskra\u2019s trend altogether and openly opposed it, or paid lip service to it but actually sided time and again with the anti-Iskra-ists.\n\nIs it not absurd to account for the divergence by the prevalence of an inveterate circle spirit and revolutionary philistinism in the small circle comprised by the old Iskra editorial board? No, it is not absurd, because all those in our Party who all through the Congress had fought for every kind of circle, all those who were generally incapable of rising above revolutionary philistinism, all those who talked about the \u201chistorical\u201d character of the philistine and circle spirit in order to justify and preserve that evil, rose up in support of this particular circle. The fact that narrow circle interests prevailed over the Party interest in the one little circle of the Iskra editorial board might, perhaps, be regarded as an accident; but it was no accident that in staunch support of this circle rose up the Akimovs and Brouck\u00e8res, who attached no less (if not more) value to the \u201chistorical continuity\u201d of the celebrated Voronezh Committee and the notorious St. Petersburg \u201cWorkers\u2019 Organisation\u201d[]; the Egorovs, who lamented the \u201cmurder\u201d of Rabocheye Dyelo as bitterly as the \u201cmurder\u201d of the old editorial board (if not more so); the Makhovs, etc., etc. You can tell a man by his friends\u2014the proverb says. And you can tell a man\u2019s political complexion by his political allies, by the people who vote for him.\n\nThe minor mistake committed by Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod was, and might have remained, a minor one until it became the starting-point for a durable alliance between them and the whole opportunist wing of our Party, until it led, as a result of that alliance, to a recrudescence of opportunism, to the exaction of revenge by all whom Iskra had fought and who were now overjoyed at a chance of venting their spleen on the consistent adherents of revolutionary Social-Democracy. And as a result of the post-Congress events, what we are witnessing in the new Iskra is precisely a recrudescence of opportunism, the revenge of the Akimovs and Brouck\u00e8res (see the leaflet issued by the Voronezh Committee[] ), and the glee of the Martynovs, who have at last (at last!) been allowed, in the detested Iskra, to have a kick at the detested \u201cenemy\u201d for each and every former grievance. This makes it particularly clear how essential it was to \u201crestore Iskra\u2019s old editorial board\u201d (we are quoting from Comrade Starover\u2019s ultimatum of November , ) in order to preserve Iskra \u201ccontinuity\u201d....\n\nTaken by itself, there was nothing dreadful, nor critical, nor even anything abnormal in the fact that the Congress (and the Party) divided into a Left and a Right, a revolutionary and an opportunist wing. On the contrary, the whole past decade in the history of the Russian (and not only the Russian) Social-Democratic movement had been leading inevitably and inexorably to such a division. The fact that the division took place over a number of very minor mistakes of the Right wing, of (relatively) very unimportant differences (a fact which seems shocking to the superficial observer and to the philistine mind), marked a big step forward for our Party as a whole. Formerly we used to differ over major issues, such as might in some cases even justify a split; now we have reached agreement on all major and important points, and are only divided by shades, about which we may and should argue, but over which it would be absurd and childish to part company (as Comrade Plekhanov has quite rightly said in his interesting article \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d, to which we shall revert). Now, when the anarchistic behaviour of the minority since the Congress has almost brought the Party to a split, one may often hear wiseacres saying: Was it worth while fighting at the Congress over such trifles as the Organising Committee incident, the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group or Rabocheye Dyelo, or Paragraph , or the dissolution of the old editorial board, etc.? Those who argue in this way[] are in fact introducing the circle standpoint into Party affairs: a struggle of shades in the Party is inevitable and essential, as long as it does not lead to anarchy and splits, as long as it is confined within bounds approved by the common consent of all comrades and Party members. And our struggle against the Right wing of the Party at the Congress, against Akimov and Axelrod, Martynov and Martov, in no way exceeded those bounds. One need only recall two facts which incontrovertibly prove this: ) when Comrades Martynov and Akimov were about to quit the Congress, we were all prepared to do everything to obliterate the idea of an \u201cinsult\u201d; we all adopted (by thirty-two votes) Comrade Trotsky\u2019s motion inviting these comrades to regard the explanations as satisfactory and withdraw their statement; ) when it came to the election of the central bodies, we were prepared to allow the minority (or the opportunist wing) of the Congress a minority on both central bodies: Martov on the Central Organ and Popov on the Central Committee. We could not act otherwise from the Party standpoint, since even before the Congress we had decided to elect two trios. If the difference of shades revealed at the Congress was not great, neither was the practical conclusion we drew from the struggle between these shades: the conclusion amounted solely to this, that two-thirds of the seats on both bodies of three ought to be given to the majority at the Party Congress.\n\nIt was only the refusal of the minority at the Party Congress to be a minority on the central bodies that led first to the \u201cfeeble whining\u201d of defeated intellectuals, and then to anarchistic talk and anarchistic actions.\n\nIn conclusion, let us take one more glance at the diagram from the standpoint of the composition of the central bodies. Quite naturally, in addition to the question of shades, the delegates were faced during the elections with the question of the suitability, efficiency, etc., of one or another person. The minority are now very prone to confuse these two questions. Yet that they are different questions is self-evident, and this can be seen from the simple fact, for instance, that the election of an initial trio for the Central Organ had been pIanned even before the Congress, at a time when no one could have foreseen the alliance of Martov and Axelrod with Martynov and Akimov. Different questions have to be answered in different ways: the answer to the question of shades must be sought for in the minutes of the Congress, in the open discussions and voting on each and every issue. As to the question of the suitability of persons, everybody at the Congress had decided that it should be settled by secret ballot. Why did the whole Congress unanimously take that decision? The question is so elementary that it would be odd to dwell on it. But (since their defeat at the ballot-box) the minority have begun to forget even elementary things. We have heard torrents of ardent, passionate speeches, heated almost to the point of irresponsibility, in defence of the old editorial board, but we have heard absolutely nothing about the shades at the Congress that were involved in the struggle over a board of six or three. We hear talk and gossip on all sides about the ineffectualness, the unsuitability, the evil designs, etc., of the persons elected to the Central Committee, but we hear absolutely nothing about the shades at the Congress that fought for predominance on the Central Committee. To me it seems indecent and discreditable to go about talking and gossiping outside the Congress about the qualities and actions of individuals (for in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred these actions are an organisational secret, which can only be divulged to the supreme authority of the Party). To fight outside the Congress by means of such gossip would, in my opinion, be scandal-mongering. And the only public reply I could make to all this talk would be to point to the struggle at the Congress: You say that the Central Committee was elected by a narrow majority. That is true. But this narrow majority consisted of all who had most consistently fought, not in words but in actual fact, for the realisation of the Iskra plans. Consequently, the moral prestige of this majority should be even higher\u2014incomparably so\u2014than its formal prestige\u2014higher in the eyes of all who value the continuity of the Iskra trend above the continuity of a particular Iskra circle. Who was more competent to judge the suitability of particular persons to carry out the Iskra policy\u2014those who fought for that pol icy at the Congress, or those who in no few cases fought against that policy and defended everything retrograde, every kind of old rubbish, every kind of circle mentality?\n\nO. After the Congress. Two Methods of Struggle\nThe analysis of the debates and voting at the Congress, which we have now concluded, actually explains in nuce (in embryo) everything that has happened since the Congress, and we can be brief in outlining the subsequent stages of our Party crisis.\n\nThe refusal of Martov and Popov to stand for election immediately introduced an atmosphere of squabbling into a Party struggle between Party shades. On the very next day after the Congress, Comrade Glebov, thinking it incredible that the unelected editors could seriously have decided to swing towards Akimov and Martynov, and attributing the whole thing primarily to irritation, suggested to Plekhanov and me that the matter should be ended peaceably and that all four should be \u201cco-opted\u201d on condition that proper representation of the editorial board on the Council was guaranteed (i.e., that of the two representatives, one was definitely drawn from the Party majority). This condition seemed sound to Plekhanov and me, for its acceptance would imply a tacit admission of the mistake at the Congress, a desire for peace instead of war, a desire to be closer to Plekhanov and me than to Akimov and Martynov, Egorov and Makhov. The concession as regards \u201cco-optation\u201d thus became a personal one, and it was not worth while refusing to make a personal concession which should clear away the irritation and restore peace. Plekhanov and I therefore consented. But the editorial majority rejected the condition. Glebov left. We began to wait and see what would happen next: whether Martov would adhere to the loyal stand he had taken up at the Congress (against Comrade Popov, the representative of the Centre), or whether the unstable elements who inclined towards a split, and in whose wake he had followed, would gain the upper hand.\n\nWe were faced with the question: would Comrade Martov choose to regard his Congress \u201ccoalition\u201d as an isolated political fact (just as, si licet parva componere magnis,[] Bebel\u2019s coalition with Vollmar in  was an isolated case), or would he want to consolidate this coalition, exert himself to prove that it was Plekhanov and I who were mistaken at the Congress, and become the actual leader of the opportunist wing of our Party? This question might be formulated otherwise as follows: a squabble or a political Party struggle? Of the three of us who on the day after the Congress were the sole available members of the central institutions, Glebov inclined most to the former answer and made the most efforts to reconcile the children who had fallen out. Comrade Plekhanov inclined most to the latter answer and was, as the saying goes, neither to hold nor to bind. I on this occasion acted the part of \u201cCentre\u201d, or \u201cMarsh\u201d, and endeavoured to employ persuasion. To try at this date to recall the spoken attempts at persuasion would be a hopelessly muddled business, and I shall not follow the bad example of Comrade Martov and Comrade Plekhanov. But I do consider it necessary to reproduce certain passages from one written attempt at persuasion which I addressed to one of the \u201cminority\u201d Iskra-ists:\n\n\u201c. . . The refusal of Martov to serve on the editorial board, his refusal and that of other Party writers to collaborate, the refusal of a number of persons to work on the Central Committee, and the propaganda of a boycott or passive resistance are bound to lead, even if against the wishes of Martov and his friends, to a split in the Party. Even if Martov adheres to a loyal stand (which he took up so resolutely at the Congress), others will not, and the outcome I have mentioned will be inevitable....\n\n\u201cAnd so I ask myself: over what, in point of fact, would we be parting company? . . . I go over all the events and impressions of the Congress; I realise that I often behaved and acted in a state of frightful irritation, \u2019frenziedly\u2019; I am quite willing to admit this fault of mine to anyone, if that can be called a fault which was a natural product of the atmosphere, the reactions, the interjections, the struggle, etc. But examining now, quite unfrenziedly, the results attained, the outcome achieved by frenzied struggle, I can detect nothing, absolutely nothing in these results that is injurious to the Party, and absolutely nothing that is an affront or insult to the minority.\n\n\u201cOf course, the very fact of finding oneself in the minority could not but be vexatious, but I categorically protest against the idea that we \u2019cast slurs\u2019 on anybody, that we wanted to insult or humiliate anybody. Nothing of the kind. And one should not allow political differences to lead to an interpretation of events based on accusing the other side of unscrupulousness, chicanery, intrigue, and the other nice things we are hearing mentioned more and more often in this atmosphere of an impending split. This should not be allowed, for it is, to say the least, the nec plus ultra of irrationality.\n\n\u201cMartov and I have had a political (and organisational) difference, as we had dozens of times before. Defeated over Paragraph  of the Rules, I could not but strive with all my might for revanche in what remained to me (and to the Congress). I could not but strive, on the one hand, for a strictly Iskra-ist Central Committee, and, on the other, for a trio on the editorial board.... I consider this trio the only one capable of being an official institution, instead of a body based on indulgence and slackness, the only one to be a real centre, each member of which would always state and defend his Party viewpoint, not one grain more, and irrespective of all personal considerations and all fear of giving offence, of resignations, and so on.\n\n\u201cThis trio, after what had occurred at the Congress, undoubtedly meant legitimising a political and organisational line in one respect directed against Martov. Undoubtedly. Cause a rupture on that account? Break up the Party because of it?? Did not Martov and Plekhanov oppose me over the question of demonstrations? And did not Martov and I oppose Plekhanov over the question of the programme? Is not one side of every trio always up against the other two? If the majority of the Iskra-ists, both in the Iskra organisation and at the Congress, found this particular shade of Martov\u2019s line organisationally and politically mistaken, is it not really senseless to attempt to attribute this to \u2019intrigue\u2019, \u2019incitement\u2019, and so forth? Would it not be senseless to try to talk away this fact by abusing the majority and calling them \u2019riffraff\u2019?\n\n\u201cI repeat that, like the majority of the Iskra-ists at the Congress, I am profoundly convinced that the line Martov adopted was wrong, and that he had to be corrected. To take offence at this correction, to regard it as an insult, etc., is unreasonable. We have not cast, and are not casting, any \u2019slurs\u2019 on anyone, nor are we excluding anyone from work. And to cause a split because someone has been excluded from a central body seems to me a piece of inconceivable folly.\u201d[][] This letter (to A. N. Potresov, of August  [September ], \u2013Ed.) was written in September (New Style). I have only omitted what seemed to me irrelevant to the matter in hand. If the addressee considers what I have omitted important, he can easily repair the omission. Incidentally, let me take this opportunity to say that any of my opponents may publish any of my private letters should they think a useful purpose will be served by it. \u2014Lenin\nI have thought it necessary to recall these written statements of mine now, because they conclusively prove that the majority wanted to draw a definite line at once between possible (and in a heated struggle inevitable) personal grievances and personal irritations caused by biting and \u201cfrenzied\u201d attacks, etc., on the one hand, and a definite political mistake, a definite political line (coalition with the Right wing), on the other.\n\nThese statements prove that the passive resistance of the minority began immediately after the Congress and at once evoked from us the warning that it was a step towards splitting the Party; the warning that it ran directly counter to their declarations of loyalty at the Congress; that the split would be solely over the fact of exclusion from the central institutions (that is, non-election to them), for nobody ever thought of excluding any Party member from work; and that our political difference (an inevitable difference, inasmuch as it had not yet been elucidated and settled which line at the Congress was mistaken, Martov\u2019s or ours) was being perverted more and more into a squabble, accompanied by abuse, suspicions, and so on and so forth.\n\nBut the warnings were in vain. The behaviour of the minority showed that the least stable elements among them, those who least valued the Party, were gaining the upper hand. This compelled Plekhanov and me to withdraw the consent we had given to Glebov\u2019s proposal. For if the minority were demonstrating by their deeds their political instability not only as regards principles, but even as regards elementary Party loyalty, what value could be attached to their talk about this celebrated \u201ccontinuity\u201d? Nobody scoffed more wittily than Plekhanov at the utter absurdity of demanding the \u201cco-optation\u201d to the Party editorial board of a majority consisting of people who frankly proclaimed their new and growing differences of opinion! Has there ever been a case in the world of a party majority on the central institutions converting itself into a minority of its own accord, prior to the airing of new differences in the press, in full view of the Party? Let the differences first be stated, let the Party judge how profound and important they were, let the Party itself correct the mistake it had made at the Second Congress, should it be shown that it had made a mistake! The very fact that such a demand was made on the plea of differences still unknown demonstrated the utter instability of those who made it, the complete submersion of political differences by squabbling, and their entire disrespect both for the Party as a whole and for their own convictions. Never have there been, nor will there be, persons of convinced principle who refuse to try to convince before they secure (privately ) a majority in the institution they want to bring round to their standpoint.\n\nFinally, on October , Comrade Plekhanov announced that he would make a last attempt to put an end to this absurd state of affairs. A meeting was called of all the six members of the old editorial board, attended by a new member of the Central Committee.[] [] This Central Committee member[] arranged, in addition, a number of private and collective talks with the minority, in which he refuted the preposterous tales that were being spread and appealed to their sense of Party duty. \u2014LeninComrade Plekhanov spent three whole hours proving how unreasonable it was to demand \u201cco-optation\u201d of four of the \u201cminority\u201d to two of the \u201cmajority\u201d. He proposed co-opting two of them, so as, on the one hand, to remove all fears that we wanted to \"bully, suppress, besiege, behead or bury anyone, and, on the other, to safeguard the rights and position of the Party \u201cmajority\u201d. The co-optation of two was likewise rejected.\n\nOn October , Plekhanov and I wrote the following official letter to all the old editors of Iskra and to Comrade Trotsky, one of its contributors:\n\n\u201cDear Comrades,\n\n\u201cThe editorial board of the Central Organ considers it its duty officially to express its regret at your withdrawal from participation in Iskra and Zarya. In spite of the repeated invitations to collaborate which we made to you immediately following the Second Party Congress and several times after, we have not received a single contribution from you. The editors of the Central Organ declare that your withdrawal from participation is not justified by anything they have done. No personal irritation should serve, of course, as an obstacle to your working on the Central Organ of the Party. If, on the other hand, your withdrawal is due to any differences of opinion with us, we would consider it of the greatest benefit to the Party if you were to set forth these differences at length. More, we would consider it highly desirable for the nature and depth of these differences to be explained to the whole Party as early as possible in the columns of the publications of which we are the editors.\u201d[][] The letter to Comrade Martov contained in addition a reference to a certain pamphlet and the following sentence: \u201cLastly, we once more inform you, in the interests of the work, that we are still prepared to co-opt you to the editorial board of the Central Organ, in order to give you every opportunity officially to state and defend your views in the supreme institution of the Party.\u201d \u2014Lenin\nAs the reader sees, it was still quite unclear to us whether the actions of the \u201cminority\u201d were principally governed by personal irritation or by a desire to steer the organ (and the Party) along a new course, and if so, what course exactly. I think that if we were even now to set seventy wise men to elucidate this question with the help of any literature or any testimony you like, they too could make nothing of this tangle. I doubt whether a squabble can ever be disentangled: you have either to cut it, or set it aside.[][] Comrade Plekhanov would probably add: \u201cor satisfy each and every claim of the initiators of the squabble\u201d. We shall see why this was impossible. \u2014Lenin\nAxelrod, Zasulich, Starover, Trotsky, and Koltsov sent a couple of lines in reply to this letter of October , to the effect that the undersigned were taking no part in Iskra since its passage into the hands of the new editorial board. Comrade Martov was more communicative and honoured us with the following reply:\n\n\u201cTo the Editorial Board of the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P.\n\n\u201cDear Comrades,\n\n\u201cIn reply to your letter of October  I wish to state the following: I consider all our discussions on the subject of working together on one organ at an end after the conference which took place in the presence of a Central Committee member on October , and at which you refused to state the reasons that induced you to withdraw your proposal to us that Axelrod, Zasulich, Starover, and I should join the editorial board on condition that we undertook to elect Comrade Lenin our \u2019representative\u2019 on the Council. After you repeatedly evaded at this conference formulating the statements you had yourselves made in the presence of witnesses, I do not think it necessary to explain in a letter to you my motives for refusing to work on Iskra under present conditions. Should the need arise, I shall explain them in detail to the whole Party, which will already be able to learn from the minutes of the Second Congress why I rejected the proposal, which you now repeat that I accept a seat on the editorial board and on the Council....[]\n\n\u201cL. Martov\u201d\n\nThis letter, in conjunction with the previous documents, clarifies beyond any possible dispute that question of boycott, disorganisation, anarchy, and preparations for a split which Comrade Martov (with the help of exclamation marks and rows of dots) so assiduously evades in his State of Siege\u2014the question of loyal and disloyal methods of struggle.\n\nComrade Martov and the others are invited to set forth their differences, they are asked to tell us plainly what the trouble is all about and what their intentions are, they are exhorted to stop sulking and to analyse calmly the mistake made over Paragraph  (which is intimately connected with their mistake in swinging to the Right)\u2014but Comrade Martov and Co. refuse to talk, and cry: \"We are being besieged! We are being bullied!\"The jibe about \u201cdreadful words\u201d has not cooled the ardour of these comical outcries.\n\nHow is it possible to besiege someone who refuses to work together with you?\u2014we asked Comrade Martov. How is it possible to ill-treat, \u201cbully\u201d, and oppress a minority which refuses to be a minority? Being in the minority necessarily and inevitably involves certain disadvantages. These disadvantages are that you either have to join a body which will outvote you on certain questions, or you stay outside that body and attack it, and consequently come under the fire of well-mounted batteries.\n\nDid Comrade Martov\u2019s cries about a \u201cstate of siege\u201d mean that those in the minority were being fought or governed unfairly and unloyally? Only such an assertion could have contained even a grain of sense (in Martov\u2019s eyes), for, I repeat, being in the minority necessarily and inevitably involves certain disadvantages. But the whole comedy of the matter is that Comrade Martov could not be fought at all as long as he refused to talk! The minority could not be governed at all as long as they refused to be a minority!\n\nComrade Martov could not cite a single fact to show that the editorial board of the Central Organ had exceeded or abused its powers while Plekhanov and I were on it. Nor could the practical workers of the minority cite a single fact of a like kind with regard to the Central Committee. However Comrade Martov may now twist and turn in his State of Siege, it remains absolutely incontrovertible that the outcries about a state of siege were nothing but \u201cfeeble whining\u201d.\n\nHow utterly Comrade Martov and Co. lacked sensible arguments against the editorial board appointed by the Congress is best of all shown by their own catchword: \u201cWe are not serfs!\u201d (State of Siege, p. .) The mentality of the bourgeois intellectual, who counts himself among the \u201celect minds\u201d standing above mass organisation and mass discipline, is expressed here with remarkable clarity. To explain their refusal to work in the Party by saying that they \u201care not serfs\u201d is to give themselves away completely, to confess to a total lack of arguments, an utter inability to furnish any motives, any sensible reasons for dissatisfaction. Plekhanov and I declare that their refusal is not justified by anything we have done; we request them to set forth their differences; and all they reply is: \u201cWe are not serfs\u201d (adding that no bargain has yet been reached on the subject of co-optation).\n\nTo the individualism of the intellectual, which already manifested itself in the controversy over Paragraph , revealing its tendency to opportunist argument and anarchistic phrase-mongering, all proletarian organisation and discipline seems to be serfdom. The reading public will soon learn that in the eyes of these \u201cParty members\u201d and Party \u201cofficials\u201d even a new Party Congress is a serf institution that is terrible and abhorrent to the \u201celect minds\u201d.... This \u201cinstitution\u201d is indeed terrible to people who are not averse to making use of the Party title but are conscious that this title of theirs does not accord with the interests and will of the Party.\n\nThe committee resolutions enumerated in my letter to the editors of the new Iskra, and published by Comrade Martov in his State of Siege, show with facts that the behaviour of the minority amounted all along to sheer disobedience of the decisions of the Congress and disorganisation of positive practical work. Consisting of opportunists and people who detested Iskra, the minority strove to rend the Party and damaged and disorganised its work, thirsting to avenge their defeat at the Congress and sensing that by honest and loyal means (by explaining their case in the press or at a congress) they would never succeed in refuting the accusation of opportunism and intellectualist instability which at the Second Congress had been levelled against them. Realising that they could not convince the Party, they tried to gain their ends by disorganising the Party and hampering all its work. They were reproached with having (by their mistakes at the Congress) caused a crack in our pot; they replied to the reproach by trying with all their might to smash the pot altogether.\n\nSo distorted had their ideas become that boycott and refusal to work were proclaimed to be \u201chonest[] methods\u201d of struggle. Comrade Martov is now wriggling all around this delicate point. Comrade Martov is such a \u201cman of principle\u201d that he defends boycott . . . when practised by the minority, but condemns boycott when, his side happening to have become the majority, it threatens Martov himself!\n\nWe need not, I think, go into the question whether this is a squabble or a \u201cdifference of principle\u201d as to what are honest methods of struggle in a Social-Democratic workers\u2019 party.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful attempts (of October  and ) to obtain an explanation from the comrades who had started the \u201cco-optation\u201d row, nothing remained for the central institutions but to wait and see what would come of their verbal assurances that they would adhere to loyal methods of struggle. On October , the Central Committee addressed a circular letter to the League (see League Minutes, pp. -), announcing that it was engaged in drafting Rules for the League and inviting the League members to assist. The Administration of the League had at that time decided against a congress of that body (by two votes to one; ibid., p. ). The replies received from minority supporters to this circular showed at once that the celebrated promise to be loyal and abide by the decisions of the Congress was just talk, and that, as a matter of fact, the minority had positively decided not to obey the central institutions of the Party, replying to their appeals to collaborate with evasive excuses full of sophistry and anarchistic phrase-mongering. In reply to the famous open letter of Deutsch, a member of the Administration (p. ), Plekhanov, myself, and other supporters of the majority expressed our vigorous \"protest against the gross violations of Party discipline by which an official of the League permits himself to hamper the organisational activities of a Party institution and calls upon other comrades likewise to violate discipline and the Rules. Remarks such as, \u2019I do not consider myself at liberty to take part in such work on the invitation of the Central Committee\u2019, or, \u2019Comrades, we must on no account allow it [The Central Committee] to draw up new Rules for the League\u2019, etc., are agitational methods of a kind that can only arouse disgust in anyone who has the slightest conception of the meaning of the words party, organisation, and party discipline. Such methods are all the more disgraceful for the fact that they are being used against a newly created Party institution and are therefore an undoubted attempt to undermine confidence in it among Party comrades, and that, moreover, they are being employed under the cachet of a member of the League Administration and behind the back of the Central Committee.\u201d (p. .)\n\nUnder such conditions, the League Congress promised to be nothing but a brawl.\n\nFrom the outset, Comrade Martov continued his Congress tactics of \u201cgetting personal\u201d, this time with Comrade Plekhanov, by distorting private conversations. Comrade Plekhanov protested, and Comrade Martov was obliged to withdraw his accusations (League Minutes, pp.  and ), which were a product of either irresponsibility or resentment.\n\nThe time for the report arrived. I had been the League\u2019s delegate at the Party Congress. A mere reference to the summary of my report (p.  et seq.)[] will show the reader that I gave a rough outline of that analysis of the voting at the Congress which, in greater detail, forms the contents of the present pamphlet. The central feature of the report was precisely the proof that, owing to their mistakes, Martov and Co. had landed in the opportunist wing of our Party. Although this report was made to an audience whose majority consisted of violent opponents, they could discover absolutely nothing in it which departed from loyal methods of Party struggle and controversy.\n\nMartov\u2019s report, on the contrary, apart from minor \u201ccorrections\u201d to particular points of my account (the incorrectness of these corrections we have shown above), was nothing but\u2014a product of disordered nerves.\n\nNo wonder that the majority refused to carry on the fight in this atmosphere. Comrade Plekhanov entered a protest against the \u201cscene\u201d (p. )\u2014it was indeed a regular \"scene \"!\u2014and withdrew from the Congress without stating the objections he had already prepared on the substance of the report. Nearly all the other supporters of the majority also withdrew from the Congress, after filing a written protest against the \u201cunworthy behaviour\u201d of Comrade Martov (League Minutes, p. ).\n\nThe methods of struggle employed by the minority became perfectly clear to all. We had accused the minority of committing a political mistake at the Congress, of having swung towards opportunism, of having formed a coalition with the Bundists, the Akimovs, the Brouck\u00e8res, the Egorovs, and the Makhovs. The minority had been defeated at the Congress, and they had now \u201cworked out\u201d two methods of struggle, embracing all their endless variety of sorties, assaults, attacks, etc.\n\nFirst method\u2014disorganising all the activity of the Party, damaging the work, hampering all and everything \u201cwithout statement of reasons\u201d.\n\nSecond method\u2014making \u201cscenes\u201d, and so on and so forth.[][] I have already pointed out that it would be unwise to attribute to sordid motives even the most sordid manifestations of the squabbling that is so habitual in the atmosphere of \u00e9migr\u00e9 and exile colonies. It is a sort of epidemic disease engendered by abnormal conditions of life, disordered nerves, and so on. I had to give a true picture of this system of struggle here, because Comrade Martov has again resorted to it in its full scope in his \" State of Siege\". \u2014Lenin\nThis \u201csecond method of struggle\u201d is also apparent in the League\u2019s famous resolutions of \u201cprinciple\u201d, in the discussion of which the \u201cmajority\u201d, of course, took no part. Let us examine these resolutions, which Comrade Martov has reproduced in his State of Siege.\n\nThe first resolution, signed by Comrades Trotsky, Fomin, Deutsch, and others, contains two theses directed against the \u201cmajority\u201d of the Party Congress: ) \u201cThe League expresses its profound regret that, owing to the manifestation at the Congress of tendencies which essentially run counter to the earlier policy of Iskra, due care was not given in drafting the Party Rules to providing sufficient safeguards of the independence and authority of the Central Committee.\u201d (League Minutes, p. .)\n\nAs we have already seen, this thesis of \u201cprinciple\u201d amounts to nothing but Akimov phrase-mongering, the opportunist character of which was exposed at the Party Congress even by Comrade Popov! In point of fact, the claim that the \u201cmajority\u201d did not mean to safeguard the independence and authority of the Central Committee was never anything but gossip. It need only be mentioned that when Plekhanov and I were on the editorial board, there was on the Council no predominance of the Central Organ over the Central Committee, but when the Martovites joined the editorial board, the Central Organ secured predominance over the Central Committee on the Council! When we were on the editorial board, practical workers in Russia predominated on the Council over writers residing abroad; since the Martovites took over, the contrary has been the case. When we were on the editorial board, the Council never once attempted to interfere in any practical matter; since the unanimous co-optation such interference has begun, as the reading public will learn in detail in the near future.\n\nNext thesis of the resolution we are examining: \u201c. . . when constituting the official central bodies of the Party, the Congress ignored the need for maintaining continuity with the actually existing central bodies....\u201d\n\nThis thesis boils down to nothing but the question of the personal composition of the central bodies. The \u201cminority\u201d preferred to evade the fact that at the Congress the old central bodies had proved their unfitness and committed a number of mistakes. But most comical of all is the reference to \u201ccontinuity\u201d with respect to the Organising Committee. At the Congress, as we have seen, nobody even hinted that the entire membership of the Organising Committee should be endorsed. At the Congress, Martov actually cried in a frenzy that a list containing three members of the Organising Committee was defamatory to him. At the Congress, the final list proposed by the \u201cminority\u201d contained one member of the Organising Committee (Popov, Glebov or Fomin, and Trotsky), whereas the list the \u201cmajority\u201d put through contained two members of the Organising Committee out of three (Travinsky, Vasilyev, and Glebov). We ask, can this reference to \u201ccontinuity\u201d really be considered a \u201cdifference of principle\u201d?\n\nLet us pass to the other resolution, which was signed by four members of the old editorial board, headed by Comrade Axelrod. Here we find all those major accusations against the \u201cmajority\u201d which have subsequently been repeated many times in the press. They can most conveniently be examined as formulated by the members of the editorial circle. The accusations are levelled against \u201cthe system of autocratic and bureaucratic government of the Party\u201d, against \u201cbureaucratic centralism\u201d, which, as distinct from \u201cgenuinely Social-Democratic centralism\u201d, is defined as follows: it \u201cplaces in the forefront, not internal union, but external, formal unity, achieved and maintained by purely mechanical means, by the systematic suppression of individual initiative and independent social activity\u201d; it is therefore \u201cby its very nature incapable of organically uniting the component elements of society\u201d.\n\nWhat \u201csociety\u201d Comrade Axelrod and Co. are here referring to, heaven alone knows. Apparently, Comrade Axelrod was not quite clear himself whether he was penning a Zemstvo address on the subject of desirable government reforms, or pouring forth the complaints of the \u201cminority\u201d. What is the implication of \u201cautocracy\u201d in the Party, about which the dissatisfied \u201ceditors\u201d clamour? Autocracy means the supreme, uncontrolled, non-accountable, non-elective rule of one individual. We know very well from the literature of the \u201cminority\u201d that by autocrat they mean me, and no one else. When the resolution in question was being drafted and adopted, I was on the Central Organ together with Plekhanov. Consequently, Comrade Axelrod and Co. were expressing the conviction that Plekhanov and all the members of the Central Committee \u201cgoverned the Party\u201d, not in accordance with their own views of what the interests of the work required, but in accordance with the will of the autocrat Lenin. This accusation of autocratic government necessarily and inevitably implies pronouncing all members of the governing body except the autocrat to be mere tools in the hands of another, mere pawns and agents of another\u2019s will. And once again we ask, is this really a \u201cdifference of principle\u201d on the part of the highly respected Comrade Axelrod?\n\nFurther, what external, formal unity are they here talking about, our \u201cParty members\u201d just returned from a Party Congress whose decisions they have solemnly acknowledged valid? Do they know of any other method of achieving unity in a party organised on any at all durable basis, except a party congress? If they do, why have they not the courage to declare frankly that they no longer regard the Second Congress as valid? Why do they not try to tell us their new ideas and new methods of achieving unity in a supposedly organised party?\n\nFurther, what \u201csuppression of individual initiative\u201d are they talking about, our individualist intellectuals whom the Central Organ of the Party has just been exhorting to set forth their differences, but who instead have engaged in bargaining about \u201cco-optation\u201d? And, in general, how could Plekhanov and I, or the Central Committee, have suppressed the initiative and independent activity of people who refused to engage in any \u201cactivity\u201d in conjunction with us? How can anyone be \u201csuppressed\u201d in an institution or body in which he refuses to have any part? How could the unelected editors complain of a \u201csystem of government\u201d when they refused to \"be governed \"? We could not have committed any errors in directing our comrades for the simple reason that they never worked under our direction at all.\n\nIt is clear, I think, that the cries about this celebrated bureaucracy are just a screen for dissatisfaction with the personal composition of the central bodies, a fig-leaf to cover up the violation of a pledge solemnly given at the Congress. You are a bureaucrat because you were appointed by the Congress not in accordance with my wishes, but against them; you are a formalist because you take your stand on the formal decisions of the Congress, and not on my consent; you are acting in a grossly mechanical way because you cite the \u201cmechanical\u201d majority at the Party Congress and pay no heed to my wish to be co-opted; you are an autocrat because you refuse to hand over the power to the old snug little band who insist on their circle \u201ccontinuity\u201d all the more because they do not like the explicit disapproval of this circle spirit by the Congress.\n\nThese cries about bureaucracy have never had any real meaning except the one I have indicated.[] [] It is enough to point out that Comrade Plekhanov ceased to be a supporter of \u201cbureaucratic centralism\u201d in the eyes of the minority once he put through the beneficent co-optation. \u2014LeninAnd this method of struggle only proves once again the intellectualist instability of the minority. They wanted to convince the Party that the selection of the central bodies was unfortunate. And how did they go about it? By criticism of Iskra as conducted by Plekhanov and me? No, that they were unable to offer. The method they used consisted in the refusal of a section of the Party to work under the direction of the hated central bodies. But no central institution of any party in the world can ever prove its ability to direct people who refuse to accept its direction. Refusal to accept the direction of the central bodies is tantamount to refusing to remain in the Party, it is tantamount to disrupting the Party; it is a method of destroying, not of convincing. And these efforts to destroy instead of convince show their lack of consistent principles, lack of faith in their own ideas.\n\nThey talk of bureaucracy. The word bureaucracy might be translated into Russian as concentration on place and position. Bureaucracy means subordinating the interests of the work to the interests of one\u2019s own career; it means focusing attention on places and ignoring the work itself; it means wrangling over co-optation instead of fighting for ideas. That bureaucracy of this kind is undesirable and detrimental to the Party is unquestionably true, and I can safely leave it to the reader to judge which of the two sides now contending in our Party is guilty of such bureaucracy.... They talk about grossly mechanical methods of achieving unity. Unquestionably, grossly mechanical methods are detrimental; but I again leave it to the reader to judge whether a grosser and more mechanical method of struggle of a new trend against an old one can be imagined than installing people in Party institutions before the Party has been convinced of the correctness of their new views, and before these views have even been set forth to the Party.\n\nBut perhaps the catchwords of the minority do mean something in principle, perhaps they do express some special group of ideas, irrespective of the petty and particular cause which undoubtedly started the \u201cswing\u201d in the present case? Perhaps if we were to set aside the wrangling over \u201cco-optation\u201d, these catchwords might turn out to be an expression of a different system of views?\n\nLet us examine the matter from this angle. Before doing so, we must place on record that the first to attempt such an examination was Comrade Plekhanov at the League, who pointed out the minority\u2019s swing towards anarchism and opportunism, and that Comrade Martov (who is now highly offended because not everyone is ready to admit that his position is one of principle[] [] Nothing could be more comical than the new Iskra\u2019s grievance that Lenin refuses to see any differences of principle, or denies them. If your attitude had been based more on principle, you would the sooner have examined my repeated statements that you have swung towards opportunism. If your position had been based more on principle, you could not well have degraded an ideological struggle to a squabble over places. You have only yourselves to blame, for you hava yourselves done everything to make it impossible to regard you as men of principle. Take Comrade Martov, for example: when speaking in his State of Siege, of the League Congress, he says nothing about the dispute with Plekhanov over anarchism, but instead informs us that Lenin is a super-centre, that Lenin has only to wink his eye to have the centre issue orders, that the Central Committee rode rough-shod over the League, etc. I have no doubt that by picking his topic in this way, Comrade Martov displayed the profundity of his ideals and principles. \u2014Lenin) preferred completely to ignore this incident in his State of Siege.\n\nAt the League Congress the general question was raised as to whether Rules that the League or a committee may draw up for itself are valid without the Central Committee\u2019s endorsement, and even if the Central Committee refuses to endorse them. Nothing could be clearer, one would think: Rules are a formal expression of organisation, and, according to Paragraph  of our Party Rules, the right to organise committees is explicitly vested in the Central Committee; Rules define the limits of a committee\u2019s autonomy, and the decisive voice in defining those limits belongs to the central and not to a local institution of the Party. That is elementary, and it was sheer childishness to argue with such an air of profundity that \u201corganising\u201d does not always imply \u201cendorsing Rules\u201d (as if the League itself had not of its own accord expressed the wish to be organised on the basis of formal Rules). But Comrade Martov has forgotten (temporarily, let us hope) even the ABC of Social-Democracy. In his opinion, the demand that Rules should be endorsed only indicated that \u201cthe earlier, revolutionary Iskra centralism is being replaced by bureaucratic centralism\u201d (League Minutes, p. ), and there, in fact\u2014Comrade Martov declared in the same speech\u2014lay the \u201cprinciple\u201d at issue (p. )\u2014a principle which he preferred to ignore in his State of Siege!\n\nComrade Plekhanov answered Martov at once, requesting that expressions like bureaucracy, Jack-in-office, etc., be refrained from as \u201cdetracting from the dignity of the Congress\u201d (p. ). There followed an interchange with Comrade Martov, who regarded these expressions as \u201ca characterisation of a certain trend from the standpoint of principle\u201d. At that time, Comrade Plekhanov, like all the other supporters of the majority, took these expressions at their real value, clearly realising that they related exclusively to the realm, if we may so put it, of \u201cco-optation\u201d, and not of principle. However, he deferred to the insistence of the Martovs and Deutsches (pp. -) and proceeded to examine their supposed principles from the standpoint of principle. \u201cIf that were so,\u201d said he (that is, if the committees were autonomous in shaping their organisation, in drawing up their Rules), \"they would be autonomous in relation to the whole, to the Party. That is not even a Bundist view, it is a downright anarchistic view. That is just how the anarchists argue: the rights of individuals are unlimited; they may conflict; every individual determines the limits of his rights for himself. The limits of autonomy should be determined not by the group itself, but by the whole of which it forms a part. The Bund was a striking instance of the violation of this principle. Hence, the limits of autonomy are determined by the Congress, or by the highest body set up by the Congress. The authority of the central institution should rest on moral and intellectual prestige. There I, of course, agree. Every representative of the organisation must be concerned for the moral prestige of its institution. But it does not follow that, while prestige in necessary, authority is not.... To counterpoise the power of authority to the power of ideas is anarchistic talk, which should have no place here\" (p. ). These propositions are as elementary as can be, they are in fact axioms, which it was strange even to put to the vote (p. ), and which were called in question only because \u201cconcepts have now been confused\u201d (loc. cit). But the minority\u2019s intellectualist individualism had, inevitably, driven them to the point of wanting to sabotage the Congress, to refuse to submit to the majority; and that wish could not be justified except by anarchistic talk. It is very amusing to note that the minority had nothing to offer in reply to Plekhanov but complaints of his use of excessively strong words, like opportunism, anarchism, and so forth. Plekhanov quite rightly poked fun at these complaints by asking why \u201cthe words Jauresism and anarchism are not permissible, and the words l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 and Jack-in-office are\u201d. No answer was given. This quaint sort of quid pro quo is always happening to Comrades Martov, Axelrod, and Co.: their new catchwords clearly bear the stamp of vexation; any reference to the fact offends them\u2014they are, you see, men of principle; but, they are told, if you deny on principle that the part should submit to the whole, you are anarchists, and again they are offended!\u2014the expression is too strong! In other words, they want to give battle to Plekhanov, but only on condition that he does not hit back in earnest!\n\nHow many times Comrade Martov and various other \u201cMensheviks\u201d[] have convicted me, no less childishly, of the following \u201ccontradiction\u201d. They quote a passage from What Is To Be Done? or A Letter to a Comrade which speaks of ideological influence, a struggle for influence, etc., and contrast it to the \u201cbureaucratic\u201d method of inflyencing by means of the Rules, to the \u201cautocratic\u201d tendency to rely on authority, and the like. How na\u00efve they are! They have already forgotten that previously our Party was not a formally organised whole, but merely a sum of separate groups, and therefore no other relations except those of ideological influence were possible between these groups. Now we have become an organised Party, and this implies the establishment of authority, the transformation of the power of ideas into the power of authority, the subordination of lower Party bodies to higher ones. Why, it positively makes one uncomfortable to have to chew over such elementary things for the benefit of old associates, especially when one feels that at the bottom of it all is simply the minority\u2019s refusal to submit to the majority in the matter of the elections! But from the standpoint of principle these endless exposures of my contradictions boil down to nothing but anarchistic phrase-mongering. The new Iskra is not averse to enjoying the title and rights of a Party institution, but it does not want to submit to the majority of the Party.\n\nIf the talk about bureaucracy contains any principle at all, if it is not just an anarchistic denial of the duty of the part to submit to the whole, then what we have here is the principle of opportunism, which seeks to lessen the responsibility of individual intellectuals to the party of the proletariat, to lessen the influence of the central institutions, to enlarge the autonomy of the least steadfast elements in the Party, to reduce organisational relations to a purely platonic and verbal acceptance of them. We saw this at the Party Congress, where the Akimovs and Liebers made exactly the same sort of speeches about \u201cmonstrous\u201d centralism as poured from the lips of Martov and Co. at the League Congress. That opportunism leads to the Martov and Axelrod \u201cviews\u201d on organisation by its very nature, and not by chance, and not in Russia alone but the world over, we shall see later, when examining Comrade Axelrod\u2019s article in the new Iskra.\n\nP. Little Annoyances Should Not Stand in the Way of a Big Pleasure\nThe League\u2019s rejection of the resolution declaring that its Rules must be endorsed by the Central Committee (League Minutes, p. ) was, as the Party Congress majority at once unanimously noted, a \u201ccrying violation of the Party Rules\u201d. Regarded as the act of men of principle, this violation was sheer anarchism; while in the atmosphere of the post-Congress struggle, it inevitably created the impression that the Party minority were trying to \u201csettle scores\u201d with the Party majority (League Minutes, p. ); it meant that they did not wish to obey the Party or to remain within the Party. And when the League refused to adopt a resolution on the Central Committee statement calling for changes in its Rules (pp. -), it inevitably followed that this assembly, which wanted to be counted an assembly of a Party organisation but at the same time not to obey the Party\u2019s central institution, had to be pronounced unlawful. Accordingly, the followers of the Party majority at once withdrew from this quasi-Party assembly, so as not to have any share in an indecent farce.\n\nThe individualism of the intellectual, with its platonic acceptance of organisational relations, which was revealed in the lack of steadfastness over Paragraph  of the Rules thus in practice reached the logical end I had predicted even in September, that is, a month and a half before, namely, the point of disrupting the Party organisation. And at that moment, on the evening of the day the League Congress ended, Comrade Plekhanov announced to his colleagues on both the Party\u2019s central institutions that he could not bear to \u201cfire on his comrades\u201d, that \u201crather than have a split, it is better to put a bullet in one\u2019s brain\u201d, and that, to avert a greater evil, it was necessary to make the maximum personal concessions, over which, in point of fact (much more than over the principles to be discerned in the incorrect position on Paragraph ), this destructive struggle was being waged. In order to give a more accurate characterisation of Comrade Plekhanov\u2019s right-about-face, which has acquired a certain general Party significance, I consider it advisable to rely not on private conversations, nor on private letters (that last resort in extremity), but on Plekhanov\u2019s own statement of the case to the whole Party, namely, his article \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d in No.  of Iskra, which was written just after the League Congress, after I had resigned from the editorial board of the Central Organ (November , ), and before the co-optation of the Martovites (November , ).\n\nThe fundamental idea of \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d is that in politics one must not be too stiff-necked, too harsh and unyielding; that it is sometimes necessary, to avoid a split, to yield even to revisionists (among those moving towards us or among the inconsistents) and to anarchistic individualists. It was only natural that these abstract generalities should arouse universal perplexity among Iskra readers. One cannot help laughing when reading the proud and majestic statements of Comrade Plekhanov (in subsequent articles) that he had not been understood because of the novelty of his ideas and because people lacked a knowledge of dialectics. In reality, \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d could only be understood, at the time it was written, by some dozen people living in two Geneva suburbs whose names both begin with the same letter.[] Comrade Plekhanov\u2019s misfortune was that he put into circulation among some ten thousand readers an agglomeration of hints, reproaches, algebraical symbols, and riddles which were intended only for these dozen or so people who had taken part in all the developments of the post-Congress struggle with the minority. This misfortune befell Comrade Plekhanov because he violated a basic principle of that dialectics to which he so unluckily referred, namely, that there is no abstract truth, that truth is always concrete. That is why it was out of place to lend an abstract form to the perfectly concrete idea of yielding to the Martovites after the League Congress.\n\nYielding\u2014which Comrade Plekhanov advocated as a new war-cry\u2014is legitimate and essential in two cases: when the yielder is convinced that those who are striving to make him yield are in the right (in which case, honest political leaders frankly and openly admit their mistake), or when an irrational and harmful demand is yielded to in order to avert a greater evil. It is perfectly clear from the article in question that it is the latter case the author has in mind: he speaks plainly of yielding to revisionists and anarchistic individualists (that is, to the Martovites, as every Party member now knows from the League Minutes), and says that it is essential in order to avert a split. As we see, Comrade Plekhanov\u2019s supposedly novel idea amounts to no more than the not very novel piece of commonplace wisdom that little annoyances should not be allowed to stand in the way of a big pleasure, that a little opportunist folly and a little anarchistic talk is better than a big Party split. When Comrade Plekhanov wrote this article he clearly realised that the minority represented the opportunist wing of our Party and that they were fighting with anarchistic weapons. Comrade Plekhanov came forward with the plan to combat this minority by means of personal concessions, just as (again si licet parva componere magnis) the German Social-Democrats combated Bernstein. Bebel publicly declared at congresses of his Party that he did not know anyone who was so susceptible to the influence of environment as Comrade Bernstein (not Mr. Bernstein, as Comrade Plekhanov was once so fond of calling him, but Comrade Bernstein): let us take him into our environment, let us make him a member of the Reichstag, let us combat revisionism, not by inappropriate harshness (\u00e0 la Sobakevich-Parvus) towards the revisionist, but by \u201ckilling him with kindness\u201d\u2014as Comrade M. Beer, I recall, put it at a meeting of English Social-Democrats when defending German conciliatoriness, peaceableness, mildness, flexibility, and caution against the attack of the English Sobakevich\u2014Hyndman. And in just the same way, Comrade Plekhanov wanted to \u201ckill with kindness\u201d the little anarchism and the little opportunism of Comrades Axelrod and Martov. True while hinting quite plainly at the \u201canarchistic individualists\u201d, Comrade Plekhanov expressed himself in a deliberately vague way about the revisionists; he did so in a manner to create the impression that he was referring to the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, who were swinging from opportunism towards orthodoxy, and not to Axelrod and Martov, who had begun to swing from orthodoxy towards revisionism. But this was only an innocent military ruse,[] [] There was never any question after the Party Congress of making concessions to Comrades Martynov, Akimov, and Brouck\u00e8re. I am not aware that they too demanded \u201cco-optation\u201d. I even doubt whether Comrade Starover or Comrade Martov consulted Comrade Brouck\u00e8re when they sent us their epistles and \u201cnotes\u201d? in the name of \u201chalf the Party\u201d. . . . At the League Congress Comrade Martov rejected, with the profound indignation of an unbending political stalwart the very idea of a \u201cunion with Ryazanov or Martynov\u201d, of the possibility of a \u201cdeal\u201d with them, or even of joint \u201cservice to the Party\u201d (as an editor; League Minutes, p. ). At the League Congress Comrade Martov sternly condemned \u201cMartynov tendencies\u201d (p. ), and when Comrade Orthodox[] subtly hinted that Axelrod and Martov no doubt \u201cconsider that Comrades Akimov, Martynov, and others also have the right to get together, draw up Rules for themselves, and act in accordance with them as they see fit\u201d (p. ), the Martovites denied it, as Peter denied Christ (p. : \u201cComrade Orthodox\u2019s fears\u201d \u201cregarding the Akimovs, Martynovs, etc.\u201d, \u201chave no foundation\u201d). \u2014Lenina feeble bulwark that was incapable of withstanding the artillery fire of Party publicity.\n\nAnd anyone who acquaints himself with the actual state of affairs at the political juncture we are describing, anyone who gains an insight into Comrade Plekhanov\u2019s mentality, will realise that I could not have acted in this instance otherwise than I did. I say this for the benefit of those supporters of the majority who have reproached me for surrendering the editorial board. When Comrade Plekhanov swung round after the League Congress and from being a supporter of the majority became a supporter of reconciliation at all costs, I was obliged to put the very best interpretation on it. Perhaps Comrade Plekhanov wanted in his article to put forward a programme for an amicable and honest peace? Any such programme boils down to a sincere admission of mistakes by both sides. What was the mistake Comrade Plekhanov laid at the door of the majority? An inappropriate, Sobakevich-like, harshness towards the revisionists. We do not know what Comrade Plekhanov had in mind by that: his witticism about the asses, or his extremely incautious\u2014in Axelrod\u2019s presence\u2014reference to anarchism and opportunism. Comrade Plekhanov preferred to express himself \u201cabstractly\u201d, and, moreover, with a hint at the other fellow. That is a matter of taste, of course. But, after all, I had admitted my personal harshness openly both in the letter to the Iskra-ist and at the League Congress. How then could I refuse to admit that the majority were guilty of such a \u201cmistake\u201d? As to the minority, Comrade Plekhanov pointed to their mistake quite clearly, namely, revisionism (cf. his remarks about opportunism at the Party Congress and about Jauresism at the League Congress) and anarchism which had led to the verge of a split. Could I obstruct an attempt to secure an acknowledgement of these mistakes and undo their harm by means of personal concessions and \u201ckindness\u201d in general? Could I obstruct such an attempt when Comrade Plekhanov in \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d directly appealed to us to \"spare the adversaries \" among the revisionists who were revisionists \u201conly because of a certain inconsistency\u201d? And if I did not believe in this attempt, could I do otherwise than make a personal concession regarding the Central Organ and move over to the Central Committee in order to defend the position of the majority?[] [] Comrade Martov put it very aptly when he said that I had moved over avec armes et bagages. Comrade Martov is very fond of military metaphors: campaign against the League, engagement, incurable wounds, etc., etc. To tell the truth, I too have a great weakness for military metaphors especially just now, when one follows the news from the Pacific with such eager interest. But, Comrade Martov, if we are to use military language, the story goes like this. We capture two forts at the Party Congress. You attack them at the League Congress. After the first brief interchange of shots, my colleague, the commandant of one of the forts, opens the gates to the enemy. Naturally, I gather together the little artillery I have and move into the other fort, which is practically unfortified, in order to \u201cstand siege\u201d against the enemy\u2019s overwhelming numbers. I even make an offer of peace for what chance do I stand against two powers? But in reply to my offer, the new allies bombard my last fort. I return the fire. Where upon my former colleague\u2014the commandant\u2014exclaims in magnificent indignation: \u201cJust look, good people, how bellicose this Chamberlain is!\u201d \u2014LeninI could not absolutely deny the feasibility of such attempts and take upon myself the full onus for the threatening split, if only because I had myself been inclined, in the letter of October , to attribute the wrangle to \u201cpersonal irritation\u201d. But I did consider, and still consider, it my political duty to defend the position of the majority. To rely in this on Comrade Plekhanov would have been difficult and risky, for everything went to show that he was prepared to interpret his dictum that \u201ca leader of the proletariat has no right to give rein to his warlike inclinations when they run counter to political good sense\u201d\u2014to interpret it in a dialectical way to mean that if you had to fire, then it was better sense (considering the state of the weather in Geneva in November) to fire at the majority.... To defend the majority\u2019s position was essential, because, when dealing with the question of the free (?) will of a revolutionary, Comrade Plekhanov\u2014in defiance of dialectics, which demands a concrete and comprehensive examination\u2014modestly evaded the question of confidence in a revolutionary, of confidence in a \u201cleader of the proletariat\u201d who was leading a definite wing of the Party. When speaking of anarchistic individualism and advising us to close our eyes \u201cat times\u201d to violations of discipline and to yield \u201csometimes\u201d to intellectualist license, which \u201cis rooted in a sentiment that has nothing to do with devotion to the revolutionary idea\u201d, Comrade Plekhanov apparently forgot that we must also reckon with the free will of the majority of the Party, and that it must be left to the practical workers to determine the extent of the concessions to be made to the anarchistic individualists. Easy as it is to fight childish anarchistic nonsense on the literary plane, it is very difficult to carry on practical work in the same organisation with an anarchistic individualist.A writer who took it upon himself to determine the extent of the concessions that might be made to anarchism in practice would only be betraying his inordinate and truly doctrinaire literary conceit. Comrade Plekhanov majestically remarked (for the sake of importance, as Bazarov[] used to say) that if a new split were to occur the workers would cease to understand us; yet at the same time he initiated an endless stream of articles in the new Iskra whose real and concrete meaning was bound to be incomprehensible not only to the workers, but to the world at large. It is not surprising that when a member of the Central Committee read the proofs of \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d he warned Comrade Plekhanov that his plan to somewhat curtail the size of a certain publication (the minutes of the Party Congress and the League Congress) would be defeated by this very article, which would excite curiosity, offer for the judgement of the man in the street something that was piquant and at the same time quite incomprehensible to him,[] [] We are having a heated and passionate argument in private. Suddenly one of us jumps in, flings open the window, and begins to clamour against Sobakeviches, anarchistic individualists, revisionists, etc. Naturally, a crowd of curious idlers gathers in the street and our enemies rub their hands in glee. Other of the disputants go to the window too and want to give a coherent account of the whole matter, without hinting at things nobody knows anything about. Thereupon the window is banged to on the plea that it is not worth while discussing squabbles (Iskra, No. , p. , col. , line  up). It was not worth while beginning in \" Iskra\" on a discussion of \u201csquabbles\u201d, Comrade Plekhanov[]\u2014that would be nearer the truth! \u2014Leninand inevitably cause people to ask in perplexity: \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d It is not surprising that owing to the abstractness of its arguments and the vagueness of its hints, this article of Comrade Plekhanov\u2019s caused jubilation in the ranks of the enemies of Social-Democracy\u2014the dancing of the cancan in the columns of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya and ecstatic praises from the consistent revisionists in Osvobozhdeniye. The source of all these comical and sad misunderstandings, from which Comrade Plekhanov later tried so comically and so sadly to extricate himself, lay precisely in the violation of that basic principle of dialectics: concrete questions should be examined in all their concreteness. The delight of Mr. Struve, in particular, was quite natural: he was not in the least interested in the \u201cgood\u201d aims (killing with kindness) which Comrade Plekhanov pursued (but might not achieve); Mr. Struve welcomed, and could not but welcome, that swing towards the opportunist wing of our Party which had begun in the new Iskra, as everybody can now plainly see. The Russian bourgeois democrats are not the only ones to welcome every swing to wards opportunism, even the slightest and most temporary, in any Social-Democratic party. The estimate of a shrewd enemy is very rarely based on sheer misunderstanding: you can tell a man\u2019s mistakes by the people who praise him. And it is in vain that Comrade Plekhanov hopes the reader will be inattentive and tries to make out that the majority unconditionally objected to a personal concession in the matter of co-optation, and not to a desertion from the Left wing of the Party to the Right. The point is not that Comrade Plekhanov made a personal concession in order to avert a split (that was very praiseworthy), but that, though fully realising the need to join issue with the inconsistent revisionists and anarchistic individualists, he chose instead to join issue with the majority, with whom he parted company over the extent of the possible practical concessions to anarchism. The point is not that Comrade Plekhanov changed the personal composition of the editorial board, but that he betrayed his position of opposing revisionism and anarchism and ceased to defend that position in the Central Organ of the Party.\n\nAs to the Central Committee, which at this time was the sole organised representative of the majority, Comrade Plekhanov parted company with it then exclusively over the possible extent of practical concessions to anarchism. Nearly a month had elapsed since November , when my resignation had given a free hand to the policy of killing with kindness. Comrade Plekhanov had had every opportunity, through all sorts of contacts, to test the expedience of this policy. Comrade Plekhanov had in this period published his article \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d, which was\u2014and remains\u2014the Martovites\u2019 sole ticket of admittance, so to speak, to the editorial board. The watchwords\u2014revisionism (which we should contend with, but sparing the adversary) and anarchistic individualism (which should be courted and killed with kindness)\u2014were printed on this ticket in imposing italics. Do come in, gentlemen, please, I will kill you with kindness\u2014is what Comrade Plekhanov said by this invitation card to his new colleagues on the editorial board. Naturally, all that remained to the Central Committee was to say its last word (that is what ultimatum means\u2014a last word as to a possible peace) about what, in its opinion, was the permissible extent of practical concessions to anarchistic individualism. Either you want peace\u2014in which case here are a certain number of seats to prove our kindness, peaceableness, readiness to make concessions, etc. (we cannot allow you any more if peace is to be guaranteed in the Party, peace not in the sense of an absence of controversy, but in the sense that the Party will not be destroyed by anarchistic individualism); take these seats and swing back again little by little from Akimov to Plekhanov. Or else you want to maintain and develop your point of view, to swing over altogether to Akimov (if only in the realm of organisational questions), and to convince the Party that you, not Plekhanov, are right\u2014in which case form a writers\u2019 group of your own, secure representation at the next Congress, and set about winning a majority by an honest struggle, by open controversy. This alternative, which was quite explicitly submitted to the Martovites in the Central Committee ultimatum of November ,  (see State of Siege and Commentary on the League Minutes[] ), was in full harmony with the letter Plekhanov and I had sent to the former editors on October , : either it is a matter of personal irritation (in which case, if the worst comes to the worst, we might even \u201cco-opt\u201d), or it is a matter of a difference of principle (in which case you must first convince the Party, and only then talk about changing the personal composition of the central bodies). The Central Committee could the more readily leave it to the Martovites to make this delicate choice for themselves since at this very time Comrade Martov in his profession de foi (Once More in the Minority) wrote the following:\n\n\u201cThe minority lay claim to only one honour, namely, to be the first in the history of our Party to show that one can be \u2019defeated\u2019 and yet not form a new party. This position of the minority follows from all their views on the organisational development of the Party; it follows from the consciousness of their strong ties with the Party\u2019s earlier work. The minority do not believe in the mystic power of \u2019paper revolutions\u2019, and see in the deep roots which their endeavours have in life a guarantee that by purely ideological propaganda within the Party they will secure the triumph of their principles of organisation.\u201d (My italics.)\n\nWhat proud and magnificent words! And how bitter it was to be taught by events that they were\u2014merely words.... I hope you will forgive me, Comrade Martov, but now I claim on behalf of the majority this \u201chonour\u201d which you have not deserved. The honour will indeed be a great one, one worth fighting for, for the circles have left us the tradition of an extraordinarily light-hearted attitude towards splits and an extraordinarily zealous application of the maxim: \u201ceither coats off, or let\u2019s have your hand!\u201d\n\nThe big pleasure (of having a united Party) was bound to outweigh, and did outweigh, the little annoyances (in the shape of the squabbling over co-optation). I resigned from the Central Organ, and Comrade Y (who had been delegated by Plekhanov and myself to the Party Council on behalf of the editorial board of the Central Organ) resigned from the Council. The Martovites replied to the Central Committee\u2019s last word as to peace with a letter (see publications mentioned) which was tantamount to a declaration of war. Then, and only then, did I write my letter to the editorial board (Iskra, No. ) on the subject of publicity.[] If it comes to talking about revisionism and discussing inconsistency, anarchistic individualism, and the defeat of various leaders, then, gentlemen, let us tell all that occurred, without reservation\u2014that was the gist of this letter about publicity. The editorial board replied with angry abuse and the lordly admonition: do not dare to stir up \"the pettiness and squabbling of circle life \" (Iskra, No. ). Is that so, I thought to myself: \u201cthe pettiness and squabbling of circle life\u201d?... Well, es ist mir recht, gentlemen, there I agree with you. Why, that means that you directly class all this fuss over \u201cco-optation\u201d as circle squabbling. That is true. But what discord is this?\u2014in the editorial of this same issue, No. , this same editorial board (we must suppose) talks about bureaucracy, formalism, and the rest.[] [] As it subsequently turned out, the \u201cdiscord\u201d was explained very simply\u2014it was a discord among the editors of the Central Organ. It was Plekhanov who wrote about \u201csquabbling\u201d (see his admission in \u201cA Sad Misunderstanding\u201d, No. ), while the editorial, \u201cOur Congress\u201d, was written by Martov (State of Siege, p. ). They were tugging in different directions. \u2014LeninDo not dare to raise the question of the fight for co-optation to the Central Organ, for that would be squabbling. But we will raise the question of co-optation to the Central Committee, and will not call it squabbling, but a difference of principle on the subject of \u201cformalism\u201d. No, dear comrades, I said to myself, permit me not to permit you that. You want to fire at my fort, and yet demand that I surrender my artillery. What jokers you are! And so I wrote and published outside of Iskra my Letter to the Editors (Why I Resigned from the \u201cIskra\u201d Editorial Board),[] briefly relating what had really occurred, and asking yet again whether peace was not possible on the basis of the following division: you take the Central Organ, we take the Central Committee. Neither side will then feel \u201calien\u201d in the Party, and we will argue about the swing towards opportunism, first in the press, and then, perhaps, at the Third Party Congress.\n\nIn reply to this mention of peace the enemy opened fire with all his batteries, including even the Council. Shells rained on my head. Autocrat, Schweitzer,[] bureaucrat, formalist, supercentre, one-sided, stiff-necked, obstinate, narrow-minded, suspicious, quarrelsome.... Very well, my friends! Have you finished? You have nothing more in reserve? Poor ammunition, I must say....\n\nNow comes my turn. Let us examine the content of the new Iskra\u2019s new views on organisation and the relation of these views to that division of our Party into \u201cmajority\u201d and \u201cminority\u201d the true character of which we have shown by our analysis of the debates and voting at the Second Congress.\n\nQ. The New Iskra.\nOpportunism In Questions Of Organisation\nAs the basis for an analysis of the principles of the new Iskra we should unquestionably take the two articles of Comrade Axelrod.[] The concrete meaning of some of his favourite catchwords has already been shown at length. Now we must try to leave their concrete meaning on one side and delve down to the line of thought that caused the \u201cminority\u201d to arrive (in connection with this or that minor and petty matter) at these particular slogans rather than any others, must examine the principles behind these slogans, irrespective of their origin, irrespective of the question of \u201cco-optation\u201d. Concessions are all the fashion nowadays, so let us make a concession to Comrade Axelrod and take his \u201ctheory\u201d \u201cseriously\u201d.\n\nComrade Axelrod\u2019s basic thesis (Iskra , No ) is that \"from the very outset our movement harboured two opposite trends, whose mutual antagonism could not fail to develop and to affect the movement parallel with its own development\". To be specific: \u201cIn principle, the proletarian aim of the movement [in Russia] is the same as that of western Social-Democracy.\u201d But in our country the masses of the workers are influenced \u201cby a social element alien to them\u201d, namely, the radical intelligentsia. And so, Comrade Axelrod establishes the existence of an antagonism between the proletarian and the radical-intellectual trend in our Party.\n\nIn this Comrade Axelrod is undoubtedly right. The existence of such an antagonism (and not in the Russian Social-Democratic Party alone) is beyond question. What is more, everyone knows that it is this antagonism that largely accounts for the division of present-day Social-Democracy into revolutionary (also known as orthodox) and opportunist (revisionist, ministerialist, reformist) Social-Democracy, which during the past ten years of our movement has become fully apparent in Russia too. Everyone also knows that the proletarian trend of the movement is expressed by orthodox Social-Democracy, while the trend of the democratic intelligentsia is expressed by opportunist Social-Democracy.\n\nBut, after so closely approaching this piece of common knowledge, Comrade Axelrod begins timidly to back away from it. He does not make the slightest attempt to analyse how this division manifested itself in the history of Russian Social-Democracy in general, and at our Party Congress in particular, although it is about the Congress that he is writing! Like all the other editors of the new Iskra, Comrade Axelrod displays a mortal fear of the minutes of this Congress. This should not surprise us after all that has been said above, but in a \u201ctheoretician\u201d who claims to be investigating the different trends in our movement it is certainly a queer case of truth-phobia. Backing away, because of this malady, from the latest and most accurate material on the trends in our movement, Comrade Axelrod seeks salvation in the sphere of pleasant daydreaming. He writes: \u201cHas not legal Marxism, or semi-Marxism, provided our liberals with a literary leader? Why should not prankish history provide revolutionary bourgeois democracy with a leader from the school of orthodox, revolutionary Marxism?\u201d All we can say about this daydream which Comrade Axelrod finds so pleasant is that if history does sometimes play pranks, that is no excuse for pranks of thought on the part of people who undertake to analyse history. When the liberal peeped out from under the cloak of the leader of semi-Marxism, those who wished (and were able) to trace his \u201ctrend\u201d did not allude to possible pranks of history, but pointed to tens and hundreds of instances of that leader\u2019s mentality and logic, to all those characteristics of his literary make-up which betrayed the reflection of Marxism in bourgeois literature.[] And if Comrade Axelrod, setting out to analyse \u201cthe general-revolutionary and the proletarian trend in our movement\u201d, could produce nothing, absolutely nothing, in proof or evidence that certain representatives of that orthodox wing of the Party which he so detests showed such and such a trend, he thereby issued a formal certificate of his own poverty. Comrade Axelrod\u2019s case must be weak indeed if all he can do is allude to possible pranks of history!\n\nComrade Axelrod\u2019s other allusion\u2014to the \u201cJacobins\u201d\u2014is still more revealing. Comrade Axelrod is probably aware that the division of present-day Social-Democracy into revolutionary and opportunist has long since given rise\u2014and not only in Russia\u2014to \u201chistorical parallels with the era of the great French Revolution\u201d. Comrade Axelrod is probably aware that the Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy everywhere and always resort to the terms \u201cJacobinism\u201d, \u201cBlanquism\u201d, and so on to describe their opponents. Let us then not imitate Comrade Axelrod\u2019s truth-phobia, let us consult the minutes of our Congress and see whether they offer any material for an analysis and examination of the trends we are considering and the parallels we are discussing.\n\nFirst example: the Party Congress debate on the programme. Comrade Akimov (\u201cfully agreeing\u201d with Comrade Martynov) says: \u201cThe clause on the capture of political power [the dictatorship of the proletariat] has been formulated in such a way\u2014as compared with the programmes of all other Social-Democratic parties\u2014that it may be interpreted, and actually has been interpreted by Plekhanov, to mean that the role of the leading organisation will relegate to the background the class it is leading and separate the former from the latter. Consequently, the formulation of our political tasks is exactly the same as in the case of Narodnaya Volya.\u201d (Minutes, p. .) Comrade Plekhanov and other Iskra-ists take issue with Comrade Akimov and accuse him of opportunism. Does not Comrade Axelrod find that this dispute shows us (in actual fact, and not in the imaginary pranks of history) the antagonism between the present-day Jacobins and the present-day Girondists of Social-Democracy? And was it not because he found himself in the company of the Girondists of Social-Democracy (owing to the mistakes he committed) that Comrade Axelrod began talking about Jacobins?\n\nSecond example: Comrade Posadovsky declares that there is a \u201cserious difference of opinion\u201d over the \u201cfundamental question\u201d of \u201cthe absolute value of democratic principles\u201d (p. ). Together with Plekhanov, he denies their absolute value. The leaders of the \u201cCentre\u201d or Marsh (Egorov) and of the anti-Iskra-ists (Goldblatt) vehemently oppose this view and accuse Plekhanov of \u201cimitating bourgeois tactics\u201d (p. ). This is exactly Comrade Axelrod\u2019s idea of a connection between orthodoxy and the bourgeois trend, the only difference being that in Axelrod\u2019s case it is vague and general, whereas Goldblatt linked it up with specific issues. Again we ask: does not Comrade Axelrod find that this dispute, too, shows us palpably, at our Party Congress, the antagonism between the Jacobins and the Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy? Is it not because he finds himself in the company of the Girondists that Comrade Axelrod raises this outcry against the Jacobins?\n\nThird example: the debate on Paragraph  of the Rules. Who is it that defends \"the proletarian trend in our movement \"? Who is it that insists that the worker is not afraid of organisation, that the proletarian has no sympathy for anarchy, that he values the incentive to organise? Who is it that warns us against the bourgeois intelligentsia, permeated through and through with opportunism? The Jacobins of Social-Democracy. And who is it that tries to smuggle radical intellectuals into the Party? Who is it that is concerned about professors, high-school students, free lances, the radical youth? The Girondist Axelrod together with the Girondist Lieber.\n\nHow clumsily Comrade Axelrod defends himself against the \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d that at our Party Congress was openly levelled at the majority of the Emancipation of Labour group! By taking up the hackneyed Bernsteinian refrain about Jacobinism, Blanquism, and so on, he defends himself in a manner that only bears out the accusation! He shouts about the menace of the radical intellectuals in order to drown out his own speeches at the Party Congress, which were full of concern for these intellectuals.\n\nThese \u201cdreadful words\u201d\u2014Jacobinism and the rest\u2014are expressive of opportunism and nothing else. A Jacobin who wholly identifies himself with the organisation of the proletariat\u2014a proletariat conscious of its class interests\u2014is a revolutionary Social-Democrat. A Girondist who sighs after professors and high-school students, who is afraid of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and who yearns for the absolute value of democratic demands is an opportunist. It is only opportunists who can still detect a danger in conspiratorial organisations today, when the idea of confining the political struggle to conspiracy has been refuted thousands of times in the press and has long been refuted and swept aside by the realities of life, and when the cardinal importance of mass political agitation has been elucidated and reiterated to the point of nausea. The real basis of this fear of conspiracy, of Blanquism, is not any feature to be found in the practical movement (as Bernstein and Co. have long, and vainly, been trying to make out), but the Girondist timidity of the bourgeois intellectual, whose mentality so often shows itself among the Social-Democrats of today. Nothing could be more comical than these laborious efforts of the new Iskra to utter a new word of warning (uttered hundreds of times before) against the tactics of the French conspirator revolutionaries of the forties and sixties (No. , editorial).[] In the next issue of Iskra, the Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy will no doubt show us a group of French conspirators of the forties for whom the importance of political agitation among the working masses, the importance of the labour press as the principal means by which the party influences the class, was an elementary truth they had learned and assimilated long ago.\n\nHowever, the tendency of the new Iskra to repeat the elements and go back to the ABC while pretending to be uttering something new is not fortuitous; it is an inevitable consequence of the situation Axelrod and Martov find themselves in, now that they have landed in the opportunist wing of our Party. There is nothing for it. They have to repeat the opportunist phrases, they have to go back, in order to try to find in the remote past some sort of justification for their position, which is indefensible from the point of view of the struggle at the Congress and of the shades and divisions in the Party that took shape there.To the Akimovite profundities about Jacobinism and Blanquism, Comrade Axelrod adds Akimovite lamentations to the effect that not only the \u201cEconomists\u201d, but the \u201cpoliticians\u201d as well, were \u201cone-sided\u201d, excessively \u201cinfatuated\u201d, and so on and so forth. Reading the high-flown disquisitions on this subject in the new Iskra, which conceitedly claims to be above all this one-sidedness and infatuation, one asks in perplexity: whose portrait is it they are painting? where is it that they hear such talk?[] Who does not know that the division of the Russian Social-Democrats into Economists and politicians has long been obsolete? Go through the files of Iskra for the last year or two before the Party Congress, and you will find that the fight against \u201cEconomism\u201d subsided and came to an end altogether as far back as ; you will find, for example, that in July  (No. ), \u201cthe times of Economism\u201d are spoken of as being \u201cdefinitely over\u201d, Economism is considered \u201cdead and buried\u201d, and any infatuations of the politicians are regarded as obvious atavism. Why, then, do the new editors of Iskra revert to this dead and buried division? Did we fight the Akimovs at the Congress on account of the mistakes they made in Rabocheye Dyelo two years ago? If we had, we should have been sheer idiots. But everyone knows that we did not, that it was not for their old, dead and buried mistakes in Rabocheye Dyelo that we fought the Akimovs at the Congress, but for the new mistakes they committed in their arguments and their voting at the Congress. It was not by their stand in Rabocheye Dyelo, but by their stand at the Congress, that we judged which mistakes were really a thing of the past and which still lived and called for controversy. By the time of the Congress the old division into Economists and politicians no longer existed; but various opportunist trends continued to exist. They found expression in the debates and voting on a number of issues, and finally led to a new division of the Party into \u201cmajority\u201d and \u201cminority\u201d. The whole point is that the new editors of Iskra are, for obvious reasons, trying to gloss over the connection between this new division and contemporary opportunism in our Party, and are, in consequence, compelled to go back from the new division to the old one. Their inability to explain the political origin of the new division (or their desire, in order to prove how accommodating they are, to cast a veil[] [] See Plekhanov\u2019s article on \u201cEconomism\u201d in No.  of Iskra. The subtitle of the article appears to contain a slight misprint. Instead of \u201cReflections on the Second Party Congress\u201d, it should apparently read, \u201con the League Congress\u201d, or even \u201con Co-optation\u201d. However appropriate concessions to personal claims may be under certain circumstances, it is quite inadmissible (from the Party, not the philistine standpoint) to confuse the issues that are agitating the Party and to substitute for the new mistake of Martov and Axelrod, who have begun to swing from orthodoxy towards opportunism, the old mistake (never recalled today by anyone except the new Iskra) of the Martynovs and Akimovs, who perhaps may now be prepared to swing from opportunism towards orthodoxy on many questions of programme and tactics. \u2014Leninover its origin) compels them to keep harping on a division that has long been obsolete. Everyone knows that the new division is based on a difference over questions of organisation, which began with the controversy over principles of organisation (Paragraph  of the Rules) and ended up with a \u201cpractice\u201d worthy of anarchists. The old division into Economists and politicians was based mainly on a difference over questions of tactics.\n\nIn its efforts to justify this retreat from the more complex, truly topical and burning issues of Party life to issues that have long been settled and have now been dug up artificially, the new Iskra resorts to an amusing display of profundity for which there can be no other name than tail-ism. Started by Comrade Axelrod, there runs like a crimson thread through all the writing of the new Iskra the profound \u201cidea\u201d that content is more important than form, that programme and tactics are more important than organisation, that \u201cthe vitality of an organisation is in direct proportion to the volume and value of the content it puts into the movement\u201d, that centralism is not an \u201cend in itself\u201d, not an \u201call-saving talisman\u201d, etc., etc. Great and profound truths! The programme is indeed more important than tactics, and tactics more important than organisation. The alphabet is more important than etymology, and etymology more important than syntax\u2014but what would we say of people who, after failing in an examination in syntax, went about pluming and priding themselves on being left in a lower class far another year? Comrade Axelrod argued about principles of organisation like an opportunist (Paragraph ), and behaved inside the organisation like an anarchist (League Congress)\u2014and now he is trying to render Social-Democracy more profound. Sour grapes! What is organisation, properly speaking? Why, it is only a form. What is centralism? After all, it is not a talisman. What is syntax? Why, it is less important than etymology; it is only the form of combining the elements of etymology.... \u201cWill not Comrade Alexandrov agree with us,\u201d the new editors of Iskra triumphantly ask, \u201cwhen we say that the Congress did much more for the centralisation of Party work by drawing up a Party programme than by adopting Rules, however perfect the latter may seem?\u201d (No. , Supplement.) It is to be hoped that this classical utterance will acquire a historic fame no less wide and no less lasting than Comrade Krichevsky\u2019s celebrated remark that Social-Democracy, like mankind, always sets itself only such tasks as it can perform. For the new Iskra\u2019s piece of profundity is of exactly the same stamp. Why was Comrade Krichevsky\u2019s phrase held up to derision? Because he tried to justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Democrats in matters of tactics\u2014their inability to set correct political tasks\u2014by a commonplace which he wanted to palm off as philosophy. In exactly the same way the new Iskra tries to justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Democrats in matters of organisation\u2014the intellectualist instability of certain comrades, which has led them to the point of anarchistic phrase-mongering\u2014by the commonplace that the programme is more important than the Rules, that questions of programme are more important than questions of organisation! What is this but tail-ism? What is it but pluming oneself on having been left in a lower class for another year?\n\nThe adoption of a programme contributes more to the centralisation of the work than the adoption of Rules. How this commonplace, palmed off as philosophy, reeks of the mentality of the radical intellectual, who has much more in common with bourgeois decadence than with Social-Democracy! Why, the word centralisation is used in this famous phrase in a sense that is nothing but symbolical. If the authors of the phrase are unable or disinclined to think, they might at least have recalled the simple fact that the adoption of a programme together with the Bundists, far from leading to the centralisation of our common work, did not even save us from a split. Unity on questions of programme and tactics is an essential but by no means a sufficient condition for Party unity, for the centralisation of Party work (good God, what elementary things one has to spell out nowadays, when all concepts have been confused!). The latter requires, in addition, unity of organisation, which, in a party that has grown to be anything more than a mere family circle, is inconceivable without formal Rules, without the subordination of the minority to the majority and of the part to the whole. As long as we had no unity on the fundamental questions of programme and tactics, we bluntly admitted that we were living in a period of disunity and separate circles, we bluntly declared that before we could unite, lines of demarcation must be drawn; we did not even talk of the forms of a joint organisation, but exclusively discussed the new (at that time they really were new) problems of fighting opportunism on programme and tactics. At present, as we all agree, this fight has already produced a sufficient degree of unity, as formulated in the Party programme and the Party resolutions on tactics; we had to take the next step, and, by common consent, we did take it, working out the forms of a united organisation that would merge all the circles together. But now these forms have been half destroyed and we have been dragged back, dragged back to anarchistic conduct, to anarchistic phrases, to the revival of a circle in place of a Party editorial board. And this step back is being justified on the plea that the alphabet is more helpful to literate speech than a knowledge of syntax!\n\nThe philosophy of tail-ism, which flourished three years ago in questions of tactics, is being resurrected today in relation to questions of organisation. Take the following argument of the new editors. \u201cThe militant Social-Democratic trend in the Party,\u201d says Comrade Alexandrov, \u201cshould be maintained not only by an ideological struggle, but by definite forms of organisation.\u201d Whereupon the editors edifyingly remark: \u201cNot bad, this juxtaposition of ideological struggle and forms of organisation. The ideological struggle is a process, whereas the forms of organisation are only . . . forms [believe it or not, that is what they say\u2014No. , Supplement, p. , bottom of col. !] designed to clothe a fluid and developing content\u2014the developing practical work of the Party.\u201d That is positively in the style of the joke about a cannon-ball being a cannon-ball and a bomb a bomb! The ideological struggle is a process, whereas the forms of organisation are only forms clothing the content! The point at issue is whether our ideological struggle is to have forms of a higher type to clothe it, the forms of a party organisation, binding on all, or the forms of the old disunity and the old circles. We have been dragged back from higher to more primitive forms, and this is being justified on the plea that the ideological struggle is a process, whereas forms\u2014are only forms. That is just how Comrade Krichevsky in bygone days tried to drag us back from tactics-as-a-plan to tactics-as-a-process.\n\nTake the new Iskra\u2019s pompous talk about the \u201cself-training of the proletariat\u201d, directed against those who are supposed to be in danger of missing the content because of the form (No. , editorial). Is this not Akimovism No. ? Akimovism No.  justified the backwardness of a section of the Social-Democratic intelligentsia in formulating tactical tasks by talking about the more \u201cprofound\u201d content of \u201cthe proletarian struggle\u201d and the self-training of the proletariat. Akimovism No.  justifies the backwardness of a section of the Social-Democratic intelligentsia in the theory and practice of organisation by equally profound talk about organisation being merely a form and the self-training of the proletariat the important thing. Let me tell you gentlemen who are so solicitous about the younger brother that the proletariat is not afraid of organisation and discipline! The proletariat will do nothing to have the worthy professors and high-school students who do not want to join an organisation recognised as Party members merely because they work under the control of an organisation. The proletariat is trained for organisation by its whole life, far more radically than many an intellectual prig. Having gained some understanding of our programme and our tactics, the proletariat will not start justifying backwardness in organisation by arguing that the form is less important than the content. It is not the proletariat, but certain intellectuals in our Party who lack self-training in the spirit of organisation and discipline, in the spirit of hostility and contempt for anarchistic talk. When they say that it is not ripe for organisation, the Akimovs No.  libel the proletariat just as the Akimovs No.  libelled it when they said that it was not ripe for the political struggle. The proletarian who has become a conscious Social-Democrat and feels himself a member of the Party will reject tail-ism in matters of organisation with the same contempt as he rejected tail-ism in matters of tactics.\n\nFinally, consider the profound wisdom of the new Iskra\u2019s \u201cPractical Worker\u201d. \u201cProperly understood,\u201d he says, \u201cthe idea of a \u2019militant\u2019 centralist organisation uniting and centralising the revolutionaries\u2019 activities [the italics are to make it look more profound] can only materialise naturally if such activities exist [both new and clever!]; organisation itself, being a form [mark that!], can only grow simultaneously [the italics are the author\u2019s, as throughout this quotation] with the growth of the revolutionary work which is its content.\u201d (No. .) Does not this remind you very much of the character in the folktale who, on seeing a funeral, cried: \u201cMany happy returns of the day\u201d? I am sure there is not a practical worker (in the genuine sense of the term) in our Party who does not understand that it is precisely the form of our activities (i.e., our organisation) that has long been lagging, and lagging desperately, behind their content, and that only the Simple Simons in the Party could shout to people who are lagging: \"Keep in line; don\u2019t run ahead !\" Compare our Party, let us say, with the Bund. There can be no question but that the content[] [] I leave quite aside the fact that the content of our Party work was mapped out at the Congress (in the programme, etc.) in the spirit of revolutionary Social-Democracy only at the cost of a struggle, a struggle against those very anti-Iskra-ists and that very Marsh whose representatives numerically predominate in our \u201cminority\u201d. On this question of \u201ccontent\u201d it would be interesting also to compare, let us say, six issues of the old Iskra (Nos. -) with twelve issues of the new Iskra (Nos. -). But that will have to wait for some other time. \u2014Leninof the work of our Party is immeasurably richer, more varied, broader, and deeper than is the case with the Bund. The scope of our theoretical views is wider, our programme more developed, our influence among the mass of the workers (and not merely among the organised artisans) broader and deeper, our propaganda and agitation more varied; the pulse of the political work of both leaders and rank and file is more lively, the popular movements during demonstrations and general strikes more impressive, and our work among the non-proletarian strata more energetic. But the \u201cform\u201d? Compared with the Bund\u2019s, the \u201cform\u201d of our work is lagging unpardonably, lagging so that it is an eyesore and brings a blush of shame to the cheeks of anyone who does not merely \u201cpick his teeth\u201d when contemplating the affairs of his Party. The fact that the organisation of our work lags behind its content is our weak point, and it was our weak point long before the Congress, long before the Organising Committee was formed. The lame and undeveloped character of the form makes any serious step in the further development of the content impossible; it causes a shameful stagnation, leads to a waste of energy, to a discrepancy between word and deed. We have all been suffering wretchedly from this discrepancy, yet along come the Axelrods and \u201cPractical Workers\u201d of the new Iskra with their profound precept: the form must grow naturally, only simultaneously with the content!\n\nThat is where a small mistake on the question of organisation (Paragraph ) will lead you if you try to lend profundity to nonsense and to find philosophical justification for opportunist talk. Marching slowly, in timid zigzags![]\u2014we have heard this refrain in relation to questions of tactics; we are hearing it again in relation to questions of organisation. Tail-ism in questions of organisation is a natural and inevitable product of the mentality of the anarchistic individualist when he starts to elevate his anarchistic deviations (which at the outset may have been accidental) to a system of views, to special differences of principle. At the League Congress we witnessed the beginnings of this anarchism; in the new Iskra we are witnessing attempts to elevate it to a system of views. These attempts strikingly confirm what was already said at the Party Congress about the difference between the points of view of the bourgeois intellectual who attaches himself to the Social-Democratic movement and the proletarian who has become conscious of his class interests. For instance, this same \u201cPractical Worker\u201d of the new Iskra with whose profundity we are already familiar denounces me for visualising the Party \u201cas an immense factory\u201d headed by a director in the shape of the Central Committee (No. , Supplement). \u201cPractical Worker\u201d never guesses that this dreadful word of his immediately betrays the mentality of the bourgeois intellectual unfamiliar with either the practice or the theory of proletarian organisation. For the factory, which seems only a bogey to some, represents that highest form of capitalist co-operation which has united and disciplined the proletariat, taught it to organise, and placed it at the head of all the other sections of the toiling and exploited population. And Marxism, the ideology of the proletariat trained by capitalism, has been and is teaching unstable intellectuals to distinguish between the factory as a means of exploitation (discipline based on fear of starvation) and the factory as a means of organisation (discipline based on collective work united by the conditions of a technically highly developed form of production). The discipline and organisation which come so hard to the bourgeois intellectual are very easily acquired by the proletariat just because of this factory \u201cschooling\u201d. Mortal fear of this school and utter failure to understand its importance as an organising factor are characteristic of the ways of thinking which reflect the petty-bourgeois mode of life and which give rise to the species of anarchism that the German Social-Democrats call Edelanarchismus, that is, the anarchism of the \u201cnoble\u201d gentleman, or aristocratic anarchism, as I would call it. This aristocratic anarchism is particularly characteristic of the Russian nihilist. He thinks of the Party organisation as a monstrous \u201cfactory\u201d; he regards the subordination of the part to the whole and of the minority to the majority as \u201cserfdom\u201d (see Axelrod\u2019s articles); division of labour under the direction of a centre evokes from him a tragi-comical outcry against transforming people into \u201ccogs and wheels\u201d (to turn editors into contributors being considered a particularly atrocious species of such transformation); mention of the organisational Rules of the Party calls forth a contemptuous grimace and the disdainful remark (intended for the \u201cformalists\u201d) that one could very well dispense with Rules altogether.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, it was a didactic remark of just this sort that Comrade Martov addressed to me in Iskra, No. , quoting, for greater weight, my own words inA Letter to a Comrade. Well, what is it if not \u201caristocratic anarchism\u201d and tail-ism to cite examples from the era of disunity, the era of the circles, to justify the preservation and glorification of the circle spirit and anarchy in the era of the Party?\n\nWhy did we not need Rules before? Because the Party consisted of separate circles without any organisational tie between them. Any individual could pass from one circle to another at his own \u201csweet will\u201d, for he was not faced with any formulated expression of the will of the whole. Disputes within the circles were not settled according to Rules, \"but by struggle and threats to resign \", as I put it in A Letter to a Comrade,[] summarising the experience of a number of circles in general and of our own editorial circle of six in particular. In the era of the circles, this was natural and inevitable, but it never occurred to anybody to extol it, to regard it as ideal; everyone complained of the disunity, everyone was distressed by it and eager to see the isolated circles fused into a formally constituted party organisation. And now that this fusion has taken place, we are being dragged back and, under the guise of higher organisational views, treated to anarchistic phrase-mongering! To people accustomed to the loose dressing-gown and slippers of the Oblomov[] circle domesticity, formal Rules seem narrow, restrictive, irksome, mean, and bureaucratic, a bond of serfdom and a fetter on the free \u201cprocess\u201d of the ideological struggle. Aristocratic anarchism cannot understand that formal Rules are needed precisely in order to replace the narrow circle ties by the broad Party tie. It was unnecessary and impossible to give formal shape to the internal ties of a circle or the ties between circles, for these ties rested on personal friendship or on an instinctive \u201cconfidence\u201d for which no reason was given. The Party tie cannot and must not rest on either of these; it must be founded on formal, \u201cbureaucratically\u201d worded Rules (bureaucratic from the standpoint of the undisciplined intellectual), strict adherence to which can alone safeguard us from the wilfulness and caprices characteristic of the circles, from the circle wrangling that goes by the name of the free \u201cprocess\u201d of the ideological struggle.\n\nThe editors of the new Iskra try to trump Alexandrov with the didactic remark that \u201cconfidence is a delicate thing and cannot be hammered into people\u2019s hearts and minds\u201d (No. , Supplement). The editors do not realise that by this talk about confidence, naked confidence, they are once more betraying their aristocratic anarchism and organisational tail-ism. When I was a member of a circle only\u2014whether it was the circle of the six editors or the Iskra organisation\u2014I was entitled to justify my refusal, say, to work with X merely on the grounds of lack of confidence, without stating reason or motive. But now that I have become a member of a party, I have no right to plead lack of confidence in general, for that would throw open the doors to all the freaks and whims of the old circles; I am obliged to give formal reasons for my \u201cconfidence\u201d or \u201clack of confidence\u201d, that is, to cite a formally established principle of our programme, tactics or Rules; I must not just declare my \u201cconfidence\u201d or \u201clack of confidence\u201d without giving reasons, but must acknowledge that my decisions\u2014and generally all decisions of any section of the Party\u2014have to be accounted for to the whole Party; I am obliged to adhere to a formally prescribed procedure when giving expression to my \u201clack of confidence\u201d or trying to secure the acceptance of the views and wishes that follow from this lack of confidence. From the circle view that \u201cconfidence\u201d does not have to be accounted for, we have already risen to the Party view which demands adherence to a formally prescribed procedure of expressing, accounting for, and testing our confidence; but the editors try to drag us back, and call their tail-ism new views on organisation!\n\nListen to the way our so-called Party editors talk about writers\u2019 groups that might demand representation on the editorial board. \u201cWe shall not get indignant and begin to shout about discipline\u201d, we are admonished by these aristocratic anarchists who have always and everywhere looked down on such a thing as discipline. We shall either \u201carrange the matter\u201d (sic!) with the group, if it is sensible, or just laugh at its demands.\n\nDear me, what a lofty and noble rebuff to vulgar \u201cfactory\u201d formalism! But in reality it is the old circle phraseology furbished up a little and served up to the Party by an editorial board which feels that it is not a Party institution, but the survival of an old circle. The intrinsic falsity of this position inevitably leads to the anarchistic profundity of elevating the disunity they hypocritically proclaim to be past and gone to a principle of Social-Democratic organisation. There is no need for any hierarchy of higher and lower Party bodies and authorities\u2014aristocratic anarchism regards such a hierarchy as the bureaucratic invention of ministries, departments, etc. (see Axelrod\u2019s article); there is no need for the part to submit to the whole; there is no need for any \u201cformal bureaucratic\u201d definition of Party methods of \u201carranging matters\u201d or of delimiting differences. Let the old circle wrangling be sanctified by pompous talk about \u201cgenuinely Social-Democratic\u201d methods of organisation.\n\nThis is where the proletarian who has been through the school of the \u201cfactory\u201d can and should teach a lesson to anarchistic individualism. The class-conscious worker has long since emerged from the state of infancy when he used to fight shy of the intellectual as such. The class-conscious worker appreciates the richer store of knowledge and the wider political outlook which he finds among Social-Democratic intellectuals. But as we proceed with the building of a real party, the class-conscious worker must learn to distinguish the mentality of the soldier of the proletarian army from the mentality of the bourgeois intellectual who parades anarchistic phrases; he must learn to insist that the duties of a Party member be fulfilled not only by the rank and file, but by the \u201cpeople at the top\u201d as well; he must learn to treat tail-ism in matters of organisation with the same contempt as he used, in days gone by, to treat tail-ism in matters of tactics!\n\nInseparably connected with Girondism and aristocratic anarchism is the last characteristic feature of the new Iskra\u2019s attitude towards matters of organisation, namely, its defence of autonomism as against centralism. This is the meaning in principle (if it has any such meaning[] [] I leave aside here, as in this section generally, the \u201cco-optational\u201d meaning of this outcry. \u2014Lenin) of its outcry against bureaucracy and autocracy, of its regrets about \u201can undeserved disregard for the non-Iskra-ists\u201d (who defended autonomism at the Congress), of its comical howls about a demand for \u201cunquestioning obedience\u201d, of its bitter complaints of \u201cJack-in-office rule\u201d, etc., etc. The opportunist wing of any party always defends and justifies all backwardness, whether in programme, tactics, or organisation. The new Iskra\u2019s defence of backwardness in organisation (its tail-ism) is closely connected with the defence of autonomism. True, autonomism has, generally speaking, been so discredited already by the three years\u2019 propaganda work of the old Iskra that the new Iskra is ashamed, as yet, to advocate it openly; it still assures us of its sympathy for centralism, but shows it only by printing the word centralism in italics. Actually, it is enough to apply the slightest touch of criticism to the \u201cprinciples\u201d of the \u201cgenuinely Social-Democratic\u201d (not anarchistic?) quasi-centralism of the new Iskra for the autonomist standpoint to be detected at every step. Is it not now clear to all and sundry that on the subject of organisation Axelrod and Martov have swung over to Akimov? Have they not solemnly admitted it themselves in the significant words, \u201cundeserved disregard for the non-Iskra-ists\u201d? And what was it but autonomism that Akimov and his friends defended at our Party Congress?\n\nIt was autonomism (if not anarchism) that Martov and Axelrod defended at the League Congress when, with amusing zeal, they tried to prove that the part need not submit to the whole, that the part is autonomous in defining its relation to the whole, that the Rules of the League, in which that relation is formulated, are valid in defiance of the will of the Party majority, in defiance of the will of the Party centre. And it is autonomism that Comrade Martov is now openly defending in the columns of the new Iskra (No. ) in the matter of the right of the Central Committee to appoint members to the local committees. I shall not speak of the puerile sophistries which Comrade Martov used to defend autonomism at the League Congress, and is still using in the new Iskra[] [] In enumerating various paragraphs of the Rules, Comrade Martov omitted the one which deals with the relation of the whole to the part: the Central Committee \u201callocates the Party forces\u201d (Paragraph ). Can one allocate forces without transferring people from one committee to another? It is positively awkward to have to dwell on such elementary things. \u2014Lenin\u2014the important thing here is to note the undoubted tendency to defend autonomism against centralism, which is a fundamental characteristic of opportunism in matters of organisation.\n\nPerhaps the only attempt to analyse the concept bureaucracy is the distinction drawn in the new Iskra (No. ) between the \u201cformal democratic principle\u201d (author\u2019s italics) and the \u201cformal bureaucratic principle\u201d. This distinction (which, unfortunately, was no more developed or explained than the reference to the non-Iskra-ists) contains a grain of truth. Bureaucracy versus democracy is in fact centralism versus autonomism; it is the organisational principle of revolutionary Social-Democracy as opposed to the organisational principle of opportunist Social-Democracy. The latter strives to proceed from the bottom upward, and, therefore, wherever possible and as far as possible, upholds autonomism and \u201cdemocracy\u201d, carried (by the overzealous) to the point of anarchism. The former strives to proceed from the top downward, and upholds an extension of the rights and powers of the centre in relation to the parts. In the period of disunity and separate circles, this top from which revolutionary Social-Democracy strove to proceed organisationally was inevitably one of the circles, the one enjoying most influence by virtue of its activity and its revolutionary consistency (in our case, the Iskra organisation). In the period of the restoration of actual Party unity and dissolution of the obsolete circles in this unity, this top is inevitably the Party Congress, as the supreme organ of the Party; the Congress as far as possible includes representatives of all the active organisations, and, by appointing the central institutions (often with a membership which satisfies the advanced elements of the Party more than the backward and is more to the taste of its revolutionary than its opportunist wing), makes them the top until the next Congress. Such, at any rate, is the case among the Social-Democratic Europeans, although little by little this custom, so abhorrent in principle to anarchists, is beginning to spread\u2014not without difficulty and not without conflicts and squabbles\u2014to the Social-Democratic Asiatics.\n\nIt is highly interesting to note that these fundamental characteristics of opportunism in matters of organisation (autonomism, aristocratic or intellectualist anarchism, tail-ism, and Girondism) are, mutatis mutandis (with appropriate modifications), to be observed in all the Social-Democratic parties in the world, wherever there is a division into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing (and where is there not?). Only quite recently this was very strikingly revealed in the German Social-Democratic Party, when its defeat at the elections in the th electoral division of Saxony (known as the G\u00f6hre incident[] [] G\u00f6hre was returned to the Reichstag on June , , from the th division of Saxony, but after the Dresden Congress[] he resigned his seat. The electorate of the th division, which had fallen vacant on the death of Rosenow, wanted to put forward G\u00f6hre as candidate. The Central Party Executive and the Regional Party Executive for Saxony opposed this, and while they had no formal right to forbid G\u00f6hre\u2019s nomination, they succeeded in getting him to decline. The Social-Democrats were defeated at the polls. \u2014Lenin) brought the question of the principles of party organisation to the fore. That this incident should have become an issue of principle was largely due to the zeal of the German opportunists. Gohre (an ex-parson, author of the fairly well-known book Drei Monate Fabrikarbeiter,[] and one of the \u201cheroes\u201d of the Dresden Congress) is himself an extreme opportunist, and the Sozialistische Monatshefte (Socialist Monthly,)[] the organ of the consistent German opportunists, at once \u201ctook up the cudgels\u201d on his behalf.\n\nOpportunism in programme is naturally connected with opportunism in tactics and opportunism in organisation. The exposition of the \u201cnew\u201d point of view was undertaken by Comrade Wolfgang Heine. To give the reader some idea of ithe political complexion of this typical intellectual, who on joining the Social-Democratic movement brought with him opportunist habits of thought, it is enough to say that Comrade Wolfgang Heine is something less than a German Comrade Akimov and something more than a German Comrade Egorov.\n\nComrade Wolfgang Heine took the field in the Sozialistische Monatshefte with no less pomp than Comrade Axelrod in the new Iskra. The very title of his article is priceless: \u201cDemocratic Observations on the G\u00f6hre Incident\u201d (Sozialistische Monatshefte, No. , April). The contents are no less thunderous. Comrade W. Heine rises up in arms against \u201cencroachments on the autonomy of the constituency\u201d, champions \u201cthe democratic principle\u201d, and protests against the interference of an \u201cappointed authority\u201d (i.e., the Central Party Executive) in the free election of deputies by the people. The point at issue, Comrade W. Heine admonishes us, is not a random incident, but a general \"tendency towards bureaucracy and centralism in the Party \", a tendency, he says, which was to be observed before, but which is now becoming particularly dangerous. It must be \u201crecognised as a principle that the local institutions of the Party are the vehicles of Party life\u201d (a plagiarism on Comrade Martov\u2019s pamphlet Once More in the Minority). We must not \u201caccustom ourselves to having all important political decisions come from one centre\u201d, and must warn the Party against \u201ca doctrinaire policy which loses contact with life\u201d (borrowed from Comrade Martov\u2019s speech at the Party Congress to the effect that \u201clife will assert itself\u201d). Rendering his argument more profound, Comrade W. Heine says: \u201c. . . If we go down to the roots of the matter and leave aside personal conflicts, which here, as everywhere, have played no small part, this bitterness against the revisionists [the italics are the author\u2019s and evidently hint at a distinction between fighting revisionism and fighting revisionists] will be found to be mainly expressive of the distrust of the Party officialdom for \u2019outsiders\u2019 [W. Heine had apparently not yet read the pamphlet about combating the state of siege, and therefore resorted to an Anglicism\u2014Outsidertum ], the distrust of tradition for the unusual, of the impersonal institution for everything individual [see Axelrod\u2019s resolution at the League Congress on the suppression of individual initiative]\u2014in short, of that tendency which we have defined above as a tendency towards bureaucracy and centralism in the Party.\u201d\n\nThe idea of \u201cdiscipline\u201d inspires Comrade W. Heine with a no less noble disgust than Comrade Axelrod.... \u201cThe revisionists,\u201d he writes, \u201chave been accused of lack of discipline for having written for the Sozialistische Monatshefte, an organ whose Social-Democratic character has even been denied because it is not controlled by the Party. This very attempt to narrow down the concept \u2019Social-Democratic\u2019, this insistence on discipline in the sphere of ideological production, where absolute freedom should prevail [remember: the ideological struggle is a process whereas the forms of organisation are only forms], demonstrates the tendency towards bureaucracy and the suppression of individuality.\u201d And W. Heine goes on and on, fulminating against this detestable tendency to create \u201cone big all-embracing organisation, as centralised as possible, one set of tactics, and one theory\u201d, against the demand for \u201cimplicit obedience\u201d, \u201cblind submission\u201d, against \u201coversimplified centralism\u201d, etc., etc., literally \u201c\u00e0 la Axelrod\u201d.\n\nThe controversy started by W. Heine spread, and as there were no squabbles about co-optation in the German Party to obscure that issue, and as the German Akimovs display their complexion not only at congresses, but all the time, in a periodical of their own, the argument soon boiled down to an analysis of the principles of the orthodox and revisionist trends on the question of organisation. Karl Kautsky came forward (in the Neue Zeit, , No. , in the article \"Wahlkreis und Partei \"\u2014\u201cConstituency and Party\u201d) as one of the spokesmen of the revolutionary trend (which, exactly as in our Party, was of course accused of \u201cdictatorship\u201d, \u201cinquisitorial\u201d tendencies, and other dreadful things). W. Heine\u2019s article, he says, \u201cexpresses the line of thought of the whole revisionist trend\u201d. Not only in Germany, but in France and Italy as well, the opportunists are all staunch supporters of autonomism, of a slackening of Party discipline, of reducing it to naught; everywhere their tendencies lead to disorganisation and to perverting \u201cthe democratic principle\u201d into anarchism. \u201cDemocracy does not mean absence of authority,\u201d Karl Kautsky informs the opportunists on the subject of organisation, \u201cdemocracy does not mean anarchy; it means the rule of the masses over their representatives, in distinction to other forms of rule, where the supposed servants of the people are in reality their masters.\u201d Kautsky traces at length the disruptive role played by opportunist autonomism in various countries; he shows that it is precisely the influx of \u201ca great number of bourgeois elements\u201d[] [] Kautsky mentions Jaur\u00e8s as an example. The more these people deviated towards opportunism, the more \u201cthey were bound to consider Party discipline an impermissible constraint on their free personality\u201d. \u2014Lenininto the Social-Democratic movement that is strengthening opportunism, autonomism, and the tendency to violate discipline; and once more he reminds us that \u201corganisation is the weapon that will emancipate the proletariat\u201d, that \u201corganisation is the characteristic weapon of the proletariat in the class struggle\u201d.\n\nIn Germany, where opportunism is weaker than in France or Italy, \"autonomist tendencies have so far led only to more or less passionate declamations against dictators and grand inquisitors, against excommunication[] [] Bannstrahl: excommunication. This is the German equivalent of the Russian \u201cstate of siege\u201d and \u201cemergency laws\u201d. It is the \u201cdreadful word\u201d of the German opportunists. \u2014Leninand heresy-hunting, and to endless cavilling and squabbling, which would only result in endless strife if replied to by the other side\u201d.\n\nIt is not surprising that in Russia, where opportunism in the Party is even weaker than in Germany, autonomist tendencies should have produced fewer ideas and more \u201cpassionate declamations\u201d and squabbling.\n\nIt is not surprising that Kautsky arrives at the following conclusion: \u201cThere is perhaps no other question on which revisionism in all countries, despite its multiplicity of form and hue, is so alike as on the question of organisation.\u201d Kautsky, too, defines the basic tendencies of orthodoxy and revisionism in this sphere with the help of the \u201cdreadful word\u201d: bureaucracy versus democracy. We are told, he says, that to give the Party leadership the right to influence the selection of candidates (for parliament) by the constituencies is \u201ca shameful encroachment on the democratic principle, which demands that all political activity proceed from the bottom upward, by the independent activity of the masses, and not from the top downward, in a bureaucratic way.... But if there is any democratic principle, it is that the majority must have predominance over the minority, and not the other way round....\u201d The election of a member of parliament by any constituency is an important matter for the Party as a whole, which should influence the nomination of candidates, if only through its representatives (Vertrauensmanner ). \u201cWhoever considers this too bureaucratic or centralistic let him suggest that candidates be nominated by the direct vote of the Party membership at large [s\u012bmtliche Parteigenossen ]. If he thinks this is not practicable, he must not complain of a lack of democracy when this function, like many others that concern the Party as a whole, is exercised by one or several Party bodies.\u201d It has long been \u201ccommon law\u201d in the German Party for constituencies to \u201ccome to a friendly understanding\u201d with the Party leadership about the choice of candidates. \u201cBut the Party has grown too big for this tacit common law to suffice any longer. Common law ceases to be law when it ceases to be accepted as a matter of course, when its stipulations, and even its very existence, are called in question. Then it becomes necessary to formulate the law specifically, to codify it\u201d . . . to go over to more \"precise statutory definition[] [] It is highly instructive to compare these remarks of Kautsky\u2019s about the replacement of a tacitly recognised common law by a formally deflned statutory law with that whole \u201cchange-over\u201d which our Party in general, and the editorial board in particular, have been undergoing since the Party Congress. Cf. the speech of V. I. Zasulich (at the League Congress, p.  et seq.), who does not seem to realise the full significance of this change-over. \u2014Lenin[statutarische Festlegung] and, accordingly, greater strictness [gr\u00f6ssere Straffheit ] of organisation\u201d.\n\nThus you have, in a different environment, the same struggle between the opportunist and the revolutionary wing of the Party on the question of organisation, the same conflict between autonomism and centralism, between democracy and \u201cbureaucracy\u201d, between the tendency to relax and the tendency to tighten organisation and discipline, between the mentality of the unstable intellectual and that of the staunch proletarian, between intellectualist individualism and proletarian solidarity. What, one asks, was the attitude to this conflict of bourgeois democracy\u2014not the bourgeois democracy which prankish history has only promised in private to show to Comrade Axelrod some day, but the real and actual bourgeois democracy which in Germany has spokesmen no less shrewd and observant than our own gentlemen of Osvobozhdeniye? German bourgeois democracy at once reacted to the new controversy, and\u2014like Russian bourgeois democracy, like bourgeois democracy everywhere and always\u2014sided solidly with the opportunist wing of the Social-Democratic Party. The Frankfurter Zeitung, leading organ of the German stock exchange, published a thunderous editorial (Frankfurter Zeitung, April , , No. , evening edition) which shows that shameless plagiarising of Axelrod is becoming a veritable disease with the German press. The stern democrats of the Frankfort stock exchange lash out furiously at the \u201cabsolutism\u201d in the Social-Democratic Party, at the \u201cparty dictatorship\u201d, at the \u201cautocratic rule of the Party authorities\u201d, at the \u201cinterdicts\u201d which are intended \u201cconcurrently to chastise revisionism as a whole\u201d (recall the \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d), at the insistence on \u201cblind obedience\u201d, \u201cdeadening discipline\u201d, \u201cservile subordination\u201d, and the transforming of Party members into \u201cpolitical corpses\u201d (that is a good bit stronger than cogs and wheels!). \u201cAll distinctiveness of personality\u201d, the knights of the stock exchange indignantly exclaim at the sight of the undemocratic regime among the Social-Democrats, \"all individuality is to be held in opprobrium, because it is feared that they might lead to the French order of things, to Jaur\u00e8sism and Millerandism, as was stated in so many words by Sindermann, who made the report on the subject\" at the Party Congress of the Saxon Social-Democrats.\n\nAnd so, insofar as the new catchwords of the new Iskra on organisation contain any principles at all, there can be no doubt that they are opportunist principles. This conclusion is confirmed both by the whole analysis of our Party Congress, which divided into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing, and by the example of all European Social-Democratic parties, where opportunism in organisation finds expression in the same tendencies, in the same accusations, and very often in the same catchwords. Of course, the national peculiarities of the various parties and the different political conditions in different countries leave their impress and make German opportunism quite dissimilar from French, French opportunism from Italian, and Italian opportunism from Russian. But the similarity of the fundamental division of all these parties into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing, the similarity of the line of thought and the tendencies of opportunism in organisation stand out clearly in spite of all this difference of conditions.[] [] No one will doubt today that the old division of the Russian Social-Democrats into Economists and politicians on questions of tactics was similar to the division of the whole international Social-Democratic movement into opportunists and revolutionaries, although the difference between Comrades Martynov and Akimov, on the one hand, and Comrades von Vollmar and von Elm or Jaur\u00e9s and Millerand, on the other, is very great. Nor can there be any doubt about the similarity of the main divisions on questions of organisation, in spite of the enormous difference between the conditions of politically unenfranchised and politically free countries. It is extremely charactcristic that the highly principled editors of the new Iskra, while briefly touching on the controversy between Kautsky and Heine (No. ), timidly evaded discussing the trends of principle manifested on questions of organisation by opportunism and orthodoxy generally. \u2014LeninWith large numbers of radical intellectuals in the ranks of our Marxists and our Social-Democrats, the opportunism which their mentality produces has been, and is, bound to exist, in the most varied spheres and in the most varied forms. We fought opportunism on the fundamental problems of our world conception, on the questions of our programme, and the complete divergence of aims inevitably led to an irrevocable break between the Social-Democrats and the liberals who had corrupted our legal Marxism. We fought opportunism on tactical issues, and our divergence with Comrades Krichevsky and Akimov on these less important issues was naturally only temporary, and was not accompanied by the formation of different parties. We must now vanquish the opportunism of Martov and Axelrod on questions of organisation, which are, of course, less fundamental than questions of tactics, let alone of programme, but which have now come to the forefront in our Party life.\n\nWhen we speak of fighting opportunism, we must never forget a characteristic feature of present-day opportunism in every sphere, namely, its vagueness, amorphousness, elusiveness. An opportunist, by his very nature, will always evade taking a clear and decisive stand, he will always seek a middle course, he will always wriggle like a snake between two mutually exclusive points of view and try to \u201cagree\u201d with both and reduce his differences of opinion to petty amendments, doubts, innocent and pious suggestions, and so on and so forth. Comrade Eduard Bernstein, an opportunist in questions of programme, \u201cagrees\u201d with the revolutionary programme of his party, and although he would no doubt like to have it \u201cradically revised\u201d, he considers this untimely, inexpedient, not so important as the elucidation of \u201cgeneral principles\u201d of \u201ccriticism\u201d (which mainly consist in uncritically borrowing principles and catchwords from bourgeois democracy).Comrade von Vollmar, an opportunist in questions of tactics, also agrees with the old tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy and also confines himself mostly to declamations, petty amendments, and sneers rather than openly advocates any definite \u201cministerial\u201d tactics.[] Comrades Martov and Axelrod, opportunists in questions of organisation, have also failed so far to produce, though directly challenged to do so, any definite statement of principles that could be \u201cfixed by statute\u201d; they too would like, they most certainly would like, a \u201cradical revision\u201d of our Rules of Organisation (Iskra, No. , p. , col. ), but they would prefer to devote themselves first to \u201cgeneral problems of organisation\u201d (for a really radical revision of our Rules, which, in spite of Paragraph , are centralist Rules, would inevitably lead, if carried out in the spirit of the new Iskra, to autonomism; and Comrade Martov, of course, does not like to admit even to himself that he tends in principle towards autonomism). Their \u201cprinciples\u201d of organisation therefore display all the colours of the rainbow. The predominant item consists of innocent passionate declamations against autocracy and bureaucracy, against blind obedience and cogs and wheels\u2014declamations so innocent that it is still very difficult to discern in them what is really concerned with principle and what is really concerned with co-optation. But as it goes on, the thing gets worse: attempts to analyse and precisely define this detestable \u201cbureaucracy\u201d inevitably lead to autonomism; attempts to \u201clend profundity\u201d to their stand and vindicate it inevitably lead to justifying backwardness, to tail-ism, to Girondist phrase-mongering. At last there emerges the principle of anarchism, as the sole really definite principle, which for that reason stands out in practice in particular relief (practice is always in advance of theory). Sneering at discipline\u2014autonomism\u2014anarchism\u2014there you have the ladder which our opportunism in matters of organisation now climbs and now descends, skipping from rung to rung and skilfully dodging any definite statement of its principles.[] [] Those who recall the debate on Paragraph  will now clearly see that the mistake committed by Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod over Paragraph  had inevitably to lead, when developed and deepened, to opportunism in matters of organisation. Comrade Martov\u2019s fundamental idea\u2014self-enrolment in the Party\u2014was this same false \u201cdemocracy\u201d, the idea of building the Party from the bottom upward. My idea, on the other hand, was \u201cbureaucratic\u201d in the sense that the Party was to be built from the top downward, from the Party Congress to the individual Party organisations. The mentality of the bourgeois intellectual, anarchistic phrase-mongering, and opportunist, tail-ist profundity were all already displayed in the debate on Paragraph . Comrade Martov says in his State of Siege (p. ) that \u201cnew ideas are beginning to be worked out\u201d by the new Iskra. That is true in the sense that he and Axelrod are really pushing ideas in a new direction, beginning with Paragraph . The only trouble is that this direction is an opportunist one. The more they \u201cwork\u201d in this direction, and the more this work is cleared of squabbling over co-optation, the deeper will they sink in the mire. Comrade Plekhanov already perceived this clearly at the Party Congress, and in his article \u201cWhat Should Not Be Done\u201d warned them once again: I am prepared, he as much as said, even to co-opt you, only don\u2019t continue along this road which can only lead to opportunism and anarchism. Martov and Axelrod would not follow this good advice: What? Not continue along this road? Agree with Lenin that the co-optation clamour is nothing but squabbling? Never! We\u2019ll show him that we are men of principle!\u2014And they have. They have clearly shown everyone that if they have any new principles at all, they are opportunist principles. \u2014LeninExactly the same stages are displayed by opportunism in matters of programme and tactics: sneering at \u201corthodoxy\u201d, narrowness, and immobility\u2014revisionist \u201ccriticism\u201d and ministerialism\u2014bourgeois democracy.\n\nThere is a close psychological connection between this hatred of discipline and that incessant nagging note of injury which is to be detected in all the writings of all opportunists today in general, and of our minority in particular. They are being persecuted, hounded, ejected, besieged, and bullied. There is far more psychological and political truth in these catchwords than was probably suspected even by the author of the pleasant and witty joke about bullies and bullied. For you have only to take the minutes of our Party Congress to see that the minority are all those who suffer from a sense of injury, all those who at one time or another and for one reason or another were offended by the revolutionary Social-Democrats. There are the Bundists and the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, whom we \u201coffended\u201d so badly that they withdrew from the Congress; there are the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists, who were mortally offended by the slaughter of organisations in general and of their own in particular; there is Comrade Makhov, who had to put up with offence every time he took the floor (for every time he did, he invariably made a fool of himself) and lastly, there are Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod, who were offended by the \u201cfalse accusation of opportunism\u201d in connection with Paragraph  of the Rules and by their defeat in the elections. All these mortal offences were not the accidental outcome of impermissible witticisms, rude behaviour, frenzied controversy, slamming of doors, and shaking of fists, as so many philistines imagine to this day, but the inevitable political outcome of the whole three years\u2019 ideological work of Iskra. If in the course of these three years we were not just wagging our tongues, but giving expression to convictions which were to be translated into deeds, we could not but fight the anti-Iskra-ists and the \u201cMarsh\u201d at the Congress. And when, together with Comrade Martov, who had fought in the front line with visor up, we had offended such heaps of people, we had only to offend Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martov ever such a little bit for the cup to overflow. Quantity was transformed into quality. The negation was negated. All the offended forgot their mutual scores, fell weeping into each other\u2019s arms, and raised the banner of \u201crevolt against Leninism\u201d.[][] This amazing expression is Comrade Martov\u2019s (State of Siege, p. ) Comrade Martov waited until he was five to one before raising the \u201crevolt\u201d against me alone. Comrade Martov argues very unskilfully: he wants to destroy his opponent by paying him the highest compliments. \u2014Lenin\nA revolt is a splendid thing when it is the advanced elements who revolt against the reactionary elements. When the revolutionary wing revolts against the opportunist wing, it is a good thing. When the opportunist wing revolts against the revolutionary wing, it is a bad business.\n\nComrade Plekhanov is compelled to take part in this bad business in the capacity of a prisoner of war, so to speak. He tries to \u201cvent his spleen\u201d by fishing out isolated awkward phrases by the author of some resolution in favour of the \u201cmajority\u201d, and exclaiming: \u201cPoor Comrade Lenin! A fine lot his orthodox supporters are!\u201d (Iskra, No. , Supplement.)\n\nWell, Comrade Plekhanov, all I can say is that if I am poor, the editors of the new Iskra are downright paupers. However poor I may be, I have not yet reached such utter destitution as to have to shut my eyes to the Party Congress and hunt for material for the exercise of my wit in the resolutions of committeemen. However poor I may be, I am a thousand times better off than those whose supporters do not utter an awkward phrase inadvertently, but on every issue\u2014whether of organisation, tactics, or programme\u2014adhere stubbornly and persistently to principles which are the very opposite of the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy. However poor I may be, I have not yet reached the stage of having to conceal from the public the praises lavished on me by such supporters. And that is what the editors of the new Iskra have to do.\n\nReader, do you know what the Voronezh Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party stands for? If not, read the minutes of the Party Congress. You will learn from them that the line of that committee is wholly expressed by ComradeAkimov and Comrade Brouck\u00e8re, who at the Congress fought the revolutionary wing of the Party all along the line, and who scores of times were ranked as opportunists by everybody, from Comrade Plekhanov to Comrade Popov. Well, this Voronezh Committee, in its January leaflet (No. , January ), makes the following statement:\n\n\u201cA great and important event in the life of our steadily growing Party took place last year: the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., a congress of the representatives of its organisations. Convening a Party congress is a very complicated matter, and, under the prevailing monarchical regime, a very dangerous and difficult one. It is therefore not surprising that it was carried out in a far from perfect way, and that the Congress itself, although it passed off without mishap, did not live up to all the Party\u2019s expectations. The comrades whom the Conference of  commissioned to convene the Congress were arrested, and the Congress was arranged by persons who represented only one of the trends in Russian Social-Democracy, viz., the \u2019Iskra\u2019-ists. Many organisations of Social-Democrats who did not happen to be Iskra-ists were not invited to take part in the work of the Congress; partly for this reason the task of drawing up a programme and Rules for the Party was carried out by the Congress in an extremely imperfect manner; the delegates themselves admit that there are important flaws in the Rules \u2019which may lead to dangerous misunderstandings\u2019. The Iskra-ists themselves split at the Congress, and many prominent members of our R.S.D.L.P. who formerly appeared to be in full agreement with the Iskra programme of action have come to see that many of its views, advocated mainly by Lenin and Plekhanov, are impracticable. Although these last gained the upper hand at the Congress, the pulse of real life and the requirements of the practical work, in which all the non-Iskra-ists are taking part, are quickly correcting the mistakes of the theoreticians and have, since the Congress, already introduced important modifications. \u2019Iskra\u2019 has changed greatly and prorrises to pay careful heed to the demands of all workers in the Social-Democratic movement generally. Thus, although the results of the Congress will have to be revised at the next Congress, and, as is obvious to the delegates themselves, are unsatisfactory and therefore cannot be accepted by the Party as unimpeachable decisions, the Congress clarified the situation in the Party, provided much material for the further theoretical and organising activity of the Party, and was an experience of immense instructive value for the work of the Party as a whole The decisions of the Congress and the Rules it drew up will be taken into account by all the organisations, but many will refrain from being guided by them exclusively, in view of their manifest imperfections.\n\n\u201cFully realising the importance of the work of the Party as a whole, the Voronezh Committee actively responded in all matters concerning the organisation of the Congress. It fully appreciates the importance of what took place at the Congress and welcomes the change under gone by \u2019Iskra\u2019, which has become the Central Organ (chief organ).\n\nAlthough the state of affairs in the Party and the Central Committee does not satisfy us as yet, we are confident that by joint efforts the difficult work of organising the Party will be perfected. In view of false rumours, the Voronezh Committee informs the comrades that there is no question of the Voronezh Committee leaving the Party. The Voronezh Committee perfectly realises what a dangerous precedent would be created by the withdrawal of a workers\u2019 organisation like the Voronezh Committee from the R.S.D.L.P., what a reproach this would be to the Party, and how disadvantageous it would be to workers\u2019 organisations which might follow this example. We must not cause new splits, but persistently strive to unite all class-conscious workers and socialists in one party. Besides, the Second Congress was not a constituent congress, but only a regular one. Expulsion from the Party can only be by decision of a Party court, and no organisation, not even the Central Committee, has the right to expel any Social-Democratic organisation from the Party. Furthermore, under Paragraph  of the Rules adopted by the Second Congress every organisation is autonomous in its local affairs, and the Voronezh Committee is accordingly fully entitled to put its views on organisation into practice and to advocate them in the Party.\u201d\n\nThe editors of the new Iskra, in quoting this leaflet in No. , reprinted the second half of this tirade, which we give here in large type; as for the first half, here printed in small type, the editors preferred to omit it.\n\nThey were ashamed.\n\nR. A Few Words On Dialectics. Two Revolutions\nA general glance at the development of our Party crisis will readily show that in the main, with minor exceptions, the composition of the two contending sides remained unchanged throughout. It was a struggle between the revolutionary wing and the opportunist wing in our Party. But this struggle passed through the most varied stages, and anyone who wants to find his bearings in the vast amount of literature already accumulated, the mass of fragmentary evidence, passages torn from their context, isolated accusations, and so on and so forth, must thoroughly familiarise himself with the peculiarities of each of these stages.\n\nLet us enumerate the principal and clearly distinct stages: ) The controversy over Paragraph  of the Rules. A purely ideological struggle over the basic principles of organisation. Plekhanov and I are in the minority. Martov and Axelrod propose an opportunist formulation and find themselves in the arms of the opportunists. ) The split in the Iskra organisation over the lists of candidates for the Central Committee: Fomin or Vasilyev in a committee of five, Trotsky or Travinsky in a committee of three. Plekhanov and I gain the majority (nine to seven), partly because of the very fact that we were in the minority on Paragraph . Martov\u2019s coalition with the opportunists confirmed my worst fears over the Organising Committee incident. ) Continuation of the controversy over details of the Rules. Martov is again saved by the opportunists. We are again in the minority and fight for the rights of the minority on the central bodies. ) The seven extreme opportunists withdraw from the Congress. We become the majority and defeat the coalition (the Iskra-ist minority, the \u201cMarsh\u201d, and the anti-Iskra-ists) in the elections. Martov and Popov decline to accept seats in our trios. ) The post-Congress squabble over co-optation. An orgy of anarchistic behaviour and anarchistic phrase-mongering. The least stable and steadfast elements among the \u201cminority\u201d gain the upper hand. ) To avert a split, Plekhanov adopts the policy of \u201ckilling with kindness\u201d. The \u201cminority\u201d occupy the editorial board of the Central Organ and the Council and attack the Central Committee with all their might. The squabble continues to pervade everything. ) First attack on the Central Committee repulsed. The squabble seems to be subsiding somewhat. It becomes possible to discuss in comparative calm two purely ideological questions which profoundly agitate the Party: a) what is the political significance and explanation of the division of our Party into \u201cmajority\u201d and \u201cminority\u201d which took shape at the Second Congress and superseded all earlier divisions? b) what is the significance in principle of the new Iskra\u2019s new position on the question of organisation?\n\nIn each of these stages the circumstances of the struggle and the immediate object of the attack are materially different; each stage is, as it were, a separate battle in one general military campaign. Our struggle cannot be understood at all unless the concrete circumstances of each battle are studied. But once that is done, we see clearly that development does indeed proceed dialectically, by way of contradictions: the minority becomes the majority, and the majority becomes the minority; each side passes from the defensive to the offensive, and from the offensive to the defensive; the starting-point of ideological struggle (Paragraph ) is \u201cnegated\u201d and gives place to an all-pervading squabble[] [] The difficult problem of drawing a line between squabbling and differences of principle now solves itself: all that relates to co-optation is squabbling; all that relates to analysis of the struggle at the Congress, to the controversy over Paragraph  and the swing towards opportunism and anarchism is a difference of principle. \u2014Lenin; but then begins \u201cthe negation of the negation\u201d, and, having just about managed to \u201crub along\u201d with our god-given wife on different central bodies, we return to the starting-point, the purely ideological struggle; but by now this \u201cthesis\u201d has been enriched by all the results of the \u201cantithesis\u201d and has become a higher synthesis, in which the isolated, random error over Paragraph  has grown into a quasi-system of opportunist views on matters of organisation, and in which the connection between this fact and the basic division of our Party into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing becomes increasingly apparent to all. In a word, not only do oats grow according to Hegel, but the Russian Social-Democrats war among themselves according to Hegel.\n\nBut the great Hegelian dialectics which Marxism made its own, having first turned it right side up, must never be confused with the vulgar trick of justifying the zigzags of politicians who swing over from the revolutionary to the opportunist wing of the Party, with the vulgar habit of lumping together particular statements, and particular developmental factors, belonging to different stages of a single process. Genuine dialectics does not justify the errors of individuals, but studies the inevitable turns, proving that they were inevitable by a detailed study of the process of development in all its concreteness. One of the basic principles of dialectics is that there is no such thing as abstract truth, truth is always concrete.... And, one thing more, the great Hegelian dialectics should never be confused with that vulgar worldly wisdom so well expressed by the Italian saying: mettere la coda dove non va il capo (sticking in the tail where the head will not go through).\n\nThe outcome of the dialectical development of our Party struggle has been two revolutions. The Party Congress was a real revolution, as Comrade Martov justly remarked in his Once More in the Minority. The wits of the minority are also right when they say: \u201cThe world moves through revolutions; well, we have made a revolution!\u201d They did indeed make a revolution after the Congress; and it is true, too, that generally speaking the world does move through revolutions. But the concrete significance of each concrete revolution is not defined by this general aphorism; there are revolutions which are more like reaction, to paraphrase the unforgettable expression of the unforgettable Comrade Makhov. We must know whether it was the revolutionary or the opportunist wing of the Party that was the actual force that made the revolution, must know whether it was revolutionary or opportunist principles that inspired the fighters, before we can determine whether a particular concrete revolution moved the \u201cworld\u201d (our Party) forward or backward.\n\nOur Party Congress was unique and unprecedented in the entire history of the Russian revolutionary movement. For the first time a secret revolutionary party succeeded in emerging from the darkness of underground life into broad daylight, showing everyone the whole course and outcome of our internal Party struggle, the whole character of our Party and of each of its more or less noticeable components in matters of programme, tactics, and organisation. For the first time we succeeded in throwing off the traditions of circle looseness and revolutionary philistinism, in bringing together dozens of very different groups, many of which had been fiercely warring among themselves and had been linked solely by the force of an idea, and which were now prepared (in principle, that is) to sacrifice all their group aloofness and group independence for the sake of the great whole which we were for the first time actually creating\u2014the Party. But in politics sacrifices are not obtained gratis, they have to be won in battle. The battle over the slaughter of organisations necessarily proved terribly fierce. The fresh breeze of free and open struggle blew into a gale. The gale swept away\u2014and a very good thing that it did!\u2014each and every remnant of all circle interests, sentiments, and traditions without exception, and for the first time created genuinely Party institutions.\n\nBut it is one thing to call oneself something, and another to be it. It is one thing to sacrifice the circle system in principle for the sake of the Party, and another to renounce one\u2019s own circle. The fresh breeze proved too fresh as yet for people used to musty philistinism. \u201cThe Party was unable to stand the strain of its first congress,\u201d as Comrade Martov rightly put it (inadvertently) in his Once More in the Minority. The sense of injury over the slaughter of organisations was too strong. The furious gale raised all the mud from the bottom of our Party stream; and the mud took its revenge. The old hidebound circle spirit overpowered the still young party spirit. The opportunist wing of the Party, routed though it had been, got the better\u2014temporarily, of course\u2014of the revolutionary wing, having been reinforced by Akimov\u2019s accidental gain.\n\nThe result is the new Iskra, which is compelled to develop and deepen the error its editors committed at the Party Congress. The old Iskra taught the truths of revolutionary struggle. The new Iskra teaches the worldly wisdom of yielding and getting on with everyone. The old Iskra was the organ of militant orthodoxy. The new Iskra treats us to a recrudescence of opportunism\u2014chiefly on questions of organisation. The old Iskra earned the honour of being detested by the opportunists, both Russian and West-European. The new Iskra has \u201cgrown wise\u201d and will soon cease to be ashamed of the praises lavished on it by the extreme opportunists. The old Iskra marched unswervingly towards its goal, and there was no discrepancy between its word and its deed. The inherent falsity of the new Iskra\u2019s position inevitably leads\u2014independently even of anyone\u2019s will or intention\u2014to political hypocrisy. It inveighs against the circle spirit in order to conceal the victory of the circle spirit over the party spirit. It hypocritically condemns splits, as if one can imagine any way of avoiding splits in any at all organised party except by the subordination of the minority to the majority. It says that heed must be paid to revolutionary public opinion, yet, while concealing the praises of the Akimovs, indulges in petty scandal-mongering about the committees of the revolutionary wing of the Party.[] [] A stereotyped form has even been worked out for this charming pastime: our special correspondent X informs us that Committee Y of the majority has behaved badly to Comrade Z of the minority. \u2014LeninHow shameful! How they have disgraced our old Iskra!\n\nOne step forward, two steps back.... It happens in the lives of individuals, and it happens in the history of nations and in the development of parties. It would be the most criminal cowardice to doubt even for a moment the inevitable and complete triumph of the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy, of proletarian organisation and Party discipline. We have already won a great deal, and we must go on fighting, undismayed by reverses, fighting steadfastly, scorning the philistine methods of circle wrangling, doing our very utmost to preserve the hard-won single Party tie linking all Russian Social-Democrats, and striving by dint of persistent and systematic work to give all Party members, and the workers in particular, a full and conscious understanding of the duties of Party members, of the struggle at the Second Party Congress, of all the causes and all the stages of our divergence, and of the utter disastrousness of opportunism, which, in the sphere of organisation as in the sphere of our programme and our tactics, helplessly surrenders to the bourgeois psychology, uncritically adopts the point of view of bourgeois democracy, and blunts the weapon of the class struggle of the proletariat.\n\nIn its struggle for power the proletariat has no other weapon but organisation. Disunited by the rule of anarchic competition in the bourgeois world, ground down by forced labour for capital, constantly thrust back to the \u201clower depths\u201d of utter destitution, savagery, and degeneration, the proletariat can, and inevitably will, become an invincible force only through its ideological unification on the principles of Marxism being reinforced by the material unity of organisation, which welds millions of toilers into an army of the working class. Neither the senile rule of the Russian autocracy nor the senescent rule of international capital will be able to withstand this army. It will more and more firmly close its ranks, in spite of all zigzags and backward steps, in spite of the opportunist phrase-mongering of the Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy, in spite of the self-satisfied exaltation of the retrograde circle spirit, and in spite of the tinsel and fuss of intellectualist anarchism. Geneva, Wednesday, January  ()\n\nEvents of the greatest historical importance are developing in Russia. The proletariat has risen against tsarism. The proletariat was driven to revolt by the government. There can hardly be any doubt now that the government deliberately allowed the strike movement to develop and a wide demonstration to be started more or less without hindrance in order to bring matters to a point where military force could be used. Its manoeuvre was successful. Thousands of killed and wounded\u2014such is the toll of Bloody Sunday, January , in St. Petersburg. The army defeated unarmed workers, women, and children. The army vanquished the enemy by shooting prostrate workers. \u201cWe have taught them a good lesson!\u201d the tsar\u2019s henchmen and their European flunkeys from among the conservative bourgeoisie say with consummate cynicism.\n\nYes, it was a great lesson, one which the Russian proletariat will not forget. The most uneducated, backward sections of the working class, who na\u00efvely trusted the tsar and sincerely wished to put peacefully before \u201cthe tsar himself\u201d the petition of a tormented people, were all taught a lesson by the troops led by the tsar or his uncle, the Grand Duke Vladimir.\n\nThe working class has received a momentous lesson in civil war; the revolutionary education of the proletariat made more progress in one day than it could have made in months and years of drab, humdrum, wretched existence. The slogan of the heroic St. Petersburg proletariat, \u201cDeath or freedom!\u201d is reverberating throughout Russia. Events   are developing with astonishing rapidity. The general strike in St. Petersburg is spreading. All industrial, public, and political activities are paralysed. On Monday, January , still more violent clashes occurred between the workers and the military. Contrary to the mendacious government reports, blood is flowing in many parts of the capital. The workers of Kolpino are rising. The proletariat is arming itself and the people. The workers are said to have seized the Sestroretsk Arsenal. They are providing themselves with revolvers, forging their tools into weapons, and procuring bombs for a desperate bid for freedom. The general strike is spreading to the provinces. Ten thousand have already ceased work in Moscow, and a general strike has been called there for tomorrow (Thursday, January ). An uprising has broken out in Riga. The workers are demonstrating in Lodz, an uprising is being prepared in Warsaw, proletarian demonstrations are taking place in Helsingfors. Unrest is growing among the workers and the strike is spreading in Baku, Odessa, Kiev, Kharkov, Koyno, and Vilna. In Sevastopol, the naval stores and arsenals are ablaze, and the troops refuse to shoot at the mutineers. Strikes in Revel and in Saratov. Workers and reservists clash with the troops in Radom.\n\nThe revolution is spreading. The government is beginning to lose its head. From the policy of bloody repression it is attempting to change over to economic concessions and to save itself by throwing a sop to the workers or promising the nine-hour day. But the lesson of Bloody Sunday cannot be forgotten. The demand of the insurgent St. Petersburg workers\u2014the immediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot\u2014must become the demand of all the striking workers. Immediate overthrow of the government\u2014 this was the slogan with which even the St. Petersburg workers who had believed in the tsar answered the massacre of January ; they answered through their leader, the priest Georgi Gapon, who declared after that bloody day: \u201cWe no longer have a tsar. A river of blood divides the tsar from the people. Long live the fight for freedom!\u201d\n\nLong live the revolutionary proletariat! say we. The general strike is rousing and rallying increasing masses   of the working class and the urban poor. The arming of the people is becoming an immediate task of the revolutionary moment.\n\nOnly an armed people can be the real bulwark of popular liberty. The sooner the proletariat succeeds in arming, and the longer it holds its fighting positions as striker and revolutionary, the sooner will the army begin to waver; more and more soldiers will at last begin to realise what they are doing and they will join sides with the people against the fiends, against the tyrant, against the murderers of defenceless workers and of their wives and children. No matter what the outcome of the present uprising in St. Petersburg may be, it will, in any case, be the first step to a wider, more conscious, better organised uprising. The government may possibly succeed in putting off the day of reckoning, but the postponement will only make the next step of the revolutionary onset more stupendous. This will only mean that the Social-Democrats will take advantage of this postponement to rally the organised fighters and spread the news about the start made by the St. Petersburg workers. The proletariat will join in the struggle, it will quit mill and factory and will prepare arms for itself. The slogans of the struggle for freedom will be carried more and more widely into the midst of the urban poor and of the millions of peasants. Revolutionary committees will be set up at every factory, in every city district, in every large village. The people in revolt will overthrow all the government institutions of the tsarist autocracy and proclaim the immediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly.\n\nThe immediate arming of the workers and of all citizens in general, the preparation and organisation of the revolutionary forces for overthrowing the government authorities and institutions\u2014this is the practical basis on which revolutionaries of every variety can and must unite to strike the common blow. The proletariat must always pursue its own independent path, never weakening its connection with the Social-Democratic Party, always bearing in mind its great, ultimate objective, which is to rid mankind of all exploitation. But this independence of the Social Democratic proletarian party will never cause us to forget the importance of a common revolutionary onset at the   moment of actual revolution. We Social-Democrats can and must act independently of the bourgeois-democratic revolutionaries and guard the class independence of the proletariat. But we must go hand in hand with them during the up rising, when direct blows are being struck at tsarism, when resistance is offered the troops, when the bastilles of the accursed enemy of the entire Russian people are stormed.\n\nThe proletariat of the whole world is now looking eagerly towards the proletariat of Russia. The overthrow of tsarism in Russia, so valiantly begun by our working class, will be the turning-point in the history of all countries; it will facilitate the task of the workers of all nations, in all states, in all parts of the globe. Let, therefore, every Social-Democrat, every class-conscious worker bear in mind the immense tasks of the broad popular struggle that now rest upon his shoulders. Let him not forget that he represents also the needs and interests of the whole peasantry, of all who toil, of all who are exploited, of the whole people against their enemy. The proletarian heroes of St. Petersburg now stand as an example to all.\n\nLong live the revolution!\n\nLong live the insurgent proletariat! The Right of Nations to Self-Determination\nClause  of the Russian Marxists\u2019 Programme, which deals with the right of nations to self-determination, has (as we have already pointed out in Prosveshcheniye)[] given rise lately to a crusade on the part of the opportunists. The Russian liquidator Semkovsky, in the St. Petersburg liquidationist newspaper, and the Bundist Liebman and the Ukrainian nationalist-socialist Yurkevich in their respective periodicals have violently attacked this clause and treated it with supreme contempt. There is no doubt that this campaign of a motley array of opportunists against our Marxist Programme is closely connected with present-day nationalist vacillations in general. Hence we consider a detailed examination of this question timely. We would mention, in passing, that none of the opportunists named above has offered a single argument of his own; they all merely repeat what Rosa Luxemburg said in her lengthy Polish article of \u2013, \u201cThe National Question and Autonomy\u201d. In our exposition we shall deal mainly with the \u201coriginal\u201d arguments of this last-named author.\n\n. WHAT IS MEANT BY THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF NATIONS?\nNaturally, this is the first question that arises when any attempt is made at a Marxist examination of what is known as self-determination. What should be understood by that term? Should the answer be sought in legal definitions deduced from all sorts of \u201cgeneral concepts\u201d of law? Or is it rather to be sought in a historico-economic study of the national movements?\n\nIt is not surprising that the Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches did not even think of raising this question, and shrugged it off by scoffing at the \u201cobscurity\u201d of the Marxist Programme, apparently unaware, in their simplicity, that the self-determination of nations is dealt with, not only in the Russian Programme of , but in the resolution of the London International Congress of  (with which I shall deal in detail in the proper place). Far more surprising is the fact that Rosa Luxemburg, who declaims a great deal about the supposedly abstract and metaphysical nature of the clause in question, should herself succumb to the sin of abstraction and metaphysics. It is Rosa Luxemburg herself who is continually lapsing into generalities about self-determination (to the extent even of philosophising amusingly on the question of how the will of the nation is to be ascertained), without any where clearly and precisely asking herself whether the gist of the matter lies in legal definitions or in the experience of the national movements throughout the world.\n\nA precise formulation of this question, which no Marxist can avoid, would at once destroy nine-tenths of Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s arguments. This is not the first time that national movements have arisen in Russia, nor are they peculiar to that country alone. Throughout the world, the period of the final victory of capitalism over feudalism has been linked up with national movements. For the complete victory of commodity production, the bourgeoisie must capture the home market, and there must be politically united territories whose population speak a single language, with all obstacles to the development of that language and to its consolidation in literature eliminated. Therein is the economic foundation of national movements. Language is the most important means of human intercourse. Unity and unimpeded development of language are the most important conditions for genuinely free and extensive commerce on a scale commensurate with modern capitalism, for a free and broad grouping of the population in all its various classes and, lastly, for the establishment of a close connection between the market and each and every proprietor, big or little, and between seller and buyer.\n\nTherefore, the tendency of every national movement is towards the formation of national states, under which these requirements of modern capitalism are best satisfied. The most profound economic factors drive towards this goal, and, therefore, for the whole of Western Europe, nay, for the entire civilised world, the national state is typical and normal for the capitalist period.\n\nConsequently, if we want to grasp the meaning of self-determination of nations, not by juggling with legal definitions, or \u201cinventing\u201d abstract definitions, but by examining the historico-economic conditions of the national movements, we must inevitably reach the conclusion that the self-determination of nations means the political separation of these nations from alien national bodies, and the formation of an independent national state.\n\nLater on we shall see still other reasons why it would be wrong to interpret the right to self-determination as meaning-anything but the right to existence as a separate state. At present, we must deal with Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s efforts to \u201cdismiss\u201d the inescapable conclusion that profound economic factors underlie the urge towards a national state.\n\nRosa Luxemburg is quite familiar with Kautsky\u2019s pamphlet Nationality and Internationality. (Supplement to Die Neue Zeit[] No., \u2013; Russian translation in the journal Nauchnaya Mysl,[] Riga, .) She is aware that, after carefully analysing the question of the national state in \u00a7 of that pamphlet, Kautsky arrived at the conclusion that Otto Bauer \u201cunderestimates the strength of the urge towards a national state\u201d (p.  of the pamphlet). Rosa Luxemburg herself quotes the following words of Kautsky\u2019s:\n\n\u201cThe national state is the form most suited to present-day conditions, [i. e., capitalist, civilised, economically progressive conditions, as distinguished from medieval, pre-capitalist, etc.]; it is the form in which the state can best fulfil its tasks\u201d (i. e., the tasks of securing the freest, widest and speediest development of capitalism). To this we must add Kautsky\u2019s still more precise concluding remark that states of mixed national composition (known as multi national states, as distinct from national states) are \u201calways those whose internal constitution has for some reason or other remained abnormal or underdeveloped\u201d (backward). Needless to say, Kautsky speaks of abnormality exclusively in the sense of lack of conformity with what is best adapted to the requirements of a developing capitalism.\n\nThe question now is: How did Rosa Luxemburg treat these historico-economic conclusions of Kautsky\u2019s? Are they right or wrong? Is Kautsky right in his historico-economic theory, or is Bauer, whose theory is basically psychological? What is the connection between Bauer\u2019s undoubted \u201cnational opportunism\u201d, his defence of cultural-national autonomy, his nationalistic infatuation (\u201can occasional emphasis on the national aspect\u201d, as Kautsky put it), his \u201cenormous exaggeration of the national aspect and complete neglect of the international aspect\u201d (Kautsky)\u2014and his underestimation of the strength of the urge to create a national state?\n\nRosa Luxemburg has not even raised this question. She has not noticed the connection. She has not considered the sum total of Bauer\u2019s theoretical views. She has not even drawn a line between the historico-economic and the psychological theories of the national question. She confines herself to the following remarks in criticism of Kautsky:\n\n\u201cThis \u2018best\u2019 national state is only an abstraction, which can easily be developed and defended theoretically, but which does not correspond to reality.\u201d (Przeglad Socjaldemokratyczny, , No. , p. .)\n\nAnd in corroboration of this emphatic statement there follow arguments to the effect that the \u201cright to self-determination\u201d of small nations is made illusory by the development of the great capitalist powers and by imperialism. \u201cCan one seriously speak,\u201d Rosa Luxemburg exclaims, \u201cabout the \u2018self-determination\u2019 of the formally independent Montenegrins, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Serbs, Greeks, partly even the Swiss, whose independence is itself a result of the political struggle and the diplomatic game of the \u2018concert of Europe\u2019?!\u201d (P. .) The state that best suits these conditions is \u201cnot a national state, as Kautsky believes, but a predatory one\u201d. Some dozens of figures are quoted relating to the size of British, French and other colonial possessions.\n\nAfter reading such arguments, one cannot help marvelling at the author\u2019s ability to misunderstand the how and the why of things. To teach Kautsky, with a serious mien, that small states are economically dependent on big ones, that a struggle is raging among the bourgeois states for the predatory suppression of other nations, and that imperialism and colonies exist\u2014all this is a ridiculous and puerile attempt to be clever, for none of this has the slightest bearing on the subject. Not only small states, but even Russia, for example, is entirely dependent, economically, on the power of the imperialist finance capital of the \u201crich\u201d bourgeois countries. Not only the miniature Balkan states, but even nineteenth-century America was, economically, a colony of Europe, as Marx pointed out in Capital.[] Kautsky, like any Marxist, is, of course, well aware of this, but that has nothing whatever to do with the question of national movements and the national state.\n\nFor the question of the political self-determination of nations and their independence as states in bourgeois society, Rosa Luxemburg has substituted the question of their economic independence. This is just as intelligent as if someone, in discussing the programmatic demand for the supremacy of parliament, i. e., the assembly of people\u2019s representatives, in a bourgeois state, were to expound the perfectly correct conviction that big capital dominates in a bourgeois country, whatever the regime in it.\n\nThere is no doubt that the greater part of Asia, the most densely populated continent, consists either of colonies of the \u201cGreat Powers\u201d, or of states that are extremely dependent and oppressed as nations. But does this commonly-known circumstance in any way shake the undoubted fact that in Asia itself the conditions for the most complete development of commodity production and the freest, widest and speediest growth of capitalism have been created only in Japan, i. e., only in an independent national state? The latter is a bourgeois state, and for that reason has itself begun to oppress other nations and to enslave colonies. We cannot say whether Asia will have had time to develop into a system of independent national states, like Europe, before the collapse of capitalism, but it remains an undisputed fact that capitalism, having awakened Asia, has called forth national movements everywhere in that continent, too; that the tendency of these movements is towards the creation of national states in Asia; that it is such states that ensure, the best conditions for the development of capitalism. The example of Asia speaks in favour of Kautsky and against Rosa Luxemburg.\n\nThe example of the Balkan states likewise contradicts her, for anyone can now see that the best conditions for the development of capitalism in the Balkans are created precisely in proportion to the creation of independent national states in that peninsula.\n\nTherefore, Rosa Luxemburg notwithstanding, the example of the whole of progressive and civilised mankind, the example of the Balkans and that of Asia prove that Kautsky\u2019s proposition is absolutely correct: the national state is the rule and the \u201cnorm\u201d of capitalism; the multi-national state represents backwardness, or is an exception. From the standpoint of national relations, the best conditions for the development of capitalism are undoubtedly provided by the national state. This does not mean, of course, that such a state, which is based on bourgeois relations, can eliminate the exploitation and oppression of nations. It only means that Marxists cannot lose sight of the powerful economic factors that give rise to the urge to create national states. It means that \u201cself-determination of nations\u201d in the Marxists\u2019 Programme cannot, from a historico-economic point of view, have any other meaning than political self-determination, state independence, and the formation of a national state.\n\nThe conditions under which the bourgeois-democratic demand for a \u201cnational state\u201d should be supported from a Marxist, i. e., class-proletarian, point of view will be dealt with in detail below. For the present, we shall confine ourselves to the definition of the concept of \u201cself-determination\u201d, and only note that Rosa Luxemburg knows what this concept means (\u201cnational state\u201d), whereas her opportunist partisans, the Liebmans, the Semkovskys, the Yurkeviches, do not even know that!\n\n. THE HISTORICALLY CONCRETE PRESENTATION OF THE QUESTION\nThe categorical requirement of Marxist theory in investigating any social question is that it be examined within definite historical limits, and, if it refers to a particular country (e. g., the national programme for a given country), that account be taken of the specific features distinguishing that country from others in the same historical epoch.\n\nWhat does this categorical requirement of Marxism imply in its application to the question under discussion?\n\nFirst of all, it implies that a clear distinction must be drawn between the two periods of capitalism, which differ radically from each other as far as the national movement is concerned. On the one hand, there is the period of the collapse of feudalism and absolutism, the period of the formation of the bourgeois-democratic society and state, when the national movements for the first time become mass movements and in one way or another draw all classes of the population into politics through the press, participation in representative institutions, etc. On the other hand, there is the period of fully formed capitalist states with a long-established constitutional regime and a highly developed antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie\u2014a period that may be called the eve of capitalism\u2019s downfall.\n\nThe typical features of the first period are: the awakening of national movements and the drawing of the peasants, the most numerous and the most sluggish section of the population, into these movements, in connection with the struggle for political liberty in general, and for the rights of the nation in particular. Typical features of the second period are: the absence of mass bourgeois-democratic movements and the fact that developed capitalism, in bringing closer together nations that have already been fully drawn into commercial intercourse, and causing them to intermingle to an increasing degree, brings the antagonism between internationally united capital and the international working-class movement into the forefront.\n\nOf course, the two periods are not walled off from each other; they are connected by numerous transitional links, the various countries differing from each other in the rapidity of their national development, in the national make up and distribution of their population, and so on. There can be no question of the Marxists of any country drawing up their national programme without taking into account all these general historical and concrete state conditions.\n\nIt is here that we come up against the weakest point in Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s arguments. With extraordinary zeal, she embellishes her article with a collection of hard words directed against \u00a7 of our Programme, which she declares to be \u201csweeping\u201d, \u201ca platitude\u201d, \u201ca metaphysical phrase\u201d, and so on without end. It would be natural to expect an author who so admirably condemns metaphysics (in the Marxist sense, i.e., anti-dialectics) and empty abstractions to set us an example of how to make a concrete historical analysis of the question. The question at issue is the national programme of the Marxists of a definite country\u2014Russia, in a definite period\u2014the beginning of the twentieth century. But does Rosa Luxemburg raise the question as to what historical period Russia is passing through, or what are the concrete features of the national question and the national movements of that particular country in that particular period?\n\nNo, she does not! She says absolutely nothing about it! In her work you will not find even the shadow of an analysis of how the national question stands in Russia in the present historical period, or of the specific features of Russia in this particular respect!\n\nWe are told that the national question in the Balkans is presented differently from that in Ireland; that Marx appraised the Polish and Czech national movements in the concrete conditions of  in such and such a way (a page of excerpts from Marx); that Engels appraised the struggle of the forest cantons of Switzerland against Austria and the Battle of Morgarten which took place in  in such and such a way (a page of quotations from Engels with the appropriate comments from Kautsky); that Lassalle regarded the peasant war in Germany of the sixteenth century as reactionary, etc.\n\nIt cannot be said that these remarks and quotations have any novelty about them, but at all events it is interesting for the reader to be occasionally reminded just how Marx, Engels and Lassalle approached the analysis of concrete historical problems in individual countries. And a perusal of these instructive quotations from Marx and Engels reveals most strikingly the ridiculous position Rosa Luxemburg has placed herself in, she preaches eloquently and angrily the need for a concrete historical analysis of the national question in different countries at different times, but she does not make the least attempt to determine what historical stage in the development of capitalism Russia is passing through at the beginning of the twentieth century, or what the specific features of the national question in this country are. Rosa Luxemburg gives examples of how others have treated the question in a Marxist fashion, as if deliberately stressing how often the road to hell is paved with good intentions and how often good counsel covers up unwillingness or inability to follow such advice in practice.\n\nHere is one of her edifying comparisons. In protesting against the demand for the independence of Poland, Rosa Luxemburg refers to a pamphlet she wrote in , proving the rapid \u201cindustrial development of Poland\u201d, with the latter\u2019s manufactured goods being marketed in Russia. Needless to say, no conclusion whatever can be drawn from this on the question of the right to self-determination; it only proves the disappearance of the old Poland of the landed gentry, etc. But Rosa Luxemburg always passes on imperceptibly to the conclusion that among the factors that unite Russia and Poland, the purely economic factors of modern capitalist relations now predominate.\n\nThen our Rosa proceeds to the question of autonomy, and though her article is entitled \u201cThe National Question and Autonomy\u201d in general, she begins to argue that the Kingdom of Poland has an exclusive right to autonomy (see Prosveshcheniye, , No. []). To support Poland\u2019s right to autonomy, Rosa Luxemburg evidently judges the state system of Russia by her economic, political and sociological characteristics and everyday life\u2014a totality of features which, taken together, produce the concept of \u201cAsiatic despotism\u201d. (Przeglad No. , p. .)\n\nIt is generally known that this kind of state system possesses great stability whenever completely patriarchal and pre-capitalist features predominate in the economic system and where commodity production and class differentiation are scarcely developed. However, if in a country whose state system is distinctly pre-capitalist in character there exists a nationally demarcated region where capitalism is rapidly developing, then the more rapidly that capitalism develops, the greater will be the antagonism between it and the pre-capitalist state system, and the more likely will be the separation of the progressive region from the whole\u2014with which it is connected, not by \u201cmodern capitalistic\u201d, but by \u201cAsiatically despotic\u201d ties.\n\nThus, Rosa Luxemburg does not get her arguments to hang together even on the question of the social structure of the government in Russia with regard to bourgeois Poland; as for the concrete, historical, specific features of the national movements in Russia\u2014she does not even raise that question.\n\nThat is a point we must now deal with.\n. THE CONCRETE FEATURES OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION IN RUSSIA, AND RUSSIA\u2019S BOURGEOIS-DEMOCRATIC REFORMATION\n\u201cDespite the elasticity of the principle of \u2018the right of nations to self-determination\u2019, which is a mere platitude, and, obviously, equally applicable, not only to the nations inhabiting Russia, but also to the nations inhabiting Germany and Austria, Switzerland and Sweden, America and Australia, we do not find it in the programmes of any of the present-day socialist parties....\u201d (Przeglad No. , p. .)\n\nThis is how Rosa Luxemburg opens her attack upon \u00a7 of the Marxist programme. In trying to foist on us the conception that this clause in the programme is a \u201cmere platitude\u201d, Rosa Luxemburg herself falls victim to this error, alleging with amusing boldness that this point is, \u201cobviously, equally applicable\u201d to Russia, Germany, etc.\n\nObviously, we shall reply, Rosa Luxemburg has decided to make her article a collection, of errors in logic that could be used for schoolboy exercises. For Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s tirade is sheer nonsense and a mockery of the historically concrete presentation of the question.\n\nIf one interprets the Marxist programme in Marxist fashion, not in a childish way, one will without difficulty grasp the fact that it refers to bourgeois-democratic national movements. That being the case, it is \u201cobvious\u201d that this programme \u201csweepingly\u201d, and as a \u201cmere platitude\u201d, etc., covers all instances of bourgeois-democratic national movements. No less obvious to Rosa Luxemburg, if she gave the slightest thought to it, is the conclusion that our programme refers only to cases where such a movement is actually in existence.\n\nHad she given thought to these obvious considerations, Rosa Luxemburg would have easily perceived what non sense she was talking. In accusing us of uttering a \u201cplatitude\u201d she has used against us the argument that no mention is made of the right to self-determination in the programmes of countries where there are no bourgeois-democratic national movements. A remarkably clever argument!\n\nA comparison of the political and economic development of various countries, as well as of their Marxist programmes, is of tremendous importance from the standpoint of Marxism, for there can be no doubt that all modern states are of a common capitalist nature and are therefore subject to a common law of development. But such a comparison must be drawn in a sensible way. The elementary condition for comparison is to find out whether the historical periods of development of the countries concerned are at all comparable. For instance, only absolute ignoramuses (such as Prince Y. Trubetskoi in Russkaya Mysl) are capable of \u201ccomparing\u201d the Russian Marxists\u2019 agrarian programme with the programmes of Western Europe, since our programme replies to questions that concern the bourgeois-democratic agrarian reform, whereas in the Western countries no such question arises.\n\nThe same applies to the national question. In most Western countries it was settled long ago. It is ridiculous to seek an answer to non-existent questions in the programmes of Western Europe. In this respect Rosa Luxemburg has lost sight of the most important thing\u2014the difference between countries, where bourgeois-democratic reforms have long been completed, and those where they have not.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in this difference. Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s complete disregard of it transforms her verbose article into a collection of empty and meaningless platitudes.\n\nThe epoch of bourgeois-democratic revolutions in Western, continental Europe embraces a fairly definite period, approximately between  and . This was precisely the period of national movements and the creation of national states. When this period drew to a close, Western Europe had been transformed into a settled system of bourgeois states, which, as a general rule, were nationally uniform states. Therefore, to seek the right to self-determination in the programmes of West-European socialists at this time of day is to betray one\u2019s ignorance of the ABC of Marxism.\n\nIn Eastern Europe and Asia the period of bourgeois-democratic revolutions did not begin until . The revolutions in Russia, Persia, Turkey and China, the Balkan wars\u2014such is the chain of world events of our period in our \u201cOrient\u201d. And only a blind man could fail to see in this chain of events the awakening of a whole series of bourgeois-democratic national movements which strive to create nationally independent and nationally uniform states. It is precisely and solely because Russia and the neighbouring countries are passing through this period that we must have a clause in our programme on the right of nations to self-determination.\n\nBut let us continue the quotation from Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s article a little more. She writes:\n\n\u201cIn particular, the programme of a party which is operating in a state with an extremely varied national composition, and for which the national question is a matter of first-rate importance\u2014the programme of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party\u2014does not contain the principle of the right of nations to self-determination.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\nThus, an attempt is made to convince the reader by the example of Austria \u201cin particular\u201d. Let us examine this example in the light of concrete historical facts and see just how sound it is.\n\nIn the first place, let us pose the fundamental question of the completion of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. In Austria, this revolution began in  and was over in . Since then, a more or less fully established bourgeois constitution has dominated, for nearly half a century, and on its basis a legal workers\u2019 party is legally functioning.\n\nTherefore, in the internal conditions of Austria\u2019s development (i. e., from the standpoint of the development of capitalism in Austria in general, and among its various nations in particular), there are no factors that produce leaps and bounds, a concomitant of which might be the formation of nationally independent states. In assuming, by her comparison, that Russia is in an analogous position in this respect, Rosa Luxemburg not only makes a fundamentally erroneous and anti-historical assumption, but also involuntarily slips into liquidationism.\n\nSecondly, the profound difference in the relations between the nationalities in Austria and those in Russia is particularly important for the question we are concerned with. Not only was Austria for a long time a state in which the Germans preponderated, but the Austrian Germans laid claim to hegemony in the German nation as a whole. This \u201cclaim\u201d, as Rosa Luxemburg (who is seemingly so averse to commonplaces, platitudes, abstractions...) will perhaps be kind enough to remember, was shattered in the war of . The German nation predominating in Austria found itself outside the pale of the independent German state which finally took shape in . On the other hand, the Hungarians\u2019 attempt to create an independent national state collapsed under the blows of the Russian serf army as far back as .\n\nA very peculiar situation was thus created\u2014a striving on the part of the Hungarians and then of the Czechs, not for separation from Austria, but, on the contrary, for the preservation of Austria\u2019s integrity, precisely in order to preserve national independence, which might have been completely crushed by more rapacious and powerful neighbours! Owing to this peculiar situation, Austria assumed the form of a dual state, and she is now being transformed into a triple state (Germans, Hungarians, Slays).\n\nIs there anything like this in Russia? Is there in our country a striving of the \u201csubject peoples\u201d for unity with the Great Russians in face of the danger of worse national oppression?\n\nOne need only pose this question in order to see that the comparison between Russia and Austria on the question of self-determination of nations is meaningless, platitudinous and ignorant.\n\nThe peculiar conditions in Russia with regard to the national question are just the reverse of those we see in Austria. Russia is a state with a single national centre\u2014 Great Russia. The Great Russians occupy a vast, unbroken stretch of territory, and number about ,,. The specific features of this national state are: first, that \u201csubject peoples\u201d (which, on the whole, comprise the majority of the entire population\u2014 per cent) inhabit the border regions; secondly, the oppression of these subject peoples is much stronger here than in the neighbouring states (and not even in the European states alone); thirdly, in a number of cases the oppressed nationalities inhabiting the border regions have compatriots across the border, who enjoy greater national independence (suffice it to mention the Finns, the Swedes, the Poles, the Ukrainians and the Rumanians along the western and southern frontiers of the state); fourthly, the development of capitalism and the general level of culture are often higher in the non-Russian border regions than in the centre. Lastly, it is in the neighbouring Asian states that we see the beginning of a phase of bourgeois revolutions and national movements which are spreading to some of the kindred nationalities within the borders of Russia.\n\nThus, it is precisely the special concrete, historical features of the national question in Russia that make the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination in the present period a matter of special urgency in our country.\n\nIncidentally, even from the purely factual angle, Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s assertion that the Austrian Social-Democrats\u2019 programme does not contain any recognition of the right of nations to self-determination is incorrect. We need only open the Minutes of the Br\u00fcnn Congress, which adopted the national programme,[] to find the statements by the Ruthenian Social-Democrat Hankiewicz on behalf of the entire Ukrainian (Ruthenian) delegation (p.  of the Minutes), and by the Polish Social-Democrat Reger on behalf of the entire Polish delegation (p. ), to the effect that one of the aspirations of the Austrian Social-Democrats of both the above-mentioned nations is to secure national unity, and the freedom and independence of their nations. Hence, while the Austrian Social-Democrats did not include the right of nations to self-determination directly in their programme, they did nevertheless allow the demand for national independence to be advanced by sections of the party. In effect, this means, of course, the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination! Thus, Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s reference to Austria speaks against Rosa Luxemburg in all respects.\n. \u201cPRACTICALITY\u201d IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION\nRosa Luxemburg\u2019s argument that \u00a7 of our Programme contains nothing \u201cpractical\u201d has been seized upon by the opportunists. Rosa Luxemburg is so delighted with this argument that in some parts of her article this \u201cslogan\u201d is repeated eight times on a single page.\n\nShe writes: \u00a7 \u201cgives no practical lead on the day-by-day policy of the proletariat, no practical solution of national problems\u201d.\n\nLet us examine this argument, which elsewhere is formulated in such a way that it makes \u00a7 look quite meaningless, or else commits us to support all national aspirations.\n\nWhat does the demand for \u201cpracticality\u201d in the national question mean?\n\nIt means one of three things: support for all national aspirations; the answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to the question of secession by any nation; or that national demands are in general immediately \u201cpracticable\u201d.\n\nLet us examine all three possible meanings of the demand for \u201cpracticality\u201d.\n\nThe bourgeoisie, which naturally assumes the leadership at the start of every national movement, says that support for all national aspirations is practical. However, the proletariat\u2019s policy in the national question (as in all others) supports the bourgeoisie only in a certain direction, but it never coincides with the bourgeoisie\u2019s policy. The working class supports the bourgeoisie only in order to secure national peace (which the bourgeoisie cannot bring about completely and which can be achieved only with complete democracy), in order to secure equal rights and to create the best conditions for the class struggle. Therefore, it is in opposition to the practicality of the bourgeoisie that the proletarians advance their principles in the national question; they always give the bourgeoisie only conditional support. What every bourgeoisie is out for in the national question is either privileges for its own nation, or exceptional advantages for it; this is called being \u201cpractical\u201d. The proletariat is opposed to all privileges, to all exclusiveness. To demand that it should be \u201cpractical\u201d means following the lead of the bourgeoisie, falling into opportunism.\n\nThe demand for a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d reply to the question of secession in the case of every nation may seem a very \u201cpractical\u201d one. In reality it is absurd; it is metaphysical in theory, while in practice it leads to subordinating the proletariat to the bourgeoisie\u2019s policy. The bourgeoisie always places its national demands in the forefront, and does so in categorical fashion. With the proletariat, however, these demands are subordinated to the interests of the class struggle. Theoretically, you cannot say in advance whether the bourgeois-democratic revolution will end in a given nation seceding from another nation, or in its equality with the latter; in either case, the important thing for the proletariat is to ensure the development of its class. For the bourgeoisie it is important to hamper this development by pushing the aims of its \u201cown\u201d nation before those of the proletariat. That is why the proletariat confines itself, so to speak, to the negative demand for recognition of the right to self-determination, without giving guarantees to any nation, and without undertaking to give anything at the expense of another nation.\n\nThis may not be \u201cpractical\u201d, but it is in effect the best guarantee for the achievement of the most democratic of all possible solutions. The proletariat needs only such guarantees, whereas the bourgeoisie of every nation requires guarantees for its own interest, regardless of the position of (or the possible disadvantages to) other nations.\n\nThe bourgeoisie is most of all interested in the \u201cfeasibility\u201d of a given demand\u2014hence the invariable policy of coming to terms with the bourgeoisie of other nations, to the detriment of the proletariat. For the proletariat, however, the important thing is to strengthen its class against the bourgeoisie and to educate the masses in the spirit of consistent democracy and socialism.\n\nThis may not be \u201cpractical\u201d as far as the opportunists are concerned, but it is the only real guarantee, the guarantee of the greater national equality and peace, despite the feudal landlords and the nationalist bourgeoisie.\n\nThe whole task of the proletarians in the national question is \u201cunpractical\u201d from the standpoint of the nationalist bourgeoisie of every nation, because the proletarians, opposed as they are to nationalism of every kind, demand \u201cabstract\u201d equality; they demand, as a matter of principle, that there should be no privileges, however slight. Failing to grasp this, Rosa Luxemburg, by her misguided eulogy of practicality, has opened the door wide for the opportunists, and especially for opportunist concessions to Great-Russian nationalism.\n\nWhy Great-Russian? Because the Great Russians in Russia are an oppressor nation, and opportunism in the national question will of course find expression among oppressed nations otherwise than among oppressor nations.\n\nOn the plea that its demands are \u201cpractical\u201d, the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations will call upon the proletariat to support its aspirations unconditionally. The most practical procedure is to say a plain \u201cyes\u201d in favour of the secession of a particular nation rather than in favour of all nations having the right to secede!\n\nThe proletariat is opposed to such practicality. While recognising equality and equal rights to a national state, it values above all and places foremost the alliance of the proletarians of all nations, and assesses any national demand, any national separation, from the angle of the workers\u2019 class struggle. This call for practicality is in fact merely a call for uncritical acceptance of bourgeois aspirations.\n\nBy supporting the right to secession, we are told, you are supporting the bourgeois nationalism of the oppressed nations. This is what Rosa Luxemburg says, and she is echoed by Semkovsky, the opportunist, who incidentally is the only representative of liquidationist ideas on this question, in the liquidationist newspaper!\n\nOur reply to this is: No, it is to the bourgeoisie that a \u201cpractical\u201d solution of this question is important. To the workers the important thing is to distinguish the principles of the two trends. Insofar as the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nation fights the oppressor, we are always, in every case, and more strongly than anyone else, in favour, for we are the staunchest and the most consistent enemies of oppression. But insofar as the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nation stands for its own bourgeois nationalism, we stand against. We fight against the privileges and violence of the oppressor nation, and do not in any way condone strivings for privileges on the part of the oppressed nation.\n\nIf, in our political agitation, we fail to advance and advocate the slogan of the right to secession, we shall play into the hands, not only of the bourgeoisie, but also of the feudal landlords and the absolutism of the oppressor nation. Kautsky long ago used this argument against Rosa Luxemburg, and the argument is indisputable. When, in her anxiety not to \u201cassist\u201d the nationalist bourgeoisie of Poland, Rosa Luxemburg rejects the right to secession in the programme of the Marxists in Russia, she is in fact assisting the Great-Russian Black Hundreds. She is in fact assisting opportunist tolerance of the privileges (and worse than privileges) of the Great Russians.\n\nCarried away by the struggle against nationalism in Poland, Rosa Luxemburg has forgotten the nationalism of the Great Russians, although it is this nationalism that is the most formidable at the present time. It is a nationalism that is mere feudal than bourgeois, and is the principal obstacle to democracy and to the proletarian struggle. The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support, At the same time we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness; we fight against the tendency of the Polish bourgeois to oppress the Jews, etc., etc.\n\nThis is \u201cunpractical\u201d from the standpoint of the bourgeois and the philistine, but it is the only policy in the national question that is practical, based on principles, and really promotes democracy, liberty and proletarian unity.\n\nThe recognition of the right to secession for all; the appraisal of each concrete question of secession from the point of view of removing all inequality, all privileges, and all exclusiveness.\n\nLet us consider the position of an oppressor nation. Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot. The interests of the freedom of the Great-Russian population[] require a struggle against such oppression. The long, centuries-old history of the suppression of the movements of the oppressed nations, and the systematic propaganda in favour of such suppression coming from the \u201cupper\u201d classes have created enormous obstacles to the cause of freedom of the Great-Russian people itself, in the form of prejudices, etc.\n\nThe Great-Russian Black Hundreds deliberately foster these prejudices and encourage them. The Great-Russian bourgeoisie tolerates or condones them. The Great-Russian proletariat cannot achieve its own aims or clear the road to its freedom without systematically countering these prejudices.\n\nIn Russia, the creation of an independent national state remains, for the time being, the privilege of the Great-Russian nation alone. We, the Great-Russian proletarians, who defend no privileges whatever, do not defend this privilege either. We are fighting on the ground of a definite state; we unite the workers of all nations living in this state; we cannot vouch for any particular path of national development, for we are marching to our class goal along all possible paths.\n\nHowever, we cannot move towards that goal unless we combat all nationalism, and uphold the equality of the various nations. Whether the Ukraine, for example, is destined to form an independent state is a matter that will be determined by a thousand unpredictable factors. Without attempting idle \u201cguesses\u201d, we firmly uphold something that is beyond doubt: the right of the Ukraine to form such a state. We respect this right; we do not uphold the privileges of Great Russians with regard to Ukrainians; we educate the masses in the spirit of recognition of that right, in the spirit of rejecting state privileges for any nation.\n\nIn the leaps which all nations have made in the period of bourgeois revolutions, clashes and struggles over the right to a national state are possible and probable. We proletarians declare in advance that we are opposed to Great-Russian privileges, and this is what guides our entire propaganda and agitation.\n\nIn her quest for \u201cpracticality\u201d Rosa Luxemburg has lost sight of the principal practical task both of the Great-Russian proletariat and of the proletariat of other nationalities: that of day-by-day agitation and propaganda against all state and national privileges, and for the right, the equal right of all nations, to their national state. This (at present) is cut principal task in the national question, for only in this way can we defend the interests of democracy and the alliance of all proletarians of all nations on an equal footing.\n\nThis propaganda may be \u201cunpractical\u201d from the point of view of the Great-Russian oppressors, as well as from the point of view of the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations (both demand a definite \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and accuse the Social-Democrats of being \u201cvague\u201d). In reality it is this propaganda, and this propaganda alone, that ensures the genuinely democratic, the genuinely socialist education of the masses. This is the only propaganda to ensure the greatest chances of national peace in Russia, should she remain a multi-national state, and the most peaceful (and for the proletarian class struggle, harmless) division into separate national states, should the question of such a division arise.\n\nTo explain this policy\u2014the only proletarian policy\u2014in the national question more concretely, we shall examine the attitude of Great-Russian liberalism towards the \u201cself-determination of nations\u201d, and the example of Norway\u2019s secession from Sweden.\n\n\n. THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE AND THE SOCIALIST OPPORTUNISTS IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION\nWe have seen that the following argument is one of Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s \u201ctrump cards\u201d in lies struggle against the programme of the Marxists in Russia: recognition of the right to self-determination is tantamount to supporting the bourgeois nationalism of the oppressed nations. On the other hand, she says, if we take this right to mean no more than combating all violence against other nations, there is no need for a special clause in the programme, for Social-Democrats are, in general, opposed to all national oppression and inequality.\n\nThe first argument, as Kautsky irrefutably proved nearly twenty years ago, is a case of blaming other people for one\u2019s own nationalism; in her fear of the nationalism of the bourgeoisie of oppressed nations, Rosa Luxemburg is actually playing into the hands of the Black-Hundred nationalism of the Great Russians! Her second argument is actually a timid evasion of the question whether or not recognition of national equality includes recognition of the right to secession. If it does, then Rosa Luxemburg admits that, in principle, \u00a7 of our Programme is correct. If it does not, then she does not recognise national equality. Shuffling and evasions will not help matters here!\n\nHowever, the best way to test these and all similar arguments is to study the attitude of the various classes of society towards this question. For the Marxist this test is obligatory. We must proceed from what is objective; we must examine the relations between the classes on this point. In failing to do so, Rosa Luxemburg is guilty of those very sins of metaphysics, abstractions, platitudes, and sweeping statements, etc., of which she vainly tries to accuse her opponents.\n\nWe are discussing the Programme of the Marxists in Russia, i.e., of the Marxists of all the nationalities in Russia. Should we not examine the position of the ruling classes of Russia?\n\nThe position of the \u201cbureaucracy\u201d (we beg pardon for this inaccurate term) and of the feudal landlords of our united-nobility type is well known. They definitely reject both the equality of nationalities and the right to self determination. Theirs is the old motto of the days of serfdom: autocracy, orthodoxy, and the national essence\u2014the last term applying only to the Great-Russian nation. Even the Ukrainians are declared to be an \u201calien\u201d people and their very language is being suppressed.\n\nLet us glance at the Russian bourgeoisie, which was \u201ccalled upon\u201d to take part\u2014a very modest part, it is true, but nevertheless some part\u2014in the government, under the \u201cJune Third\u201d legislative and administrative system. It will not need many words to prove that the Octobrists are following the Rights in this question. Unfortunately, some Marxists pay much less attention to the stand of the Great-Russian liberal bourgeoisie, the Progressists and the Cadets. Yet he who fails to study that stand and give it careful thought will inevitably flounder in abstractions and groundless statements in discussing the question of the right of nations to self-determination.\n\nSkilled though it is in the art of diplomatically evading direct answers to \u201cunpleasant\u201d questions, Rech, the principal organ of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, was compelled, in its controversy with Pravda last year, to make certain valuable admissions. The trouble started over the All-Ukraine Students\u2019 Congress held in Lvov in the summer of .[] Mr. Mogilyansky, the \u201cUkrainian expert\u201d or Ukrainian correspondent of Rech, wrote an article in which he poured vitriolic abuse (\u201cravings\u201d, \u201cadventurism\u201d, etc.) on the idea that the Ukraine should secede, an idea which Dontsov, a nationalist-socialist, had advocated and the above-mentioned congress approved.\n\nWhile in no way identifying itself with Mr. Dontsov, and declaring explicitly that he was a nationalist-socialist and that many Ukrainian Marxists did not agree with him, Rabochaya Pravda stated that the tone of Rech, or, rather, the way it formulated the question in principle, was improper and reprehensible for a Great-Russian democrat, or for anyone desiring to pass as a democrat.[] Let Rech repudiate the Dontsovs if it likes, but, from the standpoint of principle, a Great-Russian organ of democracy, which it claims to be, cannot be oblivious of the freedom to secede, the right to secede.\n\nA few months later, Rech, No. , published an \u201cexplanation\u201d from Mr. Mogilyansky, who had learned from the Ukrainian newspaper Shlyakhi,[] published in Lvov, of Mr. Dontsov\u2019s reply, in which, incidentally, Dontsov stated that \u201cthe chauvinist attacks in Rech have been properly sullied [branded?] only in the Russian Social-Democratic press\u201d. This \u201cexplanation\u201d consisted of the thrice-repeated statement that \u201ccriticism of Mr. Dontsov\u2019s recipes\u201d \u201chas nothing in common with the repudiation of the right of nations to self-determination\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt must be said,\u201d wrote Mr. Mogilyansky, \u201cthat even \u2018the right of nations to self-determination\u2019 is not a fetish [mark this!] beyond criticism: unwholesome conditions in the life of nations may give rise to unwholesome tendencies in national self-determination, and the fact that these are brought to light does not mean that the right of nations to self-determination has been rejected.\u201d\n\nAs you see, this liberal\u2019s talk of a \u201cfetish\u201d was quite in keeping with Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s. It was obvious that Mr. Mogilyansky was trying to evade a direct reply to the question whether or not he recognised the right to political self-determination, i. e., to secession.\n\nThe newspaper Proletarskaya Pravda, issue No. , for December , , also put this question point-blank to Mr. Mogilyansky and to the Constitutional-Democratic Party.[]\n\nThereupon Rech (No. ) published an unsigned, i.e., official, editorial statement replying to this question. This reply boils down to the following three points:\n\n) \u00a7 of the Constitutional-Democratic Party\u2019s programme speaks bluntly, precisely and clearly of the \u201cright of nations to free cultural self-determination\u201d.\n\n) Rech affirms that Proletarskaya Pravda \u201chopelessly confuses\u201d self-determination with separatism, with the secession of a given nation.\n\n) \u201cActually, the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the right of \u2018nations to secede\u2019 from the Russian state.\u201d (See the article \u201cNational-Liberalism and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination\u201d, in Proletarskaya Pravda No. , December , .[] )\n\nLet us first consider the second point in the Rech statement. How strikingly it shows to the Semkovskys, Liebmans, Yurkeviches and other opportunists that the hue and cry they have raised about the alleged \u201cvagueness\u201d, or \u201cindefiniteness\u201d, of the term \u201cself-determination\u201d is in fact, i. e., from the standpoint of objective class relationships and the class struggle in Russia, simply a rehash of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie\u2019s utterances!\n\nProletarskaya Pravda put the following three questions to the enlightened \u201cConstitutional-Democratic\u201d gentlemen of Rech: () do they deny that, throughout the entire history of international democracy, and especially since the middle of the nineteenth century, self-determination of nations has been understood to mean precisely political self-determination, the right to form an independent national state? () do they deny that the well-known resolution adopted by the International Socialist Congress in London in  has the same meaning? and () do they deny that Plekhanov, in writing about self-determination as far back as , meant precisely political self-determination? When Proletarskaya Pravda posed these three questions, the Cadets fell silent!\n\nNot a word did they utter in reply, for they had nothing to say. They had to admit tacitly that Proletarskaya Pravda was absolutely right.\n\nThe liberals\u2019 outcries that the term \u201cself-determination\u201d is vague and that the Social-Democrats \u201chopelessly confuse\u201d it with separatism are nothing more than attempts to confuse the issue, and evade recognition of a universally established democratic principle. If the Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches were not so ignorant, they would be ashamed to address the Workers in a liberal vein.\n\nBut to proceed. Proletarskaya Pravda compelled Rech to admit that, in the programme of the Constitutional-Democrats, the term \u201ccultural\u201d self-determination means in effect the repudiation of political self-determination.\n\n\u201cActually, the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the right of \u2018nations to secede\u2019 from the Russian state\u201d\u2014it was not without reason that Proletarskaya Pravda recommended to Novoye Vremya and Zemshchina these words from Rech as an example of our Cadets\u2019 \u201cloyalty\u201d. In its issue No. , Novoye Vremya, which never, of course, misses an opportunity of mentioning \u201cthe Yids\u201d and taking digs at the Cadets, nevertheless stated:\n\n\u201cWhat, to the Social-Democrats, is an axiom of political wisdom [i.e., recognition of the right of nations to self-determination, to secede], is today beginning to cause disagreement even among the Cadets.\u201d\n\nBy declaring that they \u201chave never pledged themselves to advocate the right of nations to secede from the Russian state\u201d, the Cadets have, in principle, taken exactly the same stand as Novoye Vremya. This is precisely one of the fundamentals of Cadet national-liberalism, of their kinship with the Purishkeviches, and of their dependence, political, ideological and practical, on the latter. Proletarskaya Pravda wrote: \u201cThe Cadets have studied history and know only too well what\u2014to put it mildly\u2014pogrom-like actions the practice of the ancient right of the Purishkeviches to \u2018grab \u2019em and hold \u2019em\u2019 has often led to.\u201d Although perfectly aware of the feudalist source and nature of the Purishkeviches\u2019 omnipotence; the Cadets are, nevertheless, taking their stand on the basis of the relationships and frontiers created by that very class. Knowing full well that there is much in the relationships and frontiers created or fixed by this class that is un-European and anti-European (we would say Asiatic if this did not sound undeservedly slighting to the Japanese and Chinese), the Cadets, nevertheless, accept them as the utmost limit.\n\nThus, they are adjusting themselves to the Purishkeviches, cringing to them, fearing to jeopardise their position, protecting them from the people\u2019s movement, from the democracy. As Proletarskaya Pravda wrote: \u201cIn effect, this means adapting oneself to the interests of the feudal-minded landlords and to the worst nationalist prejudices of the dominant nation, instead of systematically combating those prejudices.\u201d\n\nBeing men who are familiar with history and claim to be democrats, the Cadets do not even attempt to assert that the democratic movement, which is today characteristic of both Eastern Europe and Asia and is striving to change both on the model of the civilised capitalist countries, is bound to leave intact the boundaries fixed by the feudal epoch, the epoch of the omnipotence of the Purishkeviches and the disfranchisement of wide strata of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie.\n\nThe fact that the question raised in the controversy between Proletarskaya Pravda and Rech was not merely a literary question, but one that involved a real political issue of the day, was proved, among other things, by the last conference of the Constitutional-Democratic Party held on March \u2013, ; in the official report of this conference in Rech (No. , of March , ) we read:\n\n\u201cA particularly lively discussion also took place on national problems. The Kiev deputies, who were supported by N. V. Nekrasov and A. M. Kolyubakin, pointed out that the national question was becoming a key issue, which would have to he faced up to more resolutely than hitherto. F. F. Kokoshkin pointed out, however [this \u201chowever\u201d is like Shchedrin\u2019s \u201cbut\u201d\u2014\u201cthe ears never grow higher than the forehead, never!\u201d] that both the programme and past political experience demanded that \u2018elastic formulas\u2019 of \u2018political self-determination of nationalities\u2019 should be handled very carefully.\u201d\n\nThis most remarkable line of reasoning at the Cadet conference deserves serious attention from all Marxists and all democrats. (We will note in parentheses that Kievskaya Mysl, which is evidently very well informed and no doubt presents Mr. Kokoshkin\u2019s ideas correctly, added that, of course, as a warning to his opponents, he laid special stress on the danger of the \u201cdisintegration\u201d of the state.)\n\nThe official report in Rech is composed with consummate diplomatic skill designed to lift the veil as little as possible and to conceal as much as possible. Yet, in the main, what took place at the Cadet conference is quite clear. The liberal-bourgeois delegates, who were familiar with the state of affairs in the Ukraine, and the \u201cLeft\u201d Cadets raised the question precisely of the political self-determination of nations. Otherwise, there would have been no need for Mr. Kokoshkin to urge that this \u201cformula\u201d should be \u201chandled carefully\u201d.\n\nThe Cadet programme, which was of course known to the delegates at the Cadet conference, speaks of \u201ccultural\u201d, not of political self-determination. Hence, Mr. Kokoshkin was defending the programme against the Ukrainian delegates, and against the Left Cadets; he was defending \u201ccultural\u201d self-determination as opposed to \u201cpolitical\u201d self-determination. It is perfectly clear that in opposing \u201cpolitical\u201d self-determination, in playing up the danger of the \u201cdisintegration of the state\u201d, and in calling the formula \u201cpolitical self-determination\u201d an \u201celastic\u201d one (quite in keeping with Rosa Luxemburg!), Mr. Kokoshkin was defending Great-Russian national-liberalism against the more \u201cLeft\u201d or more democratic elements of the Constitutional-Democratic Party and also against the Ukrainian bourgeoisie.\n\nMr. Kokoshkin won the day at the Cadet conference, as is evident from the treacherous little word \u201chowever\u201d in the Rech report; Great-Russian national-liberalism has triumphed among the Cadets. Will not this victory help to clear the minds of those misguided individuals among the Marxists in Russia who, like the Cadets, have also begun to fear the \u201celastic formulas of political self-determination of nationalities\u201d?\n\nLet us, \u201chowever\u201d, examine the substance of Mr. Kokoshkin\u2019s line of thought. By referring to \u201cpast political experience\u201d (i.e., evidently, the experience of , when the Great-Russian bourgeoisie took alarm for its national privileges and scared the Cadet Party with its fears), and also by playing up the danger of the \u201cdisintegration of the state\u201d, Mr. Kokoshkin showed that he understood perfectly well that political self-determination can mean nothing else but the right to secede and form an independent national state. The question is\u2014how should Mr. Kokoshkin\u2019s fears be appraised in the light of democracy in general, and the proletarian class struggle in particular?\n\nMr. Kokoshkin would have us believe that recognition of the right to secession increases the danger of the \u201cdisintegration of the state\u201d. This is the viewpoint of Constable Mymretsov, whose motto was \u201cgrab \u2019em and hold \u2019em\u201d. From the viewpoint of democracy in general, the very opposite is the case: recognition of the right to secession reduces the danger of the \u201cdisintegration of the state\u201d.\n\nMr. Kokoshkin argues exactly like the nationalists do. At their last congress they attacked the Ukrainian \u201cMazeppists\u201d. The Ukrainian movement, Mr. Savenko and Co. exclaimed, threatens to weaken the ties between the Ukraine and Russia, since Austrian Ukrainophilism is strengthening the Ukrainians\u2019 ties with Austria! It remains unexplained why Russia cannot try to \u201cstrengthen\u201d her ties with the Ukrainians through the same method that the Savenkos blame Austria for using, i.e., by granting the Ukrainians freedom to use their own language, self-government and an autonomous Diet.\n\nThe arguments of the Savenkos and Kokoshkins are exactly alike, and from the purely logical point of view they are equally ridiculous and absurd. Is it not clear that the more liberty the Ukrainian nationality enjoys in any particular country, the stronger its ties with that country will be? One would think that this truism could not be disputed without totally abandoning all the premises of democracy. Can there be greater freedom of nationality, as such, than the freedom to secede, the freedom to form an independent national state?\n\nTo clear up this question, which has been so confused by the liberals (and by those who are so misguided, as to echo them), we shall cite a very simple example. Let us take the question of divorce. In her article Rosa Luxemburg writes that the centralised democratic state, while conceding autonomy to its constituent parts, should retain the most important branches of legislation, including legislation on divorce, under the jurisdiction of the central parliament. The concern that the central authority of the democratic state should retain the power to allow divorce can be readily understood. The reactionaries are opposed to freedom of divorce; they say that it must be \u201chandled carefully\u201d, and loudly declare that it means the \u201cdisintegration of the family\u201d. The democrats, however, believe that the reactionaries are hypocrites, and that they are actually defending the omnipotence of the police and the bureaucracy, the privileges of one of the sexes, and the worst kind of oppression of women. They believe that in actual fact freedom of divorce will not cause the \u201cdisintegration\u201d of family ties, but, on the contrary, will strengthen them on a democratic basis, which is the only possible and durable basis in civilised society.\n\nTo accuse those who support freedom of self-determination, i. e., freedom to secede, of encouraging separatism, is as foolish and hypocritical as accusing those who advocate freedom of divorce of encouraging the destruction of family ties. Just as in bourgeois society the defenders of privilege and corruption, on which bourgeois marriage rests, oppose freedom of divorce, so, in the capitalist state, repudiation of the right to self-determination, i. e., the right of nations to secede, means nothing more than defence of the privileges of the dominant nation and police methods of administration, to the detriment of democratic methods.\n\nNo doubt, the political chicanery arising from all the relationships existing in capitalist society sometimes leads members of parliament and journalists to indulge in frivolous and even nonsensical twaddle about one or another nation seceding. But only reactionaries can allow themselves to be frightened (or pretend to be frightened) by such talk. Those who stand by democratic principles, i.e., who insist that questions of state be decided by the mass of the population, know very well that there is a \u201ctremendous distance\u201d[] between what the politicians prate about and what the people decide. From their daily experience the masses know perfectly well the value of geographical and economic ties and the advantages of a big market and a big state. They will, therefore, resort to secession only when national oppression and national friction make joint life absolutely intolerable and hinder any and all economic intercourse. In that case, the interests of capitalist development and of the freedom of the class struggle will be best served by secession.\n\nThus, from whatever angle we approach Mr. Kokoshkin\u2019s arguments, they prove to be the height of absurdity and a mockery of the principles of democracy. And yet there is a modicum of logic in these arguments, the logic of the class interests of the Great-Russian bourgeoisie. Like most members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, Mr. Kokoshkin is a lackey of the money-bags of that bourgeoisie. He defends its privileges in general, and its state privileges in particular. He defends them hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with Purishkevich, the only difference being that Purishkevich puts more faith in the feudalist cudgel, while Kokoshkin and Co. realise that this cudgel was badly damaged in , and rely more on bourgeois methods of fooling the masses, such as frightening the petty bourgeoisie and the peasants with the spectre of the \u201cdisintegration of the state\u201d, and deluding them with phrases about blending \u201cpeople\u2019s freedom\u201d with historical tradition, etc.\n\nThe liberals\u2019 hostility to the principle of political self-determination of nations can have one, and only one, real class meaning: national-liberalism, defence of the state privileges of the Great-Russian bourgeoisie. And the opportunists among the Marxists in Russia, who today, under the Third of June regime, are against the right of nations to self-determination\u2014the liquidator Semkovsky, the Bundist Liebman, the Ukrainian petty-bourgeois Yurkevich\u2014are actually following in the wake of the national-liberals, and corrupting the working class with national-liberal ideas.\n\nThe interests of the working class and of its struggle against capitalism demand complete solidarity and the closest unity of the workers of all nations; they demand resistance to the nationalist policy of the bourgeoisie of every nationality. Hence, Social-Democrats would be deviating from proletarian policy and subordinating the workers to the policy of the bourgeoisie if they were to repudiate the right of nations to self-determination, i.e., the right of an oppressed nation to secede, or if they were to support all the national demands of the bourgeoisie of oppressed nations. It makes no difference to the hired worker whether he is exploited chiefly by the Great-Russian bourgeoisie rather than the non-Russian bourgeoisie, or by the Polish bourgeoisie rather than the Jewish bourgeoisie, etc. The hired worker who has come to understand his class interests is equally indifferent to the state privileges of the Great-Russian capitalists and to the promises of the Polish or Ukrainian capitalists to set up an earthly paradise when they obtain state privileges. Capitalism is developing and will continue to develop, anyway, both in integral states with a mixed population and in separate national states.\n\nIn any case the hired worker will be an object of exploitation. Successful struggle against exploitation requires that the proletariat be free of nationalism, and be absolutely neutral, so to speak, in the fight for supremacy that is going on among the bourgeoisie of the various nations. If the proletariat of any one nation gives the slightest support to the privileges of its \u201cown\u201d national bourgeoisie, that will inevitably rouse distrust among the proletariat of another nation; it will weaken the international class solidarity of the workers and divide them, to the delight of the bourgeoisie. Repudiation of the right to self-determination or to secession inevitably means, in practice, support for the privileges of the dominant nation.\n\nWe will get even more striking confirmation of this if we take the concrete case of Norway\u2019s secession from Sweden.\n. NORWAY\u2019S SECESSION FROM SWEDEN\nRosa Luxemburg cites precisely this example, and discusses it as follows:\n\n\u201cThe latest event in the history of federative relations, the secession of Norway from Sweden\u2014which at the time was hastily seized upon by the social-patriotic Polish press (see the Cracow Naprzod[]) as a gratifying sign of the strength and progressive nature of the tendency towards state secession\u2014at once provided striking proof that federalism and its concomitant, separation, are in no way an expression of progress or democracy. After the so-called Norwegian \u2018revolution\u2019, which meant that the Swedish king was deposed and compelled to leave Norway, the Norwegians coolly proceeded to choose another king, formally rejecting, by a national referendum, the proposal to establish a republic. That which superficial admirers of all national movements and of all semblance of independence proclaimed to be a \u2018revolution\u2019 was simply a manifestation of peasant and petty-bourgeois particularism, the desire to have a king \u2018of their own\u2019 for their money instead of one imposed upon them by the Swedish aristocracy, and was, consequently, a movement that had absolutely nothing in common with revolution. At the same time, the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway showed once more to what extent, in this case also, the federation which had existed until then was only an expression of purely dynastic interests and, therefore, merely a form of monarchism and reaction.\u201d (Przeglad.)\n\nThat is literally all that Rosa Luxemburg has to say on this score! Admittedly, it would have been difficult for her to have revealed the hopelessness of her position more saliently than she has done in this particular instance.\n\nThe question was, and is: do the Social-Democrats in a mixed national state need a programme that recognises the right to self-determination or secession?\n\nWhat does the example of Norway, cited by Rosa Luxemburg, tell us on this point?\n\nOur author twists and turns, exercises her wit and rails at Naprzod, but she does not answer the question! Rosa Luxemburg speaks about everything under the sun so as to avoid saying a single word about the actual point at issue!\n\nUndoubtedly, in wishing to have a king of their own for their money, and in rejecting, in a national referendum, the proposal to establish a republic, the Norwegian petty bourgeoisie displayed exceedingly bad philistine qualities. Undoubtedly, Naprzod displayed equally bad and equally philistine qualities in failing to notice this.\n\nBut what has all this to do with the case?\n\nThe question under discussion was the right of nations to self-determination and the attitude to be adopted by the socialist proletariat towards this right! Why, then, does not Rosa Luxemburg answer this question instead of beating about the bush?\n\nTo a mouse there is no stronger beast than the cat, it is said. To Rosa Luxemburg there is evidently no stronger beast than the \u201cFracy\u201d. \u201cFracy\u201d is the popular term for the \u201cPolish Socialist Party\u201d, its so-called revolutionary section, and the Cracow newspaper Naprzod shares the views of that \u201csection\u201d. Rosa Luxemburg is so blinded by her fight against the nationalism of that \u201csection\u201d that she loses sight of everything except Naprzod.\n\nIf Naprzod says \u201cyes\u201d, Rosa Luxemburg considers it her sacred duty to say an immediate \u201cno\u201d, without stopping to think that by so doing she does not reveal independence of Naprzod, but, on the contrary, her ludicrous dependence on the \u201cFracy\u201d and her inability to see things from a view point any deeper and broader than that of the Cracow ant hill. Naprzod, of course, is a wretched and by no means Marxist organ; but that should not prevent us from properly analysing the example of Norway, once we have chosen it.\n\nTo analyse this example in Marxist fashion, we must deal, not with the vices of the awfully terrible \u201cFracy\u201d, but, first, with the concrete historical features of the secession of Norway from Sweden, and secondly, with the tasks which confronted the proletariat of both countries in connection with this secession.\n\nThe geographic, economic and language ties between Norway and Sweden are as intimate as those between the Great Russians and many other Slav nations. But the union between Norway and Sweden was not a voluntary one, and in dragging in the question of \u201cfederation\u201d Rosa Luxemburg was talking at random, simply because she did not know what to say. Norway was ceded to Sweden by the monarchs during the Napoleonic wars, against the will of the Norwegians; and the Swedes had to bring troops into Norway to subdue her.\n\nDespite the very extensive autonomy which Norway enjoyed (she had her own parliament, etc.), there was constant friction between Norway and Sweden for many decades after the union, and the Norwegians strove hard to throw off the yoke of the Swedish aristocracy. At last, in August , they succeeded: the Norwegian parliament resolved that the Swedish king was no longer king of Norway, and in the referendum held later among the Norwegian people, the overwhelming majority (about , as against a few hundred) voted for complete separation from Sweden. After a short period of indecision, the Swedes resigned themselves to the fact of secession.\n\nThis example shows us on what grounds cases of the secession of nations are practicable, and actually occur, under modern economic and political relationships, and the form secession sometimes assumes under conditions of political freedom and democracy.\n\nNo Social-Democrat will deny\u2014unless he would profess indifference to questions of political freedom and democracy (in which case he is naturally no longer a Social-Democrat)\u2014that this example virtually proves that it is the bounden duty of class-conscious workers to conduct systematic propaganda and prepare the ground for the settlement of conflicts that may arise over the secession of nations, not in the \u201cRussian way\u201d, but only in the way they were settled in  between Norway and Sweden. This is exactly what is meant by the demand in the programme for the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination. But Rosa Luxemburg tried to get around a fact that was repugnant to her theory by violently attacking the philistinism of the Norwegian philistines and the Cracow Naprzod; for she understood perfectly well that this historical fact completely refutes her phrases about the right of nations to self-determination being a \u201cutopia\u201d, or like the right \u201cto eat off gold plates\u201d, etc. Such phrases only express a smug and opportunist belief in the immutability of the present alignment of forces among the nationalities of Eastern Europe.\n\nTo proceed. In the question of the self-determination of nations, as in every other question, we are interested, first and foremost, in the self-determination of the proletariat within a given nation. Rosa Luxemburg modestly evaded this question too, for she realised that an analysis of it on the basis of the example of Norway, which she herself had chosen, would be disastrous to her \u201ctheory\u201d.\n\nWhat position did the Norwegian and Swedish proletariat take, and indeed had to take, in the conflict over secession? After Norway seceded, the class-conscious workers of Norway would naturally have voted for a republic,[] and if some socialists voted otherwise it only goes to show how much dense, philistine opportunism there sometimes is in the European socialist movement. There can be no two opinions about that, and we mention the point only because Rosa Luxemburg is trying to obscure the issue by speaking off the mark. We do not know whether the Norwegian socialist programme made it obligatory for Norwegian Social-Democrats to hold particular views on the question of secession. We will assume that it did not, and that the Norwegian socialists left it an open question as to what extent the autonomy of Norway gave sufficient scope to wage the class struggle freely, or to what extent the eternal friction and conflicts with the Swedish aristocracy hindered freedom of economic life. But it cannot be disputed that the Norwegian proletariat had to oppose this aristocracy and support Norwegian peasant democracy (with all its philistine limitations).\n\nAnd the Swedish proletariat? It is common knowledge that the Swedish landed proprietors, abetted by the Swedish clergy, advocated war against Norway. Inasmuch as Norway was much weaker than Sweden, had already experienced a Swedish invasion, and the Swedish aristocracy carries enormous weight in its own country, this advocacy of war presented a grave danger. We may be sure that the Swedish Kokoshkins spent much time and energy in trying to corrupt the minds of the Swedish people by appeals to \u201chandle\u201d the \u201celastic formulas of political self-determination of nations carefully\u201d, by painting horrific pictures of the danger of the \u201cdisintegration of the state\u201d and by assuring them that \u201cpeople\u2019s freedom\u201d was compatible with the traditions of the Swedish aristocracy. There cannot be the slightest doubt that the Swedish Social-Democrats would have betrayed the cause of socialism and democracy if they had not fought with all their might to combat both the landlord and the \u201cKokoshkin\u201d ideology and policy, and if they had failed to demand, not only equality of nations in general (to which the Kokoshkins also subscribe), but also the right of nations to self-determination, Norway\u2019s freedom to secede.\n\nThe close alliance between the Norwegian and Swedish workers, their complete fraternal class solidarity, gained from the Swedish workers\u2019 recognition of the right of the Norwegians to secede. This convinced the Norwegian workers that the Swedish workers were not infected with Swedish nationalism, and that they placed fraternity with the Norwegian proletarians above the privileges of the Swedish bourgeoisie and aristocracy. The dissolution of the ties imposed upon Norway by the monarchs of Europe and the Swedish aristocracy strengthened the ties between the Norwegian and Swedish workers. The Swedish workers have proved that in spite of all the vicissitudes of bourgeois policy\u2014bourgeois relations may quite possibly bring about a repetition of the forcible subjection of the Norwegians to the Swedes!\u2014they will be able to preserve and defend the complete equality and class solidarity of the workers of both nations in the struggle against both the Swedish and the Norwegian bourgeoisie.\n\nIncidentally, this reveals how groundless and even frivolous are the attempts sometimes made by the \u201cFracy\u201d to \u201cuse\u201d our disagreements with Rosa Luxemburg against Polish Social-Democracy. The \u201cFracy\u201d are not a proletarian or a socialist party, but a petty-bourgeois nationalist party, something like Polish Social-Revolutionaries. There never has been, nor could there be, any question of unity between the Russian Social-Democrats and this party. On the other hand, no Russian Social-Democrat has ever \u201crepented\u201d of the close relations and unity that have been established with the Polish Social-Democrats. The Polish Social-Democrats have rendered a great historical service by creating the first really Marxist, proletarian party in Poland, a country imbued with nationalist aspirations and passions. Yet the service the Polish Social-Democrats have rendered is a great one, not because Rosa Luxemburg has talked a lot of nonsense about \u00a7 of the Russian Marxists\u2019 Programme, but despite that sad circumstance.\n\nThe question of the \u201cright to self-determination\u201d is of course not so important to the Polish Social-Democrats as it is to the Russian. It is quite understandable that in their zeal (sometimes a little excessive, perhaps) to combat the nationalistically blinded petty bourgeoisie of Poland the Polish Social-Democrats should overdo things. No Russian Marxist has ever thought of blaming the Polish Social-Democrats for being opposed to the secession of Poland. These Social-Democrats err only when, like Rosa Luxemburg, they try to deny the necessity of including the recognition of the right to self-determination in the Programme of the Russian Marxists.\n\nVirtually, this is like attempting to apply relationships, understandable by Cracow standards, to all the peoples and nations inhabiting Russia, including the Great Russians. It means being \u201cPolish nationalists the wrong way round\u201d, not Russian, not international Social-Democrats.\n\nFor international Social-Democracy stands for the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination. This is what we shall now proceed to discuss.\n. THE RESOLUTION OF THE LONDON INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS, \nThis resolution reads:\n\n\u201cThis Congress declares that it stands for the full right of all nations to self-determination [Selbstbestimmungsrecht] and expresses its sympathy for the workers of ever country now suffering under the yoke of military, national or other absolutism. This Congress calls upon the workers of all these countries to join the ranks of the class-conscious [Klassenbewusste\u2014those who understand their class interests] workers of the whole world in order jointly to fight for the defeat of international capitalism and for the achievement of the aims of international Social-Democracy.\u201d[]\n\nAs we have already pointed out, our opportunists\u2014Semkovsky, Liebman and Yurkevich\u2014are simply unaware of this resolution. But Rosa Luxemburg knows it and quotes the full text, which contains the same expression as that contained in our programme, viz., \u201cself-determination\u201d.\n\nHow does Rosa Luxemburg remove this obstacle from the path of her \u201coriginal\u201d theory?\n\nOh, quite simply ... the whole emphasis lies in the second part of the resolution ... its declarative character ... one can refer to it only by mistake!\n\nThe feebleness and utter confusion of our author are simply amazing. Usually it is only the opportunists who talk about the consistent democratic and socialist points in the programme being mere declarations, and cravenly avoid an open debate on them. It is apparently not without reason that Rosa Luxemburg has this time found herself in the deplorable company of the Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches. Rosa Luxemburg does not venture to state openly whether she regards the above resolution as correct or erroneous. She shifts and shuffles as if counting on the inattentive or ill-informed reader, who forgets the first part of the resolution by the time he has started reading the second, or who has never heard of the discussion that took place in the socialist press prior to the London Congress.\n\nRosa Luxemburg is greatly mistaken, however, if she imagines that, in the sight of the class-conscious workers of Russia, she can get away with trampling upon the resolution of the International on such an important fundamental issue, without even deigning to analyse it critically.\n\nRosa Luxemburg\u2019s point of view was voiced during the discussions which took place prior to the London Congress, mainly in the columns of Die Neue Zeit, organ of the German Marxists; in essence this point of view was defeated in the International! That is the crux of the matter, which the Russian reader must particularly bear in mind.\n\nThe debate turned on the question of Poland\u2019s independence. Three points of view were put forward:\n\n. That of the \u201cFracy\u201d, in whose name Haecker spoke. They wanted the International to include in its own programme a demand for the independence of Poland. The motion was not carried and this point of view was defeated in the International.\n\n. Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s point of view, viz., the Polish socialists should not demand independence for Poland. This point of view entirely precluded the proclamation of the right of nations to self-determination. It was likewise defeated in the International.\n\n. The point of view which was elaborated at the time by K. Kautsky, who opposed Rosa Luxemburg and proved that her materialism was extremely \u201cone-sided\u201d; according to Kautsky, the International could not at the time make the independence of Poland a point in its programme; but the Polish socialists were fully entitled to put forward such a demand. From the socialists\u2019 point of view it was undoubtedly a mistake to ignore the tasks of national liberation in a situation where national oppression existed.\n\nThe International\u2019s resolution reproduces the most essential and fundamental propositions in this point of view: on the one hand, the absolutely direct, unequivocal recognition of the full right of all nations to self-determination; on the other hand, the equally unambiguous appeal to the workers for international unity in their class struggle.\n\nWe think that this resolution is absolutely correct, and that, to the countries of Eastern Europe and Asia at the beginning of the twentieth century, it is this resolution, with both its parts being taken as an integral whole, that gives the only correct lead to the proletarian class policy in the national question.\n\nLet us deal with the three above-mentioned viewpoints in somewhat greater detail.\n\nAs is known, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels considered it the bounden duty of the whole of West-European democracy, and still more of Social-Democracy, to give active support to the demand for Polish independence. For the period of the s and s, the period of the bourgeois revolutions in Austria and Germany, and the period of the \u201cPeasant Reform\u201d in Russia,[] this point of view was quite correct and the only one that was consistently democratic and proletarian. So long as the masses of the people in Russia and in most of the Slav countries were still sunk in torpor, so long as there were no independent, mass, democratic movements in those countries, the liberation movement of the gentry in Poland assumed an immense and paramount importance from the point of view, not only of Russian, not only of Slav, but of European democracy as a whole.[] []\n\nBut while Marx\u2019s standpoint was quite correct for the forties, fifties and sixties or for the third quarter of the nineteenth century, it has ceased to be correct by the twentieth century. Independent democratic movements, and even an independent proletarian movement, have arisen in most Slav countries, even in Russia, one of the most backward Slav countries. Aristocratic Poland has disappeared, yielding place to capitalist Poland. Under such circumstances Poland could not but lose her exceptional revolutionary importance.\n\nThe attempt of the P.S.P. (the Polish Socialist Party, the present-day \u201cFracy\u201d) in  to \u201cestablish\u201d for all time the point of view Marx had held in a different epoch was an attempt to use the letter of Marxism against the spirit of Marxism. The Polish Social-Democrats were therefore quite right in attacking the extreme nationalism of the Polish petty bourgeoisie and pointing out that the national question was of secondary importance to Polish workers, in creating for the first time a purely proletarian party in Poland and proclaiming the extremely important principle that the Polish and the Russian workers must maintain the closest alliance in their class struggle.\n\nBut did this mean that at the beginning of the twentieth century the International could regard the principle of political self-determination of nations, or the right to secede, as unnecessary to Eastern Europe and Asia? This would have been the height of absurdity, and (theoretically) tantamount to admitting that the bourgeois-democratic reform of the Turkish, Russian and Chinese states had been consummated; indeed it would have been tantamount (in practice) to opportunism, towards absolutism.\n\nNo. At a time when bourgeois-democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe and Asia have begun, in this period of the awakening and intensification of national movements and of the formation of independent proletarian parties, the task of these parties with regard to national policy must be twofold: recognition of the right of all nations to self-determination, since bourgeois-democratic reform is-not yet completed and since working-class democracy consistently, seriously and sincerely (and not in a liberal, Kokoshkin fashion) fights for equal rights for nations; then, a close, unbreakable alliance in the class struggle of the proletarians of all nations in a given state, throughout all the changes in its history, irrespective of any reshaping of the frontiers of the individual states by the bourgeoisie.\n\nIt is this twofold task of the proletariat that the  resolution of the International formulates. That is the substance, the underlying principle, of the resolution adopted by the Conference of Russian Marxists held in the summer of . Some people profess to see a \u201ccontradiction\u201d in the fact that while point  of this resolution, which recognises the right to self-determination and secession, seems to \u201cconcede\u201d the maximum to nationalism (in reality, the recognition of the right of all nations to self-determination implies the maximum of democracy and the minimum of nationalism), point  warns the workers against the nationalist slogans of the bourgeoisie of any nation and demands the unity and amalgamation of the workers of all nations in internationally united proletarian organisations. But this is a \u201ccontradiction\u201d only for extremely shallow minds, which, for instance, cannot grasp why the unity and class solidarity of the Swedish and the Norwegian proletariat gained when the Swedish workers upheld Norway\u2019s freedom to secede and form an independent state.\n\n. THE UTOPIAN KARL MARX AND THE PRACTICAL ROSA LUXEMBURG\nCalling Polish independence a \u201cutopia\u201d and repeating this ad nauseam, Rosa Luxemburg exclaims ironically: Why not raise the demand for the independence of Ireland?\n\nThe \u201cpractical\u201d Rosa Luxemburg evidently does not know what Karl Marx\u2019s attitude to the question of Irish independence was. It is worth while dwelling upon this, so as to show how a concrete demand for national independence was analysed from a genuinely Marxist, not opportunist, standpoint.\n\nIt was Marx\u2019s custom to \u201csound out\u201d his socialist acquaintances, as he expressed it, to test their intelligence and the strength of their convictions.[] After making the acquaintance of Lopatin, Marx wrote to Engels on July , , expressing a highly flattering opinion of the young Russian socialist but adding at the same time:\n\n\u201cPoland is his weak point. On this point he speaks quite like an Englishman\u2014say, an English Chartist of the old school\u2014about Ireland.\u201d[]\n\nMarx questions a socialist belonging to an oppressor nation about his attitude to the oppressed nation and at once reveals a defect common to the socialists of the dominant nations (the English and the Russian): failure to understand their socialist duties towards the downtrodden nations, their echoing of the prejudices acquired from the bourgeoisie of the \u201cdominant nation\u201d.\n\nBefore passing on to Marx\u2019s positive declarations on Ireland, we must point out that in general the attitude of Marx and Engels to the national question was strictly critical, and that they recognised its historically conditioned importance. Thus, Engels wrote to Marx on May , , that the study of history was leading him to pessimistic conclusions in regard to Poland, that the importance of Poland was temporary\u2014only until the agrarian revolution in Russia. The role of the Poles in history was one of \u201cbold (hotheaded) foolishness\u201d. \u201cAnd one cannot point to a single instance in which Poland has successfully represented progress, even in relation to Russia, or done anything at all of historical importance.\u201d Russia contains more of civilisation, education, industry and the bourgeoisie than \u201cthe Poland of the indolent gentry\u201d. \u201cWhat are Warsaw and Cracow compared to St. Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa!\u201d Engels had no faith in the success of the Polish gentry\u2019s insurrections.\n\nBut all these thoughts, showing the deep insight of genius, by no means prevented Engels and Marx from treating the Polish movement with the most profound and ardent sympathy twelve years later, when Russia was still dormant and Poland was seething.\n\nWhen drafting the Address of the International in , Marx wrote to Engels (on November , ) that he had to combat Mazzini\u2019s nationalism, and went on to say: \u201cInasmuch as international politics occurred in the Address, I spoke of countries, not of nationalities, and denounced Russia, not the minores gentium.\u201d Marx had no doubt as to the subordinate position of the national question as compared with the \u201clabour question\u201d. But his theory is as far from ignoring national movements as heaven is from earth.\n\nThen came . Marx wrote to Engels about the \u201cProudhonist clique\u201d in Paris which \u201cdeclares nationalities to be an absurdity, attacks Bismarck and Garibaldi. As polemics against chauvinism their doings are useful and explicable. But as believers in Proudhon (Lafargue and Longuet, two very good friends of mine here, also belong to them), who think all Europe must and will sit quietly on their hind quarters until the gentlemen in France abolish poverty and ignorance\u2014they are grotesque.\u201d (Letter of June , .)\n\n\u201cYesterday,\u201d Marx wrote on June , , \u201cthere Was a discussion in the International Council on the present war.... The discussion wound up, as was to be foreseen, with \u2018the question of nationality\u2019 in general and the attitude we take towards it.... The representatives of \u2018Young France\u2019 (non workers) came out with the announcement that all nationalities and even nations were \u2018antiquated prejudices\u2019. Proudhonised Stirnerism.... The whole world waits until the French are ripe for a social revolution.... The English laughed very much when I began my speech by saying that our friend Lafargue and others, who had done away with nationalities, had spoken \u2018French\u2019 to us, i. e., a language which nine-tenths of the audience did not understand. I also suggested that by the negation of nationalities he appeared, quite unconsciously, to understand their absorption by the model French nation.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion that follows from all these critical remarks of Marx\u2019s is clear: the working class should be the last to make a fetish of the national question, since the development of capitalism does, not necessarily awaken all nations to independent life. But to brush aside the mass national movements once they have started, and to refuse to support what is progressive in them means, in effect, pandering to nationalistic prejudices, that is, recognising \u201cone\u2019s own nation\u201d as a model nation (or, we would add, one possessing the exclusive privilege of forming a state).[]\n\nBut let us return to the question of Ireland.\n\nMarx\u2019s position on this question is most clearly expressed in the following extracts from his letters:\n\n\u201cI have done my best to bring about this demonstration of the English workers in favour of Fenianism.... I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable, although after the separation there may come federation.\u201d This is what Marx wrote to Engels on November , .\n\nIn his letter of November  of the same year he added:\n\n\u201c...what shall we advise the English workers? In my opinion they must make the Repeal of the Union\u201d [Ireland with England, i.e., the separation of Ireland from England] (in short, the affair of , only democratised and adapted to the conditions of the time) an article of their pronunziamento. This is the only legal and therefore only possible form of Irish emancipation which can be admitted in the programme of an English party. Experience must show later whether a mere personal union can continue to subsist between the two countries....\n\n\u201c...What the Irish need is:\n\n\u201c) Self-government and independence from England;\n\n\u201c) An agrarian revolution....\u201d\n\nMarx attached great importance to the Irish question and delivered hour-and-a-half lectures on this subject at the German Workers\u2019 Union (letter of December , ).\n\nIn a letter dated November , , Engels spoke of \u201cthe hatred towards the Irish found among the English workers\u201d, and almost a year later (October , ), returning to this subject, he wrote\n\n\u201cIl n\u2019y a qu\u2019un pas [it is only one step] from Ireland to Russia.... Irish history shows what a misfortune it is for one nation to have subjugated another. All the abominations of the English have their origin in the Irish Pale. I have still to plough my way through the Cromwellian period, but this much seems certain to me, that things would have taken another turn in England, too, but for the necessity of military rule in Ireland and the creation of a new aristocracy there.\u201d\n\nLet us note, in passing, Marx\u2019s letter to Engels of August , :\n\n\u201cThe Polish workers in Posen have brought a strike to a victorious end with the help of their colleagues in Berlin. This struggle against Monsieur le Capital\u2014even in the lower form of the strike\u2014is a more serious way of getting rid of national prejudices than peace declamations from the lips of bourgeois gentlemen.\u201d\n\nThe policy on the Irish question pursued by Marx in the International may be seen from the following:\n\nOn November , , Marx wrote to Engels that he had spoken for an hour and a quarter at the Council of the International on the question of the attitude of the British Ministry to the Irish Amnesty, and had proposed the following resolution:\n\n\u201cResolved,\n\n\u201cthat in his reply to the Irish demands for the release of the imprisoned Irish patriots Mr. Gladstone deliberately insults the Irish nation;\n\n\u201cthat he clogs political amnesty with conditions alike degrading to the victims of misgovernment and the people they belong to;\n\n\u201cthat having, in the teeth of his responsible position, publicly and enthusiastically cheered on the American slave-holders\u2019 rebellion, he now steps in to preach to the Irish people the doctrine of passive obedience;\n\n\u201cthat his whole proceedings with reference to the Irish Amnesty question are the true and genuine offspring of that \u2018policy of conquest\u2019, by the fiery denunciation of which Mr. Gladstone ousted his Tory rivals from office;\n\n\u201cthat the General Council of the International Workingmen\u2019s Association express their admiration of the spirited, firm and high-souled manner in which the Irish people carry on their Amnesty movement;\n\n\u201cthat this resolution be communicated to all branches of, and workingmen\u2019s bodies connected with, the International Workingmen\u2019s Association in Europe and America.\u201d\n\nOn December , , Marx wrote that his paper on the Irish question to be read at the Council of the International would be couched as follows:\n\n\u201cQuite apart from all phrases about \u2018international\u2019 and \u2018humane\u2019 justice for Ireland\u2014which are taken for granted in the International Council\u2014it is in the direct and absolute interest of the English working class to get rid of their present connexion with Ireland. And this is my fullest conviction; and for reasons which in part I can not tell the English workers themselves. For a long time I believed that it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by English working-class ascendancy. I always expressed this point of view in the New York Tribune[] [an American paper to which Marx contributed for a long time]. Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite. The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ireland.... The English reaction in England had its roots in the subjugation of Ireland.\u201d (Marx\u2019s italics.)\n\nMarx\u2019s policy on the Irish question should now be quite clear to our readers.\n\nMarx, the \u201cutopian\u201d, was so \u201cunpractical\u201d that he stood for the separation of Ireland, which half a century later has not yet been achieved.\n\nWhat gave rise to Marx\u2019s policy, and was it not mistaken?\n\nAt first Marx thought that Ireland would not be liberated by the national movement of the oppressed nation, but by the working-class movement of the oppressor nation. Marx did not make an Absolute of the national movement, knowing, as he did, that only the victory of the working class can bring about the complete liberation of all nationalities. It is impossible to estimate beforehand all the possible relations between the bourgeois liberation movements of the oppressed nations and the proletarian emancipation movement of the oppressor nation (the very problem which today makes the national question in Russia so difficult).\n\nHowever, it so happened that the English working class fell under the influence of the liberals for a fairly long time, became an appendage to the liberals, and by adopting a liberal-labour policy left itself leaderless. The bourgeois liberation movement in Ireland grew stronger and assumed revolutionary forms. Marx reconsidered his view and corrected it. \u201cWhat a misfortune it is for a nation to have subjugated another.\u201d The English working class will never be free until Ireland is freed from the English yoke. Reaction in England is strengthened and fostered by the enslavement of Ireland (just as reaction in Russia is fostered by her enslavement of a number of nations!).\n\nAnd, in proposing in the International a resolution of sympathy with \u201cthe Irish nation\u201d, \u201cthe Irish people\u201d (the clever L. Vl. would probably have berated poor Marx for forgetting about the class struggle!), Marx advocated the separation of Ireland from England, \u201calthough after the separation there may come federation\u201d.\n\nWhat were the theoretical grounds for Marx\u2019s conclusion? In England the bourgeois revolution had been consummated long ago. But it had not yet been consummated in Ireland; it is being consummated only now, after the lapse of half a century, by the reforms of the English Liberals. If capitalism had been overthrown in England as quickly as Marx had at first expected, there would have been no room for a bourgeois-democratic and general national movement in Ireland. But since it had arisen, Marx advised the English workers to support it, give it a revolutionary impetus and see it through in the interests of their own liberty.\n\nThe economic ties between Ireland and England in the s were of course, even closer than Russia\u2019s present ties with Poland, the Ukraine, etc. The \u201cunpracticality\u201d and \u201cimpracticability\u201d of the separation of Ireland (if only owing to geographical conditions and England\u2019s immense colonial power) were quite obvious. Though, in principle, an enemy of federalism, Marx in this instance granted the possibility of federation, as well,[] if only the emancipation of Ireland was achieved in a revolutionary, not reformist way, through a movement of the mass of the people of Ireland supported by the working class of England. There can be no doubt that only such a solution of the historical problem would have been in the best interests of the proletariat and most conducive to rapid social progress.\n\nThings turned out differently. Both the Irish people and the English proletariat proved weak. Only now, through the sordid deals between the English Liberals and the Irish bourgeoisie, is the Irish problem being solved (the example of Ulster shows with what difficulty) through the land reform (with compensation) and Home Rule (not yet introduced). Well then? Does it follow that Marx and Engels were \u201cutopians\u201d, that they put forward \u201cimpracticable\u201d national demands, or that they allowed themselves to be influenced by the Irish petty-bourgeois nationalists (for there is no doubt about the petty-bourgeois nature of the Fenian movement), etc.?\n\nNo. In the Irish question, too, Marx and Engels pursued a consistently proletarian policy, which really educated the masses in a spirit of democracy and socialism. Only such a policy could have saved both Ireland and England half a century of delay in introducing the necessary reforms, and prevented these reforms from being mutilated by the Liberals to please the reactionaries.\n\nThe policy of Marx and Engels on the Irish question serves as a splendid example of the attitude the proletariat of the oppressor nations should adopt towards national movements, an example which has lost none of its immense practical importance. It serves as a warning against that \u201cservile haste\u201d with which the philistines of all countries, colours and languages hurry to label as \u201cutopian\u201d the idea of altering the frontiers of states that were established by the violence and privileges of the landlords and bourgeoisie of one nation.\n\nIf the Irish and English proletariat had not accepted Marx\u2019s policy and had not made the secession of Ireland their slogan, this would have been the worst sort of opportunism, a neglect of their duties as democrats and socialists, and a concession to English reaction and the English bourgeoisie.\n\n. THE  PROGRAMME AND ITS LIQUIDATORS\nThe Minutes of the  Congress, at which the Programme of the Russian Marxists was adopted, have become a great rarity, and the vast majority of the active members of the working-class movement today are unacquainted with the motives underlying the various points (the more so since not all the literature relating to it enjoys the blessings of legality...). It is therefore necessary to analyse the debate that took place at the  Congress on the question under discussion.\n\nLet us state first of all that however meagre the Russian Social-Democratic literature on the \u201cright of nations to self-determination\u201d may be, it nevertheless shows clearly that this right has always been understood to mean the right to secession. The Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches who doubt this and declare that \u00a7 is \u201cvague\u201d, etc., do so only because of their sheer ignorance or carelessness. As far back as , Plekhanov, in Zarya, defended \u201cthe right to self-determination\u201d in the draft programme, and wrote that this demand, while not obligatory upon bourgeois democrats, was \u201cobligatory upon Social-Democrats\u201d. \u201cIf we were to for got it or hesitate, to advance it,\u201d Plekhanov wrote, \u201cfor fear of offending the national prejudices of our fellow-countrymen of Great-Russian nationality, the call ... \u2018workers of all countries, unite!\u2019 would be a shameful lie on our lips....\u201d[]\n\nThis is a very apt description of the fundamental argument in favour of the point under consideration; so apt that it is not surprising that the \u201canythingarian\u201d critics of our programme have been timidly avoiding it. The abandonment of this point, no matter for what motives, is actually a \u201cshameful\u201d concession to Great-Russian nationalism. But why Great-Russian, when it is a question of the right of all nations to self-determination? Because it refers to secession from the Great Russians. The interests of the unity of the proletarians, the interests of their class solidarity call for recognition of the right of nations to secede\u2014that is what Plekhanov admitted twelve years ago in the words quoted above. Had our opportunists given thought to this they would probably not have talked so much nonsense about self-determination.\n\nAt the  Congress, which adopted the draft programme that Plekhanov advocated, the main work was done by the Programme Commission. Unfortunately no Minutes of its proceedings were kept; they would have been particularly interesting on this point, for it was only in the Commission that the representatives of the Polish Social-Democrats, Warszawski and Hanecki, tried to defend their views and to dispute \u201crecognition of the right to self-determination\u201d. Any reader who goes to the trouble of comparing their arguments (set forth in the speech by Warszawski and the statement by him and Hanecki, pp. \u2013 and \u2013 of the Congress Minutes) with those which Rosa Luxemburg advanced in her Polish article, which we have analysed, will find them identical.\n\nHow were these arguments treated by the Programme Commission of the Second Congress, where Plekhanov, more than anyone else, spoke against the Polish Marxists? They were mercilessly ridiculed! The absurdity of proposing to the Marxists of Russia that they should reject the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination was demonstrated so plainly and clearly that the Polish Marxists did not even venture to repeat their arguments at the plenary meeting of the Congress! They left the Congress, convinced of the hopelessness of their case at the supreme assembly of Marxists\u2014Great-Russian, Jewish, Georgian, and Armenian.\n\nNeedless to say, this historic episode is of very great importance to everyone seriously interested in his own programme. The fact that the Polish Marxists\u2019 arguments were completely defeated at the Programme Commission of the Congress, and that the Polish Marxists gave up the attempt to defend their views at the plenary meeting of the Congress is very significant. No wonder Rosa Luxemburg maintained a \u201cmodest\u201d silence about it in her article in \u2014the recollection of the Congress must have been too unpleasant! She also kept quiet about the ridiculously inept proposal made by Warszawski and Hanecki in , on behalf of all Polish Marxists, to \u201camend\u201d \u00a7 of the Programme, a proposal which neither Rosa Luxemburg nor the other Polish Social-Democrats have ventured (or will ever venture) to repeat.\n\nBut although Rosa Luxemburg, concealing her defeat in , has maintained silence over these facts, those who take an interest in the history of their Party will make it their business to ascertain them and give thought to their significance.\n\nOn leaving the  Congress, Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s friends submitted the following statement:\n\n\u201cWe propose that Clause  [now Clause ] of the draft programme read as follows: \u00a7 . Institutions guaranteeing full freedom of cultural development to all nations incorporated in the state.\u201d (P.  of the Minutes.)\n\nThus, the Polish Marxists at that time put forward views on the national question that were so vague that instead of self-determination they practically proposed the notorious \u201ccultural-national autonomy\u201d, only under another name!\n\nThis sounds almost incredible, but unfortunately it is a fact. At the Congress itself, attended though it was by five Bundists with five votes and three Caucasians with six votes, without counting Kostrov\u2019s cousultative voice, not a single vote was cast for the rejection of the clause about self-determination. Three votes were cast for the proposal to add \u201ccultural-national autonomy\u201d to this clause (in favour of Goldblatt\u2019s formula: \u201cthe establishment of institutions guaranteeing the nations full freedom of cultural development\u201d) and four votes for Lieber\u2019s formula (\u201cthe right of nations to freedom in their cultural development\u201d).\n\nNow that a Russian liberal party\u2014the Constitutional-Democratic Party\u2014has appeared on the scene, we know that in its programme the political self-determination of nations has been replaced by \u201ccultural self-determination\u201d. Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s Polish friends, therefore, were \u201ccombating\u201d the nationalism of the P.S.P., and, did it so successfully that they proposed the substitution of a liberal programme for the Marxist programme! And in the same breath they accused our programme of being opportunist; no wonder this accusation was received with laughter by the Programme Commission of the Second Congress!\n\nHow was \u201cself-determination\u201d understood by the delegates to the Second Congress, of whom, as we have seen, not one was opposed to \u201cself-determination of nations\u201d?\n\nThe following three extracts from the Minutes provide the answer:\n\n\u201cMartynov is of the opinion that the term \u2018self-determination\u2019 should not be given a broad interpretation; it merely means the right of a nation to establish itself as a separate polity, not regional self-government\u201d (p. ). Martynov was a member of the Programme Commission, in which the arguments of Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s friends were repudiated and ridiculed. Martynov was then an Economist in his views, and a violent opponent of Iskra; had he expressed an opinion that was not shared by the majority of the Programme Commission he would certainly have been repudiated.\n\nBundist Goldblatt was the first to speak when the Congress, after the Commission had finished its work, discussed \u00a7 (the present Clause ) of the Programme.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cNo objections can he raised to the \u2018right to self-determination\u2019. When a nation is fighting for independence, that should not he opposed. If Poland refuses to enter into lawful marriage with Russia, she should not be interfered with, as Plekhanov put it. I agree with this opinion within these limits\u201d (pp. \u2013).\n\nPlekhanov had not spoken on this subject at all at the plenary meeting of the Congress. Goldblatt was referring to what Plekhanov had said at the Programme Commission, where the \u201cright to self-determination\u201d had been explained in a simple yet detailed manner to mean the right to secession. Lieber, who spoke after Goldblatt, remarked:\n\n\u201cOf course, if any nationality finds that it cannot live within the frontiers of Russia, the Party will not place any obstacles in its way\u201d (p. ).\n\nThe reader will see that at the Second Congress of the Party, which adopted the programme, it was unanimously understood that self-determination meant \u201conly\u201d the right to secession. Even the Bundists grasped this truth at the time, and it is only in our own deplorable times of continued counter-revolution and all sorts of \u201capostasy\u201d that we can find people who, bold in their ignorance, declare that the programme is \u201cvague\u201d. But before devoting time to these sorry would-be Social-Democrats, let us first finish with the attitude of the Poles to the programme.\n\nThey came to the Second Congress () declaring that unity was necessary and imperative. But they left the Congress after their \u201creverses\u201d in the Programme Commission, and their last word was a written statement, printed in the Minutes of the Congress, containing the above-mentioned proposal to substitute cultural-national autonomy for self-determination.\n\nIn  the Polish Marxists joined the Party; neither upon joining nor afterwards (at the Congress of , the conferences of  and , or the plenum of ) did they introduce a single proposal to amend \u00a7 of the Russian Programme!\n\nThat is a fact.\n\nAnd, despite all utterances and assurances, this fact definitely proves that Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s friends regarded the question as having been settled by the debate at the Programme Commission of the Second Congress, as well as by the decision of that Congress, and that they tacitly acknowledged their mistake and corrected it by joining the Party in , after they had left the Congress in , without a single attempt to raise the question of amending \u00a7 of the Programme through Party channels.\n\nRosa Luxemburg\u2019s article appeared over her signature in \u2014of course, it never entered anyone\u2019s head to deny Party publicists the right to criticise the programme\u2014and, since the Writing of this article, not a single official body of the Polish Marxists has raised the question of revising \u00a7.\n\nTrotsky was therefore: rendering a great disservice to certain admirers of Rosa Luxemburg when he wrote, on behalf of the editors of Borba, in issue No.  of that publication (March ):\n\n\u201cThe Polish Marxists consider that \u2018the right to national self-determination\u2019 is entirely devoid of political content and should be deleted from the programme\u201d (p. ).\n\nThe obliging Trotsky is more dangerous than an enemy! Trotsky could produce no proof, except \u201cprivate conversations\u201d (i. e., simply gossip, on which Trotsky always subsists), for classifying \u201cPolish Marxists\u201d in general as supporters of every article by Rosa Luxemburg. Trotsky presented the \u201cPolish Marxists\u201d as people devoid of honour and conscience, incapable of respecting even their own convictions and the programme of their Party. How obliging Trotsky is!\n\nWhen, in , the representatives of the Polish Marxists walked out of the Second Congress over the right to self-determination, Trotsky could have said at the time that they regarded this right as devoid of content and subject to deletion from the programme.\n\nBut after that the Polish Marxists joined the Party whose programme this was, and they have never introduced a motion to amend it.[]\n\nWhy did Trotsky withhold these facts from the readers of his journal? Only because it pays him to speculate on fomenting differences between the Polish and the Russian opponents of liquidationism and to deceive the Russian workers on the question of the programme.\n\nTrotsky has never yet held a firm opinion on any important question of Marxism. He always contrives to worm his way into the cracks of any given difference of opinion, and desert one side for the other. At the present moment he is in the company of the Bundists and the liquidators. And these gentlemen do not stand on ceremony where the Party is concerned.\n\nListen to the Bundist Liebman.\n\n\u201cWhen, fifteen years ago,\u201d this gentleman writes, \u201cthe Russian Social-Democrats included the point about the right of every nationality to \u2018self-determination\u2019 in their programme, everyone [!] asked himself: What does this fashionable [!] term really mean? No answer was forthcoming [!]. This word was left [!] wrapped in mist. And indeed, at the time, it was difficult to dispel that mist. The moment had not come when this point could be made concrete\u2014it was said\u2014so let it remain wrapped in mist [!] for the time being and practice will show what content should he put into it.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t it magnificent, the way this \u201cragamuffin\u201d[] mocks at the Party programme?\n\nAnd why does he mock at it?\n\nBecause he is an absolute ignoramus, who has never learnt anything or even read any Party history, but merely happened to land in liquidationist circles where going about in the nude is considered the \u201cright\u201d thing to do as far as knowledge of the Party and everything it stands for is concerned.\n\nPomyalovsky\u2019s seminary student boasts of having \u201cspat into a barrel of sauerkraut\u201d.[] The Bundist gentlemen have gone one better. They let the Liebmans loose to spit publicly into their own barrel. What do the Liebmans care about the fact that the International Congress has passed a decision, that at the Congress of their own Party the representatives of their own Bund proved that they were quite able (and what \u201csevere\u201d critics and determined enemies of Iskra they were!) to understand the meaning of \u201cself-determination\u201d and were even in agreement with it? And will it not be easier to liquidate the Party if the \u201cParty publicists\u201d (no jokes, please!) treat its history and programme after the fashion of the seminary student?\n\nHere is a second \u201cragamuffin\u201d, Mr. Yurkevich of Dzvin. Mr. Yurkevich must have had the Minutes of the Second Congress before him, because he quotes Plekhanov, as repeated by Goldblatt, and shows that he is aware of the fact that self-determination can only mean the right to secession. This, however, does not prevent him from spreading slander about the Russian Marxists among the Ukrainian petty bourgeoisie, alleging that they stand for the \u201cstate integrity\u201d of Russia. (No. \u2013, , p. , etc.) Of course, the Yurkeviches could not have invented a better method than such slander to alienate the Ukrainian democrats from the Great-Russian democrats. And such alienation is in line with the entire policy of the group of Dzvin publicists who advocate the separation of the Ukrainian workers in a special national organisation![]\n\nIt is quite appropriate, of course, that a group of nationalist philistines, who are engaged in splitting the ranks of the proletariat\u2014and objectively this is the role of Dzvin\u2014 should disseminate such hopeless confusion on the national question. Needless to say, the Yurkeviches and Liebmans, who are \u201cterribly\u201d offended when they are called \u201cnear Party men\u201d, do not say a word, not a single word, as to how they would like the problem of the right to secede to be settled in the programme.\n\nBut here is the third and principal \u201cragamuffin\u201d, Mr. Semkovsky, who, addressing a Great-Russian audience through the columns of a liquidationist newspaper, lashes at \u00a7 of the Programme and at the same time declares that \u201cfor certain reasons he does not approve of the proposal\u201d to delete this clause!\n\nThis is incredible, but it is a fact.\n\nIn August , the liquidators\u2019 conference raised the national question officially. For eighteen months not a single article has appeared on the question of \u00a7, except the one written by Mr. Semkovsky. And in this article the author repudiates the programme, \u201cwithout approving\u201d, however, \u201cfor certain reasons\u201d (is this a secrecy disease?) the proposal to amend it! We may be sure that it would be difficult to find anywhere in the world similar examples of opportunism, or even worse\u2014renunciation of the Party, and a desire to liquidate it.\n\nA single example will suffice to show what Semkovsky\u2019s arguments are like:\n\n\u201cWhat are we to do,\u201d he writes, \u201cif the Polish proletariat wants to fight side by side with the proletariat of all Russia within the framework of a single state, while the reactionary classes of Polish society, on the contrary, want to separate Poland from Russia and obtain a majority of votes in favour of secession by referendum? Should we, Russian Social-Democrats in the central parliament, vote together with our Polish comrades against secession, or\u2014in order not to violate the \u2018right to self-determination\u2019\u2014vote for secession?\u201d (Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. .)\n\nFrom this it is evident that Mr. Semkovsky does not even understand the point at issue! It did not occur to him that the right to secession presupposes the settlement of the question by a parliament (Diet, referendum, etc.) of the seceding region, not by a central parliament.\n\nThe childish perplexity over the question \u201cWhat are we to do\u201d, if under democracy the majority are for reaction, serves to screen the real and live issue when both the Purishkeviches and the Kokoshkins consider the very idea of secession criminal! Perhaps the proletarians of all Russia ought not to fight the Purishkeviches and the Kokoshkins today, but should by-pass them and fight the reactionary classes of Poland!\n\nSuch is the sheer rubbish published in the liquidators\u2019 organ of which Mr. L. Martov is one of the ideological leaders, the selfsame L. Martov who drafted the programme and spoke in favour of its adoption in , and even subsequently wrote in favour of the right to secede. Apparently L. Martov is now arguing according to the rule:\n\nNo clever man is needed there;\nBetter send Read,\nAnd I shall wait and see.[]\n\nHe sends Read-Semkovsky along and allows our programme to be distorted, and endlessly muddled up in a daily paper whose new readers are unacquainted with it!\n\nYes. Liquidationism has gone a long way\u2014there are even very many prominent ex-Social-Democrats who have not a trace of Party spirit left in them.\n\nRosa Luxemburg cannot, of course, be classed with the Liebmans, Yurkeviches and Semkovskys, but the fact that it was this kind of people who seized upon her error shows with particular clarity the opportunism she has lapsed into.\n\n. CONCLUSION\nTo sum up.\n\nAs far as the theory of Marxism in general is concerned, the question of the right to self-determination presents no difficulty. No one can seriously question the London resolution of , or the fact that self-determination implies only the right to secede, or that the formation of independent national states is the tendency in all bourgeois-democratic revolutions.\n\nA difficulty is to some extent created by the fact that in Russia the proletariat of both the oppressed and oppressor nations are fighting, and must fight, side by side. The task is to preserve the unity of the proletariat\u2019s class struggle for socialism, and to resist all bourgeois and Black-Hundred nationalist influences. Where the oppressed nations are concerned, the separate organisation of the proletariat as an independent party sometimes leads to such a bitter struggle against local nationalism that the perspective becomes distorted and the nationalism of the oppressor nation is lost sight of.\n\nBut this distortion of perspective cannot last long. The experience of the joint struggle waged by the proletarians of various nations has demonstrated all too clearly that we must formulate political issues from the all-Russia, not the \u201cCracow\u201d point of view. And in all-Russia politics it is the Purishkeviches and the Kokoshkins who are in the saddle. Their ideas predominate, and their persecution of non-Russians for \u201cseparatism\u201d, for thinking about secession, is being preached, and practised in the Duma, in the schools, in the churches, in the barracks, and in hundreds and thousands of newspapers. It is this Great-Russian nationalist poison that is polluting the entire all-Russia political atmosphere. This is the misfortune of one nation, which, by subjugating other nations, is strengthening reaction throughout Russia. The memories of  and  form a living political tradition, which, unless great storms arise, threatens to hamper every democratic and especially every Social-Democratic movement for decades to come.\n\nThere can be no doubt that however natural the point of view of certain Marxists belonging to the oppressed nations (whose \u201cmisfortune\u201d is sometimes that the masses of the population are blinded by the idea of their \u201cown\u201d national liberation) may appear at times, in reality the objective alignment of class forces in Russia snakes refusal to advocate the right to self-determination tantamount to the worst opportunism, to the infection of the proletariat with the ideas of the Kokoshkins. And these ideas are, essentially, the ideas and the policy of the Purishkeviches.\n\nTherefore, although Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s point of view could at first have been excused as being specifically Polish, \u201cCracow\u201d narrow-mindedness,[] it is inexcusable today, when nationalism and, above all, governmental Great-Russian nationalism, has everywhere gained ground, and when policy is being shaped by this Great-Russian nationalism. In actual fact; it is being seized upon by the opportunists of all nations, who fight shy of the idea of \u201cstorms\u201d and \u201cleaps\u201d, believe that the bourgeois-democratic revolution is over, and follow in the wake of the liberalism of the Kokoshkins.\n\nLike any other nationalism, Great-Russian nationalism passes through various phases, according to the classes that are dominant in the bourgeois country at any given time. Up to , we almost exclusively knew national-reactionaries. After the revolution, national-liberals arose in our country.\n\nIn our country this is virtually the stand adopted both by the Octobrists and by the Cadets (Kokoshkin), i.e., by the whole of the present-day bourgeoisie.\n\nGreat-Russian national-democrats will inevitably appear later on. Mr. Peshekhonov, one of the founders of the \u201cPopular Socialist\u201d Party, already expressed this point of view (in the issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo for August ) when he called for caution in regard to the peasants\u2019 nationalist prejudices. However much others may slander us Bolsheviks and accuse us of \u201cidealising\u201d the peasant, we always have made and always will make a clear distinction between peasant intelligence and peasant prejudice, between peasant strivings for democracy and opposition to Purishkevich, and the peasant desire to make peace with the priest and the landlord.\n\nEven now, and probably for a fairly long time to come, proletarian democracy must reckon with the nationalism of the Great-Russian peasants (not with the object of making concessions to it, but in order to combat it).[] The awakening of nationalism among the oppressed nations, which be came so pronounced after  (let us recall, say, the group of \u201cFederalist-Autonomists\u201d in the First Duma, the growth of the Ukrainian movement, of the Moslem movement, etc.), will inevitably lead to greater nationalism among the Great-Russian petty bourgeoisie in town and countryside. The slower the democratisation of Russia, the more persistent, brutal and bitter will be the national persecution and bickering among the bourgeoisie of the various nations. The particularly reactionary nature of the Russian Purishkeviches will simultaneously give rise to (and strengthen) \u201cseparatist\u201d tendencies among the various oppressed nationalities, which sometimes enjoy far greater freedom in neighbouring states.\n\nIn this situation, the proletariat, of Russia is faced with a twofold or, rather, a two-sided task: to combat nationalism of every kind, above all, Great-Russian nationalism; to recognise, not only fully equal rights, for all nations in general, but also equality of rights as regards polity, i.e., the right of nations to self-determination, to secession. And at the same time, it is their task, in the interests of a successful struggle against all and every kind, of nationalism among all nations, to preserve the unity of the proletarian struggle and the proletarian organisations, amalgamating these organisations into a close-knit international association, despite bourgeois strivings for national exclusiveness.\n\nComplete equality of rights for all nations; the right of nations to self-determination; the unity of the workers of all nations\u2014such is the national programme that Marxism, the experience of the whole world, and the experience of Russia, teach the workers.\n\nThis article had been set up when I received No.  of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, in which Mr. Vl. Kosovsky writes the following about the recognition of the right of all nations to self-determination:\n\n\u201cTaken mechanically from the resolution of the First Congress of the Party (), which in turn had borrowed it from the decisions of international socialist congresses, it was given, as is evident from the debate, the same meaning at the  Congress as was ascribed to it by the Socialist International, i.e., political self-determination, the self-determination of nations in the field of political independence. Thus the formula: national self-determination, which implies the right to territorial separation, does not in any way affect the question of how national relations within a given state organism should be regulated for nationalities that cannot or have no desire to leave the existing state.\u201d\n\nIt is evident from this that Mr. Vl. Kosovsky has teen the Minutes of the Second Congress of  and understands perfectly well the real (and only) meaning of the term self-determination. Compare this with the fact that the editors of the Bund newspaper Zeit let Mr. Liebman loose to scoff at the programme and to declare that it is vague! Queer \u201cparty\u201d ethics among these Bundists.... The Lord alone knows why Kosovsky should declare that the Congress took over the principle of self-determination mechanically. Some people want to \u201cobject\u201d, but how, why, and for what reason\u2014they do not know. This question is usually answered quite simply: there is no counter-revolution at all or we do not know where it is. But we know full well where power is. It is in the hands of the Provisional Government, which is controlled by the Central Executive Committee (C.E.C.) of the All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Soldiers\u2019 and Workers\u2019 Deputies. This is the usual answer.\n\nYesterday\u2019s political crisis,[] like most types of crises, which tear down everything conventional and shatter all illusions, left in its wake the ruins of the illusions expressed in the usual answers\u2014cited above\u2014to the basic questions of any revolution.\n\nThere is a former member of the Second Duma, Alexinsky, whom the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, the ruling parties in the Soviets of Workers\u2019, Soldiers\u2019 and Peas ants\u2019 Deputies, refused to admit on to the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies until he rehabilitated himself, i.e., until he redeemed his honour.[]\n\nWhat was the trouble? Why did the Executive Committee publicly and formally deny Alexinsky its confidence, demanding that he redeem his honour, i.e., declaring him dishonest?\n\nIt was because Alexinsky had made himself so notorious by libellous statements that he had been branded a slanderer in Paris by journalists of the most diverse parties. Alexinsky did not bother to redeem his honour before the Executive Committee. He preferred to hide himself in Plekhanov\u2019s newspaper Yedinstvo, appearing first under initials, and then, after he had plucked up courage, under his full name.\n\nOn July , yesterday afternoon, a few Bolsheviks were warned by friends that Alexinsky had laid before the Petrograd journalists\u2019 committee some new malicious libel. Most of those who received the warning ignored it completely, treating Alexinsky and his \u201cwork\u201d with disdainful contempt. But one Bolshevik, Jugashvili (Stalin), a member of the Central Executive Committee, who as a Georgian Social-Democrat had known Comrade Chkheidze for a long time, spoke to the latter at a meeting of the C.E.C. about Alexinsky\u2019s new infamous slander campaign.\n\nThis happened late at night, but Chkheidze declared that the C.E.C. could not be indifferent to the spreading of libel by people who are afraid of open court and an investigation by the C.E.C. In his own name, as Chairman of the C.E.C., and in the name of Tsereteli, a member of the Provisional Government, Chkheidze immediately telephoned all newspaper offices, suggesting that they retrain from publishing Alexinsky\u2019s libel. Chkheidze told Stalin that most papers had expressed readiness to comply with his request, and that only Yedinstvo and Rech had \u201ckept silent\u201d for a time (we have not seen Yedinstvo, but Rech has not printed the libel). As a result, the libel appeared only on the pages of a petty, yellow, and to most intelligent people completely unknown paper, Zhivoye Slovo[] No.  (), whose editor and publisher signs himself A. M. Umansky.\n\nThe slanderers will now answer before the court. In this respect things are quite simple.\n\nThe absurdity of the libel is striking: a certain ensign of the Sixteenth Siberian Rifle Regiment by the name of Yermolenko was \u201cdispatched\u201d (?) \u201con April  to us behind the front lines of the Sixth Army to agitate for the speediest conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Germany\u201d. Apparently, he is the escaped prisoner of whom the \u201cdocument\u201d published in Zhivoye Slovo says: \u201cThis commission was accepted by. Yermolenko on the insistence of the comrades\u201d!!\n\nFrom this alone you can judge how little faith can be put in an individual who is dishonourable enough to accept such a \u201ccommission\u201d!... The witness has no sense of honour. This is a fact.\n\nAnd what was the witness\u2019s testimony?\n\nHe testified the following: \u201cOfficers of the German General Staff, Schiditzki and L\u00fcbers, had told him that propaganda of a similar kind was being carried on in Russia by A. Skoropis-Yoltukhovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian section of the Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine,[] and an agent of the German General Staff, and by Lenin. Lenin was commissioned to do all he could to undermine the confidence of the Russian people in the Provisional Government.\u201d\n\nThus the German officers, in order to induce Yermolenko to commit this dishonourable act, shamelessly lied to him about Lenin who, as everybody knows and as is officially stated by the entire Bolshevik Party, has always rejected most emphatically, consistently, and unconditionally a separate peace treaty with Germany!! The lie of the German officers is so obvious, crude and preposterous that no literate person would even for a moment take it for anything but a lie. And a politically literate person would be even more certain that to associate Lenin with an individual like Yoltukhovsky (?) and with the Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine is particularly preposterous, for both Lenin and all other internationalists have repeatedly dissociated themselves publicly from this dubious social-patriotic \u201cUnion\u201d during the war!\n\nThe crude lie told by Yermolenko, whom the Germans had bribed, or by German officers, would not deserve the slightest attention, were it not that the \u201cdocument\u201d has added what it calls \u201cfresh information\u201d\u2014it is not known by whom, from whom, how, or when received\u2014according to which \u201cmoney for propaganda is being received\u201d (by whom? the \u201cdocument\u201d is afraid to say plainly that the accused or suspected is Lenin!! The document says nothing about who \u201cis receiving it\u201d) \u201cthrough trusted people\u201d: the \u201cBolsheviks\u201d F\u00fcrstenberg (Hanecki) and Kozlovsky. It is alleged that there is information proving the transfer of money through banks, and that \u201cthe military censorship has discovered a continuous (!) exchange of telegrams of a political and financial nature between German agents and Bolshevik leaders\u201d!!\n\nAgain such a crude lie that it sticks out like a sore thumb. If there were even a word of truth in that, then how could it happen () that Hanecki had quite recently been allowed freely to enter Russia and permitted to leave her just as   freely? () that neither Hanecki nor Kozlovsky had been arrested before the appearance in the press of information concerning their crimes? Is it really possible that the General Staff, had it actually been in possession of even remotely trustworthy information about the sending of money, telegrams, etc., would have permitted the publication of rumours about this, through the Alexinskys and the yellow press, without arresting Hanecki and Kozlovsky? Isn\u2019t it clear this is nothing but the cheap work of newspaper slanderers of the lowest order?\n\nWe may add that Hanecki and Kozlovsky are not Bolsheviks, but members of the Polish Social-Democratic Party; that we have known Hanecki, a member of its Central Committee, since the  London Congress from which the Polish delegates withdrew, and so on. The Bolsheviks never received any money from either Hanecki or Kozlovsky. All that is a lie, a complete, vulgar lie.\n\nWhat is its political significance? First, it indicates that the Bolsheviks\u2019 political opponents are so low and contemptible that they cannot get along without lies and libel.\n\nSecondly, it provides us with an answer to the title question of this article.\n\nThe report about the \u201cdocuments\u201d was sent to Kerensky as early as May . Kerensky is a member of the Provisional Government and the Soviet, i.e., of both \u201cpowers\u201d. May to July  is a long time. The power, if it really were a power, could and should itself have investigated those \u201cdocuments\u201d, interrogated the witnesses, and arrested the suspects. The power, both \u201cpowers\u201d\u2014the Provisional Government and the C.E.C.\u2014could and should have done this.\n\nYet both powers are inactive, while the General Staff is found to have some sort of relations with Alexinsky, who was not admitted to the Soviet\u2019s Executive Committee owing to his libellous activities! The General Staff, at the very moment of the Cadets\u2019 withdrawal, permits\u2014probably by accident\u2014the handing over of its official documents to Alexinsky for publication!\n\nThe power is inactive. Neither Kerensky, nor the Provisional Government, nor the C.E.C. so much as think of arresting Lenin, Hanecki, or Kozlovsky, if they are under suspicion. Last night, July , both Chkheidze and Tsereteli   asked the newspapers not to print the obvious libel. But just a little later, late at night, Polovtsev sent military cadets and Cossacks to wreck Pravda\u2019s offices, stop the paper\u2019s publication, arrest its publishers, seize its ledgers (on the pretext of investigating whether or not suspicious funds were involved). At the same time that yellow, base, filthy little rag, Zhivoye Slovo, printed foul libel to arouse passions, revile the Bolsheviks, create an atmosphere of mob violence, and afford a plausible justification for the behaviour of Polovtsev, the military cadets and the Cossacks who had wrecked Pravda\u2019s offices.\n\nWhoever does not close his eyes to the truth cannot remain deluded. When it is necessary to act, both powers remain inactive\u2014the C.E.C., because it \u201ctrusts\u201d the Cadets and is afraid of irritating them, and the Cadets, who do not act as a power because they prefer to act behind the scenes.\n\nCounter-revolution behind the scenes\u2014this is it, as clear as day: the Cadets, certain quarters of the General Staff (\"high-ranking officers\u201d, as our Party\u2019s resolution calls them), and the shady, semi-Black Hundred press. These are not inactive, these \u201cwork\u201d together hand in glove; this is the soil in which pogroms, attempted pogroms, the shooting of demonstrators, etc., etc., are nurtured.\n\nWhoever does not deliberately shut his eyes to the truth cannot remain deluded any longer.\n\nThere is no power, and there will be none until the transfer of power to the Soviets lays the foundation for creating power. Counter-revolution thrives on the absence of authority by uniting the Cadets with certain high-ranking officers and with the Black Hundred press. This is a sad reality, but a reality nevertheless.\n\nWorkers and soldiers! You must show firmness, determination and vigilance! The more violent the slander and lies against the Bolsheviks these days, the more calmly must we, while refuting the lies and slander, reflect upon the historical interrelation of events and the political, i.e., class, significance of the revolution\u2019s present course.\n\nTo refute the lies and slander, we only have to refer again to Listok \u201cPravdy\u201d of July , and to call the reader\u2019s attention especially to the article printed below which gives documentary evidence that on July  the Bolsheviks campaigned against the demonstration (as admitted by the Socialist-Revolutionaries\u2019 paper). The article indicates that on July  the popular mood exploded into action and the demonstration started against our advice. It shows that on July , in a leaflet (reprinted by the Socialist-Revolutionary paper Dyelo Naroda), we called for a peaceful and organised demonstration, that on the night of July  we passed a decision to call off the demonstration. Slanderers, continue your slander! You can never refute these facts and their decisive significance in every connection!\n\nLet us turn to the question of the historical interrelation of the events. When, as early as the beginning of April, we opposed support for the Provisional Government, we were attacked by both the S.R.s and the Mensheviks. But what has reality proved?\n\nWhat have the three political crises proved \u2014 April  and , June  and , July  and ?\n\nThey have proved, in the first place, that the masses are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the bourgeois policy of the Provisional Government\u2019s bourgeois majority.\n\nIt is rather interesting to note that the ruling Socialist-Revolutionaries\u2019 newspaper, Dyelo Naroda, despite its marked hostility to the Bolsheviks, is compelled to admit, in its July  issue, the deep economic and political causes of the action of July  and . The stupid, crude, infamous lie that this action was artificially created, that the Bolsheviks campaigned in favour of action, will daily be more and more exposed.\n\nThe common cause, the common origin, the deep common root of the three above-mentioned political crises is clear, especially if we look at them in their interrelation, as science demands that politics be looked at. It is absurd even to think that three such crises could be produced artificially.\n\nIn the second place, it is instructive to grasp what each one of them had in common with the others, and what was its specific features.\n\nWhat is common to all three is a mass dissatisfaction overflowing all bounds, a mass resentment with the bourgeoisie and their government. Whoever forgets, ignores or underestimates this essence of the matter, renounces the ABC of socialism concerning the class struggle.\n\nLet those who call themselves socialists, who know something about the character of the class struggle in European revolutions, think about the class struggle in the Russian revolution.\n\nThese crises are peculiar in the ways they manifested themselves. The first (April \u2013) was stormy and spontaneous, and completely unorganised. It led to Black Hundreds firing on the demonstrators and to unprecedentedly savage and lying accusations against the Bolsheviks. After the outburst came a political crisis.\n\nIn the second case, the demonstration was called by the Bolsheviks, and was canceled after a stern ultimatum and direct ban by the Congress of Soviets; then, on June , came a general demonstration in which the Bolshevik slogans clearly predominated. As the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks themselves admitted on the evening of June , a political crisis would certainly have broken out had it not been for the offensive at the front.\n\nThe third crisis broke out spontaneously on July  despite the Bolsheviks\u2019 efforts on July  to check it. Reaching its   climax on July , it led to a furious outburst of counter-revolution on July  and . The vacillation of the S.R.s and Mensheviks expressed itself in Spiridonova and a number of other S.R.s declaring for the transfer of power to the Soviets, and in the Menshevik internationalists, previously opposed to it, voicing the same idea.\n\nThe last, and perhaps the most instructive, conclusion to be drawn from considering the events in their interconnection is that all three crises manifested some form of demonstration that is new in the history of our revolution, a demonstration of a more complicated type in which the movement proceeds in waves, a sudden drop following a rapid rise, revolution and counter-revolution becoming more acute, and the middle elements being eliminated for a more or less extensive period.\n\nIn all three crises, the movement took the form of a demonstration. An anti-government demonstration \u2014 that would be the most exact, formal description of events. But the fact of the matter is that it was not an ordinary demonstration; it was something considerably more than a demonstration, but less than a revolution. It was an outburst of revolution and counter-revolution together, a sharp, sometimes almost sudden elimination of the middle elements, while the proletarian and bourgeois elements made a stormy appearance.\n\nIn this respect it is extremely typical that, for each of these movements, the middle elements blame both of the specific class forces \u2014 the proletariat as well as the bourgeoisie. Look at the S.R.s and Mensheviks. They lean over backwards to frantically shout that, by their extremes, the Bolsheviks are helping the counter-revolution. At the same time, however, they admit again and again that the Cadets (with whom they form a bloc in the government) are counter-revolutionary. \"Our urgent task is to draw a line,\" wrote Dyelo Naroda yesterday, \"to dig a deep moat between ourselves and all the Right elements, including Yedinstvo, which has gone militant\" (with which, we may add, the S.R.s formed a bloc during the elections).\n\nCompare that with today\u2019s (July ) issue of Yedinstvo, in which Plekhanov\u2019s editorial is compelled to state the indisputable fact that the Soviets (i.e., the S.R.s and   Mensheviks) will \"think over the matter for a fortnight\" and that, if power were to pass to the Soviets, \"it would be tantamount to victory for Lenin\u2019s supporters\". \"If the Cadets don\u2019t stick to the rule\u2014the worse, the better...,\" says Plekhanov, \"they themselves will have to admit that they have made a big mistake [by withdrawing from the Cabinet], making the work of Lenin\u2019s supporters easier.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t that typical? The middle elements blame the Cadets for making the Bolsheviks\u2019 work easier, and the Bolsheviks for making the Cadets\u2019 work easier! Is it so hard to guess that if we substitute class names for political ones we have before us the dreams of the petty bourgeoisie about the disappearance of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie? Isn\u2019t the petty bourgeoisie complaining about the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie? Is it really so hard to guess that no Bolsheviks in the world could have \u201ccreated\u201d even a single \"popular movement\", let alone three movements, if the deepest economic and political causes had not set the proletariat into action? Is it so difficult to guess that no Cadets and monarchists combined could have called forth any movement \"from the Right\" if it had not been for the equally deep causes that make the bourgeoisie as a class counter-revolutionary?\n\nBoth we and the Cadets were blamed for the April - movement \u2014 for intransigence, extremes, and for aggravating the situation. The Bolsheviks were even accused (absurd as it may be) of the firing on Nevsky. When the movement was over, however, those same S.R.s and Mensheviks, in their joint, official organ, Izvestia, wrote that the \"popular movement\" had \"swept away the imperialists, Milyukov, etc.\", i.e., they praised the movement!! Isn\u2019t that typical? Doesn\u2019t it show very clearly that the petty bourgeoisie do not understand the workings, the meaning, of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie?\n\nThe objective situation is this. The vast majority of the country\u2019s population is petty-bourgeois by its living conditions and more so by its ideas. But big capital rules the country, primarily through banks and syndicates. There is an urban proletariat in this country, mature enough to go its own way, but not yet able to draw at once the majority of the semi-proletarians to its side. From this fundamental,   class fact follows the inevitability of such crises as the three we are now examining, as well as their forms.\n\nIn future the forms of crises may, of course, change, but the substance of the issue will remain the same even if, for instance, the S.R. Constituent Assembly meets in October. The S.R.s have promised the peasants: () to abolish private landownership; () to transfer the land to the working people; () to confiscate the landed estates and transfer them to the peasants without compensation. These great reforms can never be realised without the most decisive revolutionary measures against the bourgeoisie, measures that can only be taken when the poor peasants join the proletariat, only when the banks and the syndicates are nationalised.\n\nThe credulous peasants, believing for a time that these beautiful things can be achieved by compromising with the bourgeoisie, will inevitably be disappointed and . . . \u201cdissatisfied\u201d (mildly speaking) with the sharp class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie for the implementation of the promises of the S.R.s. So it was, and so it will be. I. CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCTION AND MONOPOLIES\nThe enormous growth of industry and the remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism. Modern production censuses give most complete and most exact data on this process.\n\nIn Germany, for example, out of every , industrial enterprises, large enterprises, i.e., those employing more than  workers, numbered three in , six in  and nine in ; and out of every  workers employed, this group of enterprises employed. ,  and , respectively. Concentration of production, however, is much more intense than the concentration of workers, since labour in the large enterprises is much more productive. This is shown by the figures on steam-engines and electric motors. If we take what in Germany is called industry in the broad sense of the term, that is, including commerce, transport, etc., we get the following picture. Large-scale enterprises, , out of a total of ,,, that is to say, . per cent. These enterprises employ ,, workers out of a total of ,,, i.e., . per cent; they use ,, steam horse power out of a total of ,,, i.e., . per cent, and ,, kilowatts of electricity out of a total of ,,, i.e., . per cent.\n\nLess than one-hundredth of the total number of enterprises utilise more than three-fourths of the total amount of steam and electric power! Two million nine hundred and seventy thousand small enterprises (employing up to five workers), constituting  per cent of the total, utilise only  per cent of the total amount of steam and electric power! Tens of thousands of huge enterprises are everything; millions of small ones are nothing.\n\nIn , there were in Germany  establishments employing one thousand and more workers, nearly one-tenth (,,) of the total number of workers employed in industry, and they consumed almost one-third ( per cent) of the total amount of steam and electric power.[] As we shall see, money capital and the banks make this superiority of a handful of the largest enterprises still more overwhelming, in the most literal sense of the word, i.e., millions of small, medium and even some big \u201cproprietors\u201d are in fact in complete subjection to some hundreds of millionaire financiers.\n\nIn another advanced country of modern capitalism, the United States of America, the growth of the concentration of production is still greater. Here statistics single out industry in the narrow sense of the word and classify enterprises according to the value of their annual output. In  large-scale enterprises with an output valued at one million dollars and over, numbered , (out of ,, i.e., . per cent). These employed ,, workers (out of ,,, i.e., . per cent) and the value of their output amounted to $,,, (out of $,,,, i.e.,  per cent). Five years later, in , the corresponding figures were: , enterprises (out of ,, i.e., . per cent) employing ,, workers (out of ,,, i.e., . per cent) with an output valued at $,,, (out of $,,,, i.e., . per cent). []\n\nAlmost half the total production of all the enterprises of the country was carried on by one-hundredth part of these enterprises! These , giant enterprises embrace  branches of industry. From this it can be seen that at a certain stage of its development concentration itself, as it were, leads straight to monopoly, for a score or so of giant enterprises can easily arrive at an agreement, and on the other hand, the hindrance to competition, the tendency towards monopoly, arises from the huge size of the enterprises. This transformation of competition into monopoly is one of the most important\u2014if not the most important\u2014phenomena of modern capitalist economy, and we must deal with it in greater detail. But first we must clear up one possible misunderstanding.\n\nAmerican statistics speak of , giant enterprises in  branches of industry, as if there were only a dozen enterprises of the largest scale for each branch of industry.\n\nBut this is not the case. Not in every branch of industry are there large-scale enterprises; and moreover, a very important feature of capitalism in its highest stage of development is so-called combination of production, that is to say, the grouping in a single enterprise of different branches of industry, which either represent the consecutive stages in the processing of raw materials (for example, the smelting of iron ore into pig-iron, the conversion of pig-iron into steel, and then, perhaps, the manufacture of steel goods)\u2014or are auxiliary to one another (for example, the utilisation of scrap, or of by-products, the manufacture of packing materials, etc.).\n\n\u201cCombination,\u201d writes Hilferding, \u201clevels out the fluctuations of trade and therefore assures to the combined enterprises a more stable rate of profit. Secondly, combination has the effect of eliminating trade. Thirdly, it has the effect of rendering possible technical improvements, and, consequently, the acquisition of superprofits over and above those obtained by the \u2018pure\u2019 (i.e,, non-combined) enterprises. Fourthly, it strengthens the position of the combined enterprises relative to the \u2018pure\u2019 enterprises, strengthens them in the competitive struggle in periods of serious depression, when the fall in prices of raw materials does not keep pace with the fall in prices of manufactured goods.\u201d[]\n\nThe German bourgeois economist, Heymann, who has written a book especially on \u201cmixed\u201d, that is, combined, enterprises in the German iron industry, says: \u201cPure enterprises perish, they are crushed between the high price of raw material and the low price of the finished product.\u201d Thus we get the following picture: \u201cThere remain, on the one hand, the big coal companies, producing millions of tons yearly, strongly organised in their coal syndicate, and on the other, the big steel plants, closely allied to the coal mines, having their own steel syndicate. These giant enterprises, producing , tons of steel per annum, with a tremendous output of ore and coal and producing finished steel goods, employing , workers quartered in company houses, and sometimes owning their own railways and ports, are the typical representatives of the German iron and steel industry. And concentration goes on further and further. Individual enterprises are becoming larger and larger. An ever-increasing number of enterprises in one, or in several different industries, join together in giant enterprises, backed up and directed by half a dozen big Berlin banks. In relation to the German mining industry, the truth of the teachings of Karl Marx on concentration is definitely proved; true, this applies to a country where industry is protected by tariffs and freight rates. The German mining industry is ripe for expropriation.\u201d[]\n\nSuch is the conclusion which a bourgeois economist who, by way of exception, is conscientious, had to arrive at. It must be noted that he seems to place Germany in a special category because her industries are protected by higher tariffs. But this is a circumstance which only accelerates concentration and the formation of monopolist manufacturers\u2019 associations, cartels, syndicates, etc. It is extremely important to note that in free-trade Britain, concentration also leads to monopoly, although somewhat later and perhaps in another form. Professor Hermann Levy, in his special work of research entitled Monopolies, Cartels and Trusts, based on data on British economic development, writes as follows:\n\n\u201cIn Great Britain it is the size of the enterprise and its high technical level which harbour a monopolist tendency. This, for one thing, is due to the great investment of capital per enterprise, which gives rise to increasing demands for new capital for the new enterprises and thereby renders their launching more difficult. Moreover (and this seems to us to be the more important point), every new enterprise that wants to keep pace with the gigantic enterprises that have been formed by concentration would here produce such an enormous quantity of surplus goods that it could dispose of them only by being able to sell them profitably as a result of an enormous increase in demand; otherwise, this surplus would force prices down to a level that would be unprofitable both for the new enterprise and for the monopoly combines.\u201d Britain differs from other countries where protective tariffs facilitate the formation of cartels in that monopolist manufacturers\u2019 associations, cartels and trusts arise in the majority of cases only when the number of the chief competing enterprises has been reduced to \u201ca couple of dozen or so\u201d. \u201cHere the influence of concentration on the formation of large industrial monopolies in a whole sphere of industry stands out with crystal clarity.\u201d[]\n\nHalf a century ago, when Marx was writing Capital, free competition appeared to the overwhelming majority of economists to be a \u201cnatural law\u201d. Official science tried, by a conspiracy of silence, to kill the works of Marx, who by a theoretical and historical analysis of capitalism had proved that free competition gives rise to the concentration of production, which, in turn, at a certain stage of development, leads to monopoly. Today, monopoly has become a fact. Economists are writing mountains of books in which they describe the diverse manifestations of monopoly, and continue to declare in chorus that \u201cMarxism is refuted\u201d. But facts are stubborn things, as the English proverb says, and they have to be reckoned with, whether we like it or not. The facts show that differences between capitalist countries, e.g., in the matter of protection or free trade, only give rise to insignificant variations in the form of monopolies or in the moment of their appearance; and that the rise of monopolies, as the result of the concentration of production, is a general and fundamental law of the present stage of development of capitalism.\n\nFor Europe, the time when the new capitalism definitely superseded the old can be established with fair precision; it was the beginning of the twentieth century. In one of the latest compilations on the history of the \u201cformation of monopolies\u201d, we read:\n\n\u201cIsolated examples of capitalist monopoly could be cited from the period preceding ; in these could be discerned the embryo of the forms that are so common today; but all this undoubtedly represents the prehistory of the cartels. The real beginning of modern monopoly goes back, at the earliest, to the sixties. The first important period of development of monopoly commenced with the international industrial depression of the seventies and lasted until the beginning of the nineties.\u201d \u201cIf we examine the question on a European scale, we will find that the development of free competition reached its apex in the sixties and seventies. It was then that Britain completed the construction of her old-style capitalist organisation. In Germany, this organisation had entered into a fierce struggle with handicraft and domestic industry, and had begun to create for itself its own forms of existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great revolution commenced with the crash of , or rather, the depression which followed it and which, with hardly discernible interruptions in the early eighties, and the unusually violent, but short-lived boom round about , marks twenty-two years of European economic history ... .. During the short boom of -, the system of cartels was widely resorted to in order to take advantage of favourable business conditions. An ill-considered policy drove prices up still more rapidly and still higher than would have been the case if there had been no cartels. and nearly all these cartels perished ingloriously in the smash. Another five-year period of bad trade and low prices followed, but a new spirit reigned in industry; the depression was no longer regarded as something to be taken for granted: it was regarded as nothing more than a pause before another boom.\n\n\u201cThe cartel movement entered its second epoch: instead of being a transitory phenomenon, the cartels have become one of the foundations of economic life. They are winning one field of industry after another, primarily, the raw materials industry. At the beginning of the nineties the cartel system had already acquired-in the organisation of the coke syndicate on the model of which the coal syndicate was later formed\u2014a cartel technique which has hardly been improved on. For the first time the great boom at the close of the nineteenth century and the crisis of - occurred entirely\u2014in the mining and iron industries at least\u2014under the aegis of the cartels. And while at that time it appeared to be something novel, now the general public takes it for granted that large spheres of economic life have been, as a general rule, removed from the realm of free competition.\u201d[]\n\nThus, the principal stages in the history of monopolies are the following: () -, the highest stage, the apex of development of free competition; monopoly is in the barely discernible, embryonic stage. () After the crisis of , a lengthy period of development of cartels; but they are still the exception. They are not yet durable. They are still a transitory phenomenon. () The boom at the end of the nineteenth century and the crisis of -. Cartels become one of the foundations of the whole of economic life. Capitalism has been transformed into imperialism.\n\nCartels come to an agreement on the terms of sale, dates of payment, etc. They divide the markets among themselves. They fix the quantity of goods to be produced. They fix prices. They divide the profits among the various enterprises, etc.\n\nThe number of cartels in Germany was estimated at about  in  and at  in , with about , firms participating.[] But it is generally recognised that these figures are underestimations. From the statistics of German industry for  we quoted above, it is evident that even these , very big enterprises probably consume more than half the steam and electric power used in the country. In the United States of America, the number of trusts in  was estimated at  and in , . American statistics divide all industrial enterprises into those belonging to individuals, to private firms or to corporations. The latter in  comprised . per cent, and in , . per cent, i.e., more than one-fourth of the total industrial enterprises in the country. These employed in , . per cent, and in , . per cent, i.e., more than three-fourths of the total wage-earners. Their output at these two dates was valued at $,,, and $,,,, i.e., . per cent and . per cent of the total, respectively.\n\nAt times cartels and trusts concentrate in their hands seven- or eight-tenths of the total output of a given branch of industry. The Rhine-Westphalian Coal Syndicate, at its foundation in , concentrated . per cent of the total coal output of the area, and in  it already concentrated . per cent.[] The monopoly so created assures enormous profits, and leads to the formation of technical production units of formidable magnitude. The famous Standard Oil Company in the United States was founded in : \u201cIt has an authorised capital of $,,. It issued $,, common and $,, preferred stock. From  to  the following dividends were paid on the latter: , , , , , , ,  per cent in the respective years, i.e., in all, $,,. From  to , out of total net profits amounting to $,,, $,, were distributed in dividends, and the rest went to reserve capital.[] \u201cIn  the various works of the United States Steel Corporation employed no less than , people. The largest enterprise in the German mining industry, Gelsenkirchener Bergwerksgesellschaft, in  had a staff of , workers and office employees.\u201d[] In , the United States Steel Corporation already produced ,, tons of steel.[] Its output constituted in , . per cent, and in , . per cent of the total output of steel in the United States.[] The output of ore was . per cent and . per cent, respectively.\n\nThe report of the American Government Commission on Trusts states: \u201cTheir superiority over competitors is due to the magnitude of their enterprises and their excellent technical equipment. Since its inception, the Tobacco Trust has devoted all its efforts to the universal substitution of mechanical for manual labour. With this end in view it has bought up all patents that have anything to do with the manufacture of tobacco and has spent enormous sums for this purpose. Many of these patents at first proved to be of no use, and had to be modified by the engineers employed by the trust. At the end of , two subsidiary companies were formed solely to acquire patents. With the same object in view, the trust has built its own foundries, machine shops and repair shops. One of these establishments, that in Brooklyn, employs on the average  workers; here experiments are carried out on inventions concerning the manufacture of cigarettes, cheroots, snuff, tinfoil for packing, boxes, etc. Here, also, inventions are perfected.\u201d[] \u201cOther trusts also employ what are called development engineers whose business it is to devise new methods of production and to test technical improvements. The United States Steel Corporation grants big bonuses to its workers and engineers for all inventions that raise technical efficiency, or reduce cost of production.\u201d[]\n\nIn German large-scale industry, e.g., in the chemical industry, which has developed so enormously during these last few decades, the promotion of technical improvement is organised in the same way. By  the process of concentration of production had already given rise to two main \u201cgroups\u201d which, in their way, were also in the nature of monopolies. At first these groups constituted \u201cdual alliances\u201d of two pairs of big factories, each having a capital of from twenty to twenty-one million marks-on the one hand, the former Meister Factory in Hochst and the Casella Factory in Frankfurt am Main; and on the other hand, the aniline and soda factory at Ludwigshafen and the former Bayer Factory at Elberfeld. Then, in , one of these groups, and in  the other group, each concluded an agreement with yet another big factory. The result was the formation of two \u201ctriple alliances\u201d, each with a capital of from forty to fifty million marks. And these \u201calliances\u201d have already begun to \u201capproach\u201d each other, to reach \u201can understanding\u201d about prices, etc.[]\n\nCompetition becomes transformed into monopoly. The result is immense progress in the socialisation of production. In particular, the process of technical invention and improvement becomes socialised.\n\nThis is something quite different from the old free competition between manufacturers, scattered and out of touch with one another, and producing for an unknown market. Concentration has reached the point at which it is possible to make an approximate estimate of all sources of raw materials (for example, the iron ore deposits) of a country and even, as we shall see, of several countries, or of the whole world. Not only are such estimates made, but these sources are captured by gigantic monopolist associations. An approximate estimate of the capacity of markets is also made, and the associations \u201cdivide\u201d them up amongst themselves by agreement. Skilled labour is monopolised, the best engineers are engaged; the means of transport are captured\u2014railways in America, shipping companies in Europe and America. Capitalism in its imperialist stage leads directly to the most comprehensive socialisation of production; it, so to speak, drags the capitalists, against their will and consciousness, into some sort of a new social order, a transitional one from complete free competition to complete socialisation.\n\nProduction becomes social, but appropriation remains private. The social means of production remain the private property of a few. The general framework of formally recognised free competition remains, and the yoke of a few monopolists on the rest of the population becomes a hundred times heavier, more burdensome and intolerable.\n\nThe German economist, Kestner, has written a book especially devoted to \u201cthe struggle between the cartels and outsiders\u201d, i.e., the capitalists outside the cartels. He entitled his work Compulsory Organisation, although, in order to present capitalism in its true light, he should, of course, have written about compulsory submission to monopolist associations. It is instructive to glance at least at the list of the methods the monopolist associations resort to in the present-day, the latest, the civilised struggle for \u201corganisation\u201d: () stopping supplies of raw materials ... \u201cone of the most important methods of compelling adherence to the cartel\u201d); () stopping the supply of labour by means of \u201calliances\u201d (i.e., of agreements between the capitalists and the trade unions by which the latter permit their members to work only in cartelised enterprises); () stopping deliveries; () closing trade outlets; () agreements with the buyers, by which the latter undertake to trade only with the cartels; () systematic price cutting (to ruin \u201coutside\u201d firms, i.e., those which refuse to submit to the monopolists. Millions are spent in order to sell goods for a certain time below their cost price; there were instances when the price of petrol was thus reduced from  to  marks, i.e., almost by half!); () stopping credits; () boycott.\n\nHere we no longer have competition between small and large, between technically developed and backward enterprises. We see here the monopolists throttling those who do not submit to them, to their yoke, to their dictation. This is how this process is reflected in the mind of a bourgeois economist:\n\n\u201cEven in the purely economic sphere,\u201d writes Kestner, \u201ca certain change is taking place from commercial activity in the old sense of the word towards organisational-speculative activity. The greatest success no longer goes to the merchant whose technical and commercial experience enables him best of all to estimate the needs of the buyer, and who is able to discover and, so to speak, \u2018awaken\u2019 a latent demand; it goes to the speculative genius [?!] who knows how to estimate, or even only to sense in advance, the organisational development and the possibilities of certain connections between individual enterprises and the banks. . . .\u201d\n\nTranslated into ordinary human language this means that the development of capitalism has arrived at a stage when, although commodity production still \u201creigns\u201d and continues to be regarded as the basis of economic life, it has in reality been undermined and the bulk of the profits go to the \u201cgeniuses\u201d of financial manipulation. At the basis of these manipulations and swindles lies socialised production; but the immense progress of mankind, which achieved this socialisation, goes to benefit . . . the speculators. We shall see later how \u201con these grounds\u201d reactionary, petty-bourgeois critics of capitalist imperialism dream of going back to \u201cfree\u201d, \u201cpeaceful\u201d, and \u201chonest\u201d competition.\n\n\u201cThe prolonged raising of prices which results from the formation of cartels,\u201d says Kestner, \u201chas hitherto been observed only in respect of the most important means of production, particularly coal, iron and potassium, but never in respect of manufactured goods. Similarly, the increase in profits resulting from this raising of prices has been limited only to the industries which produce means of production. To this observation we must add that the industries which process raw materials (and not semi-manufactures) not only secure advantages from the cartel formation in the shape of high profits, to the detriment of the finished goods industry, but have also secured a dominating position over the latter, which did not exist under free competition.\u201d[]\n\nThe words which I have italicised reveal the essence of the case which the bourgeois economists admit so reluctantly and so rarely, and which the present-day defenders of opportunism, led by Kautsky, so zealously try to evade and brush aside. Domination, and the violence that is associated with it, such are the relationships that are typical of the \u201clatest phase of capitalist development\u201d; this is what inevitably had to result, and has resulted, from the formation of all-powerful economic monopolies.\n\nI shall give one more example of the methods employed by the cartels. Where it is possible to capture all or the chief sources of raw materials, the rise of cartels and formation of monopolies is particularly easy. It would be wrong, however, to assume that monopolies do not arise in other industries in which it is impossible to corner the sources of raw materials. The cement industry, for instance, can find its raw materials everywhere. Yet in Germany this industry too is strongly cartelised. The cement manufacturers have formed regional syndicates: South German, Rhine-Westplialian, etc. The prices fixed are monopoly prices:  to  marks a car-load, when the cost price is  marks! The enterprises pay a dividend of from  to  per cent\u2014and it must not be forgotten that the \u201cgeniuses\u201d of modern speculation know how to pocket big profits besides what they draw in dividends. In order to prevent competition in such a profitable industry, the monopolists even resort to various stratagems: they spread false rumours about the bad situation in their industry; anonymous warnings are published in the newspapers, like the following: \u201cCapitalists, don\u2019t invest your capital in the cement industry!\u201d; lastly, they buy up \u201coutsiders\u201d (those outside the syndicates) and pay them compensation of ,, , and even , marks.[] Monopoly hews a path for itself everywhere without scruple as to the means, from paying a \u201cmodest\u201d sum to buy off competitors, to the American device of employing dynamite against them.\n\nThe statement that cartels can abolish crises is a fable spread by bourgeois economists who at all costs desire to place capitalism in a favourable light. On the contrary, the monopoly created in certain branches of industry increases and intensifies the anarchy inherent in capitalist production as a whole. The disparity between the development of agriculture and that of industry, which is characteristic of capitalism in general, is increased. The privileged position of the most highly cartelised, so-called heavy industry, especially coal and iron, causes \u201ca still greater lack of co-ordination\u201d in other branches of industry\u2014as Jeidels, the author of one of the best works on \u201cthe relationship of the German big banks to industry\u201d, admits.[]\n\n\u201cThe more developed an economic system is,\u201d writes Liefmann, an unblushing apologist of capitalism, \u201cthe more it resorts to risky enterprises, or enterprises in other countries, to those which need a great deal of time to develop, or finally, to those which are only of local importance.\u201d[] The increased risk is connected in the long run with a prodigious increase of capital, which, as it were, overflows the brim, flows abroad, etc. At the same time the extremely rapid rate of technical progress gives rise to increasing elements of disparity between the various spheres of national economy, to anarchy and crises. Liefmann is obliged to admit that: \u201cIn all probability mankind will see further important technical revolutions in the near future which will also affect the organisation of the economic system\u201d... electricity and aviation.... \u201cAs a general rule, in such periods of radical economic change, speculation develops on a large scale.\u201d...[]\n\nCrises of every kind\u2014economic crises most frequently, but not only these\u2014in their turn increase very considerably the tendency towards concentration and towards monopoly. In this connection, the following reflections of Jeidels on the significance of the crisis of , which, as we have already seen, marked the turning-point in the history of modern monopoly, are exceedingly instructive:\n\n\u201cSide by side with the gigantic plants in the basic industries, the crisis of  still found many plants organised on lines that today would be considered obsolete, the \u2018pure\u2019 (non-combined) plants, which were brought into being at the height of the industrial boom. The fall in prices and the falling off in demand put these \u2018pure\u2019 enterprises in a precarious position, which did not affect the gigantic combined enterprises at all or only affected them for a very short time. As a consequence of this the crisis of  resulted in a far greater concentration of industry than the crisis of : the latter crisis also produced a sort of selection of the best-equipped enterprises, but owing to the level of technical development at that time, this selection could not place the firms which successfully emerged from the crisis in a position of monopoly. Such a durable monopoly exists to a high degree in the gigantic enterprises in the modern iron and steel and electrical industries owing to their very complicated technique, far-reaching organisation and magnitude of capital, and, to a lesser degree, in the engineering industry, certain branches of the metallurgical industry, transport, etc.\u201d[]\n\nMonopoly! This is the last word in the \u201clatest phase of capitalist development\u201d. But we shall only have a very insufficient, incomplete, and poor notion of the real power and the significance of modern monopolies if we do not take into consideration the part played by the banks.\n\nII. BANKS AND THEIR NEW ROLE\nThe principal and primary function of banks is to serve as middlemen in the making of payments. In so doing they transform inactive money capital into active, that is, into capital yielding a profit; they collect all kinds of money revenues and place them at the disposal of the capitalist class.\n\nAs banking develops and becomes concentrated in a small number of establishments, the banks grow from modest middlemen into powerful monopolies having at their command almost the whole of the money capital of all the capitalists and small businessmen and also the larger part of the means of production and sources of raw materials in any one country and in a number of countries. This transformation of numerous modest middlemen into a handful of monopolists is one of the fundamental processes in the growth of capitalism into capitalist imperialism; for this reason we must first of all examine the concentration of banking.\n\nIn -, the combined deposits of the German joint-stock banks, each having a capital of more than a million marks, amounted to , million marks; in -, these deposits already amounted to , million marks, an increase of  per cent in five years; and of the , million increase, , million was divided among  banks, each having a capital of more than  million marks. The distribution of the deposits between big and small banks was as follows:[]\n\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEPOSITS\n \tIn  big Berlin\nbanks\tIn the other \nbanks with a capital\nof more than \nmillion marks\tIn  banks\nwith a capital\nof -\nmillion marks\tIn small banks\n(with a capital\nof less than a\nmillion marks)\n-.....\t\t.\t.\t\n-......\t\t\t\t\nThe small banks are being squeezed out by the big banks, of which only nine concentrate in their hands almost half the total deposits. But we have left out of account many important details, for instance, the transformation of numerous small banks into actual branches of the big banks, etc. Of this I shall speak later on.\n\nAt the end of , Schulze-Gaevernitz estimated the deposits in the nine big Berlin banks at , million marks, out of a total of about , million marks. Taking into account not only the deposits, but the total bank capital, this author wrote: \u201cAt the end of , the nine big Berlin banks, together with their affiliated banks, controlled , million marks, that is, about  per cent of the total German bank capital. The Deutsche Bank, which together with its affiliated banks controls nearly , million marks, represents, parallel to the Prussian State Railway Administration, the biggest and also the most decentralised accumulation of capital in the Old World.\u201d[]\n\nI have emphasised the reference to the \u201caffiliated\u201d banks because it is one of the most important distinguishing features of modern capitalist concentration. The big enterprises, and the banks in particular, not only completely absorb the small ones, but also \u201cannex\u201d them, subordinate them, bring them into their \u201cown\u201d group or \u201cconcern\u201d (to use the technical term) by acquiring \u201choldings\u201d in their capital, by purchasing or exchanging shares, by a system of credits, etc., etc. Professor Liefmann has written a voluminous \u201cwork\u201d of about  pages describing modern \u201cholding and finance companies\u201d,[] unfortunately adding very dubious \u201ctheoretical\u201d reflections to what is frequently undigested raw material. To what results this \u201cholding\u201d system leads in respect of concentration is best illustrated in the book written on the big German banks by Riesser, himself a banker. But before examining his data, let us quote a concrete example of the \u201cholding\u201d system.\n\nThe Deutsche Bank \u201cgroup\u201d is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, of the big banking groups. In order to trace the main threads which connect all the banks in this group, a distinction must be made between holdings of the first and second and third degree, or what amounts to the same thing, between dependence (of the lesser banks on the Deutsche Bank) in the first, second and third degree. We then obtain the following picture[]:\n\nThe Deutsche Bank\nhas holdings:\tDirect or st\ndegree de-\npendence\tnd degree\ndepen-\ndence\trd degree\ndepen-\ndence\nPermanently\tin  other\nbanks\t of the \nhave holdings in\n other banks\t of the  have\nholdings in \nother banks\nFor an indefinite\nperiod....\tin  other\nbanks\t\u2014\t\u2014\nOccasionally....\tin  other\nbanks\t of the  have\nholdings in \nother banks\n of the  have\nholdings in \nother banks\nTotals......\tin  other\nbanks\t of the  have\nholdings in \nother banks\n of the \nhave holdings\nin  other\nbanks\nIncluded in the eight banks \u201coccasionally\u201d dependent on the Deutsche Bank in the \u201cfirst degree\u201d, are three foreign banks: one Austrian (the Wiener Bankverein) and two Russian (the Siberian Commercial Bank and the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade). Altogether, the Deutsche Bank group comprises, directly and indirectly, partially and totally,  banks; and the total capital\u2014its own and that of others which it controls\u2014is estimated at between two and three thousand million marks.\n\nIt is obvious that a bank which stands at the head of such. a group, and which enters into agreement with half a dozen other banks only slightly smaller than itself for the purpose of conducting exceptionally big and profitable financial operations like floating state loans, has already outgrown the part of \u201cmiddleman\u201d and has become an association of a handful of monopolists.\n\nThe rapidity with which the concentration of banking proceeded in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century is shown by the following data which we quote in an abbreviated form from Riesser:\n\nSIX BIG BERLIN BANKS\nYear\tBranches in Germany\tDeposit banks\nand exchange\noffices\tConstant holdings in German joint-\nstock banks\tTotal establishments\n...\t\t\t\t\n...\t\t\t\t\n...\t\t\t\t\nWe see the rapid expansion of a close network of channels which cover the whole country, centralising all capital and all revenues, transforming thousands and thousands of scattered economic enterprises into a single national capitalist, and then into a world capitalist economy. The \u201cdecentralisation\u201d that SchuIze-Gaevernitz, as an exponent of present-day bourgeois political economy, speaks of in the passage previously quoted, really means the subordination to a single centre of an increasing number of formerly relatively \u201cindependent\u201d, or rather, strictly local economic units. In reality it is centralisation, the enhancement of the role, importance and power of monopolist giants.\n\nIn the older capitalist countries this \u201cbanking network\u201d is still more close. In Great Britain and Ireland, in , there were in all , branches of banks. Four big banks had more than  branches each (from  to ); four had more than  branches each, and eleven more than  each.\n\nIn France, three very big banks, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, the Comptoir National and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale extended their operations and their network of branches in the following manner.[]\n\nNumber of branches and offices\tCapital\n(, francs)\nYear\tIn the prov-\ninces\tIn\nParis\tTotal\tOwn\nCapital\tDeposits used\nas capital\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t,\n\t,\t\t,\t\t,\nIn order to show the \u201cconnections\u201d of a big modern bank, Riesser gives the following figures of the number of letters dispatched and received by the Disconto-Gesellschaft, one of the biggest banks in Germany and in the world (its capital in  amounted to  million marks):\n\nYear\tLetters\nreceived\tLetters\ndispatched\n...\t,\t,\n...\t,\t,\n...\t,\t,\nThe number of accounts of the big Paris bank, the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, increased from , in  to , in .[]\n\nThese simple figures show perhaps better than lengthy disquisitions how the concentration of capital and the growth of bank turnover are radically changing the significance of the banks. Scattered capitalists are transformed into a single collective capitalist. When carrying the current accounts of a few capitalists, a bank, as it were, transacts a purely technical and exclusively auxiliary operation. When, however, this operation grows to enormous dimensions we find that a handful of monopolists subordinate to their will all the operations, both commercial and industrial, of the whole of capitalist society; for they are enabled-by means of their banking connections, their current accounts and other financial operations\u2014first, to ascertain exactly the financial position of the various capitalists, then to control them, to influence them by restricting or enlarging, facilitating or hindering credits, and finally to entirely determine their fate, determine their income, deprive them of capital, or permit them to increase their capital rapidly and to enormous dimensions, etc.\n\nWe have just mentioned the  million marks capital of the Disconto-Gesellschaft of Berlin. This increase of the capital of the bank was one of the incidents in the struggle for hegemony between two of the biggest Berlin banks-the Deutsche Bank and the Disconto. In , the first was still a novice and had a capital of only  million marks, while the second had a capital of  million marks. In , the first had a capital of  million, while the second had  million. In , the first increased its capital to  million and the second, by merging with another first-class big bank, the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein, increased its capital to  million. And, of course, this struggle for hegemony went hand in hand with the more and more frequent conclusion of \u201cagreements\u201d of an increasingly durable character between the two banks. The following are the conclusions that this development forces upon banking specialists who regard economic questions from a standpoint which does not in the least exceed the bounds of the most moderate and cautious bourgeois reformism.\n\nCommenting on the increase of the capital of the Disconto Gesellschaft to  million marks, the German review, Die Bank, wrote: \u201cOther banks will follow this same path and in time the three hundred men, who today govern Germany economically, will gradually be reduced to fifty, twenty-five or still fewer. It cannot be expected that this latest move towards concentration will be confined to banking. The close relations that exist between individual banks naturally lead to the bringing together of the industrial syndicates which these banks favour.... One fine morning we shall wake up in surprise to see nothing but trusts before our eyes, and to find ourselves faced with the necessity of substituting state monopolies for private monopolies. However, we have nothing to reproach ourselves with, except that we have allowed things to follow their own course, slightly accelerated by the manipulation of stocks.\u201d[]\n\nThis is an example of the impotence of bourgeois journalism which differs from bourgeois science only in that the latter is less sincere and strives to obscure the essence of the matter, to hide the forest behind the trees. To be \u201csurprised\u201d at the results of concentration, to \u201creproach\u201d the government of capitalist Germany, or capitalist \u201csociety\u201d (\u201courselves\u201d), to fear that the introduction of stocks and shares might \u201caccelerate\u201d concentration in the same way as the German \u201ccartel\u201d specialist Tschierschky fears the American trusts and \u201cprefers\u201d the German cartels on the grounds that they \u201cmay not, like the trusts, excessively accelerate technical and economic progress\u201d[] \u2014is not all this a sign of impotence?\n\nBut facts remain facts. There are no trusts in Germany; there are \u201conly\u201d cartels\u2014but Germany is governed by not more than three hundred magnates of capital, and the number of these is constantly diminishing. At all events, banks greatly intensify and accelerate the process of concentration of capital and the formation of monopolies in all capitalist countries, notwithstanding all the differences in their banking laws.\n\nThe banking system \u201cpossesses, indeed, the form of universal book-keeping and distribution of means of production on a social scale, but solely the form\u201d, wrote Marx in Capital half a century ago (Russ. trans., Vol. III, part II, p. []). The figures we have quoted on the growth of bank capital, on the increase in the number of the branches and offices of the biggest banks, the increase in the number of their accounts, etc., present a concrete picture of this \u201cuniversal book-keeping\u201d of the whole capitalist class; and not only of the capitalists, for the banks collect, even though temporarily, all kinds of money revenues\u2014of small businessmen, office clerks, and of a tiny upper stratum of the working class. \u201cUniversal distribution of means of production\u201d\u2014that, from the formal aspect, is what grows out of the modern banks, which, numbering some three to six of the biggest in France, and six to eight in Germany, control millions and millions. In substance, however, the distribution of means of production is not at all \u201cuniversal\u201d, but private, i.e., it conforms to the interests of big capital, and primarily, of huge, monopoly capital, which operates under conditions in which the masses live in want, in which the whole development of agriculture hopelessly lags behind the development of industry, while within industry itself the \u201cheavy industries\u201d exact tribute from all other branches of industry.\n\nIn the matter of socialising capitalist economy the savings-banks and post-offices are beginning to compete with the banks; they are more \u201cdecentralised\u201d, i.e., their influence extends to a greater number of localities, to more remote places, to wider sections of the population. Here is the data collected by an American commission on the comparative growth of deposits in banks and savings-banks[]:\n\nDEPOSITS (,, marks)\nYear\tBritain\tFrance\tGermany\n \tBanks\tSavings-\nbanks\tBanks\tSavings-\nbanks\tBanks\tCredit\nSocieties\tSavings-\nbanks\n...\t.\t.\t?\t.\t.\t.\t.\n...\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\n...\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nAs they pay interest at the rate of  per cent and  / per cent on deposits, the savings-banks must seek \u201cprofitable\u201d investments for their capital, they must deal in bills, mortgages, etc.The boundaries between the banks and the savings-banks \u201cbecome more and more obliterated\u201d. The Chambers of Commerce of Bochum and Erfurt, for example, demand that savings-banks be \u201cprohibited\u201d from engaging in \u201cpurely\u201d banking business,such as discounting bills; they demand the limitation of the \u201cbanking\u201d operations of the post-office.[] The banking magnates seem to be afraid that state monopoly will steal upon them. from an unexpected quarter. It goes without saying, however, that this fear is no more than an expression of the rivalry, so to speak, between two department managers in the same office; for, on the one hand, the millions entrusted to the savings-banks are in the final analysis actually controlled by these very same bank capital magnates, while, on the other hand, state monopoly in capitalist society is merely a means of increasing and guaranteeing the income of millionaires in some branch of industry who are on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nThe change from the old type of capitalism, in which free competition predominated, to the new capitalism, in which monopoly reigns, is expressed, among other things, by a decline in the importance of the Stock Exchange. The review, Die Bank, writes: \u201cThe Stock Exchange has long ceased to be the indispensable medium of circulation that it formerly was when the banks were not yet able to place the bulk of new issues with their clients.\u201d[]\n\n\u201c\u2019Every bank is a Stock Exchange\u2019, and the bigger the bank, and the more successful the concentration of banking, the truer does this modern aphorism ring.\u201d[] \u201cWhile formerly, in the seventies, the Stock Exchange, flushed with the exuberance of youth\u201d (a \u201csubtle\u201d allusion to the Stock Exchange crash of , the company promotion scandals,[] etc.), \u201copened the era of the industrialisation of Germany, nowadays the banks and industry are able to \u2018manage it alone\u2019. The domination of our big banks over the Stock Exchange ... is nothing else than the expression of the completely organised German industrial state. If the domain of the automatically functioning economic laws is thus restricted, and if the domain of conscious regulation by the banks is considerably enlarged, the national economic responsibility of a few guiding heads is immensely increased,\u201d so writes the German Professor Schulze-Gaevernitz,[] an apologist of German imperialism, who is regarded as an authority by the imperialists of all countries, and who tries to gloss over the \u201cmere detail\u201d that the \u201cconscious regulation\u201d of economic life by the banks consists in the fleecing of the public by a handful of \u201ccompletely organised\u201d monopolists. The task of a bourgeois professor is not to lay bare the entire mechanism, or to expose all the machinations of the bank monopolists, but rather to present them in a favourable light.\n\nIn the same way, Riesser, a still more authoritative economist and himself a banker, makes shift with meaningless phrases in order to explain away undeniable facts: \u201c... the Stock Exchange is steadily losing the feature which is absolutely essential for national economy as a whole and for the circulation of securities in particular\u2014that of being not only a most exact measuring-rod, but also an almost automatic regulator of the economic movements which converge on it.\u201d[]\n\nIn other words, the old capitalism, the capitalism of free competition with its indispensable regulator, the Stock Exchange, is passing away. A new capitalism has come to take its place, bearing obvious features of something transient, a mixture of free competition and monopoly. The question naturally arises: into what is this new capitalism \u201cdeveloping\u201d? But the bourgeois scholars are afraid to raise this question.\n\n\u201cThirty years ago, businessmen, freely competing against one another, performed nine-tenths of the work connected with their business other than manual labour. At the present time, ninetenths of this \u2018brain work\u2019 is performed by employees. Banking is in the forefront of this evolution.\u201d[] This admission by Schulze-Gaevernitz brings us once again to the question: into what is this new capitalism, capitalism in its imperialist stage, developing?\n\nAmong the few banks which remain at the head of all capitalist economy as a result of the process of concentration, there is naturally to be observed an increasingly marked tendency towards monopolist agreements, towards a bank trust. In America, not nine, but two very big banks, those of the multimillionaires Rockefeller and Morgan, control a capital of eleven thousand million marks.[] In Germany the absorption of the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein by the Disconto-Gesellschaft to which I referred above, was commented on in the following terms by the Frankfurter Zeitung,[] an organ of Stock Exchange interests:\n\n\u201cThe concentration movement of the banks is narrowing the circle of establishments from which it is possible to obtain credits, and is consequently increasing the dependence of big industry upon a small number of banking groups. In view of the close connection between industry and the financial world, the freedom of movement of industrial companies which need banking capital is restricted. For this reason, big industry is watching the growing trustification of the banks with mixed feelings. Indeed, we have repeatedly seen the beginnings of certain agreements between the individual big banking concerns, which aim at restricting competition.\u201d[]\n\nAgain and again, the final word in the development of banking is monopoly.\n\nAs regards the close connection between the banks and industry, it is precisely in this sphere that the new role of the banks is, perhaps, most strikingly felt. When a bank discounts a bill for a firm, opens a current account for it, etc., these operations, taken separately, do not in the least diminish its independence, and the bank plays no other part than that of a modest middleman. But when such operations are multiplied and become an established practice, when the bank \u201ccollects\u201d in its own hands enormous amounts of capital, when the running of a current account for a given firm enables the bank\u2014and this is what happens\u2014to obtain fuller and more detailed information about the economic position of its client, the result is that the industrial capitalist becomes more completely dependent on the bank.\n\nAt the same time a personal link-up, so to speak, is established between the banks and the biggest industrial and commercial enterprises, the merging of one with another through the acquisition of shares, through the appointment of bank directors to the Supervisory Boards (or Boards of Directors) of industrial and commercial enterprises, and vice versa. The German economist, Jeidels, has compiled most detailed data on this form of concentration of capital and of enterprises. Six of the biggest Berlin banks were represented by their directors in  industrial companies; and by their board members in  others, making a total of  companies. In  of these companies they either had two of their representatives on each of the respective Supervisory Boards, or held the posts of chairmen. We find these industrial and commercial companies in the most diverse branches of industry: insurance, transport, restaurants, theatres, art industry, etc. On the other hand, on the Supervisory Boards of these six banks (in ) were fifty-one of the biggest industrialists, including the director of Krupp, of the powerful \u201cHapag\u201d (Hamburg-Amerika Line), etc., etc. From  to , each of these six banks participated in the share and bond issues of many hundreds of industrial companies (the number ranging from  to ).[]\n\nThe \u201cpersonal link-up\u201d between the banks and industry is supplemented by the \u201cpersonal link-up\u201d between both of them and the government. \u201cSeats on Supervisory Boards,\u201d writes Jeidels, \u201care freely offered to persons of title, also to ex-civil servants, who are able to do a great deal to facilitate (!!) relations with the authorities.\u201d . . . \u201cUsually, on the Supervisory Board of a big bank, there is a member of parliament or a Berlin city councillor.\u201d\n\nThe building and development, so to speak, of the big capitalist monopolies is therefore going on full steam ahead in all \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201csupernatural\u201d ways. A sort of division of labour is being systematically developed amongst the several hundred kings of finance who reign over modern capitalist society:\n\n\u201cSimultaneously with this widening of the sphere of activity of certain big industrialists (joining the boards of banks, etc.) and with the assignment of provincial bank managers to definite industrial regions, there is a growth of specialisation among the directors of the big banks. Generally speaking, this specialisation is only conceivable when banking is conducted on a large scale, and particularly when it has widespread connections with industry. This division of labour proceeds along two lines: on the one hand, relations with industry as a whole are entrusted to one director, as his special function; on the other, each director assumes the supervision of several separate enterprises, or of a group of enterprises in the same branch of industry or having similar interests.... (Capitalism has already reached the stage of organised supervision of individual enterprises.) One specialises in German industry, sometimes even in West German industry alone (the West is the most industrialised part of Germany), others specialise in relations with foreign states and foreign industry, in information on the characters of industrialists and others, in Stock Exchange questions, etc. Besides, each bank director is often assigned a special locality or a special branch of industry; one works chiefly on Supervisory Boards of electric companies, another, on chemical, brewing, or beet sugar plants, a third, in a few isolated industrial enterprises, but at the same time works on the Supervisory Boards of insurance companies.... In short, there can be no doubt that the growth in the dimensions and diversity of the big banks\u2019 operations is accompanied by an increase in the division of labour among their directors with the object (and result) of, so to speak, lifting them somewhat out of pure banking and making them better experts, better judges of the general problems of industry and the special problems of each branch of industry, thus making them more capable of acting within the respective bank\u2019s industrial sphere of influence. This system is supplemented by the banks\u2019 endeavours to elect to their Supervisory Boards men who are experts in industrial affairs, such as industrialists, former officials, especially those formerly in the railway service or in mining,\u201d etc.[]\n\nWe find the same system only in a slightly different form in French banking. For instance, one of the three biggest French banks, the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, has organised a financial research service (service des \u00e9tudes financi\u00e8res), which permanently employs over fifty engineers, statisticians, economists, lawyers, etc. This costs from six to seven hundred thousand francs annually. The service is in turn divided into eight departments: one specialises in collecting information on industrial establishments, another studies general statistics, a third, railway and steamship companies, a fourth, securities, a fifth, financial reports, etc.[]\n\nThe result is, on the one hand, the ever-growing merger, or, as N. I. Bukharin aptly calls it, coalescence, of bank and industrial capital and, on the other hand, the growth of the banks into institutions of a truly \u201cuniversal character\u201d. On this question I find it necessary to quote the exact terms used by Jeidels, who has best studied the subject:\n\n\u201cAn examination of the sum total of industrial relationships reveals the universal character of the financial establishments working on behalf of industry. Unlike other kinds of banks, and contrary to the demand sometimes expressed in the literature that banks should specialise in one kind of business or in one branch of industry in order to prevent the ground from slipping from under their feet\u2014the big banks are striving to make their connections with industrial enterprises as varied as possible in respect of the locality or branches of industry and are striving to eliminate the unevenness in the distribution of capital among localities and branches of industry resulting from the historical development of individual enterprises.\u201d \u201cOne tendency is to make the connections with industry general; another tendency is to make them durable and close. In the six big banks both these tendencies are realised, not in full, but to a considerable extent and to an equal degree.\u201d\n\nQuite often industrial and commercial circles complain of the \u201cterrorism\u201d of the banks. And it is not surprising that such complaints are heard, for the big banks \u201ccommand\u201d, as will be seen from the following example. On November , , one of the big, so-called Berlin \u201cD\u201d banks (the names of the four biggest banks begin with the letter D) wrote to the Board of Directors of the German Central Northwest Cement Syndicate in the following terms: \u201cAs we learn from the notice you published in a certain newspaper of the th inst., we must reckon with the possibility that the next general meeting of your syndicate, to be held on the th of this month, may decide on measures which are likely to effect changes in your enterprise which are unacceptable to us. We deeply regret that, for these reasons, we are obliged henceforth to withdraw the credit which had hitherto been allowed you.... But if the said next general meeting does not decide upon measures which are unacceptable to us, and if we receive suitable guarantees on this matter for the future, we shall be quite willing to open negotiations with you on the grant of a new credit.\u201d[]\n\nAs a matter of fact, this is small capital\u2019s old complaint about being oppressed by big capital, but in this case it was a whole syndicate that fell into the category of \u201csmall\u201d capital! The old struggle between small and big capital is being resumed at a new and immeasurably higher stage of development. It stands to reason that the big banks\u2019 enterprises, worth many millions, can accelerate technical progress with means that cannot possibly be compared with those of the past. The banks, for example, set up special technical research societies, and, of course, only \u201cfriendly\u201d industrial enterprises benefit from their work. To this category belong the Electric Railway Research Association, the Central Bureau of Scientific and Technical Research, etc.\n\nThe directors of the big banks themselves cannot fail to see that new conditions of national economy are being created; but they are powerless in the face of these phenomena.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has watched, in recent years,\u201d writes Jeidels, \u201cthe changes of incumbents of directorships and seats on the Supervisory Boards of the big banks, cannot fail to have noticed that power is gradually passing into the hands of men who consider the active intervention of the big banks in the general development of industry to be necessary and of increasing importance. Between these new men and the old bank directors, disagreements on this subject of a business and often of a personal nature are growing. The issue is whether or not the banks, as credit institutions, will suffer from this intervention in industry, whether they are sacrificing tried principles and an assured profit to engage in a field of activity which has nothing in common with their role as middlemen in providing credit, and which is leading the banks into a field where they are more than ever before exposed to the blind forces of trade fluctuations. This is the opinion of many of the older bank directors, while most of the young men consider active intervention in industry to be a necessity as great as that which gave rise, simultaneously with big modern industry, to the big banks and modern industrial banking. The two parties are agreed only on one point: that there are neither firm principles nor a concrete aim in the new activities of the big banks.\u201d[]\n\nThe old capitalism has had its day. The new capitalism represents a transition towards something. It is hopeless, of course, to seek for \u201cfirm principles and a concrete aim\u201d for the purpose of \u201creconciling\u201d monopoly with free competition. The admission of the practical men has quite a different ring from the official praises of the charms of \u201corganised\u201d capitalism sung by its apologists, Schulze-Gaevernitz, Liefmann and similar \u201ctheoreticians\u201d.\n\nAt precisely what period were the \u201cnew activities\u201d of the big banks finally established? Jeidels gives us a fairly exact answer to this important question:\n\n\u201cThe connections between the banks and industrial enterprises, with their new content, their new forms and their new organs, namely, the big banks which are organised on both a centralised and a decentralised basis, were scarcely a characteristic economic phenomenon before the nineties; in one sense, indeed, this initial date may be advanced to the year , when the important mergers took place and when, for the first time, the new form of decentralised organisation was introduced to suit the industrial policy of the banks. This starting-point could perhaps be placed at an even later date, for it was the crisis of  that enormously accelerated and intensified the process of concentration of industry and of banking, consolidated that process, for the first time transformed the connection with industry into the actual monopoly of the big banks, and made this connection much closer and more active.\u201d[]\n\nThus, the twentieth century marks the turning-point from the old capitalism to the new, from the domination of capital in general to the domination of finance capital.\n\nIII. FINANCE CAPITAL AND THE FINANCIAL OLIGARCHY\n\u201cA steadily increasing proportion of capital in industry,\u201d writes Hilferding, \u201cceases to belong to the industrialists who employ it. They obtain the use of it only through the medium of the banks which, in relation to them, represent the owners of the capital. On the other hand, the bank is forced to sink an increasing share of its funds in industry. Thus, to an ever greater degree the banker is being transformed into an industrial capitalist. This bank capital, i.e., capital in money form, which is thus actually transformed into industrial capital, I call \u2018finance capital\u2019.\u201d \u201cFinance capital is capital controlled by banks and employed by industrialists.\u201d[]\n\nThis definition is incomplete insofar as it is silent on one extremely important fact\u2014on the increase of concentration of production and of capital to such an extent that concentration is leading, and has led, to monopoly. But throughout the whole of his work, and particularly in the two chapters preceding the one from which this definition is taken, Hilferding stresses the part played by capitalist monopolies.\n\nThe concentration of production; the monopolies arising therefrom; the merging or coalescence of the banks with industry\u2014such is the history of the rise of finance capital and such is the content of that concept.\n\nWe now have to describe how, under the general conditions of commodity production and private property, the \u201cbusiness operations\u201d of capitalist monopolies inevitably lead to the domination of a financial oligarchy. It should be noted that German\u2014and not only German\u2014bourgeois scholars, like Riesser, Schulze-Gaevernitz, Liefmann and others, are all apologists of imperialism and of finance capital. Instead of revealing the \u201cmechanics\u201d of the formation of an oligarchy, its methods, the size of its revenues \u201cimpeccable and peccable\u201d, its connections with parliaments etc., etc., they obscure or gloss over them. They evade these \u201cvexed questions\u201d by pompous and vague phrases, appeals to the \u201csense of responsibility\u201d of bank directors, by praising \u201cthe sense of duty\u201d of Prussian officials, giving serious study to the petty details of absolutely ridiculous parliamentary bills for the \u201csupervision\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d of monopolies, playing spillikins with theories, like, for example, the following \u201cscholarly\u201d definition, arrived at by Professor Liefmann: \u201cCommerce is an occupation having for its object the collection, storage and supply of goods.\u201d[] (The Professor\u2019s bold-face italics.) . . . From this it would follow that commerce existed in the time of primitive man, who knew nothing about exchange, and that it will exist under socialism!\n\nBut the monstrous facts concerning the monstrous rule of the financial oligarchy are so glaring that in all capitalist countries, in America, France and Germany, a whole literature has sprung up, written from the bourgeois point of view, but which, nevertheless, gives a fairly truthful picture and criticism\u2014petty-bourgeois, naturally\u2014of this oligarchy.\n\nParamount importance attaches to the \u201cholding system\u201d, already briefly referred to above. The German economist, Heymann, probably the first to call attention to this matter, describes the essence of it in this way:\n\n\u201cThe head of the concern controls the principal company (literally: the \u201cmother company\u201d); the latter reigns over the subsidiary companies (\u201cdaughter companies\u201d) which in their turn control still other subsidiaries (\u201cgrandchild companies\u201d), etc. In this way, it is possible with a comparatively small capital to dominate immense spheres of production. Indeed, if holding  per cent of the capital is always sufficient to control a company, the head of the concern needs only one million to control eight million in the second subsidiaries. And if this \u2018interlocking\u2019 is extended, it is possible with one million to control sixteen million, thirty-two million, etc.\u201d[]\n\nAs a matter of fact, experience shows that it is sufficient to own  per cent of the shares of a company in order to direct its affairs,[] since in practice a certain number of small, scattered shareholders find it impossible to attend general meetings, etc. The \u201cdemocratisation\u201d of the ownership of shares, from which the bourgeois sophists and opportunist so-called \u201cSocial-Democrats\u201d expect (or say that they expect) the \u201cdemocratisation of capital\u201d, the strengthening of the role and significance of small scale production, etc., is, in fact, one of the ways of increasing the power of the financial oligarchy. Incidentally, this is why, in the more advanced, or in the older and more \u201cexperienced\u201d capitalist countries, the law allows the issue of shares of smaller denomination. In Germany, the law does not permit the issue of shares of less than one thousand marks denomination, and the magnates of German finance look with an envious eye at Britain, where the issue of one-pound shares (=  marks, about  rubles) is permitted Siemens, one of the biggest industrialists and \u201cfinancial kings\u201d in Germany, told the Reiclistag on June , , that \u201cthe one-pound share is the basis of British imperialism\u201d.[] This merchant has a much deeper and more \u201cMarxist\u201d understanding of imperialism than a certain disreputable writer who is held to be one of the founders of Russian Marxism[] and believes that imperialism is a bad habit of a certain nation....\n\nBut the \u201cholding system\u201d not only serves enormously to increase the power of the monopolists; it also enables them to resort with impunity to all sorts of shady and dirty tricks to cheat the public, because formally the directors of the \u201cmother company\u201d are not legally responsible for the \u201cdaughter company\u201d, which is supposed to be \u201cindependent\u201d, and through the medium of which they can \u201cpull off\u201d anything. Here is an example taken from the German review, Die Bank, for May :\n\n\u201cThe Spring Steel Company of Kassel was regarded some years ago as being one of the most profitable enterprises in Germany. Through bad management its dividends fell from  per cent to nil. It appears that the Board, without consulting the shareholders, had loaned six million marks to one of its \u2018daughter companies\u2019, the Hassia Company, which had a nominal capital of only some hundreds of thousands of marks. This commitment, amounting to nearly treble the capital of the \u2018mother company\u2019, was never mentioned in its balance-sheets. This omission was quite legal and could be hushed up for two whole years because it did not violate any point of company law. The chairman of the Supervisory Board, who as the responsible head had signed the false balance-sheets, was, and still is, the president of the Kassel Chamber of Commerce. The shareholders only heard of the loan to the Hassia Company long afterwards, when it had been proved to be a mistake\u201d... (the writer should put this word in inverted commas) ... \u201cand when Spring Steel shares dropped nearly  per cent, because those in the know were getting rid of them....\n\n\u201cThis typical example of balance-sheet jugglery, quite common in joint-stock companies, explains why their Boards of Directors are willing to undertake risky transactions with a far lighter heart than individual businessmen. Modern methods of drawing up balance-sheets not only make it possible to conceal doubtful undertakings from the ordinary shareholder, but also allow the people most concerned to escape the consequence of unsuccessful speculation by selling their shares in time when the individual businessman risks his own skin in everything he does....\n\n\u201cThe balance-sheets of many joint-stock companies put us in mind of the palimpsests of the Middle Ages from which the visible inscription had first to be erased in order to discover beneath it another inscription giving the real meaning of the document. [Palimpsests are parchment documents from which the original inscription has been erased and another inscription imposed.]\n\n\u201cThe simplest and, therefore, most common procedure for making balance-sheets indecipherable is to divide a single business into several parts by setting up \u2018daughter companies\u2019\u2014or by annexing them. The advantages of this system for various purposes\u2014legal and illegal\u2014are so evident that big companies which do not employ it are quite the exception.\u201d[]\n\nAs an example of a huge monopolist company that extensively employs this system, the author quotes the famous General Electric Company (the A.E.G., to which I shall refer again later on). In , it was calculated that this company held shares in  to  other companies, dominating them, of course, and thus controlling a total capital of about , million marks.[]\n\nNone of the rules of control, the publication of balance-sheets, the drawing up of balance-sheets according to a definite form, the public auditing of accounts, etc., the things about which well-intentioned professors and officials\u2014that is, those imbued with the good intention of defending and prettyfying capitalism\u2014discourse to the public, are of any avail; for private property is sacred, and no one can be prohibited from buying, selling, exchanging or hypothecating shares, etc.\n\nThe extent to which this \u201cholding system\u201d has developed in the big Russian banks may be judged by the figures given by E. Agalid, who for fifteen years was an official of the Russo-Chinese Bank and who, in May , published a book, not altogether correctly entitled Big Banks and the World Market.[] The author divides the big Russian banks into two main groups: (a) banks that come under the \u201cholding system\u201d, and (b) \u201cindependent\u201d banks\u2014\u201cindependence\u201d however, being arbitrarily taken to mean independence of foreign banks. The author divides the first group into three subgroups: () German holdings, () British holdings, and () French holdings, having in view the \u201choldings\u201d and domination of the big foreign banks of the particular country mentioned. The author divides the capital of the banks into \u201cproductively\u201d invested capital (industrial and commercial undertakings), and \u201cspeculatively\u201d invested capital (in Stock Exchange and financial operations), assuming, from his petty-bourgeois reformist point of view, that it is possible, under capitalism, to separate the first form of investment from the second and to abolish the second form.\n\nHere are the figures he supplies:\n\nBANK ASSETS\n(According to Reports for October-November \n, rubles\n \tCapital Invested\nGroups of Russian banks\tProductively\tSpeculatively\tTotal\na )\tFour banks: Siberian Commercial,\nRussian , International, and\nDiscount Bank....\t.\t.\t,.\na )\tTwo banks: Commercial and\nIndustrial, and Russo-British\t.\t.\t.\na )\tFive banks: Russian-Asiatic, St.\nPetersburg Private, Azov-Don,\nUnion Moscow, Russo-\nFrench Commercial\t.\t.\t,.\n \t( banks) Total..............a) =\t,.\t,.\t,.\nb)\tEight banks: Moscow Merchants,\nVolga-Kama, Junker and Co.,\nSt. Petersburg Commercial (formerly\nWawelberg), Bank of Moscow (formerly\nRyabushinsky), Moscow Discount,\nMoscow Commercial, Moscow\nPrivate.......\n\n.\t.\t.\n \t( banks) Total ..........\t,.\t,.\t,.\nAccording to these figures, of the approximately , million rubles making up the \u201cworking\u201d capital of the big banks, more than three-fourths, more than , million, belonged to banks which in reality were only \u201cdaughter companies\u201d of foreign banks, and chiefly of Paris banks (the famous trio: Union Parisienne, Paris et Pays-Bas and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale), and of Berlin banks (particularly the Deutsche Bank and Disconto-Gesellschaft). Two of the biggest Russian banks, the Russian (Russian Bank for Foreign Trade) and the International (St. Petersburg International Commercial Bank), between  and  increased their capital from  to  million rubles, and their reserves from  million to  million \u201cemploying three-fourths German capital\u201d. The first bank belongs to the Berlin Deutsche Bank \u201cconcern\u201d and the second to the Berlin Disconto-Gesellschaft. The worthy Agahd is deeply indignant at the majority of the shares being held by the Berlin banks, so that the Russian shareholders are, therefore, powerless. Naturally, the country which exports capital skims the cream; for example, the Berlin Deutsche Bank, before placing the shares of the Siberian Commercial Bank on the Berlin market, kept them in its portfolio for a whole year, and then sold them at the rate of  for , that is, at nearly twice their nominal value, \u201cearning\u201d a profit of nearly six million rubles, which Hilferding calls \u201cpromoter\u2019s profits\u201d.\n\nOur author puts the total \u201ccapacity\u201d of the principal St. Petersburg banks at , million rubles, well over , million, and the \u201choldings\u201d, or rather, the extent to which foreign banks dominated them, he estimates as follows: French banks,  per cent; British,  per cent; German,  per cent. The author calculates that of the total of , million rubles of functioning capital, , million rubles, or over  per cent, fall to the share of the Produgol and Prodamet syndicates[] and the syndicates in the oil, metallurgical and cement industries. Thus, owing to the formation of capitalist monopolies, the merging of bank and industrial capital has also made enormous strides in Russia.\n\nFinance capital, concentrated in a few hands and exercising a virtual monopoly, exacts enormous and ever-increasing profits from the floating of companies, issue of stock, state loans, etc., strengthens the domination of the financial oligarchy and levies tribute upon the whole of society for the benefit of monopolists. Here is an example, taken from a multitude of others, of the \u201cbusiness\u201d methods of the American trusts, quoted by Hilferding. In , Havemeyer founded the Sugar Trust by amalgamating fifteen small firms, whose total capital amounted to ,, dollars. Suitably \u201cwatered\u201d, as the Americans say, the capital of the trust was declared to be  million dollars. This \u201covercapitalisation\u201d anticipated the monopoly profits, in the same way as the United States Steel Corporation anticipates its monopoly profits in buying up as many iron ore fields as possible. In fact, the Sugar Trust set up monopoly prices, which secured it such profits that it could pay  per cent dividend on capital \u201cwatered\u201d sevenfold, or about  per cent on the capital actually invested at the time the trust was formed! In , the capital of the Sugar Trust amounted to  million dollars. In twenty-two years, it had increased its capital more than tenfold.\n\nIn France the domination of the \u201cfinancial oligarchy\u201d (Against the Financial Oligarchy in France, the title of the well-known book by Lysis, the fifth edition of which was published in ) assumed a form that was only slightly different. Four of the most powerful banks enjoy, not a relative, but an \u201cabsolute monopoly\u201d in the issue of bonds. In reality, this is a \u201ctrust of big banks\u201d. And monopoly ensures monopoly profits from bond issues. Usually a borrowing country does not get more than  per cent of the sum of the loan, the remaining  per cent goes to the banks and other middlemen. The profit made by the banks out of the Russo-Chinese loan of  million francs amounted to  per cent; out of the Russian () loan of  million francs the profit amounted to  per cent; and out of the Moroccan () loan of ,, francs it amounted to . per cent. Capitalism, which began its development with petty usury capital, is ending its development with gigantic usury capital. \u201cThe French,\u201d says Lysis, \u201care the usurers of Europe.\u201d All the conditions of economic life are being profoundly modified by this transformation of capitalism. With a stationary population, and stagnant industry, commerce and shipping, the \u201ccountry\u201d can grow rich by usury. \u201cFifty persons, representing a capital of eight million francs, can control , million francs deposited in four banks.\u201d The \u201cholding system\u201d, with which we are already familiar, leads to the same result. One of the biggest banks, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for instance, issues , bonds for its \u201cdaughter company\u201d, the Egyptian Sugar Refineries. The bonds are issued at  per cent, i.e., the bank gains  centimes on the franc. The dividends of the new company were found to be fictitious, the \u201cpublic\u201d lost from  to  million francs. \u201cOne of the directors of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale was a member of the board of directors of the Sugar Refineries.\u201d It is not surprising that the author is driven to the conclusion that \u201cthe French Republic is a financial monarchy\u201d; \u201cit is the complete domination of the financial oligarchy; the latter dominates over the press and the government.\u201d[]\n\nThe extraordinarily high rate of profit obtained from the issue of bonds, which is one of the principal functions of finance capital, plays a very important part in the development and consolidation of the financial oligarchy. \u201cThere is not a single business of this type within the country that brings in profits even approximately equal to those obtained from the floatation of foreign loans,\u201d says Die Bank.[]\n\n\u201cNo banking operation brings in profits comparable with those obtained from the issue of securities!\u201d According to the German Economist, the average annual profits made on the issue of industrial stock were as follows:\n\n \tPer Cent\n..............\t.\n..............\t.\n..............\t.\n..............\t.\n..............\t.\n..............\t.\n\u201cIn the ten years from  to , more than a thousand million marks were \u2018earned\u2019 by issuing German industrial stock.\u201d[]\n\nDuring periods of industrial boom, the profits of finance capital are immense, but during periods of depression, small and unsound businesses go out of existence, and the big banks acquire \u201choldings\u201d in them by buying them up for a mere song, or participate in profitable schemes for their \u201creconstruction\u201d and \u201creorganisation\u201d. In the \u201creconstruction\u201d of undertakings which have been running at a loss, \u201cthe share capital is written down, that is, profits are distributed on a smaller capital and continue to be calculated on this smaller basis. Or, if the income has fallen to zero, new capital is called in, which, combined with the old and less remunerative capital, will bring in an adequate return.\u201d \u201cIncidentally,\u201d adds Hilferding, \u201call these reorganisations and reconstructions have a twofold significance for the banks: first, as profitable transactions; and secondly, as opportunities for securing control of the companies in difficulties.\u201d[]\n\nHere is an instance. The Union Mining Company of Dortmund was founded in . Share capital was issued to the amount of nearly  million marks and the market price of the shares rose to  after it had paid a  per cent dividend for its first year. Finance capital skimmed the cream and earned a trifle of something like  million marks. The principal sponsor of this company was that very big German Disconto-Gesellschaft which so successfully attained a capital of  million marks. Later, the dividends of the Union declined to nil; the shareholders had to consent to a \u201cwriting down\u201d of capital, that is, to losing some of it in order not to lose it all. By a series of \u201creconstructions\u201d, more than  million marks were written off the books of the Union in the course of thirty years. \u201cAt the present time, the original shareholders of the company possess only  per cent of the nominal value of their shares\u201d[] but the banks \u201cearned something\u201d out of every \u201creconstruction\u201d.\n\nSpeculation in land situated in the suburbs of rapidly growing big towns is a particularly profitable operation for finance capital. The monopoly of the banks merges here with the monopoly of ground-rent and with monopoly of the means of communication, since the rise in the price of land and the possibility of selling it profitably in lots, etc., is mainly dependent on good means of communication with the centre of the town; and these means of communication are in the hands of large companies which are connected with these same banks through the holding system and the distribution of seats on the boards. As a result we get what the German writer, L. Eschwege, a contributor to Die Bank who has made a special study of real estate business and mortgages, etc., calls a \u201cbog\u201d. Frantic speculation in suburban building lots; collapse of building enterprises like the Berlin firm of Boswau and Knauer, which acquired as much as  million marks with the help of the \u201csound and solid\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2014the latter, of course, acting through the holding system, i.e., secretly, behind the scenes\u2014and got out of it with a loss of \u201conly\u201d  million marks, then the ruin of small proprietors and of workers who get nothing from the fictitious building firms, fraudulent deals with the \u201chonest\u201d Berlin police and administration for the purpose of gaining control of the issue of cadastral certificates, building licences, etc., etc.[]\n\n\u201cAmerican ethics\u201d, which the European professors and well-meaning bourgeois so hypocritically deplore, have, in the age of finance capital, become the ethics of literally every large city in any country.\n\nAt the beginning of , there was talk in Berlin of the formation of a \u201ctransport trust\u201d, i.e., of establishing \u201ccommunity of interests\u201d between the three Berlin transport undertakings: the city electric railway, the tramway company and the omnibus company. \u201cWe have been aware,\u201d wrote Die Bank, \u201cthat this plan was contemplated ever since it became known that the majority of the shares in the bus company had been acquired by the other two transport companies.... We may fully believe those who are pursuing this aim when they say that by uniting the transport services, they will secure economies, part of which will in time benefit the public. But the question is complicated by the fact that behind the transport trust that is being formed are the banks, which, if they desire, can subordinate the means of transportation, which they have monopolised, to the interests of their real estate business. To be convinced of the reasonableness of such a conjecture, we need only recall that the interests of the big banks that encouraged the formation of the Electric Railway Company were already involved in it at the time the company was formed. That is to say: the interests of this transport undertaking were interlocked with the real estate interests. The point is that the eastern line of this railway was to run across land which this bank sold at an enormous profit for itself and for several partners in the transactions when it became certain the line was to be laid down.\u201d[]\n\nA monopoly, once it is formed and controls thousands of millions, inevitably penetrates into every sphere of public life, regardless of the form of government and all other \u201cdetails\u201d. In German economic literature one usually comes across obsequious praise of the integrity of the Prussian bureaucracy, and allusions to the French Panama scandal[] and to political corruption in America. But the fact is that even bourgeois literature devoted to German banking matters constantly has to go far beyond the field of purely banking operations; it speaks, for instance, about \u201cthe attraction of the banks\u201d in reference to the increasing frequency with which public officials take employment with the banks, as follows: \u201cHow about the integrity of a state official who in his innermost heart is aspiring to a soft job in the Behrenstrasse?\u201d[] (The Berlin street where the head office of the Deutsche Bank is situated.) In , the publisher of Die Bank, Alfred Lansburgh, wrote an article entitled \u201cThe Economic Significance of Byzantinism\u201d, in which he incidentally referred to Wilhelm II\u2019s tour of Palestine, and to \u201cthe immediate result of this journey, the construction of the Baghdad railway, that fatal \u2018great product of German enterprise\u2019, which is more responsible for the \u2018encirclement\u2019 than all our political blunders put together\u201d.[] (By encirclement is meant the policy of Edward VII to isolate Germany and surround her with an imperialist anti-German alliance.) In , Eschwege, the contributor to this same magazine to whom I have already referred, wrote an article entitled \u201cPlutocracy and Bureaucracy\u201d, in which he exposed, for example, the case of a German official named V\u00f6lker, who was a zealous member of the Cartel Committee and who, it turned out some time later, obtained a lucrative post in the biggest cartel, the Steel Syndicate. Similar cases, by no means casual, forced this bourgeois author to admit that \u201cthe economic liberty guaranteed by the German Constitution has become in many departments of economic life, a meaningless phrase\u201d and that under the existing rule of the plutocracy, \u201ceven the widest political liberty cannot save us from being converted into a nation of unfree people\u201d.[]\n\nAs for Russia, I shall confine myself to one example. Some years ago, all the newspapers announced that Davydov, the director of the Credit Department of the Treasury, had resigned his post to take employment with a certain big bank at a salary which, according to the contract, would total over one million rubles in the course of several years. The Credit Department is an institution, the function of which is to \u201cco-ordinate the activities of all the credit institutions of the country\u201d and which grants subsidies to banks in St. Petersburg and Moscow amounting to between  and , million rubles.\u201d[]\n\nIt is characteristic of capitalism in general that the ownership of capital is separated from the application of capital to production, that money capital is separated from industrial or productive capital, and that the rentier who lives entirely on income obtained from money capital, is separated from the entrepreneur and from all who are directly concerned in the management of capital. Imperialism, or the domination of finance capital, is that highest stage of capitalism in which this separation reaches vast proportions. The supremacy of finance capital over all other forms of capital means the predominance of the rentier and of the financial oligarchy; it means that a small number of financially \u201cpowerful\u201d states stand out among all the rest. The extent to which this process is going on may be judged from the statistics on emissions, i.e., the issue of all kinds of securities.\n\nIn the Bulletin of the International Statistical Institute, A. Neymarck[] has published very comprehensive, complete and comparative figures covering the issue of securities all over the world, which have been repeatedly quoted in part in economic literature. The following are the totals he gives for four decades:\n\nTOTAL ISSUES IN FRANCS PER DECADE\n(,,)\n-..............\t.\n-.............\t.\n-.........\t.\n-............\t.\nIn the s the total amount of issues for the whole world was high, owing particularly to the loans floated in connection with, the Franco-Prussian War, and the company-promotion boom which set in in Germany after the war. On the whole, the increase was relatively not very rapid during the three last decades of the nineteenth century, and only in the first ten years of the twentieth century is an enormous increase of almost  per cent to be observed. Thus the beginning of the twentieth century marks the turning-point, not only in the growth of monopolies (cartels, syndicates, trusts), of which we have already spoken, but also in the growth of finance capital.\n\nNeymarck estimates the total amount of issued securities current in the world in  at about , million francs. Deducting from this sum amounts which might have been duplicated, he reduces the total to ,-, million, which is distributed among the various countries as follows (I take , million):\n\nFINANCIAL SECURITIES CURRENT IN \n(,, francs)\nGreat Britain\t\tHolland\t.\nUnited States\t\tBelgium\t.\nFrance\t\tSpain\t.\nGermany\t\tSwitzerland\t.\nRussia\t\tDenmark\t.\nAustria-Hungary\t\tSweden,\nNorway,\nRumania,\netc.\t.\nItaly\t\nJapan\t\nFrom these figures we at once see standing out in sharp relief four of the richest capitalist countries, each of which holds securities to amounts ranging approximately from , to , million francs. Of these four countries, two, Britain and France, are the oldest capitalist countries, and, as we shall see, possess the most colonies; the other two, the United States and Germany, are capitalist countries leading in the rapidity of development and the degree of extension of capitalist monopolies in industry. Together, these four countries own , million francs, that is, nearly  per cent of the world\u2019s finance capital. In one way or another, nearly the whole of the rest of the world is more or less the debtor to and tributary of these international banker countries, these four \u201cpillars\u201d of world finance capital.\n\nIt is particularly important to examine the part which the export of capital plays in creating the international network of dependence on and connections of finance capital.\n\nIV. EXPORT OF CAPITAL\nTypical of the old capitalism, when free competition held undivided sway, was the export of goods. Typical of the latest stage of capitalism, when monopolies rule, is the export of capital.\n\nCapitalism is commodity production at its highest stage of development, when labour-power itself becomes a commodity. The growth of internal exchange, and, particularly, of international exchange, is a characteristic feature of capitalism. The uneven and spasmodic development of individual enterprises, individual branches of industry and individual countries is inevitable under the capitalist system. England became a capitalist country before any other, and by the middle of the nineteenth century, having adopted free trade, claimed to be the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d, the supplier of manufactured goods to all countries, which in exchange were to keep her provided with raw materials. But in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, this monopoly was already undermined; for other countries, sheltering themselves with \u201cprotective\u201d tariffs, developed into independent capitalist states. On the threshold of the twentieth century we see the formation of a new type of monopoly: firstly, monopolist associations of capitalists in all capitalistically developed countries; secondly, the monopolist position of a few very rich countries, in which the accumulation of capital has reached gigantic proportions. An enormous \u201csurplus of capital\u201d has arisen in the advanced countries.\n\nIt goes without saying that if capitalism could develop agriculture, which today is everywhere lagging terribly behind industry, if it could raise the living standards of the masses, who in spite of the amazing technical progress are everywhere still half-starved and poverty-stricken, there could be no question of a surplus of capital. This \u201cargument\u201d is very often advanced by the petty-bourgeois critics of capitalism. But if capitalism did these things it would not be capitalism; for both uneven development and a semi-starvation level of existence of the masses are fundamental and inevitable conditions and constitute premises of this mode of production. As long as capitalism remains what it is, surplus capital will be utilised not for the purpose of raising the standard of living of the masses in a given country, for this would mean a decline in profits for the capitalists, but for the purpose of increasing profits by exporting capital abroad to the backward countries. In these backward countries profits are usually high, for capital is scarce, the price of land is relatively low, wages are low, raw materials are cheap. The export of capital is made possible by a number of backward countries having already been drawn into world capitalist intercourse; main railways have either been or are being built in those countries, elementary conditions for industrial development have been created, etc. The need to export capital arises from the fact that in a few countries capitalism has become \u201coverripe\u201d and (owing to the backward state of agriculture and the poverty of the masses) capital cannot find a field for \u201cprofitable\u201d investment.\n\nHere are approximate figures showing the amount of capital invested abroad by the three principal countries[]:\n\nCAPITAL INVESTED ABROAD\n(,, francs)\nYear\tGreat Britain\tFrance\tGermany\n.....\t.\t\u2014\t\u2014\n.....\t.\t ()\t\u2014\n.....\t.\t()\t?\n.....\t.\t()\t?\n.....\t.\t-\t.\n.....\t-.\t\t.\nThis table shows that the export of capital reached enormous dimensions only at the beginning of the twentieth century. Before the war the capital invested abroad by the three principal countries amounted to between , million and , million francs. At the modest rate of  per cent, the income from this sum should reach from , to , million francs a year\u2014a sound basis for the imperialist oppression and exploitation of most of the countries and nations of the world, for the capitalist parasitism of a handful of wealthy states!\n\nHow is this capital invested abroad distributed among the various countries? Where is it invested? Only an approximate answer can be given to these questions, but it is one sufficient to throw light on certain general relations and connections of modern imperialism.\n\nDISTRIBUTION (APPROXIMATE) OF FOREIGN\nCAPITAL IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GLOBE\n(circa )\n \tGreat\nBritain\tFrance\tGermany\tTotal\n \t \t(,, marks)\t \nEurope..........\t\t\t\t\nAmerica..........\t\t\t\t\nAsia, Africa, and Australia......\t\t\t\t\n \t \t \t \t \nTotal........\t\t\t\t\nThe principal spheres of investment of British capital are the British colonies, which are very large also in America (for example, Canada), not to mention Asia, etc. In this case, enormous exports of capital are bound up most closely with vast colonies, of tile importance of which for imperialism I shall speak later. In the case of France the situation is different. French capital exports are invested mainly in Europe, primarily in Russia (at least ten thousand million francs). This is mainly loan capital, government loans, and not capital invested in industrial undertakings. Unlike British colonial imperialism, French imperialism might be termed usury imperialism. In the case of Germany, we have a third type; colonies are inconsiderable, and German capital invested abroad is divided most evenly between Europe and America.\n\nThe export of capital influences and greatly accelerates the development of capitalism in those countries to which it is exported. While, therefore, the export of capital may tend to a certain extent to arrest development in the capital-exporting countries, it can only do so by expanding and deepening the further development of capitalism throughout the world.\n\nThe capital-exporting countries are nearly always able to obtain certain \u201cadvantages\u201d, the character of which throws light on the peculiarity of the epoch of finance capital and monopoly. The following passage, for instance, appeared in the Berlin review, Die Bank, for October :\n\n\u201cA comedy worthy of the pen of Aristophanes is lately being played on the international capital market. Numerous foreign countries, from Spain to the Balkan states, from Russia to Argentina, Brazil and China, are openly or secretly coming into the big money market with demands, sometimes very persistent, for loans. The money markets are not very bright at the moment and the political outlook is not promising. But not a single money market dares to refuse a loan for fear that its neighbour may forestall it, consent to grant a loan and so secure some reciprocal service. In these international transactions the creditor nearly always manages to secure some extra benefit: a favourable clause in a commercial treaty, a coating station, a contract to construct a harbour, a fat concession, or an order for guns.\u201d[]\n\nFinance capital has created the epoch of monopolies, and monopolies introduce everywhere monopolist principles: the utilisation of \u201cconnections\u201d for profitable transactions takes the place of competition on the open market. The most usual thing is to stipulate that part of the loan granted shall be spent on purchases in the creditor country, particularly on orders for war materials, or for ships, etc. In the course of the last two decades (-), France has very often resorted to this method. The export of capital thus becomes a means of encouraging the export of commodities. In this connection, transactions between particularly big firms assume a form which, as Schilder[] \u201cmildly\u201d puts it, \u201cborders on corruption\u201d. Krupp in Germany, Schneider in France, Armstrong in Britain are instances of firms which have close connections with powerful banks and governments and which cannot easily be \u201cignored\u201d when a loan is being arranged.\n\nFrance, when granting loans to Russia, \u201csqueezed\u201d her in the commercial treaty of September , , stipulating for certain concessions to run till . She did the same in the commercial treaty with Japan of August , . The tariff war between Austria and Serbia, which lasted, with a seven months\u2019 interval, from  to , was partly caused by Austria and France competing to supply Serbia with war materials. In January , Paul Deschanel stated in the Chamber of Deputies that from  to  French firms had supplied war materials to Serbia to the value of  million francs.\n\nA report from the Austro-Hungarian Consul at San-Paulo (Brazil) states: \u201cThe Brazilian railways are being built chiefly by French, Belgian, British and German capital. In the financial operations connected with the construction of these railways the countries involved stipulate for orders for the necessary railway materials.\u201d\n\nThus finance capital, literally, one might say, spreads its net over all countries of the world. An important role in this is played by banks founded in the colonies and by their branches. German imperialists look with envy at the \u201cold\u201d colonial countries which have been particularly \u201csuccessful\u201d in providing for themselves in this respect. In , Great Britain had  colonial banks with , branches (in  there were  banks with , branches), France had  with  branches; Holland,  with  branches; and Germany had \u201conly\u201d  with  branches.[] The American capitalists, in their turn, are jealous of the English and German: \u201cIn South America,\u201d they complained in , \u201cfive German banks have forty branches and five British banks have seventy branches.... Britain and Germany have invested in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay in the last twenty-five years approximately four thousand million dollars, and as a result together enjoy  per cent of the total trade of these three countries.\u201d[]\n\nThe capital-exporting countries have divided the world among themselves in the figurative sense of the term. But finance capital has led to the actual division of the world.\n\nV. DIVISION OF THE WORLD AMONG CAPITALIST ASSOCIATIONS\nMonopolist capitalist associations, cartels, syndicates and trusts first divided the home market among themselves and obtained more or less complete possession of the industry of their own country. But under capitalism the home market is inevitably bound up with the foreign market. Capitalism long ago created a world market. As the export of capital increased, and as the foreign and colonial connections and \u201cspheres of influence\u201d of the big monopolist associations expanded in all ways, things \u201cnaturally\u201d gravitated towards an international agreement among these associations, and towards the formation of international cartels.\n\nThis is a new stage of world concentration of capital and production, incomparably higher than the preceding stages. Let us see how this supermonopoly develops.\n\nThe electrical industry is highly typical of the latest technical achievements and is most typical of capitalism at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. This industry has developed most in the two leaders of the new capitalist countries, the United States and Germany. In Germany, the crisis of  gave a particularly strong impetus to its concentration. During the crisis, the banks, which by that time had become fairly well merged with industry, enormously accelerated and intensified the ruin of relatively small firms and their absorption by the large ones. \u201cThe banks,\u201d writes Jeidels, \u201crefused a helping hand to the very firms in greatest need of capital, and brought on first a frenzied boom and then the hopeless failure of the companies which had not been connected with them closely enough.\u201d []\n\nAs a result, after , concentration in Germany progressed with giant strides. Up to  there had been seven or eight \u201cgroups\u201d in the electrical industry. Each consisted of several companies (altogether there were ) and each was backed by from  to  banks. Between  and  all these groups were merged into two, or one. The following diagram shows the process:\n\nGROUPS IN THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY\nPrior to : Felten & Lahmeyer; Guillaume\n|\n|\tUnion A.E.G.\n|\n|\tSiemens Schuckert\n& Halske & Co.\n|\tBerg-\nmann\n|\tKum-\nmer\n|\n|\n|\nFelten & Lahmeyer\n\n|_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\t|\nA.E.G.\n(G.E.C.)\n\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-|\n|\n|\nSiemens & Halske-\nSchuckert\n|_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\t|\n|\nBerg-\nman\n_-_-_-_-_-|\t|\n|\nFailed in\n\nBy :\tA.E.G. (G.E.C.) Siemens & Halske Schuckert\n \t(in close \"co-operation\" since )\nThe famous A.E.G. (General Electric Company), which grew up in this way, controls  to  companies (through the \u201cholding\u201d system), and a total capital of approximately , million marks. Of direct agencies abroad alone, it has thirty-four, of which twelve are joint-stock companies, in more than ten countries. As early as  the amount of capital invested abroad by the German electrical industry was estimated at  million marks. Of this sum,  million were invested in Russia. Needless to say, the A.E.G. is a huge \u201ccombine\u201d\u2014its manufacturing companies alone number no less than sixteen\u2014producing the most diverse articles, from cables and insulators to motor-cars and flying machines.\n\nBut concentration in Europe was also a component part of the process of concentration in America, which developed in the following way:\n\n \tGeneral Electric Company\nUnited States:\tThomas-Houston Co.\nestablishes a firm in\nEurope\nEdison Co. establishes in Eu-\nrope the French Edison Co.\nwhich transfers its patents to\nthe German firm\nGermany:\tUnion Electric Co.\tGeneral Electric Co. (A.E.G.)\nThus, two electrical \u201cgreat powers\u201d were formed: \u201cthere are no other electrical companies in the world completely independent of them,\u201d wrote Heinig in his article \u201cThe Path of the Electric Trust\u201d. An idea, although far from complete, of the turnover and the size of the enterprises of the two \u201ctrusts\u201d can be obtained from the following figures:\n\n \tTurnover\n(,\nmarks)\nNumber of\nemployees\tNet profits\n(,\nmarks)\nAmerica: General Electric Co:\n(G.E.C)\t \t \t \n\n\n\n\t,\n,\t.\n.\nGermany: General Electric Co:\n(A.E.G.)\n \t \t \n\n\t\n\t,\n,\t.\n.\nAnd then, in , the German and American trusts concluded an agreement by which they divided the world between them. Competition between them ceased. The American General Electric Company (G.E.C.) \u201cgot\u201d the United States and Canada. The German General Electric Company (A.E.G.) \u201cgot\u201d Germany, Austria, Russia, Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Turkey and the Balkans. Special agreements, naturally secret, were concluded regarding the penetration of \u201cdaughter companies\u201d into new branches of industry, into \u201cnew\u201d countries formally not yet allotted. The two trusts were to exchange inventions and experiments. []\n\nThe difficulty of competing against this trust, actually a single world-wide trust controlling a capital of several thousand million, with \u201cbranches\u201d, agencies, representatives, connections, etc., in every corner of the world, is self-evident. But the division of the world between two powerful trusts does not preclude redivision if the relation of forces changes as a result of uneven development, war, bankruptcy, etc.\n\nAn instructive example of an attempt at such a redivision, of the struggle for redivision, is provided by the oil industry.\n\n\u201cThe world oil market,\u201d wrote Jeidels in , \u201cis even today still divided between two great financial groups\u2014Rockefeller\u2019s American Standard Oil Co., and Rothschild and Nobel, the controlling interests of the Russian oilfields in Baku. The two groups are closely connected. But for several years five enemies have been threatening their monopoly\u201d [] : () the exhaustion of the American oilfields; () the competition of the firm of Mantashev of Baku; () the Austrian oilfields; () the Rumanian oilfields; () the overseas oilfields, particularly in the Dutch colonies (the extremely rich firms, Samuel, and Shell, also connected with British capital). The three last groups are connected with the big German banks, headed by the huge Deutsche Bank. These banks independently and systematically developed the oil industry in Rumania, for example, in order to have a foothold of their \u201cown\u201d. In , the foreign capital invested in the Rumanian oil industry was estimated at  million francs, of which  million was German capital. []\n\nA struggle began for the \u201cdivision of the world\u201d, as, in fact, it is called in economic literature. On the one hand, the Rockefeller \u201coil trust\u201d wanted to lay its hands on everything; it formed a \u201cdaughter company\u201d right in Holland, and bought up oilfields in the Dutch Indies, in order to strike at its principal enemy, the Anglo-Dutch Shell trust. On the other hand, the Deutsche Bank and the other German banks aimed at \u201cretaining\u201d Rumania \u201cfor themselves\u201d and at uniting her with Russia against Rockefeller. The latter possessed far more capital and an excellent system of oil transportation and distribution. The struggle had to end, and did end in , with the utter defeat of the Deutsche Bank, which was confronted with the alternative: either to liquidate its \u201coil interests\u201d and lose millions, or submit. It chose to submit, and concluded a very disadvantageous agreement with the \u201coil trust\u201d. The Deutsche Bank agreed \u201cnot to attempt anything which might injure American interests\u201d. Provision was made, however, for the annulment of the agreement in the event of Germany establishing a state oil monopoly.\n\nThen the \u201ccomedy of oil\u201d began. One of the German finance kings, von Gwinner, a director of the Deutsche Bank, through his private secretary, Stauss, launched a campaign for a state oil monopoly. The gigantic machine of the huge German bank and all its wide \u201cconnections\u201d were set in motion. The press bubbled over with \u201cpatriotic\u201d indignation against the \u201cyoke\u201d of the American trust, and, on March , , the Reichstag, by an almost unanimous vote, adopted a motion asking the government to introduce a bill for the establishment of an oil monopoly. The government seized upon this \u201cpopular\u201d idea, and the game of the Deutsche Bank, which hoped to cheat its American counterpart and improve its business by a state monopoly, appeared to have been won. The German oil magnates already saw visions of enormous profits, which would not be less than those of the Russian sugar refiners.... But, firstly, the big German banks quarrelled among themselves over the division of the spoils. The Disconto-Gesellschaft exposed the covetous aims of the Deutsche Bank; secondly, the government took fright at the prospect of a struggle with Rockefeller, for it was very doubtful whether Germany could be sure of obtaining oil from other sources (the Rumanian output was small); thirdly, just at that time the  credits of a thousand million marks were voted for Germany\u2019s war preparations. The oil monopoly project was postponed. The Rockefeller \u201coil trust\u201d came out of the struggle, for the time being, victorious.\n\nThe Berlin review, Die Bank, wrote in this connection that Germany could fight the oil trust only by establishing an electricity monopoly and by converting water-power into cheap electricity. \u201cBut,\u201d the author added, \u201cthe electricity monopoly will come when the producers need it, that is to say, when the next great crash in the electrical industry is imminent, and when the gigantic, expensive power stations now being put up at great cost everywhere by private electrical concerns, which are already obtaining certain franchises from towns, from states, etc., can no longer work at a profit. Water-power will then have to be used. But it will be impossible to convert it into cheap electricity at state expense; it will also have to be handed over to a \u2018private monopoly controlled by the state\u2019, because private industry has already concluded a number of contracts and has stipulated for heavy compensation.... So it was with the nitrate monopoly, so it is with the oil monopoly, so it will be with the electric power monopoly. It is time our state socialists, who allow themselves to be blinded by a beautiful principle, understood, at last, that in Germany the monopolies have never pursued the aim, nor have they had the result, of benefiting the consumer, or even of handing over to the state part of the promoter\u2019s profits; they have served only to facilitate, at the expense of the state, the recovery of private industries which were on the verge of bankruptcy. []\n\nSuch are the valuable admissions which the German bourgeois economists are forced to make. We see plainly here how private and state monopolies are interwoven in the epoch of finance capital; how both are but separate links in the imperialist struggle between the big monopolists for the division of the world.\n\nIn merchant shipping, the tremendous development of concentration has ended also in the division of the world. In Germany two powerful companies have come to the fore: the Hamburg-Amerika and the Norddeutscher Lloyd, each having a capital of  million marks (in stocks and bonds) and possessing shipping tonnage to the value of  to  million marks. On the other hand, in America, on January , , the International Mercantile Marine Co., known as the Morgan trust, was formed; it united nine American and British steamship companies, and possessed a capital of  million dollars ( million marks). As early as , the German giants and this American-British trust concluded an agreement to divide the world with a consequent division of profits. The German companies undertook not to compete in the Anglo-American traffic. Which ports were to be \u201callotted\u201d to each was precisely stipulated; a joint committee of control was set up, etc. This agreement was concluded for twenty years, with the prudent provision for its annulment in the event of war. []\n\nExtremely instructive also is the story of the formation of the International Rail Cartel. The first attempt of the British, Belgian and German rail manufacturers to form such a cartel was made as early as , during a severe industrial depression. The manufacturers agreed not to compete with one another in the home markets of the countries involved, and they divided the foreign markets in the following quotas: Great Britain,  per cent; Germany,  per cent; Belgium,  per cent. India was reserved entirely for Great Britain. Joint war was declared against a British firm which remained outside the cartel, the cost of which was met by a percentage levy on all sales. But in  the cartel collapsed when two British firms retired from it. It is characteristic that agreement could not be achieved during subsequent boom periods.\n\nAt the beginning of , the German steel syndicate was formed. In November , the International Rail Cartel was revived, with the following quotas: Britain, . per cent; Germany, . per cent; Belgium, . per cent. France came in later and received . per cent, . per cent and . per cent in the first, second and third year respectively, over and above the  per cent limit, i.e., out of a total of . per cent, etc. In , the United States Steel Corporation entered the cartel; then Austria and Spain. \u201cAt the present time,\u201d wrote Vogelstein in , \u201cthe division of the world is complete, and the big consumers, primarily the state railways\u2014since the world has been parcelled out without consideration for their interests\u2014can now dwell like the poet in the heavens of Jupiter.\u201d []\n\nLet me also mention the International Zinc Syndicate which was established in  and which precisely apportioned output among five groups of factories: German, Belgian, French, Spanish and British; and also the International Dynamite Trust, which, Liefmann says, is \u201cquite a modern, close alliance of all the German explosives manufacturers who, with the French and American dynamite manufacturers, organised in a similar manner, have divided the whole world among themselves, so to speak\u201d. []\n\nLiefmann calculated that in  there were altogether about forty international cartels in which Germany had a share, while in  there were about a hundred.\n\nCertain bourgeois writers (now joined by Karl Kautsky, who has completely abandoned the Marxist position he had held, for example, in ) have expressed the opinion that international cartels, being one of the most striking expressions of the internationalisation of capital, give the hope of peace among nations under capitalism. Theoretically, this opinion is absolutely absurd, while in practice it is sophistry and a dishonest defence of the worst opportunism. International cartels show to what point capitalist monopolies have developed, and the object of the struggle between the various capitalist associations. This last circumstance is the most important; it alone shows us the historico-economic meaning of what is taking place; for the forms of the struggle may and do constantly change in accordance with varying, relatively specific and temporary causes, but the substance of the struggle, its class content, positively cannot change while classes exist. Naturally, it is in the interests of, for example, the German bourgeoisie, to whose side Kautsky has in effect gone over in his theoretical arguments (I shall deal with this later), to obscure the substance of the present economic struggle (the division of the world) and to emphasise now this and now another form of the struggle. Kautsky makes the same mistake. Of course, we have in mind not only the German bourgeoisie, but the bourgeoisie all over the world. The capitalists divide the world, not out of any particular malice, but because the degree of concentration which has been reached forces them to adopt this method in order to obtain profits. And they divide it \u201cin proportion to capital\u201d, \u201cin proportion to strength\u201d, because there cannot be any other method of division under commodity production and capitalism. But strength varies with the degree of economic and political development. In order to understand what is taking place, it is necessary to know what questions are settled by the changes in strength. The question as to whether these changes are \u201cpurely\u201d economic or non-economic (e.g., military) is a secondary one, which cannot in the least affect fundamental views on the latest epoch of capitalism. To substitute the question of the form of the struggle and agreements (today peaceful, tomorrow warlike, the next day warlike again) for the question of the substance of the struggle and agreements between capitalist associations is to sink to the role of a sophist.\n\nThe epoch of the latest stage of capitalism shows us that certain relations between capitalist associations grow up, based on the economic division of the world; while parallel to and in connection with it, certain relations grow up between political alliances, between states, on the basis of the territorial division of the world, of the struggle for colonies, of the \u201cstruggle for spheres of influence\u201d.\nVI. DIVISION OF THE WORLD AMONG THE GREAT POWERS\nIn his book, on \u201cthe territorial development of the European colonies\u201d, A. Supan, [] the geographer, gives the following brief summary of this development at the end of the nineteenth century:\n\nPERCENTAGE OF TERRITORY BELONGING TO THE EUROPEAN\nCOLONIAL POWERS\n(Including the United States)\n \t\t\tIncrease or\ndecrease\nAfrica..........\t.\t.\t+.\nPolynesia....\t.\t.\t+.\nAsia............\t.\t.\t+.\nAustralia.....\t.\t.\t\u2014\nAmerica......\t.\t.\t-.\n\u201cThe characteristic feature of this period,\u201d he concludes, \u201cis, therefore, the division of Africa and Polynesia.\u201d As there are no unoccupied territories\u2014that is, territories that do not belong to any state in Asia and America, it is necessary to amplify Supan\u2019s conclusion and say that the characteristic feature of the period under review is the final partitioning of the globe\u2014final, not in the sense that repartition is impossible; on the contrary, repartitions are possible and inevitable\u2014but in the sense that the colonial policy of the capitalist countries has completed the seizure of the unoccupied territories on our planet. For the first time the world is completely divided up, so that in the future only redivision is possible, i.e., territories can only pass from one \u201cowner\u201d to another, instead of passing as ownerless territory to an owner\n\nHence, we are living in a peculiar epoch of world colonial policy, which is most closely connected with the \u201clatest stage in the development of capitalism\u201d, with finance capital. For this reason, it is essential first of all to deal in greater detail with the facts, in order to ascertain as exactly as possible what distinguishes this epoch from those preceding it, and what the present situation is. In the first place, two questions of fact arise here: is an intensification of colonial policy, a sharpening of the struggle for colonies, observed precisely in the epoch of finance capital? And how, in this respect, is the world divided at the present time?\n\nThe American writer, Morris, in his book on the history of colonisation, [] made an attempt to sum up the data on the colonial possessions of Great Britain, France and Germany during different periods of the nineteenth century. The following is a brief summary of the results he has obtained:\n\nCOLONIAL POSSESSIONS\nYear\tGreat Britain\tFrance\tGermany\nArea\n(,\nsq. m.)\tPop. (,)\tArea\n(,\nsq. m.)\tPop. (,)\tArea\n(,\nsq. m.)\tPop. (,)\n-\t?\t.\t.\t.\t\u2014\t\u2014\n\t.\t.\t.\t.\t\u2014\t\u2014\n\t.\t.\t.\t.\t\u2014\t\u2014\n\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nFor Great Britain, the period of the enormous expansion of colonial conquests was that between  and , and it was also very considerable in the last twenty years of the nineteenth century. For France and Germany this period falls precisely in these twenty years. We saw above that the development of premonopoly capitalism, of capitalism in which free competition was predominant, reached its limit in the s and s. We now see that it is precisely after that period that the tremendous \u201cboom\u201d in colonial conquests begins, and that the struggle for the territorial division of the world becomes extraordinarily sharp. It is beyond doubt, therefore, that capitalism\u2019s transition to the stage of monopoly capitalism, to finance capital, is connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partitioning of the world.\n\nHobson, in his work on imperialism, marks the years - as the epoch of intensified \u201cexpansion\u201d of the chief European states. According to his estimate, Great Britain during these years acquired ,, square miles of territory with ,, inhabitants; France, ,, square miles with ,,; Germany, ,, square miles with ,,; Belgium, , square miles with ,,; Portugal, , square miles with ,, inhabitants. The scramble for colonies by all the capitalist states at the end of the nineteenth century and particularly since the s is a commonly known fact in the history of diplomacy and of foreign policy.\n\nIn the most flourishing period of free competition in Great Britain, i.e., between  and , the leading British bourgeois politicians were opposed to colonial policy and were of the opinion that the liberation of the colonies, their complete separation from Britain, was inevitable and desirable. M. Beer, in an article, \u201cModern British Imperialism\u201d, [] published in , shows that in , Disraeli, a statesman who was generally inclined towards imperialism, declared: \u201cThe colonies are millstones round our necks.\u201d But at the end of the nineteenth century the British heroes of the hour were Cecil Rhodes and Joseph Chamberlain, who openly advocated imperialism and applied the imperialist policy in the most cynical manner!\n\nIt is not without interest to observe that even then these leading British bourgeois politicians saw the connection between what might be called the purely economic and the socio-political roots of modern imperialism. Chamberlain advocated imperialism as a \u201ctrue, wise and economical policy\u201d, and pointed particularly to the German, American and Belgian competition which Great Britain was encountering in the world market. Salvation lies in monopoly, said the capitalists as they formed cartels, syndicates and trusts. Salvation lies in monopoly, echoed the political leaders of the bourgeoisie, hastening to appropriate the parts of the world not yet shared out. And Cecil Rhodes, we are informed by his intimate friend, the journalist Stead, expressed his imperialist views to him in  in the following terms: \u201cI was in the East End of London (a working-class quarter) yesterday and attended a meeting of the unemployed. I listened to the wild speeches, which were just a cry for \u2018bread! bread!\u2019 and on my way home I pondered over the scene and I became more than ever convinced of the importance of imperialism.... My cherished idea is a solution for the social problem, i.e., in order to save the ,, inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines. The Empire, as I have always said, is a bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you must become imperialists. []\n\nThat was said in  by Cecil Rhodes, millionaire, a king of finance, the man who was mainly responsible for the Anglo-Boer War. True, his defence of imperialism is crude and cynical, but in substance it does not differ from the \u201ctheory\u201d advocated by Messrs. Maslov, S\u00fcdekum, Potresov, David, the founder of Russian Marxism and others. Cecil Rhodes was a somewhat more honest social-chauvinist....\n\nTo present as precise a picture as possible of the territorial division of the world and of the changes which have occurred during the last decades in this respect, I shall utilise the data furnished by Supan in the work already quoted on the colonial possessions of all the powers of the world. Supan takes the years  and ; I shall take the year \u2014a year very aptly selected, for it is precisely by that time that the pre-monopolist stage of development of West-European capitalism can be said to have been, in the main, completed\u2014and the year , and instead of Supan\u2019s figures I shall quote the more recent statistics of H\u00fcbner\u2019s Geographical and Statistical Tables. Supan gives figures only for colonies; I think it useful, in order to present a complete picture of the division of the world, to add brief data on non-colonial and semi-colonial countries, in which category I place Persia, China and Turkey: the first of these countries is already almost completely a colony, the second and third are becoming such.\n\nWe thus get the following result:\n\nCOLONIAL POSSESSIONS OF THE GREAT POWERS\n(, square kilometers and , inhabitants)\n \tColonies\tMetropolitan\ncountries\tTotal\n\t\t\t\nArea\tPop.\tArea\tPop.\tArea\tPop.\tArea\tPop.\nGreat\nBritain\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nRussia\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nFrance\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nGermany\t\u2014\t\u2014\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nUnited\nStates\t\u2014\t\u2014\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nJapan\t\u2014\t\u2014\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nTotal for  Great\nPowers\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\nColonies of other powers\n(Belgium, Holland, etc.)\t.\t.\nSemi-colonial countries\n(Persia, China, Turkey)\t.\t.\nOther countries\t.\t.\nTotal for the world\t.\t,.\nWe clearly see from these figures how \u201ccomplete\u201d was the partition of the world at the turn of the twentieth century. After  colonial possessions increased to enormous dimensions, by more than fifty per cent, from ,, to ,, square kilometres for the six biggest powers; the increase amounts to ,, square kilometres, fifty per cent more than the area of the metropolitan countries (,, square kilometres). In  three powers had no colonies, and a fourth, France, had scarcely any. By  these four powers had acquired colonies with an area of ,, square kilometres, i.e., about half as much again as the area of Europe, with a population of nearly ,,. The unevenness in the rate of expansion of colonial possessions is very great. If, for instance, we compare France, Germany and Japan, which do not differ very much in area and population, we see that the first has acquired almost three times as much colonial territory as the other two combined. In regard to finance capital, France, at the beginning of the period we are considering, was also, perhaps, several times richer than Germany and Japan put together. In addition to, and on the basis of, purely economic conditions, geographical and other conditions also affect the dimensions of colonial possessions. However strong the process of levelling the world, of levelling the economic and living conditions in different countries, may have been in the past decades as a result of the pressure of large-scale industry, exchange and finance capital, considerable differences still remain; and among the six countries mentioned we see, firstly, young capitalist countries (America, Germany, Japan) whose progress has been extraordinarily rapid; secondly, countries with an old capitalist development (France and Great Britain), whose progress lately has been much slower than that of the previously mentioned countries, and thirdly, a country most backward economically (Russia), where modern capitalist imperialism is enmeshed, so to speak, in a particularly close network of pre-capitalist relations.\n\nAlongside the colonial possessions of the Great Powers, we have placed the small colonies of the small states, which are, so to speak, the next objects of a possible and probable \u201credivision\u201d of colonies. These small states mostly retain their colonies only because the big powers are torn by conflicting interests, friction, etc., which prevent them from coming to an agreement on the division of the spoils. As to the \u201csemi-colonial\u201d states, they provide an example of the transitional forms which are to be found in all spheres of nature and society. Finance capital is such a great, such a decisive, you might say, force in all economic and in all international relations, that it is capable of subjecting, and actually does subject, to itself even states enjoying the fullest political independence; we shall shortly see examples of this. Of course, finance capital finds most \u201cconvenient\u201d, and derives the greatest profit from, a form of subjection which involves the loss of the political independence of the subjected countries and peoples. In this respect, the semi-colonial countries provide a typical example of the \u201cmiddle stage\u201d. It is natural that the struggle for these semidependent countries should have become particularly bitter in the epoch of finance capital, when the rest of the world has already been divided up.\n\nColonial policy and imperialism existed before the latest stage of capitalism, and even before capitalism. Rome, founded on slavery, pursued a colonial policy and practised imperialism. But \u201cgeneral\u201d disquisitions on imperialism, which ignore, or put into the background, the fundamental difference between socio-economic formations, inevitably turn into the most vapid banality or bragging, like the comparison: \u201cGreater Rome and Greater Britain.\u201d [] Even the capitalist colonial policy of previous stages of capitalism is essentially different from the colonial policy of finance capital.\n\nThe principal feature of the latest stage of capitalism is the domination of monopolist associations of big employers. These monopolies are most firmly established when all the sources of raw materials are captured by one group, and we have seen with what zeal the international capitalist associations exert every effort to deprive their rivals of all opportunity of competing, to buy up, for example, ironfields, oilfields, etc. Colonial possession alone gives the monopolies complete guarantee against all contingencies in the struggle against competitors, including the case of the adversary wanting to be protected by a law establishing a state monopoly. The more capitalism is developed, the more strongly the shortage of raw materials is felt, the more intense the competition and the hunt for sources of raw materials throughout the whole world, the more desperate the struggle for the acquisition of colonies.\n\n\u201cIt may be asserted,\u201d writes Schilder, \u201calthough it may sound paradoxical to some, that in the more or less foreseeable future the growth of the urban and industrial population is more likely to be hindered by a shortage of raw materials for industry than by a shortage of food.\u201d For example, there is a growing shortage of timber\u2014the price of which is steadily rising\u2014of leather, and of raw materials for the textile industry. \u201cAssociations of manufacturers are making efforts to create an equilibrium between agriculture and industry in the whole of world economy; as an example of this we might mention the International Federation of Cotton Spinners\u2019 Associations in several of the most important industrial countries, founded in , and the European Federation of Flax Spinners\u2019 Associations, founded on the same model in .\u201d []\n\nOf course, the bourgeois reformists, and among them particularly the present-day adherents of Kautsky, try to belittle the importance of facts of this kind by arguing that raw materials \u201ccould be\u201d obtained in the open market without a \u201ccostly and dangerous\u201d colonial policy; and that the supply of raw materials \u201ccould be\u201d increased enormously by \u201csimply\u201d improving conditions in agriculture in general. But such arguments become an apology for imperialism, an attempt to paint it in bright colours, because they ignore the principal feature of the latest stage of capitalism: monopolies. The free market is becoming more and more a thing of the past; monopolist syndicates and trusts are restricting it with every passing day, and \u201csimply\u201d improving conditions in agriculture means improving the conditions of the masses, raising wages and reducing profits. Where, except in the imagination of sentimental reformists, are there any trusts capable of concerning themselves with the condition of the masses instead of the conquest of colonies?\n\nFinance capital is interested not only in the already discovered sources of raw materials but also in potential sources, because present-day technical development is extremely rapid, and land which is useless today may be improved tomorrow if new methods are devised (to this end a big bank can equip a special expedition of engineers, agricultural experts, etc.), and if large amounts of capital are invested. This also applies to prospecting for minerals, to new methods of processing up and utilising raw materials, etc., etc. Hence, the inevitable striving of finance capital to enlarge its spheres of influence and even its actual territory. In the same way that the trusts capitalise their property at two or three times its value, taking into account its \u201cpotential\u201d (and not actual) profits and the further results of monopoly, so finance capital in general strives to seize the largest possible amount of land of all kinds in all places, and by every means, taking into account potential sources of raw materials and fearing to be left behind in the fierce struggle for the last remnants of independent territory, or for the repartition of those territories that have been already divided.\n\nThe British capitalists are exerting every effort to develop cotton growing in their colony, Egypt (in , out of ,, hectares of land under cultivation, ,, or more than one-fourth, were under cotton); the Russians are doing the same in their colony, Turkestan, because in this way they will be in a better position to defeat their foreign competitors, to monopolise the sources of raw materials and form a more economical and profitable textile trust in which all the processes of cotton production and manufacturing will be \u201ccombined\u201d and concentrated in the hands of one set of owners.\n\nThe interests pursued in exporting capital also give an impetus to the conquest of colonies, for in the colonial market it is easier to employ monopoly methods (and sometimes they are the only methods that can be employed) to eliminate competition, to ensure supplies, to secure the necessary \u201cconnections\u201d, etc.\n\nThe non-economic superstructure which grows up on the basis of finance capital, its politics and its ideology, stimulates the striving for colonial conquest. \u201cFinance capital does not want liberty, it wants domination,\u201d as Hilferding very truly says. And a French bourgeois writer, developing and supplementing, as it were, the ideas of Cecil Rhodes quoted above,[] writes that social causes should be added to the economic causes of modern colonial policy: \u201cOwing to the growing complexities of life and the difficulties which weigh not only on the masses of the workers, but also on the middle classes, \u2018impatience, irritation and hatred are accumulating in all the countries of the old civilisation and are becoming a menace to public order; the energy which is being hurled out of the definite class channel must be given employment abroad in order to avert an explosion at home\u2019.\u201d []\n\nSince we are speaking of colonial policy in the epoch of capitalist imperialism, it must be observed that finance capital and its foreign policy, which is the struggle of the great powers for the economic and political division of the world, give rise to a number of transitional forms of state dependence. Not only are the two main groups of countries, those owning colonies, and the colonies themselves, but also the diverse forms of dependent countries which, politically, are formally independent, but in fact, are enmeshed in the net of financial and diplomatic dependence, typical of this epoch. We have already referred to one form of dependence\u2014the semi-colony. An example of another is provided by Argentina.\n\n\u201cSouth America, and especially Argentina,\u201d writes Schulze-Gaevernitz in his work on British imperialism, \u201cis so dependent financially on London that it ought to be described as almost a British commercial colony.\u201d [] Basing himself on the reports of the Austro-Hungarian Consul at Buenos Aires for , Schilder estimated the amount of British capital invested in Argentina at , million francs. It is not difficult to imagine what strong connections British finance capital (and its faithful \u201cfriend\u201d, diplomacy) thereby acquires with the Argentine bourgeoisie, with the circles that control the whole of that country\u2019s economic and political life.\n\nA somewhat different form of financial and diplomatic dependence, accompanied by political independence, is presented by Portugal. Portugal is an independent sovereign state, but actually, for more than two hundred years, since the war of the Spanish Succession (-), it has been a British protectorate. Great Britain has protected Portugal and her colonies in order to fortify her own positions in the fight against her rivals, Spain and France. In return Great Britain has received commercial privileges, preferential conditions for importing goods and especially capital into Portugal and the Portuguese colonies, the right to use the ports and islands of Portugal, her telegraph cables, etc., etc. [] Relations of this kind have always existed between big and little states, but in the epoch of capitalist imperialism they become a general system, they form part of the sum total of \u201cdivide the world\u201d relations and become links in the chain of operations of world finance capital.\n\nIn order to finish with the question of the division of the world, I must make the following additional observation. This question was raised quite openly and definitely not only in American literature after the Spanish-American War, and in English literature after the Anglo-Boer War, at the very end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth; not only has German literature, which has \u201cmost jealously\u201d watched \u201cBritish imperialism\u201d, systematically given its appraisal of this fact. This question has also been raised in French bourgeois literature as definitely and broadly as is thinkable from the bourgeois point of view. Let me quote Driault, the historian, who, in his book, Political and Social Problems at the End of the Nineteenth Century, in the chapter \u201cThe Great Powers and the Division of the World\u201d, wrote the following: \u201cDuring the past few years, all the free territory of the globe, with the exception of China, has been occupied by the powers of Europe and North America. This has already brought about several conflicts and shifts of spheres of influence, and these foreshadow more terrible upheavals in the near future. For it is necessary to make haste. The nations which have not yet made provision for themselves run the risk of never receiving their share and never participating in the tremendous exploitation of the globe which will be one of the most essential features of the next century (i.e., the twentieth). That is why all Europe and America have lately been afflicted with the fever of colonial expansion, of \u2018imperialism\u2019, that most noteworthy feature of the end of the nineteenth century.\u201d And the author added: \u201cIn this partition of the world, in this furious hunt for the treasures and the big markets of the globe, the relative strength of the empires founded in this nineteenth century is totally out of proportion to the place occupied in Europe by the nations which founded them. The dominant powers in Europe, the arbiters of her destiny, are not equally preponderant in the whole world. And, as colonial might, the hope of controlling as yet unassessed wealth, will evidently react upon the relative strength of the European powers, the colonial question\u2014\u201cimperialism\u201d, if you will\u2014which has already modified the political conditions of Europe itself, will modify them more and more.\u201d []\n\nVII. IMPERIALISM AS A SPECIAL STAGE OF CAPITALISM\nWe must now try to sum up, to draw together the threads of what has been said above on the subject of imperialism. Imperialism emerged as the development and direct continuation of the fundamental characteristics of capitalism in general. But capitalism only became capitalist imperialism at a definite and very high stage of its development, when certain of its fundamental characteristics began to change into their opposites, when the features of the epoch of transition from capitalism to a higher social and economic system had taken shape and revealed themselves in all spheres. Economically, the main thing in this process is the displacement of capitalist free competition by capitalist monopoly. Free competition is the basic feature of capitalism, and of commodity production generally; monopoly is the exact opposite of free competition, but we have seen the latter being transformed into monopoly before our eyes, creating large-scale industry and forcing out small industry, replacing large-scale by still larger-scale industry, and carrying concentration of production and capital to the point where out of it has grown and is growing monopoly: cartels, syndicates and trusts, and merging with them, the capital of a dozen or so banks, which manipulate thousands of millions. At the same time the monopolies, which have grown out of free competition, do not eliminate the latter, but exist above it and alongside it, and thereby give rise to a number of very acute, intense antagonisms, frictions and conflicts. Monopoly is the transition from capitalism to a higher system.\n\nIf it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of imperialism we should have to say that imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism. Such a definition would include what is most important, for, on the one hand, finance capital is the bank capital of a few very big monopolist banks, merged with the capital of the monopolist associations of industrialists; and, on the other hand, the division of the world is the transition from a colonial policy which has extended without hindrance to territories unseized by any capitalist power, to a colonial policy of monopolist possession of the territory of the world, which has been completely divided up.\n\nBut very brief definitions, although convenient, for they sum up the main points, are nevertheless inadequate, since we have to deduce from them some especially important features of the phenomenon that has to be defined. And so, without forgetting the conditional and relative value of all definitions in general, which can never embrace all the concatenations of a phenomenon in its full development, we must give a definition of imperialism that will include the following five of its basic features:\n\n() the concentration of production and capital has developed to such a high stage that it has created monopolies which play a decisive role in economic life; () the merging of bank capital with industrial capital, and the creation, on the basis of this \u201cfinance capital\u201d, of a financial oligarchy; () the export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities acquires exceptional importance; () the formation of international monopolist capitalist associations which share the world among themselves, and () the territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed. Imperialism is capitalism at that stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance capital is established; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun, in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed.\n\nWe shall see later that imperialism can and must be defined differently if we bear in mind not only the basic, purely economic concepts\u2014to which the above definition is limited\u2014but also the historical place of this stage of capitalism in relation to capitalism in general, or the relation between imperialism and the two main trends in the working-class movement. The thing to be noted at this point is that imperialism, as interpreted above, undoubtedly represents a special stage in the development of capitalism. To enable the reader to obtain the most wellgrounded idea of imperialism, I deliberately tried to quote as extensively as possible bourgeois economists who have to admit the particularly incontrovertible facts concerning the latest stage of capitalist economy. With the same object in view, I have quoted detailed statistics which enable one to see to what degree bank capital, etc., has grown, in what precisely the transformation of quantity into quality, of developed capitalism into imperialism, was expressed. Needless to say, of course, all boundaries in nature and in society are conventional and changeable, and it would be absurd to argue, for example, about the particular year or decade in which imperialism \u201cdefinitely\u201d became established.\n\nIn the matter of defining imperialism, however, we have to enter into controversy, primarily, with Karl Kautsky, the principal Marxist theoretician of the epoch of the so-called Second International\u2014that is, of the twenty-five years between  and . The fundamental ideas expressed in our definition of imperialism were very resolutely attacked by Kautsky in , and even in November , when he said that imperialism must not be regarded as a \u201cphase\u201d or stage of economy, but as a policy, a definite policy \u201cpreferred\u201d by finance capital; that imperialism must not be \u201cidentified\u201d with \u201cpresent-day capitalism\u201d; that if imperialism is to be understood to mean \u201call the phenomena of present-day capitalism\u201d\u2014cartels, protection, the domination of the financiers, and colonial policy\u2014then the question as to whether imperialism is necessary to capitalism becomes reduced to the \u201cflattest tautology\u201d, because, in that case, \u201cimperialism is naturally a vital necessity for capitalism\u201d, and so on. The best way to present Kautsky\u2019s idea is to quote his own definition of imperialism, which is diametrically opposed to the substance of the ideas which I have set forth (for the objections coming from the camp of the German Marxists, who have been advocating similar ideas for many years already, have been long known to Kautsky as the objections of a definite trend in Marxism).\n\nKautsky\u2019s definition is as follows:\n\n\u201cImperialism is a product of highly developed industrial capitalism. It consists in the striving of every industrial capitalist nation to bring under its control or to annex all large areas of agrarian [Kautsky\u2019s italics] territory, irrespective of what nations inhabit it.\u201d []\n\nThis definition is of no use at all because it one-sidedly, i.e., arbitrarily, singles out only the national question (although the latter is extremely important in itself as well as in its relation to imperialism), it arbitrarily and inaccurately connects this question only with industrial capital in the countries which annex other nations, and in an equally arbitrary and inaccurate manner pushes into the forefront the annexation of agrarian regions.\n\nImperialism is a striving for annexations\u2014this is what the political part of Kautsky\u2019s definition amounts to. It is correct, but very incomplete, for politically, imperialism is, in general, a striving towards violence and reaction. For the moment, however, we are interested in the economic aspect of the question, which Kautsky himself introduced into his definition. The inaccuracies in Kautsky\u2019s definition are glaring. The characteristic feature of imperialism is not industrial but finance capital. It is not an accident that in France it was precisely the extraordinarily rapid development of finance capital, and the weakening of industrial capital, that from the eighties onwards gave rise to the extreme intensification of annexationist (colonial) policy. The characteristic feature of imperialism is precisely that it strives to annex not only agrarian territories, but even most highly industrialised regions (German appetite for Belgium; French appetite for Lorraine), because () the fact that the world is already partitioned obliges those contemplating a redivision to reach out for every kind of territory, and () an essential feature of imperialism is the rivalry between several great powers in the striving for hegemony, i.e., for the conquest of territory, not so much directly for themselves as to weaken the adversary and undermine his hegemony. (Belgium is particularly important for Germany as a base for operations against Britain; Britain needs Baghdad as a base for operations against Germany, etc.)\n\nKautsky refers especially\u2014and repeatedly\u2014to English writers who, lie alleges, have given a purely political meaning to the word \u201cimperialism\u201d in the sense that he, Kautsky, understands it. We take up the work by the English writer Hobson, Imperialism, which appeared in , and there we read:\n\n\u201cThe new imperialism differs from the older, first, in substituting for the ambition of a single growing empire the theory and the practice of competing empires, each motivated by similar lusts of political aggrandisement and commercial gain; secondly, in the dominance of financial or investing over mercantile interests.\u201d []\n\nWe see that Kautsky is absolutely wrong in referring to English writers generally (unless lie meant the vulgar English imperialists, or the avowed apologists for imperialism). We see that Kautsky, while claiming that he continues to advocate Marxism, as a matter of fact takes a step backward compared with the social-liberal Hobson, who more correctly takes into account two \u201chistorically concrete\u201d (Kautsky\u2019s definition is a mockery of historical concreteness!) features of modern imperialism: () the competition between several imperialisms, and () the predominance of the financier over the merchant. If it is chiefly a question of the annexation of agrarian countries by industrial countries, then the role of the merchant is put in the forefront.\n\nKautsky\u2019s definition is not only wrong and un-Marxist. It serves as a basis for a whole system of views which signify a rupture with Marxist theory and Marxist practice all along the line. I shall refer to this later. The argument about words which Kautsky raises as to whether the latest stage of capitalism should be called imperialism or the stage of finance capital is not worth serious attention. Call it what you will, it makes no difference. The essence of the matter is that Kautsky detaches the politics of imperialism from its economics, speaks of annexations as being a policy \u201cpreferred\u201d by finance capital, and opposes to it another bourgeois policy which, he alleges, is possible on this very same basis of finance capital. It follows, then, that monopolies in the economy are compatible with non-monopolistic, non-violent, non-annexationist methods in politics. It follows, then, that the territorial division of the world, which was completed during this very epoch of finance capital, and which constitutes the basis of the present peculiar forms of rivalry between the biggest capitalist states, is compatible with a non-imperialist policy. The result is a slurring-over and a blunting of the most profound contradictions of the latest stage of capitalism, instead of an exposure of their depth; the result is bourgeois reformism instead of Marxism.\n\nKautsky enters into controversy with the German apologist of imperialism and annexations, Cunow, who clumsily and cynically argues that imperialism is present-day capitalism; the development of capitalism is inevitable and progressive; therefore imperialism is progressive; therefore, we should grovel before it and glorify it! This is something like the caricature of the Russian Marxists which the Narodniks drew in -. They argued: if the Marxists believe that capitalism is inevitable in Russia, that it is progressive, then they ought to open a tavern and begin to implant capitalism! Kautsky\u2019s reply to Cunow is as follows: imperialism is not present-day capitalism; it is only one of the forms of the policy of present-day capitalism. This policy we can and should fight, fight imperialism, annexations, etc.\n\nThe reply seems quite plausible, but in effect it is a more subtle and more disguised (and therefore more dangerous) advocacy of conciliation with imperialism, because a \u201cfight\u201d against the policy of the trusts and banks that does not affect the economic basis of the trusts and banks is mere bourgeois reformism and pacifism, the benevolent and innocent expression of pious wishes. Evasion of existing contradictions, forgetting the most important of them, instead of revealing their full depth\u2014such is Kautsky\u2019s theory, which has nothing in common with Marxism. Naturally, such a \u201ctheory\u201d can only serve the purpose of advocating unity with the Cunows!\n\n\u201cFrom the purely economic point of view,\u201d writes Kautsky, \u201cit is not impossible that capitalism will yet go through a new phase, that of the extension of the policy of the cartels to foreign policy, the phase of ultra-imperialism,\u201d [] i.e., of a superimperialism, of a union of the imperialisms of the whole world and not struggles among them, a phase when wars shall cease under capitalism, a phase of \u201cthe joint exploitation of the world by internationally united finance capital\u201d. []\n\nWe shall have to deal with this \u201ctheory of ultra-imperialism\u201d later on in order to show in detail how decisively and completely it breaks with Marxism. At present, in keeping with the general plan of the present work, we must examine the exact economic data on this question. \u201cFrom the purely economic point of view\u201d, is \u201cultra-imperialism\u201d possible, or is it ultra-nonsense?\n\nIf the purely economic point of view is meant to be a \u201cpure\u201d abstraction, then all that can be said reduces itself to the following proposition: development is proceeding towards monopolies, hence, towards a single world monopoly, towards a single world trust. This is indisputable, but it is also as completely meaningless as is the statement that \u201cdevelopment is proceeding\u201d towards the manufacture of foodstuffs in laboratories. In this sense the \u201ctheory\u201d of ultra-imperialism is no less absurd than a \u201ctheory of ultra-agriculture\u201d would be.\n\nIf, however, we are discussing the \u201cpurely economic\u201d conditions of the epoch of finance capital as a historically concrete epoch which began at the turn of the twentieth century, then the best reply that one can make to the lifeless abstractions of \u201cultraimperialism\u201d (which serve exclusively a most reactionary aim: that of diverting attention from the depth of existing antagonisms) is to contrast them with the concrete economic realities of the present-day world economy. Kautsky\u2019s utterly meaningless talk about ultra-imperialism encourages, among other things, that profoundly mistaken idea which only brings grist to the mill of the apologists of imperialism, i.e., that the rule of finance capital lessens the unevenness and contradictions inherent in the world economy, whereas in reality it increases them.\n\nR. Calwer, in his little book, An Introduction to the World Economy, [] made an attempt to summarise the main, purely economic, data that enable one to obtain a concrete picture of the internal relations of the world economy at the turn of the twentieth century. He divides the world into five \u201cmain economic areas\u201d, as follows: () Central Europe (the whole of Europe with the exception of Russia and Great Britain); () Great Britain; () Russia; () Eastern Asia; () America; he includes the colonies in the \u201careas\u201d of the states to which they belong and \u201cleaves aside\u201d a few countries not distributed according to areas, such as Persia, Afghanistan, and Arabia in Asia, Morocco and Abyssinia in Africa, etc.\n\nHere is a brief summary of the economic data he quotes on these regions.\n\nPrincipal\neconomic\nareas\tArea\tPop.\tTransport\tTrade\tIndustry\nMillion sq.\nmiles\tMillions\tRailways\n(thou. km)\tMercantile\nfleet (mill-\nions tons)\tImports,\nexports\n(thous-million\nmarks)\tOutput\t \nOf coal (mill.\ntons)\tOf pig iron\n(mill. tons)\tNumber\nof cotton\nspindles\n(millions)\n) Central\nEurope\t.\n(.)\t\n()\t\t\t\t\t\t\n) Britain\t.\n(.)\t\n()\t\t\t\t\t\t\n) Russia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n) Eastern Asia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.\t\n) America\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNOTE: The figures in parentheses show the area and population of the colonies.\n\nWe see three areas of highly developed capitalism (high development of means of transport, of trade and of industry): the Central European, the British and the American areas. Among these are three states which dominate the world: Germany, Great Britain, and the United States. Imperialist rivalry and the struggle between these countries have become extremely keen because Germany has only an insignificant area and few colonies; the creation of \u201cCentral Europe\u201d is still a matter for the future, it is being born in the midst of a desperate struggle. For the moment the distinctive feature of the whole of Europe is political disunity. In the British and American areas, on the other hand, political concentration is very highly developed, but there is a vast disparity between the immense colonies of the one and the insignificant colonies of the other. In the colonies, however, capitalism is only beginning to develop. The struggle for South America is becoming more and more acute.\n\nThere are two areas where capitalism is little developed: Russia and Eastern Asia. In the former, the population is extremely sparse, in the latter it is extremely dense; in the former political concentration is high, in the latter it does not exist. The partitioning of China is only just beginning, and the struggle for it between Japan, the U.S., etc., is continually gaining in intensity.\n\nCompare this reality\u2014the vast diversity of economic and political conditions, the extreme disparity in the rate of development of the various countries, etc., and the violent struggles among the imperialist states\u2014with Kautsky\u2019s silly little fable about \u201cpeaceful\u201d ultra-imperialism. Is this not the reactionary attempt of a frightened philistine to hide from stern reality? Are not the international cartels which Kautsky imagines are the embryos of \u201cultra-imperialism\u201d (in the same way as one \u201ccan\u201d describe the manufacture of tablets in a laboratory as ultra-agriculture in embryo) an example of the division and the redivision of the world, the transition from peaceful division to non-peaceful division and vice versa? Is not American and other finance capital, which divided the whole world peacefully with Germany\u2019s participation in, for example, the international rail syndicate, or in the international mercantile shipping trust, now engaged in redividing the world on the basis of a new relation of forces that is being changed by methods anything but peaceful?\n\nFinance capital and the trusts do not diminish but increase the differences in the rate of growth of the various parts of the world economy. Once the relation of forces is changed, what other solution of the contradictions can be found under capitalism than that of force? Railway statistics [] provide remarkably exact data on the different rates of growth of capitalism and finance capital in world economy. In the last decades of imperialist development, the total length of railways has changed as follows:\n\n \tRailways ( kilometers)\n\t\t+\nEurope\t\t \t\t \t+\t \nU.S.\t\t\t+\nAll colonies\t\t\t\t\t+\t+\nIndependent and semi-independent\nstates of Asia and America\t\t\t+\nTotal\t\t \t,\t \t \t \nThus, the development of railways has been most rapid in the colonies and in the independent (and semi-independent) states of Asia and America. Here, as we know, the finance capital of the four or five biggest capitalist states holds undisputed sway. Two hundred thousand kilometres of new railways in the colonies and in the other countries of Asia and America represent a capital of more than , million marks newly invested on particularly advantageous terms, with special guarantees of a good return and with profitable orders for steel works, etc., etc.\n\nCapitalism is growing with the greatest rapidity in the colonies and in overseas countries. Among the latter, new imperialist powers are emerging (e.g., Japan). The struggle among the world imperialisms is becoming more acute. The tribute levied by finance capital on the most profitable colonial and overseas enterprises is increasing. In the division of this \u201cbooty\u201d, an exceptionally large part goes to countries which do not always stand at the top of the list in the rapidity of the development of their productive forces. In the case of the biggest countries, together with their colonies, the total length of railways was as follows:\n\n \t( kilometres)\n\t\t \nU.S.\t\t\t+\nBritish Empire\t\t\t+\nRussia\t\t\t+\nGermany\t\t\t+\nFrance\t\t\t+\nTotal\t\t\t+\nThus, about  per cent of the total existing railways are concentrated in the hands of the five biggest powers. But the concentration of the ownership of these railways, the concentration of finance capital, is immeasurably greater since the French and British millionaires, for example, own an enormous amount of shares and bonds in American, Russian and other railways.\n\nThanks to her colonies, Great Britain has increased the length of \u201cher\u201d railways by , kilometres, four times as much as Germany. And yet, it is well known that the development of productive forces in Germany, and especially the development of the coal and iron industries, has been incomparably more rapid during this period than in Britain\u2014not to speak of France and Russia. In , Germany produced ,, tons of pig-iron and Great Britain produced ,, tons; in , Germany produced ,, tons and Great Britain, ,, tons. Germany, therefore, had an overwhelming superiority over Britain in this respect. [] The question is: what means other than war could there be under capitalism to overcome the disparity between the development of productive forces and the accumulation of capital on the one side, and the division of colonies and spheres of influence for finance capital on the other?\n\nVIII. PARASITISM AND DECAY OF CAPITALISM\nWe now have to examine yet another significant aspect of imperialism to which most of the discussions on the subject usually attach insufficient importance. One of the shortcomings of the Marxist Hilferding is that on this point he has taken a step backward compared with the non-Marxist Hobson. I refer to parasitism, which is characteristic of imperialism.\n\nAs we have seen, the deepest economic foundation of imperialism is monopoly. This is capitalist monopoly, i.e., monopoly which has grown out of capitalism and which exists in the general environment of capitalism, commodity production and competition, in permanent and insoluble contradiction to this general environment. Nevertheless, like all monopoly, it inevitably engenders a tendency of stagnation and decay. Since monopoly prices are established, even temporarily, the motive cause of technical and, consequently, of all other progress disappears to a certain extent and, further, the economic possibility arises of deliberately retarding technical progress. For instance, in America, a certain Owens invented a machine which revolutionised the manufacture of bottles. The German bottle-manufacturing cartel purchased Owens\u2019s patent, but pigeon-holed it, refrained from utilising it. Certainly, monopoly under capitalism can never completely, and for a very long period of time, eliminate competition in the world market (and this, by the by, is one of the reasons why the theory of ultra-imperialism is so absurd). Certainly, the possibility of reducing the cost of production and increasing profits by introducing technical improvements operates in the direction of change. But the tendency to stagnation and decay, which is characteristic of monopoly, continues to operate, and in some branches of industry, in some countries, for certain periods of time, it gains the upper hand.\n\nThe monopoly ownership of very extensive, rich or wellsituated colonies operates in the same direction.\n\nFurther, imperialism is an immense accumulation of money capital in a few countries, amounting, as we have seen, to ,-, million francs in securities. Hence the extraordinary growth of a class, or rather, of a stratum of rentiers, i.e., people who live by \u201cclipping coupons\u201d, who take no part in any enterprise whatever, whose profession is idleness. The export of capital, one of the most essential economic bases of imperialism, still more completely isolates the rentiers from production and sets the seal of parasitism on the whole country that lives by exploiting the labour of several overseas countries and colonies.\n\n\u201cIn ,\u201d writes Hobson, \u201cthe British capital invested abroad represented about  per cent of the total wealth of the United Kingdom.\u201d [] Let me remind the reader that by  this capital had increased about two and a half times. \u201cAggressive imperialism,\u201d says Hobson further on, \u201cwhich costs the tax-payer so dear, which is of so little value to the manufacturer and trader ... is a source of great gain to the investor.... The annual income Great Britain derives from commissions in her whole foreign and colonial trade, import and export, is estimated by Sir R.Giffen at \u00a3,, (nearly  million rubles] for , taken at  / per cent, upon a turnover of \u00a3,,.\u201d Great as this sum is, it cannot explain the aggressive imperialism of Great Britain, which is explained by the income of \u00a3 million to \u00a3 million from \u201cinvested\u201d capital, the income of the rentiers.\n\nThe income of the rentiers is five times greater than the income obtained from the foreign trade of the biggest \u201ctrading\u201d country in the world! This is the essence of imperialism and imperialist parasitism.\n\nFor that reason the term \u201crentier state\u201d (Rentnerstaat), or usurer state, is coming into common use in the economic literature that deals with imperialism. The world has become divided into a handful of usurer states and a vast majority of debtor states. \u201cAt the top of the list of foreign investments,\u201d says Schulze-Gaevernitz, \u201care those placed in politically dependent or allied countries: Great Britain grants loans to Egypt, Japan, China and South America. Her navy plays here the part of bailiff in case of necessity. Great Britain\u2019s political power protects her from the indignation of her debtors.\u201d [] Sartorius von Waltershausen in his book, The National Economic System of Capital Investments Abroad, cites Holland as the model \u201crentier state\u201d and points out that Great Britain and France are now becoming such. [] Schilder is of the opinion that five industrial states have become \u201cdefinitely pronounced creditor countries\u201d: Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. He does not include Holland in this list simply because she is \u201cindustrially little developed\u201d. [] The United States is a creditor only of the American countries.\n\n\u201cGreat Britain,\u201d says Schulze-Gaevernitz, \u201cis gradually becoming transformed from an industrial into a creditor state. Notwithstanding the absolute increase in industrial output and the export of manufactured goods, there is an increase in the relative importance of income from interest and dividends, issues of securities, commissions and speculation in the whole of the national economy. In my opinion it is precisely this that forms the economic basis of imperialist ascendancy. The creditor is more firmly attached to the debtor than the seller is to the buyer. [] In regard to Germany, A. Lansburgh, the publisher of the Berlin Die Bank, in , in an article entitled \u201cGermany\u2014a Rentier State\u201d, wrote the following: \u201cPeople in Germany are ready to sneer at the yearning to become rentiers that is observed in France. But they forget that as far as the bourgeoisie is concerned the situation in Germany is becoming more and more like that in France.\u201d [] -\n\nThe rentier state is a state of parasitic, decaying capitalism, and this circumstance cannot fail to influence all the socio-political conditions of the countries concerned, in general, and the two fundamental trends in the working-class movement, in particular. To demonstrate this in the clearest possible manner let me quote Hobson, who is a most reliable witness, since he cannot be suspected of leaning towards Marxist orthodoxy; on the other hand, he is an Englishman who is very well acquainted with the situation in the country which is richest in colonies, in finance capital, and in imperialist experience.\n\nWith the Anglo-Boer War fresh in his mind, Hobson describes the connection between imperialism and the interests of the \u201cfinanciers\u201d, their growing profits from contracts, supplies, etc., and writes: \u201cWhile the directors of this definitely parasitic policy are capitalists, the same motives appeal to special classes of the workers. In many towns most important trades are dependent upon government employment or contracts; the imperialism of the metal and shipbuilding centres is attributable in no small degree to this fact.\u201d Two sets of circumstances, in this writer\u2019s opinion, have weakened the old empires: () \u201ceconomic parasitism\u201d, and () the formation of armies recruited from subject peoples. \u201cThere is first the habit of economic parasitism, by which the ruling state has used its provinces, colonies, and dependencies in order to enrich its ruling class and to bribe its lower classes into acquiescence.\u201d And I shall add that the economic possibility of such bribery, whatever its form may be, requires high monopolist profits.\n\nAs for the second circumstance, Hobson writes: \u201cOne of the strangest symptoms of the blindness of imperialism is the reckless indifference with which Great Britain, France and other imperial nations are embarking on this perilous dependence. Great Britain has gone farthest. Most of the fighting by which we have won our Indian Empire has been done by natives; in India, as more recently in Egypt, great standing armies are placed under British commanders; almost all the fighting associated with our African dominions, except in the southern part, has been done for us by natives.\u201d\n\nHobson gives the following economic appraisal of the prospect of the partitioning of China: \u201cThe greater part of Western Europe might then assume the appearance and character already exhibited by tracts of country in the South of England, in the Riviera and in the tourist-ridden or residential parts of Italy and Switzerland, little clusters of wealthy aristocrats drawing dividends and pensions from the Far East, with a somewhat larger group of professional retainers and tradesmen and a larger body of personal servants and workers in the transport trade and in the final stages of production of the more perishable goods; all the main arterial industries would have disappeared, the staple foods and manufactures flowing in as tribute from Asia and Africa. . . . We have foreshadowed the possibility of even a larger alliance of Western states, a European federation of great powers which, so far from forwarding the cause of world civilisation, might introduce the gigantic peril of a Western parasitism, a group of advanced industrial nations, whose upper classes drew vast tribute from Asia and Africa, with which they supported great tame masses of retainers, no longer engaged in the staple industries of agriculture and manufacture, but kept in the performance of personal or minor industrial services under the control of a new financial aristocracy. Let those who would scout such a theory (it would be better to say: prospect) as undeserving of consideration examine the economic and social condition of districts in Southern England today which are already reduced to this condition, and reflect upon the vast extension of such a system which might be rendered feasible by the subjection of China to the economic control of similar groups of financiers, investors, and political and business officials, draining the greatest potential reservoir of profit the world has ever known, in order to consume it in Europe. The situation is far too complex, the play of world forces far too incalculable, to render this or any other single interpretation of the future very probable; but the influences which govern the imperialism of Western Europe today are moving in this direction, and, unless counteracted or diverted, make towards some such consummation.\u201d []\n\nThe author is quite right: if the forces of imperialism had not been counteracted they would have led precisely to what he has described. The significance of a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d in the present imperialist situation is correctly appraised. He should have added, however, that, also within the working-class movement, the opportunists, who are for the moment victorious in most countries, are \u201cworking\u201d systematically and undeviatingly in this very direction. Imperialism, which means the partitioning of the world, and the exploitation of other countries besides China, which means high monopoly profits for a handful of very rich countries, makes it economically possible to bribe the upper strata of the proletariat, and thereby fosters, gives shape to, and strengthens opportunism. We must not, however, lose sight of the forces which counteract imperialism in general, and opportunism in particular, and which, naturally, the social-liberal Hobson is unable to perceive.\n\nThe German opportunist, Gerhard Hildebrand, who was once expelled from the Party for defending imperialism, and who could today be a leader of the so-called \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d Party of Germany, supplements Hobson well by his advocacy of a \u201cUnited States of Western Europe\u201d (without Russia) for the purpose of \u201cjoint\u201d action ... against the African Negroes, against the \u201cgreat Islamic movement\u201d, for the maintenance of a \u201cpowerful army and navy\u201d, against a \u201cSino-Japanese coalition\u201d, [] etc.\n\nThe description of \u201cBritish imperialism\u201d in Schulze-Gaevernitz\u2019s book reveals the same parasitical traits. The national income of Great Britain approximately doubled from  to , while the income \u201cfrom abroad\u201d increased ninefold in the same period. While the \u201cmerit\u201d of imperialism is that it \u201ctrains the Negro to habits of industry\u201d (you cannot manage without coercion ... ), the \u201cdanger\u201d of imperialism lies in that \u201cEurope will shift the burden of physical toil\u2014first agricultural and mining, then the rougher work in industry\u2014on to the coloured races, and itself be content with the role of rentier, and in this way, perhaps, pave the way for the economic, and later, the political emancipation of the coloured races\u201d.\n\nAn increasing proportion of land in England is being taken out of cultivation and used for sport, for the diversion of the rich. As far as Scotland\u2014the most aristocratic place for hunting and other sports\u2014is concerned, it is said that \u201cit lives on its past and on Mr. Carnegie\u201d (the American multimillionaire). On horse racing and fox hunting alone England annually spends \u00a3,, (nearly  million rubles). The number of rentiers in England is about one million. The percentage of the productively employed population to the total population is declining:\n\n \tPopulation\nEngland and\nWales (,)\tWorkers in\nbasic industries\n(,)\tPer cent of\ntotal popula-\ntion\n.....\t.\t.\t\n.....\t.\t.\t\nAnd in speaking of the British working class the bourgeois student of \u201cBritish imperialism at the beginning of the twentieth century\u201d is obliged to distinguish systematically between the \u201cupper stratum\u201d of the workers and the \u201clower stratum of the proletariat proper\u201d. The upper stratum furnishes the bulk of the membership of co-operatives, of trade unions, of sporting clubs and of numerous religious sects. To this level is adapted the electoral system, which in Great Britain is still \u201csufficiently restricted to exclude the lower stratum of the proletariat proper\"! In order to present the condition of the British working class in a rosy light, only this upper stratum\u2014which constitutes a minority of the proletariat\u2014is usually spoken of. For instance, \u201cthe problem of unemployment is mainly a London problem and that of the lower proletarian stratum, to which the politicians attach little importance...\u201d [] He should have said: to which the bourgeois politicians and the \u201csocialist\u201d opportunists attach little importance.\n\nOne of the special features of imperialism connected with the facts I am describing, is the decline in emigration from imperialist countries and the increase in immigration into these countries from the more backward countries where lower wages are paid. As Hobson observes, emigration from Great Britain has been declining since . In that year the number of emigrants was ,, while in , the number was ,. Emigration from Germany reached the highest point between  and , with a total of ,, emigrants. In the course of the following two decades, it fell to , and to ,. On the other hand, there was an increase in the number of workers entering Germany from Austria, Italy, Russia and other countries. According to the  census, there were ,, foreigners in Germany, of whom , were industrial workers and , agricultural workers. [] In France, the workers employed in the mining industry are, \u201cin great part\u201d, foreigners: Poles, Italians and Spaniards. [] In the United States, immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe are engaged in the most poorly paid jobs, while American workers provide the highest percentage of overseers or of the better-paid workers. [] Imperialism has the tendency to create privileged sections also among the workers, and to detach them from the broad masses of the proletariat.\n\nIt must be observed that in Great Britain the tendency of imperialism to split the workers, to strengthen opportunism among them and to cause temporary decay in the working-class movement, revealed itself much earlier than the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries; for two important distinguishing features of imperialism were already observed in Great Britain in the middle of the nineteenth century\u2014vast colonial possessions and a monopolist position in the world market. Marx and Engels traced this connection between opportunism in the working-class movement and the imperialist features of British capitalism systematically, during the course of several decades. For example, on October , , Engels wrote to Marx: \u201cThe English proletariat is actually becoming more and more bourgeois, so that this most bourgeois of all nations is apparently aiming ultimately at the possession of a bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat alongside the bourgeoisie. For a nation which exploits the whole world this is of course to a certain extent justifiable.\u201d[] Almost a quarter of a century later, in a letter dated August , , Engels speaks of the \u201cworst English trade unions which allow themselves to be led by men sold to, or at least paid by, the middle class\u201d. In a letter to Kautsky, dated September , , Engels wrote: \u201cYou ask me what the English workers think about colonial policy. Well, exactly the same as they think about politics in general. There is no workers\u2019 party here, there are only Conservatives and Liberal-Radicals, and the workers gaily share the feast of England\u2019s monopoly of the world market and the colonies.\u201d [] (Engels expressed similar ideas in the press in his preface to the second edition of The Condition of the Working Class in England, which appeared in .)\n\nThis clearly shows the causes and effects. The causes are: () exploitation of the whole world by this country; () its monopolist position in the world market; () its colonial monopoly. The effects are: () a section of the British proletariat becomes bourgeois; () a section of the proletariat allows itself to be led by men bought by, or at least paid by, the bourgeoisie. The imperialism of the beginning of the twentieth century completed the division of the world among a handful of states, each of which today exploits (in the sense of drawing superprofits from) a part of the \u201cwhole world\u201d only a little smaller than that which England exploited in ; each of them occupies a monopolist position in the world market thanks to trusts, cartels, finance capital and creditor and debtor relations; each of them enjoys to some degree a colonial monopoly (we have seen that out of the total of ,, sq. km., which comprise the whole colonial world, ,, sq. km., or  per cent, belong to six powers; ,, sq. km., or  per cent, belong to three powers).\n\nThe distinctive feature of the present situation is the prevalence of such economic and political conditions that are bound to increase the irreconcilability between opportunism and the general and vital interests of the working-class movement: imperialism has grown from an embryo into the predominant system; capitalist monopolies occupy first place in economics and politics; the division of the world has been completed; on the other hand, instead of the undivided monopoly of Great Britain, we see a few imperialist powers contending for the right to share in this monopoly, and this struggle is characteristic of the whole period of the early twentieth century. Opportunism cannot now be completely triumphant in the working-class movement of one country for decades as it was in Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century; but in a number of countries it has grown ripe, overripe, and rotten, and has become completely merged with bourgeois policy in the form of \u201csocial-chauvinism\u201d. []\n\nIX. CRITIQUE OF IMPERIALISM\nBy the critique of imperialism, in the broad sense of the term, we mean the attitude of the different classes of society towards imperialist policy in connection with their general ideology.\n\nThe enormous dimensions of finance capital concentrated in a few hands and creating an extraordinarily dense and widespread network of relationships and connections which subordinates not only the small and medium, but also the very small capitalists and small masters, on the one hand, and the increasingly intense struggle waged against other national state groups of financiers for the division of the world and domination over other countries, on the other hand, cause the propertied classes to go over entirely to the side of imperialism. \u201cGeneral\u201d enthusiasm over the prospects of imperialism, furious defence of it and painting it in the brightest colours\u2014such are the signs of the times. Imperialist ideology also penetrates the working class. No Chinese Wall separates it from the other classes. The leaders of the present-day, so-called, \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d Party of Germany are justly called \u201csocial-imperialists\u201d, that is, socialists in words and imperialists in deeds; but as early as , Hobson noted the existence in Britain of \u201cFabian imperialists\u201d who belonged to the opportunist Fabian Society.\n\nBourgeois scholars and publicists usually come out in defence of imperialism in a somewhat veiled form; they obscure its complete, domination and its deep-going roots, strive to push specific and secondary details into the forefront and do their very best to distract attention from essentials by means of absolutely ridiculous schemes for \u201creform\u201d, such as police supervision of the trusts or banks, etc. Cynical and frank imperialists who are bold enough to admit the absurdity of the idea of reforming the fundamental characteristics of imperialism are a rarer phenomenon.\n\nHere is an example. The German imperialists attempt, in the magazine Archives of World Economy, to follow the national emancipation movements in the colonies, particularly, of course, in colonies other than those belonging to Germany. They note the unrest and the protest movements in India, the movement in Natal (South Africa), in the Dutch East Indies, etc. One of them, commenting on an English report of a conference held on June -, , of representatives of various subject nations and races, of peoples of Asia, Africa and Europe who are under foreign rule, writes as follows in appraising the speeches delivered at this conference: \u201cWe are told that we must fight imperialism; that the ruling states should recognise the right of subject peoples to independence; that an international tribunal should supervise the fulfilment of treaties concluded between the great powers and weak peoples. Further than the expression of these pious wishes they do not go. We see no trace of understanding of the fact that imperialism is inseparably bound up with capitalism in its present form and that, therefore [!!], an open struggle against imperialism would be hopeless, unless, perhaps, the fight were to be confined to protests against certain of its especially abhorrent excesses.\u201d [] Since the reform of the basis of imperialism is a deception, a \u201cpious wish\u201d, since the bourgeois representatives of the oppressed nations go no \u201cfurther\u201d forward, the bourgeois representative of an oppressing nation goes \u201cfurther\u201d backward, to servility towards imperialism under cover of the claim to be \u201cscientific\u201d. That is also \u201clogic\u201d!\n\nThe questions as to whether it is possible to reform the basis of imperialism, whether to go forward to the further intensification and deepening of the antagonisms which it engenders. or backward, towards allaying these antagonisms, are fundamental questions in the critique of imperialism. Since the specific political features of imperialism are reaction everywhere and increased national oppression due to the oppression of the financial oligarchy and the elimination of free competition, a petty-bourgeois-democratic opposition to imperialism arose at the beginning of the twentieth century in nearly all imperialist countries. Kautsky not only did not trouble to oppose, was not only unable to oppose this petty-bourgeois reformist opposition, which is really reactionary in its economic basis, but became merged with it in practice, and this is precisely where Kautsky and the broad international Kautskian trend deserted Marxism.\n\nIn the United States, the imperialist war waged against Spain in  stirred up the opposition of the \u201canti-imperialists\u201d, the last of the Mohicans of bourgeois democracy who declared this war to be \u201ccriminal\u201d, regarded the annexation of foreign territories as a violation of the Constitution, declared that the treatment of Aguinaldo, leader of the Filipinos (the Americans promised him the independence of his country, but later landed troops and annexed it), was \u201cjingo treachery\u201d, and quoted the words of Lincoln: \u201cWhen the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also governs others, it is no longer self-government; it is despotism.\u201d [] But as long, as all this criticism shrank from recognising the inseverable bond between imperialism and the trusts, and, therefore, between imperialism and the foundations of capitalism, while it shrank from joining the forces engendered by large-scale capitalism and its development-it remained a \u201cpious wish\u201d.\n\nThis is also the main attitude taken by Hobson in his critique of imperialism. Hobson anticipated Kautsky in protesting against the \u201cinevitability of imperialism\u201d argument, and in urging the necessity of \u201cincreasing the consuming capacity\u201d of the people (under capitalism!). The petty-bourgeois point of view in the critique of imperialism, the omnipotence of the banks, the financial oligarchy, etc., is adopted by the authors I have often quoted, such as Agahd, A. Lansburgh, L. Eschwege, and among the French writers Victor Berard, author of a superficial book entitled England and Imperialism which appeared in . All these authors, who make no claim to be Marxists, contrast imperialism with free competition and democracy, condemn the Baghdad railway scheme, which is leading to conflicts and war, utter \u201cpious wishes\u201d for peace, etc. This applies also to the compiler of international stock and share issue statistics, A. Neymarck, who, after calculating the thousands of millions of francs representing \u201cinternational\u201d securities, exclaimed in : \u201cIs it possible to believe that peace may be disturbed ... that, in the face of these enormous figures, anyone would risk starting a war?\u201d []\n\nSuch simple-mindedness on the part of the bourgeois economists is not surprising; moreover, it is in their interest to pretend to be so naive and to talk \u201cseriously\u201d about peace under imperialism. But what remains of Kautsky\u2019s Marxism, when, in ,  and , he takes up the same bourgeois-reformist point of view and affirms that \u201ceverybody is agreed\u201d (imperialists, pseudo- socialists and social-pacifists) on the matter of peace? Instead of an analysis of imperialism and an exposure of the depths of its contradictions, we have nothing but a reformist \u201cpious wish\u201d to wave them aside, to evade them.\n\nHere is a sample of Kautsky\u2019s economic criticism of imperialism. He takes the statistics of the British export and import trade with Egypt for  and ; it seems that this export and import trade has grown more slowly than British foreign trade as a whole. From this Kautsky concludes that \u201cwe have no reason to suppose that without military occupation the growth of British trade with Egypt would have been less, simply as a result of the mere operation of economic factors\u201d. \u201cThe urge of capital to expand ... can be best promoted, not by the violent methods of imperialism, but by peaceful democracy.\u201d []\n\nThis argument of Kautsky\u2019s, which is repeated in every key by his Russian armour-bearer (and Russian shielder of the social-chauvinists), Mr. Spectator,[] constitutes the basis of Kautskian critique of imperialism, and that is why we must deal with it in greater detail. We will begin with a quotation from Hilferding, whose conclusions Kautsky on many occasions, and notably in April , has declared to have been \u201cunanimously adopted by all socialist theoreticians\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is not the business of the proletariat,\u201d writes Hilferding \u201cto contrast the more progressive capitalist policy with that of the now bygone era of free trade and of hostility towards the state. The reply of the proletariat to the economic policy of finance capital, to imperialism, cannot be free trade, but socialism. The aim of proletarian policy cannot today be the ideal of restoring free competition\u2014which has now become a reactionary ideal\u2014but the complete elimination of competition by the abolition of capitalism.\u201d []\n\nKautsky broke with Marxism by advocating in the epoch of finance capital a \u201creactionary ideal\u201d, \u201cpeaceful democracy\u201d, \u201cthe mere operation of economic factors\u201d, for objectively this ideal drags us back from monopoly to non-monopoly capitalism, and is a reformist swindle.\n\nTrade with Egypt (or with any other colony or semi-colony) \u201cwould have grown more\u201d without military occupation, without imperialism, and without finance capital. What does this mean? That capitalism would have developed more rapidly if free competition had not been restricted by monopolies in general, or by the \u201cconnections\u201d, yoke (i.e., also the monopoly) of finance capital, or by the monopolist possession of colonies by certain countries?\n\nKautsky\u2019s argument can have no other meaning; and this \u201cmeaning\u201d is meaningless. Let us assume that free competition, without any sort of monopoly, would have developed capitalism and trade more rapidly. But the more rapidly trade and capitalism develop, the greater is the concentration of production and capital which gives rise to monopoly. And monopolies have already arisen\u2014precisely out of free competition! Even if monopolies have now begun to retard progress, it is not an argument in favour of free competition, which has become impossible after it has given rise to monopoly.\n\nWhichever way one turns Kautsky\u2019s argument, one will find nothing in it except reaction and bourgeois reformism.\n\nEven if we correct this argument and say, as Spectator says, that the trade of the colonies with Britain is now developing more slowly than their trade with other countries, it does not save Kautsky; for it is also monopoly, also imperialism that is beating Great Britain, only it is the monopoly and imperialism of another country (America, Germany). It is known that the cartels have given rise to a new and peculiar form of protective tariffs, i.e., goods suitable for export are protected (Engels noted this in Vol. III of Capital[]). It is known, too, that the cartels add finance capital have a system peculiar to themselves, that of \u201cexporting goods at cut-rate prices\u201d, or \u201cdumping\u201d, as the English call it: within a given country the cartel sells its goods at high monopoly prices, but sells them abroad at a much lower price to undercut the competitor, to enlarge its own production to the utmost, etc. If Germany\u2019s trade with the British colonies is developing more rapidly than Great Britain\u2019s, it only proves that German imperialism is younger, stronger and better organised than British imperialism, is superior to it; but it by no means proves the \u201csuperiority\u201d of free trade, for it is not a fight between free trade and protection and colonial dependence, but between two rival imperialisms, two monopolies, two groups of finance capital. The superiority of German imperialism over British imperialism is more potent than the wall of colonial frontiers or of protective tariffs: to use this as an \u201cargument\u201d in favour of free trade and \u201cpeaceful democracy\u201d is banal, it means forgetting the essential features and characteristics of imperialism, substituting petty-bourgeois reformism for Marxism.\n\nIt is interesting to note that even the bourgeois economist, A. Lansburgh, whose criticism of imperialism is as petty-bourgeois as Kautsky\u2019s, nevertheless got closer to a more scientific study of trade statistics. He did not compare one single country, chosen at random, and one single colony with the other countries; he examined the export trade of an imperialist country: () with countries which are financially dependent upon it, and borrow money from it; and () with countries which are financially independent. He obtained the following results:\n\nEXPORT TRADE OF GERMANY (, marks)\nTo countries financially\ndependent on\nGermany\t\t\tPer cent\nincrease\nRumania\t.\t.\t\nPortugal\t.\t.\t\nArgentina\t.\t.\t\nBrazil\t.\t.\t\nChile\t.\t.\t\nTotal\t.\t.\t\nTo countries\nfinancially\nindependent\nof Germany\t \t \t \nGreat Britain\t.\t.\t\nFrance\t.\t.\t\nBelgium\t.\t.\t\nSwitzerland\t.\t.\t\nAustralia\t.\t.\t\nDutch East\nIndies\t.\t.\t\nTotal\t,.\t,.\t\nLansburgh did not draw conclusions and therefore, strangely enough, failed to observe that if the figures prove anything at all, they prove that he is wrong, for the exports to countries financially dependent on Germany have grown more rapidly, if only slightly, than exports to the countries which are financially independent. (I emphasise the \u201cif\u201d, for Lansburgh\u2019s figures are far from complete.)\n\nTracing the connection between exports and loans, Lansburgh writes:\n\n\u201cIn -, a Rumanian loan was floated through the German banks, which had already in previous years made advances on this loan. It was used chiefly to purchase railway materials in Germany. In , German exports to Rumania amounted to  million marks. The following year they dropped to . million marks and, with fluctuations, to . million in . Only in very recent years have they regained the level of , thanks to two new loans.\n\n\u201cGerman exports to Portugal rose, following the loans of - to ,, (); then, in the two following years, they dropped to ,, and ,,, and regained their former level only in .\n\n\u201cThe figures of German trade with Argentina are still more striking. Loans were floated in  and ; German exports to Argentina reached ,, marks (). Two years later they amounted to only ,, marks, less than one-third of the previous figure. It was not until  that they regained and surpassed the level of , and then only as a result of new loans floated by the state and by municipalities, with advances to build power stations, and with other credit operations.\n\n\u201cExports to Chile, as a consequence of the loan of , rose to ,, marks (in ), and a year later dropped to ,, marks. A new Chilean loan floated by the German banks in  was followed by a rise of exports to ,, marks in , only to fall again to ,, marks in .\u201d []\n\nFrom these facts Lansburgh draws the amusing petty-bourgeois moral of how unstable and irregular export trade is when it is bound up with loans, how bad it is to invest capital abroad instead of \u201cnaturally\u201d and \u201charmoniously\u201d developing home industry, how \u201ccostly\u201d are the millions in bakshish that Krupp has to pay in floating foreign loans, etc. But the facts tell us clearly: the increase in exports is connected with just these swindling tricks of finance capital, which is not concerned with bourgeois morality, but with skinning the ox twice\u2014first, it pockets the profits from the loan; then it pockets other profits from the same loan which the borrower uses to make purchases from Krupp, or to purchase railway material from the Steel Syndicate, etc.\n\nI repeat that I do not by any means consider Lansburgh\u2019s figures to be perfect; but I had to quote them because they are more scientific than Kautsky\u2019s and Spectator\u2019s and because Lansburgh showed the correct way to approach the question. In discussing the significance of finance capital in regard to exports, etc., one must be able to single out the connection of exports especially and solely with the tricks of the financiers, especially and solely with the sale of goods by cartels, etc. Simply to compare colonies with non-colonies, one imperialism with another imperialism, one semi-colony or colony (Egypt) with all other countries, is to evade and to obscure the very essence of the question.\n\nKautsky\u2019s theoretical critique of imperialism has nothing in common with Marxism and serves only as a preamble to propaganda for peace and unity with the opportunists and the social-chauvinists, precisely for the reason that it evades and obscures the very profound and fundamental contradictions of imperialism: the contradictions between monopoly and free competition which exists side by side with it, between the gigantic \u201coperations\u201d (and gigantic profits) of finance capital and \u201chonest\u201d trade in the free market, the contradiction between cartels and trusts, on the one hand, and non-cartelised industry, on the other, etc.\n\nThe notorious theory of \u201cultra-imperialism\u201d, invented by Kautsky, is just as reactionary. Compare his arguments on this subject in , with Hobson\u2019s arguments in .\n\nKautsky: \u201c... Cannot the present imperialist policy be supplanted by a new, ultra-imperialist policy, which will introduce the joint exploitation of the world by internationally united finance capital in place of the mutual rivalries of national finance capitals? Such a new phase of capitalism is at any rate conceivable. Can it be achieved? Sufficient premises are still lacking to enable us to answer this question.\u201d []\n\nHobson: \u201cChristendom thus laid out in a few great federal empires, each with a retinue of uncivilised dependencies, seems to many the most legitimate development of present tendencies, and one which would offer the best hope of permanent peace on an assured basis of inter-Imperialism.\u201d\n\nKautsky called ultra-imperialism or super-imperialism what Hobson, thirteen years earlier, described as inter- imperialism. Except for coining a new and clever catchword, replacing one Latin prefix by another, the only progress Kautsky has made in the sphere of \u201cscientific\u201d thought is that he gave out as Marxism what Hobson, in effect, described as the cant of English parsons. After the Anglo-Boer War it was quite natural for this highly honourable caste to exert their main efforts to console the British middle class and the workers who had lost many of their relatives on the battlefields of South Africa and who were obliged to pay higher taxes in order to guarantee still higher profits for the British financiers. And what better consolation could there be than the theory that imperialism is not so bad; that it stands close to inter- (or ultra-) imperialism, which can ensure permanent peace? No matter what the good intentions of the English parsons, or of sentimental Kautsky, may have been, the only objective, i.e., real, social significance of Kautsky\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d is this: it is a most reactionary method of consoling the masses with hopes of permanent peace being possible under capitalism, by distracting their attention from the sharp antagonisms and acute problems of the present times, and directing it towards illusory prospects of an imaginary \u201cultraimperialism\u201d of the future. Deception of the masses\u2014that is all there is in Kautsky\u2019s \u201cMarxist\u201d theory.\n\nIndeed, it is enough to compare well-known and indisputable facts to become convinced of the utter falsity of the prospects which Kautsky tries to conjure up before the German workers (and the workers of all lands). Let us consider India, Indo-China and China. It is known that these three colonial and semi-colonial countries, with a population of six to seven hundred million, are subjected to the exploitation of the finance capital of several imperialist powers: Great Britain, France, Japan, the U.S.A., etc. Let us assume that these imperialist countries form alliances against one another in order to protect or enlarge their possessions, their interests and their spheres of influence in these Asiatic states; these alliances will be \u201cinter-imperialist\u201d, or \u201cultra-imperialist\u201d alliances. Let us assume that all the imperialist countries conclude an alliance for the \u201cpeaceful\u201d division of these parts of Asia; this alliance would be an alliance of \u201cinternationally united finance capital\u201d. There are actual examples of alliances of this kind in the history of the twentieth century\u2014the attitude of the powers to China, for instance. We ask, is it \u201cconceivable\u201d, assuming that the capitalist system remains intact\u2014and this is precisely the assumption that Kautsky does make\u2014that such alliances would be more than temporary, that they would eliminate friction, conflicts and struggle in every possible form?\n\nThe question has only to be presented clearly for any other than a negative answer to be impossible. This is because the only conceivable basis under capitalism for the division of spheres of influence, interests, colonies, etc., is a calculation of the strength of those participating, their general economic, financial, military strength, etc. And the strength of these participants in the division does not change to an equal degree, for the even development of different undertakings, trusts, branches of industry, or countries is impossible under capitalism. Half a century ago Germany was a miserable, insignificant country, if her capitalist strength is compared with that of the Britain of that time; Japan compared with Russia in the same way. Is it \u201cconceivable\u201d that in ten or twenty years\u2019 time the relative strength of the imperialist powers will have remained unchanged? It is out of the question.\n\nTherefore, in the realities of the capitalist system, and not in the banal philistine fantasies of English parsons, or of the German \u201cMarxist\u201d, Kautsky, \u201cinter-imperialist\u201d or \u201cultra-imperialist\u201d alliances, no matter what form they may assume, whether of one imperialist coalition against another, or of a general alliance embracing all the imperialist powers, are inevitably nothing more than a \u201ctruce\u201d in periods between wars. Peaceful alliances prepare the ground for wars, and in their turn grow out of wars; the one conditions the other, producing alternating forms of peaceful and non-peaceful struggle on one and the same basis of imperialist connections and relations within world economics and world politics. But in order to pacify the workers and reconcile them with the social-chauvinists who have deserted to the side of the bourgeoisie, over-wise Kautsky separates one link of a single chain from another, separates the present peaceful (and ultra-imperialist, nay, ultra-ultra-imperialist) alliance of all the powers for the \u201cpacification\u201d of China (remember the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion[]) from the non-peaceful conflict of tomorrow, which will prepare the ground for another \u201cpeaceful\u201d general alliance for the partition, say, of Turkey, on the day after tomorrow, etc., etc. Instead of showing the living connection between periods of imperialist peace and periods of imperialist war, Kautsky presents the workers with a lifeless abstraction in order to reconcile them to their lifeless leaders.\n\nAn American writer, Hill, in his A History of the Diplomacy in the International Development of Europe refers in his preface to the following periods in the recent history of diplomacy: () the era of revolution; () the constitutional movement; () the present era of \u201ccommercial imperialism\u201d. [] Another writer divides the history of Great Britain\u2019s \u201cworld policy\u201d since  into four periods: () the first Asiatic period (that of the struggle against Russia\u2019s advance in Central Asia towards India); () the African period (approximately -): that of the struggle against France for the partition of Africa (the \u201cFashoda incident\u201d of  which brought her within a hair\u2019s breadth of war with France); () the second Asiatic period (alliance with Japan against Russia); and () the \u201cEuropean\u201d period, chiefly anti-German. [] \u201cThe political patrol clashes take place on the financial field,\u201d wrote the banker, Riesser, in , in showing how French finance capital operating in Italy was preparing the way for a political alliance of these countries, and how a conflict was developing between Germany and Great Britain over Persia, between all the European capitalists over Chinese loans, etc. Behold, the living reality of peaceful \u201cultra-imperialist\u201d alliances in their inseverable connection with ordinary imperialist conflicts!\n\nKautsky\u2019s obscuring of the deepest contradictions of imperialism, which inevitably boils down to painting imperialism in bright colours, leaves its traces in this writer\u2019s criticism of the political features of imperialism. Imperialism is the epoch of finance capital and of monopolies, which introduce everywhere the striving for domination, not for freedom. Whatever the political system, the result of these tendencies is everywhere reaction and an extreme intensification of antagonisms in this field. Particularly intensified become the yoke of national oppression and the striving for annexations, i.e., the violation of national independence (for annexation is nothing but the violation of the right of nations to self-determination). Hilferding rightly notes the connection between imperialism and the intensification of national oppression. \u201cIn the newly opened-up countries,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe capital imported into them intensifies antagonisms and excites against the intruders the constantly growing resistance of the peoples who are awakening to national consciousness; this resistance can easily develop into dangerous measures against foreign capital. The old social relations become completely revolutionised, the age-long agrarian isolation of \u2018nations without history\u2019 is destroyed and they are drawn into the capitalist whirlpool. Capitalism itself gradually provides the subjugated with the means and resources for their emancipation and they set out to achieve the goal which once seemed highest to the European nations: the creation of a united national state as a means to economic and cultural freedom. This movement for national independence threatens European capital in its most valuable and most promising fields of exploitation, and European capital can maintain its domination only by continually increasing its military forces.\u201d []\n\nTo this must be added that it is not only in newly opened-up countries, but also in the old, that imperialism is leading to annexation, to increased national oppression, and, consequently, also to increasing resistance. While objecting to the intensification of political reaction by imperialism, Kautsky leaves in the shade a question that has become particularly urgent, viz., the impossibility of unity with the opportunists in the epoch of imperialism. While objecting to annexations , he presents his objections in a form that is most acceptable and least offensive to the opportunists. He addresses himself to a German audience, yet he obscures the most topical and important point, for instance, the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany. In order to appraise this \u201cmental aberration\u201d of Kautsky\u2019s I shall take the following example. Let us suppose that a Japanese condemns the annexation of the Philippines by the Americans. The question is: will many believe that he does so because he has a horror of annexations as such, and not because he himself has a desire to annex the Philippines? And shall we not be constrained to admit that the \u201cfight\u201d the Japanese is waging against annexations can be regarded as being sincere and politically honest only if he fights against the annexation of Korea by Japan, and urges freedom for Korea to secede from Japan?\n\nKautsky\u2019s theoretical analysis of imperialism, as well as his economic and political critique of imperialism, are permeated through and through with a spirit, absolutely irreconcilable with Marxism, of obscuring and glossing over the fundamental contradictions of imperialism and with a striving to preserve at all costs the crumbling unity with opportunism in the European working-class movement.\n\nX. THE PLACE OF IMPERIALISM IN HISTORY\nWe have seen that in its economic essence imperialism is monopoly capitalism. This in itself determines its place in history, for monopoly that grows out of the soil of free competition, and precisely out of free competition, is the transition from the capitalist system to a higher socio-economic order. We must take special note of the four principal types of monopoly, or principal manifestations of monopoly capitalism, which are characteristic of the epoch we are examining.\n\nFirstly, monopoly arose out of the concentration of production at a very high stage. This refers to the monopolist capitalist associations, cartels, syndicatess, and trusts. We have seen the important part these play in present-day economic life. At the beginning of the twentieth century, monopolies had acquired complete supremacy in the advanced countries, and although the first steps towards the formation of the cartels were taken by countries enjoying the protection of high tariffs (Germany, America), Great Britain, with her system of free trade, revealed the same basic phenomenon, only a little later, namely, the birth of monopoly out of the concentration of production.\n\nSecondly, monopolies have stimulated the seizure of the most important sources of raw materials, especially for the basic and most highly cartelised industries in capitalist society: the coal and iron industries. The monopoly of the most important sources of raw materials has enormously increased the power of big capital, and has sharpened the antagonism between cartelised and non-cartelised industry.\n\nThirdly, monopoly has sprung from the banks. The banks have developed from modest middleman enterprises into the monopolists of finance capital. Some three to five of the biggest banks in each of the foremost capitalist countries have achieved the \u201cpersonal link-up\u201d between industrial and bank capital, and have concentrated in their hands the control of thousands upon thousands of millions which form the greater part of the capital and income of entire countries. A financial oligarchy, which throws a close network of dependence relationships over all the economic and political institutions of present-day bourgeois society without exception\u2014such is the most striking manifestation of this monopoly.\n\nFourthly, monopoly has grown out of colonial policy. To the numerous \u201cold\u201d motives of colonial policy, finance capital has added the struggle for the sources of raw materials, for the export of capital, for spheres of influence, i.e., for spheres for profitable deals, concessions, monopoly profits and so on, economic territory in general. When the colonies of the European powers,for instance, comprised only one-tenth of the territory of Africa(as was the case in ), colonial policy was able to develop\u2014by methods other than those of monopoly\u2014by the \u201cfree grabbing\u201d of territories, so to speak. But when nine-tenths of Africa had been seized (by ), when the whole world had been divided up,there was inevitably ushered in the era of monopoly possession of colonies and, consequently, of particularly intense struggle for the division and the redivision of the world.\n\nThe extent to which monopolist capital has intensified all the contradictions of capitalism is generally known. It is sufficient to mention the high cost of living and the tyranny of the cartels. This intensification of contradictions constitutes the most powerful driving force of the transitional period of history, which began from the time of the final victory of world finance capital.\n\nMonopolies, oligarchy, the striving for domination and not for freedom, the exploitation of an increasing number of small or weak nations by a handful of the richest or most powerful nations\u2014all these have given birth to those distinctive characteristics of imperialism which compel us to define it as parasitic or decaying capitalism. More and more prominently there emerges, as one of the tendencies of imperialism, the creation of the \u201crentier state\u201d, the usurer state, in which the bourgeoisie to an ever-increasing degree lives on the proceeds of capital exports and by \u201cclipping coupons\u201d. It would be a mistake to believe that this tendency to decay precludes the rapid growth of capitalism. It does not. In the epoch of imperialism, certain branches of industry, certain strata of the bourgeoisie and certain countries betray, to a greater or lesser degree, now one and now another of these tendencies. On the whole, capitalism is growing far more rapidly than before; but this growth is not only becoming more and more uneven in general, its unevenness also manifests itself, in particular, in the decay of the countries which are richest in capital (Britain).\n\nIn regard to the rapidity of Germany\u2019s economic development, Riesser, the author of the book on the big German banks, states: \u201cThe progress of the preceding period (-), which had not been exactly slow, compares with the rapidity with which the whole of Germany\u2019s national economy, and with it German banking, progressed during this period (-) in about the same way as the speed of the mail coach in the good old days compares with the speed of the present-day automobile ... which is whizzing past so fast that it endangers not only innocent pedestrians in its path, but also the occupants of the car.\u201d In its turn, this finance capital which has grown with such extraordinary rapidity is not unwilling, precisely because it has grown so quickly, to pass on to a more \u201ctranquil\u201d possession of colonies which have to be seized\u2014and not only by peaceful methods\u2014from richer nations. In the United States, economic development in the last decades has been even more rapid than in Germany, and for this very reason, the parasitic features of modern American capitalism have stood out with particular prominence. On the other hand, a comparison of, say, the republican American bourgeoisie with the monarchist Japanese or German bourgeoisie shows that the most pronounced political distinction diminishes to an extreme degree in the epoch of imperialism\u2014not because it is unimportant in general, but because in all these cases we are talking about a bourgeoisie which has definite features of parasitism.\n\nThe receipt of high monopoly profits by the capitalists in one of the numerous branches of industry, in one of the numerous countries, etc., makes it economically possible for them to bribe certain sections of the workers, and for a time a fairly considerable minority of them, and win them to the side of the bourgeoisie of a given industry or given nation against all the others. The intensification of antagonisms between imperialist nations for the division of the world increases this urge. And so there is created that bond between imperialism and opportunism, which revealed itself first and most clearly in Great Britain, owing to the fact that certain features of imperialist development were observable there much earlier than in other countries. Some writers, L. Martov, for example, are prone to wave aside the connection between imperialism and opportunism in the working-class movement\u2014a particularly glaring fact at the present time\u2014by resorting to \u201cofficial optimism\u201d (\u00e0 la Kautsky and Huysmans) like the following: the cause of the opponents of capitalism would be hopeless if it were progressive capitalism that led to the increase of opportunism, or, if it were the best-paid workers who were inclined towards opportunism, etc. We must have no illusions about \u201coptimism\u201d of this kind. It is optimism in respect of opportunism; it is optimism which serves to conceal opportunism. As a matter of fact the extraordinary rapidity and the particularly revolting character of the development of opportunism is by no means a guarantee that its victory will be durable: the rapid growth of a painful abscess on a healthy body can only cause it to burst more quickly and thus relieve the body of it. The most dangerous of all in this respect are those who do not wish to understand that the fight against imperialism is a sham and humbug unless it is inseparably bound up with the fight against opportunism.\n\nFrom all that has been said in this book on the economic essence of imperialism, it follows that we must define it as capitalism in transition, or, more precisely, as moribund capitalism. It is very instructive in this respect to note that bourgeois economists, in describing modern capitalism, frequently employ catchwords and phrases like \u201cinterlocking\u201d, \u201cabsence of isolation\u201d, etc.; \u201cin conformity with their functions and course of development\u201d, banks are \u201cnot purely private business enterprises: they are more and more outgrowing the sphere of purely private business regulation\u201d. And this very Riesser, whose words I have just quoted, declares with all seriousness that the \u201cprophecy\u201d of the Marxists concerning \u201csocialisation\u201d has \u201cnot come true\u201d!\n\nWhat then does this catchword \u201cinterlocking\u201d express? It merely expresses the most striking feature of the process going on before our eyes. It shows that the observer counts the separate trees, but cannot see the wood. It slavishly copies the superficial, the fortuitous, the chaotic. It reveals the observer as one who is overwhelmed by the mass of raw material and is utterly incapable of appreciating its meaning and importance. Ownership of shares, the relations between owners of private property \u201cinterlock in a haphazard way\u201d. But underlying this interlocking, its very base, are the changing social relations of production. When a big enterprise assumes gigantic proportions, and, on the basis of an exact computation of mass data, organises according to plan the supply of primary raw materials to the extent of two-thirds, or three-fourths, of all that is necessary for tens of millions of people; when the raw materials are transported in a systematic and organised manner to the most suitable places of production, sometimes situated hundreds or thousands of miles from each other; when a single centre directs all the consecutive stages of processing the material right up to the manufacture of numerous varieties of finished articles; when these products are distributed according to a single plan among tens and hundreds of millions of consumers (the marketing of oil in America and Germany by the American oil trust)\u2014then it becomes evident that we have socialisation of production, and not mere \u201cinterlocking\u201d, that private economic and private property relations constitute a shell which no longer fits its contents, a shell which must inevitably decay if its removal is artificially delayed, a shell which may remain in a state of decay for a fairly long period (if, at the worst, the cure of the opportunist abscess is protracted), but which will inevitably be removed.\n\nThe enthusiastic admirer of German imperialism, Schulze-Gaevernitz, exclaims:\n\n\u201cOnce the supreme management of the German banks has been entrusted to the hands of a dozen persons, their activity is even today more significant for the public good than that of the majority of the Ministers of State. .. . (The \u201cinterlocking\u201d of bankers, ministers, magnates of industry and rentiers is here conveniently forgotten.) If we imagine the development of those tendencies we have noted carried to their logical conclusion we will have: the money capital of the nation united in the banks; the banks themselves combined into cartels; the investment capital of the nation cast in the shape of securities. Then the forecast of that genius Saint-Simon will be fulfilled: \u2018The present anarchy of production, which corresponds to the fact that economic relations are developing without uniform regulation, must make way for organisation in production. Production will no longer be directed by isolated manufacturers, independent of each other and ignorant of man\u2019s economic needs; that will be done by a certain public institution. A central committee of management, being able to survey the large field of social economy from a more elevated point of view, will regulate it for the benefit of the whole of society, will put the means of production into suitable hands, and above all will take care that there be constant harmony between production and consumption. Institutions already exist which have assumed as part of their functions a certain organisation of economic labour, the banks.\u2019 We are still a long way from the fulfilment of Saint-Simon\u2019s forecast, but we are on the way towards it: Marxism, different from what Marx imagined, but different only in form.\u201d []\n\nA crushing \u201crefutation\u201d of Marx indeed, which retreats a step from Marx\u2019s precise, scientific analysis to Saint-Simon\u2019s guess-work, the guess-work of a genius, but guess-work all the same.",
    "1905-1909": " Marx, Karl, was born...\nMarx, the student\nMarx, Karl, was born on May ,  (New Style), in the city of Trier (Rhenish Prussia). His father was a lawyer, a Jew, who in  adopted Protestantism. The family was well-to-do, cultured, but not revolutionary. After graduating from a Gymnasium in Trier, Marx entered the university, first at Bonn and later in Berlin, where he read law, majoring in history and philosophy. He concluded his university course in , submitting a doctoral thesis on the philosophy of Epicurus. At the time Marx was a Hegelian idealist in his views. In Berlin, he belonged to the circle of \u201cLeft Hegelians\u201d (Bruno Bauer and others) who sought to draw atheistic and revolutionary conclusion from Hegel\u2019s philosophy.\n\nAfter graduating, Marx moved to Bonn, hoping to become a professor. However, the reactionary policy of the government, which deprived Ludwig Feuerbach of his chair in , refused to allow him to return to the university in , and in  forbade young Professor Bruno Bauer to lecture at Bonn, made Marx abandon the idea of an academic career. Left Hegelian views were making rapid headway in Germany at the time. Feuerbach began to criticize theology, particularly after , and turn to materialism, which in  gained ascendancy in his philosophy (The Essence of Christianity). The year  saw the appearance of his Principles of the Philosophy of the Future. \u201cOne must oneself have experienced the liberating effect\u201d of these books, Engels subsequently wrote of these works of Feuerbach. \u201cWe [i.e., the Left Hegelians, including Marx] all became at once Feuerbachians.\u201d At that time, some radical bourgeois in the Rhineland, who were in touch with the Left Hegelians, founded, in Cologne, an opposition paper called Rheinische Zeitung (The first issue appeared on January , ). Marx and Bruno Bauer were invited to be the chief contributors, and in October  Marx became editor-in-chief and moved from Bonn to Cologne. The newspaper\u2019s revolutionary-democratic trend became more and more pronounced under Marx\u2019s editorship, and the government first imposed double and triple censorship on the paper, and then on January   decided to suppress it. Marx had to resign the editorship before that date, but his resignation did not save the paper, which suspended publication in March . Of the major articles Marx contributed to Rheinische Zeitung, Engels notes, in addition to those indicated below (see Bibliography),[] an article on the condition of peasant winegrowers in the Moselle Valley.[] Marx\u2019s journalistic activities convinced him that he was insufficiently acquainted with political economy, and he zealously set out to study it.\n\nIn , Marx married, at Kreuznach, a childhood friend he had become engaged to while still a student. His wife came of a reactionary family of the Prussian nobility, her elder brother being Prussia\u2019s Minister of the Interior during a most reactionary period\u2014-. In the autumn of , Marx went to Paris in order to publish a radical journal abroad, together with Arnold Ruge (-); Left Hegelian; in prison in -; a political exile following , and a Bismarckian after -). Only one issue of this journal, Deutsch-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher, appeared;[] publication was discontinued owing to the difficulty of secretly distributing it in Germany, and to disagreement with Ruge. Marx\u2019s articles in this journal showed that he was already a revolutionary who advocated \u201cmerciless criticism of everything existing\u201d, and in particular the \u201ccriticism by weapon\u201d,[] and appealed to the masses and to the proletariat.\n\nEngels at \nIn September , Frederick Engels came to Paris for a few days, and from that time on became Marx\u2019s closest friend. They both took a most active part in the then seething life of the revolutionary groups in Paris (of particular importance at the time was Proudhon\u2019s[] doctrine), which Marx pulled to pieces in his Poverty of Philosophy, ); waging a vigorous struggle against the various doctrines of petty-bourgeois socialism, they worked out the theory and tactics of revolutionary proletarian socialism, or communism Marxism). See Marx\u2019s works of this period, - in the Bibliography. At the insistent request of the Prussian government, Marx was banished from Paris in , as a dangerous revolutionary. He went to Brussels. In the spring of  Marx and Engels joined a secret propaganda society called the Communist League;[] they took a prominent part in the League\u2019s Second Congress (London, November ), at whose request they drew up the celebrated Communist Manifesto, which appeared in February . With the clarity and brilliance of genius, this work outlines a new world-conception, consistent with materialism, which also embrace the realm of social life; dialectics, as the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development; the theory of the class struggle and of the world-historic revolutionary role of the proletariat\u2014the creator of a new, communist society.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Revolution of February ,[] Marx was banished from Belgium. He returned to Paris, whence, after the March Revolution,[] he went to Cologne, Germany, where Neue Rheinische Zeitung[] was published from June , , to May , , with Marx as editor-in-chief. The new theory was splendidly confirmed by the course of the revolutionary events of -, just as it has been subsequently confirmed by all proletarian and democratic movements in all countries of the world. The victorious counter-revolution first instigated court proceedings against Marx (he was acquitted on February , ), and then banished him from Germany (May , ). First Marx went to Paris, was again banished after the demonstration of June , ,[] and then went to London, where he lived until his death.\n\nHis life as a political exile was a very hard one, as the correspondence between Marx and Engels (published in ) clearly reveals. Poverty weighed heavily on Marx and his family; had it not been for Engels\u2019 constant and selfless financial aid, Marx would not only have been unable to complete Capital but would have inevitably have been crushed by want. Moreover, the prevailing doctrines and trends of petty-bourgeois socialism, and of non-proletarian socialism in general, forced Marx to wage a continuous and merciless struggle and sometime to repel the most savage and monstrous personal attacks (Herr Vogt).[] Marx, who stood aloof from circles of political exiles, developed his materialist theory in a number of historical works (see Bibliography), devoting himself mainly to a study of political economy. Marx revolutionized science (see \u201cThe Marxist Doctrine\u201d, below) in his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy () and Capital (Vol. I, ).\n\nThe revival of the democratic movements in the late fifties and in the sixties recalled Marx to practical activity. In  (September ) the International Working Men\u2019s Association\u2014the celebrated First International\u2014was founded in London. Marx was the heart and soul of this organization, and author of its first Address[] and of a host of resolutions, declaration and manifestoes. In uniting the labor movement of various forms of non-proletarian, pre-Marxist socialism (Mazzini, Proudhon, Bakunin, liberal trade-unionism in Britain, Lassallean vacillations to the right in Germany, etc.), and in combating the theories of all these sects and schools, Marx hammered out a uniform tactic for the proletarian struggle of the working in the various countries. Following the downfall of the Paris Commune ()\u2014of which gave such a profound, clear-cut, brilliant effective and revolutionary analysis (The Civil War In France, )\u2014and the Bakunin-caused[] cleavage in the International, the latter organization could no longer exist in Europe. After the Hague Congress of the International (), Marx had the General Council of the International had played its historical part, and now made way for a period of a far greater development of the labor movement in all countries in the world, a period in which the movement grew in scope, and mass socialist working-class parties in individual national states were formed.\n\nMarx\u2019s health was undermined by his strenuous work in the International and his still more strenuous theoretical occupations. He continued work on the refashioning of political economy and on the completion of Capital, for which he collected a mass of new material and studied a number of languages (Russian, for instance). However, ill-health prevented him from completing Capital.\n\nHis wife died on December , , and on March , , Marx passed away peacefully in his armchair. He lies buried next to his wife at Highgate Cemetery in London. Of Marx\u2019s children some died in childhood in London, when the family were living in destitute circumstances. Three daughters married English and French socialists; Eleanor Aveling, Laura Lafargue and Jenny Longuet. The latters\u2019 son is a member of the French Socialist Party.\n\n \n\nNotes\n[] This \u201cBibliography\u201d written by Lenin for the article is not included. \u2014Ed.\n\n[] The reference is to the article \u201cJustification of the Correspondent from the Mosel\u201d by Karl Marx.\u2014Ed.\n\n[] The reference is to the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher (German-French Annals), a magazine edited by Karl Marx and Arnold Ruge and published in German in Paris.

Publication of the magazine was discontinued mainly as a result of basic differences of opinion between Marx and the bourgeois radical Ruge.\u2014Ed.\n\n[] Proudhonism\u2014An unscientific trend in petty-bourgeois socialism, hostile to Marxism, so called after its ideologist, the French anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon. Proudhon criticized big capitalist property from the petty-bourgeois position and dreamed of perpetuating small private ownership. He proposed the foundation of \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d and \u201cexchange\u201d banks, with the aid of which the workers would be able to acquire the means of production, become handicraftsmen and ensure the just marketing of their produce. Proudhon did not understand the historic role of the proletariat and displayed a negative attitude to the class struggle, the proletarian revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat; as an anarchist, he denied the need for the state.

Marx was the genius who continued and consummated the three main ideological currents of the th century, as represented by the three most advanced countries of mankind: classical German philosophy, classical English political economy, and French socialism combined with French revolutionary doctrines in general. Acknowledged even by his opponents, the remarkable consistency and integrity of Marx\u2019s views, whose totality constitutes modern materialism and modern scientific socialism, as the theory and programme of the working-class movement in all the civilized countries of the world, make it incumbent on us to present a brief outline of his world-conception in general, prior to giving an exposition of the principal content of Marxism, namely, Marx\u2019s economic doctrine.\n\nPhilosophical Materialism\nBeginning with the years \u2013, when his views took shape, Marx was a materialist and especially a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, whose weak point he subsequently saw only in his materialism being insufficiently consistent and comprehensive. To Marx, Feuerbach\u2019s historic and \u201cepoch-making\u201d significance lay in his having resolutely broken with Hegel\u2019s idealism and in his proclamation of materialism, which already \u201cin the th century, particularly French materialism, was not only a struggle against the existing political institutions and against... religion and theology, but also... against all metaphysics\u201d (in the sense of \u201cdrunken speculation\u201d as distinct from \u201csober philosophy\u201d). (The Holy Family, in Literarischer Nachlass[]) \u201cTo Hegel... ,\u201d wrote Marx, \u201cthe process of thinking, which, under the name of \u2018the Idea\u2019, he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos (the creator, the maker) of the real world.... With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.\u201d (Capital, Vol. I, Afterward to the Second Edition.) In full conformity with this materialist philosophy of Marx\u2019s, and expounding it, Frederick Engels wrote in Anti-Duhring (read by Marx in the manuscript): \u201cThe real unity of the world consists in its materiality, and this is proved... by a long and wearisome development of philosophy and natural science....\u201d \u201cMotion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been matter without motion, or motion without matter, nor can there be.... Bit if the... question is raised: what thought and consciousness really are, and where they come from; it becomes apparent that they are products of the human brain and that man himself is a product of Nature, which has developed in and along with its environment; hence it is self-evident that the products of the human brain, being in the last analysis also products of Nature, do not contradict the rest of Nature\u2019s interconnections but are in correspondence with them....\n\n\u201cHegel was an idealist, that is to say, the thoughts within his mind were to him not the more or less abstract images [Abbilder, reflections; Engels sometimes speaks of \u201cimprints\u201d] of real things and processes, but on the contrary, things and their development were to him only the images, made real, of the \u201cIdea\u201d existing somewhere or other before the world existed.\u201d\n\nIn his Ludwig Feuerbach\u2014which expounded his own and Marx\u2019s views on Feuerbach\u2019s philosophy, and was sent to the printers after he had re-read an old manuscript Marx and himself had written in - on Hegel, Feuerbach and the materialist conception of history\u2014Engels wrote:\n\n\u201cThe great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is the relation of thinking and being... spirit to Nature... which is primary, spirit or Nature.... The answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primary of spirit to Nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other... comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded Nature as primary, belonged to the various schools of materialism.\u201d\n\nAny other use of the concepts of (philosophical) idealism and materialism leads only to confusion. Marx decidedly rejected, not only idealism, which is always linked in one way or another with religion, but also the views\u2014especially widespread in our day\u2014of Hume and Kant, agnosticism, criticism, and positivism[] in their various forms; he considered that philosophy a \u201creactionary\u201d concession to idealism, and at best a \u201cshame-faced way of surreptitiously accepting materialism, while denying it before the world.\u201d[]\n\nOn this question, see, besides the works by Engels and Marx mentioned above, a letter Marx wrote to Engels on December , , in which, referring to an utterance by the naturalist Thomas Huxley, which was \u201cmore materialistic\u201d than usual, and to his recognition that \u201cas long as we actually observe and think, we cannot possibly get away from materialism\u201d, Marx reproached Huxley for leaving a \u201cloop hole\u201d for agnosticism, for Humism.\n\nIt is particularly important to note Marx\u2019s view on the relation between freedom and necessity: \u201cFreedom is the appreciation of necessity. \u2018Necessity is blind only insofar as it is not understood.\u2019\u201d (Engels in Anti-Duhring) This means recognition of the rule of objective laws in Nature and of the dialectical transformation of necessity into freedom (in the same manner as the transformation of the uncognized but cognizable \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d into the \u201cthing-for-us\u201d, of the \u201cessence of things\u201d into \u201cphenomena\u201d). Marx and Engels considered that the \u201cold\u201d materialism, including that of Feuerbach (and still more the \u201cvulgar\u201d materialism of Buchner, Vogt and Moleschott), contained the following major shortcomings:\n\n()\n \n \n()\n \n \n()\nthis materialism was \u201cpredominantly mechanical,\u201d failing to take account of the\nlatest developments in chemistry and biology (today it would be necessary to add:\nand in the electrical theory of matter);\nthe old materialism was non-historical and non-dialectical (metaphysical, in the\nmeaning of anti-dialectical), and did not adhere consistently and comprehensively\nto the standpoint of development;\nit regarded the \u201chuman essence\u201d in the abstract, not as the \u201ccomplex of\nall\u201d (concretely and historically determined) \u201csocial relations\u201d, and therefore\nmerely \u201cinterpreted\u201d the world, whereas it was a question of \u201cchanging\u201d it,\ni.e., it did not understand the importance of \u201crevolutionary practical activity\u201d.\nDialectics\nAs the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development, and the richest in content, Hegelian dialectics was considered by Marx and Engels the greatest achievement of classical German philosophy. They thought that any other formulation of the principle of development, of evolution, was one-sided and poor in content, and could only distort and mutilate the actual course of development (which often proceeds by leaps, and via catastrophes and revolutions) in Nature and in society.\n\n\u201cMarx and I were pretty well the only people to rescue conscious dialectics [from the destruction of idealism, including Hegelianism] and apply it in the materialist conception of Nature.... Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern natural science that it has furnished extremely rich [this was written before the discovery of radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements, etc.!] and daily increasing materials for this test, and has thus proved that in the last analysis Nature\u2019s process is dialectical and not metaphysical.\n\n\u201c The great basic thought,\u201d Engels writes, \u201cthat the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away... this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two different things.... For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain.\u201d Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is \u201cthe science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and of human thought.\u201d[]\n\nThis revolutionary aspect of Hegel\u2019s philosophy was adopted and developed by Marx. Dialectical materialism \u201cdoes not need any philosophy standing above the other sciences.\u201d From previous philosophy there remains \u201cthe science of thought and its laws\u2014formal logic and dialectics.\u201d Dialectics, as understood by Marx, and also in conformity with Hegel, includes what is now called the theory of knowledge, or epistemology, studying and generalizing the original and development of knowledge, the transition from non-knowledge to knowledge.\n\nIn our times, the idea of development, of evolution, has almost completely penetrated social consciousness, only in other ways, and not through Hegelian philosophy. Still, this idea, as formulated by Marx and Engels on the basis of Hegels\u2019 philosophy, is far more comprehensive and far richer in content than the current idea of evolution is. A development that repeats, as it were, stages that have already been passed, but repeats them in a different way, on a higher basis (\u201cthe negation of the negation\u201d), a development, so to speak, that proceeds in spirals, not in a straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes, and revolutions; \u201cbreaks in continuity\u201d; the transformation of quantity into quality; inner impulses towards development, imparted by the contradiction and conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite laws\u2014these are some of the features of dialectics as a doctrine of development that is richer than the conventional one. (Cf. Marx\u2019s letter to Engels of January , , in which he ridicules Stein\u2019s \u201cwooden trichotomies,\u201d which it would be absurd to confuse with materialist dialectics.)\n\nThe Materialist Conception of History\nA realization of the inconsistency, incompleteness, and onesidedness of the old materialism convinced Marx of the necessity of \u201cbringing the science of society... into harmony with the materialist foundation, and of reconstructing it thereupon.\u201d[] Since materialism in general explains consciousness as the outcome of being, and not conversely, then materialism as applied to the social life of mankind has to explain social consciousness as the outcome of social being. \u201cTechnology,\u201d Marx writes (Capital, Vol. I), \u201cdiscloses man\u2019s mode of dealing with Nature, the immediate process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them.\u201d[] In the preface to his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx gives an integral formulation of the fundamental principles of materialism as applied to human society and its history, in the following words:\n\n\u201cIn the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces.\n\n\u201cThe sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or\u2014what is but a legal expression for the same thing\u2014with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophic\u2014in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out.\n\n\u201cJust as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so we cannot judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production.... In broad outlines, Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society.\u201d[] [Cf. Marx\u2019s brief formulation in a letter to Engels dated July , : \u201cOur theory that the organization of labor is determined by the means of production.\u201d]\n\nThe discovery of the materialist conception of history, or more correctly, the consistent continuation and extension of materialism into the domain of social phenomena, removed the two chief shortcomings in earlier historical theories. In the first place, the latter at best examined only the ideological motives in the historical activities of human beings, without investigating the origins of those motives, or ascertaining the objective laws governing the development of the system of social relations, or seeing the roots of these relations in the degree of development reached by material production; in the second place, the earlier theories did not embrace the activities of the masses of the population, whereas historical materialism made it possible for the first time to study with scientific accuracy the social conditions of the life of the masses, and the changes in those conditions. At best, pre-Marxist \u201csociology\u201d and historiography brought forth an accumulation of raw facts, collected at random, and a description of individual aspects of the historical process. By examining the totality of opposing tendencies, by reducing them to precisely definable conditions of life and production of the various classes of individual aspects of the historical process. By examining the choice of a particular \u201cdominant\u201d idea or in its interpretation, and by revealing that, without exception, all ideas and all the various tendencies stem from the condition of the material forces of production, Marxism indicated the way to an all-embracing and comprehensive study of the process of the rise, development, and decline of socio-economic systems. People make their own history but what determines the motives of people, of the mass of people\u2014i.e., what is the sum total of all these clashes in the mass of human societies? What are the objective conditions of production of material life that form the basis of all man\u2019s historical activity? What is the law of development of these conditions? To all these Marx drew attention and indicated the way to a scientific study of history as a single process which, with all its immense variety and contradictoriness, is governed by definite laws.\n\nThe Class Struggle\nIt is common knowledge that, in any given society, the striving of some of its members conflict with the strivings of others, that social life is full of contradictions, and that history reveals a struggle between nations and societies, as well as within nations and societies, and, besides, an alternation of periods of revolution and reaction, peace and war, stagnation and rapid progress or decline. Marxism has provided the guidance \u2014i.e., the theory of the class struggle\u2014for the discovery of the laws governing this seeming maze and chaos. It is only a study of the sum of the strivings of all the members of a given society or group of societies that can lead to a scientific definition of the result of those strivings. Now the conflicting strivings stem from the difference in the position and mode of life of the classes into which each society is divided.\n\n\u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles,\u201d Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto (with the exception of the history of the primitive community, Engels added subsequently). \u201cFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\u201d\n\nEver since the Great French Revolution, European history has, in a number of countries, tellingly revealed what actually lies at the bottom of events\u2014the struggle of classes. The Restoration period in France[] already produced a number of historians (Thierry, Guizot, Mignet, and Thiers) who, in summing up what was taking place, were obliged to admit that the class struggle was taking place, were obliged to admit that the class struggle was the key to all French history. The modern period\u2014that of complete victory of the bourgeoisie, representative institutions, extensive (if not universal) suffrage, a cheap daily press that is widely circulated among the masses, etc., a period of powerful and ever-expanding unions of workers and unions of employers, etc.\u2014has shown even more strikingly (though sometimes in a very one-sided, \u201cpeaceful\u201d, and \u201cconstitutional\u201d form) the class struggle as the mainspring of events. The following passage from Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto will show us what Marx demanded of social science as regards an objective analysis of the position of each class in modern society, with reference to an analysis of each class\u2019s conditions of development:\n\n\u201cOf all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product. The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future interests; they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.\u201d\n\nIn a number of historical works (see Bibliography), Marx gave brilliant and profound examples of materialist historiography, of an analysis of the position of each individual class, and sometimes of various groups or strata within a class, showing plainly why and how \u201cevery class struggle is a political struggle.\u201d[] The above-quoted passage is an illustration of what a complex network of social relations and transitional stages from one class to another, from the past to the future, was analyzed by Marx so as to determine the resultant of historical development.\n\nMarx\u2019s economic doctrine is the most profound, comprehensive and detailed confirmation and application of his theory.\n\n \n\nNotes\n[] See Marx and Engels, The Holy Family (Chapter Eight)\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Agnoticism\u2014An idealist philosophical theory asserting that the world in unknowable, that the human mind is limited and cannot know anything beyond the realms of sensations. Agnosticism has various forms: some agnostics recognize the objective existence of the material world but deny the possibility of knowing it, others deny the existence of the material world on the plea that man cannot know whether anything exists beyond his sensations.\n\nCriticism\u2014Kant gave this name to his idealist philosophy, considering the criticism of man\u2019s cognitive ability to be the purpose of that philosophy. Kant\u2019s criticism led him to the conviction that human reason cannot know the nature of things.\n\nPositivism\u2014A widespread trend in bourgeois philosophy and sociology, founded by Comte (-), a French philosopher and sociologist. The positivists deny the possibility of knowing inner regularities and relations and deny the significance of philosophy as a method of knowing and changing the objective world. They reduce philosophy to a summary of the data provided by the various branches of science and to a superficial description of the results of direct observation\u2014i.e., to \u201cpositive\u201d facts. Positivism considers itself to be \u201cabove\u201d both materialism and idealism but it is actually nothing more than a variety of subjective idealism.\u2014Ed.\n\n[] Frederick Engels: Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Frederick Engels: Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy\u2014Lenin\n\n[] Frederick Engels: Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy\u2014Lenin\n\n[] See Karl Marx, Capital.

An investigation into the relations of production in a given, historically defined society, in their inception, development, and decline\u2014such is the content of Marx\u2019s economic doctrine. In capitalist society, the production of commodities is predominant, and Marx\u2019s analysis therefore begins with an analysis of commodity.\n\nValue\nA commodity is, in the first place, a thing that satisfies a human want; in the second place, it is a thing that can be exchanged for another thing. The utility of a thing makes is use-value. Exchange-value (or, simply, value), is first of all the ratio, the proportion, in which a certain number of use-values of one kind can be exchanged for a certain number of use-values of another kind. Daily experience shows us that million upon millions of such exchanges are constantly equating with one another every kind of use-value, even the most diverse and incomparable. Now, what is there in common between these various things, things constantly equated with one another in a definite system of social relations? Their common feature is that they are products of labor. In exchanging products, people equate the most diverse kinds of labor. The production of commodities is a system of social relations in which individual producers create diverse products (the social division of labor), and in which all these products are equated with one another in the process of exchange. Consequently, what is common to all commodities is not the concrete labor of a definite branch of production, not labor of one particular kind, but abstract human labor\u2014human labor in general. All the labor power of a given society, as represented in the sum total of the values of all commodities, is one and the same human labor power. Thousands upon thousands of millions of acts of exchange prove this. Consequently, each particular commodity represents only a certain share of the socially necessary labor time. The magnitude of value is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor, or by the labor time that is socially necessary for the production of a given commodity, of a given use-value.\n\n\u201cWhenever, by an exchange, we equate as values our different products, by that very act, we also equate, as human labor, the different kind of labor expended upon them. We are not aware of this, nevertheless we do it.\u201d [Capital]. As one of the earlier economists said, value is a relation between two persons; only he should have added: a relation concealed beneath a material wrapping. We can understand what value is only when we consider it from the standpoint of the system of social relations of production in a particular historical type of society, moreover, or relations that manifest themselves in the mass phenomenon of exchange, a phenomenon which repeats itself thousands upon thousands of time. \u201cAs values, all commodities are only definite masses of congealed labor time.\u201d [A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy].\n\nAfter making a detailed analysis of the twofold character of the labor incorporated in commodities, Marx goes on to analyze the form of value and money. Here, Marx\u2019s main task is to study the origin of the money form of value, to study the historical process of the development of exchange, beginning with individual and incidental acts of exchange (the \u201celementary or accidental form of value\u201d, in which a given quantity of one commmodity is exchanged for a given quantity of another), passing on to the universal form of value, in which a number of different commodities are exchanged for one and the same particular commodity, and ending with the money form of value, when gold becomes that particular commodity, the universal equivalent. As the highest product of the development of exchange and commodity production, money masks, conceals, the social character of all individual labor, the social link between individual producers united by the market. Marx analyzes the various functions of money in very great detail; it is important to note here in particular (as in the opening chapters of Capital in general) that what seems to be an abstract and at times purely deductive mode of exposition deals in reality with a gigantic collection of factual material on the history of the development of exchange and commodity production.\n\n\u201cIf we consider money, its existence implies a definite stage in the exchange of commodities. The particular functions of money, which it performs either as the mere equivalent of commodities or as means of circulation, or means of payment, as hoard or as universal money, point, according to the extent and relative preponderance of the one function or the other, to very different stages in the process of social production.\u201d [Capital].\n\nSurplus Value\nAt a certain stage in the development of commodity production money becomes transformed into capital. The formula of commodity circulation was C-M-C (commodity\u2014money\u2014commodity)\u2014i.e., the sale of one commodity for the purpose of buying another.\n\nThe general formula of capital, on the contrary, is M-C-M\u2014i.e., the purchase for the purpose of selling (at a profit).\n\nThe increase over the original value of the money that is put into circulation is called by Marx surplus value. The fact of this \u201cgrowth\u201d of money in capitalist circulation is common knowledge. Indeed, it is this \u201cgrowth\u201d which transforms money into capital, as a special and historically determined social relation of production. Surplus value cannot arise out of commodity circulation, for the latter knows only the exchange of equivalents; neither can it arise out of price increases, for the mutual losses and gains of buyers and sellers would equalize one another, whereas what we have here in not an individual phenomenon but a mass, average and social phenomenon. To obtain surplus value, the owner of money \u201cmust ... find... in the market a commodity, whose use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value\u201d [Capital]\u2014a commodity whose process of consumption is at the same time a process of the creation of value. Such a commodity exists\u2014human labor power. Its consumption is labor, and labor creates value. The owner of money buys labor power at its value, which, like the value of every other commodity, is determined by the socially necessary labor time requisite for its production (i.e., the cost of maintaining the worker and his family). Having bought enough labor power, the owner of money is entitled to use it, that is, to set it to work for a whole day\u2014 hours, let us say. Yet, in the course of six hours (\u201cnecessary\u201d labor time) the worker creates product sufficient to cover the cost of his own maintenance; in the course of the next six hours (\u201csurplus\u201d labor time), he creates \u201csurplus\u201d product, or surplus value, for which the capitalist does not pay. Therefore, from the standpoint of the process of production, two parts must be distinguished in capital: constant capital, which is expended on means of production (machinery, tools, raw materials, etc.), whose value, without any change, is transferred (immediately or part by part) to the finished product; secondly, variable capital, which is expended on labor power. The value of this latter capital is not invariable, but grows in the labor process, creating surplus value. Therefore, to express the degree of capital\u2019s exploitation of labor power, surplus must be compared not with the entire capital but only with variable capital. Thus, in the example just given, the rate of surplus value, as Marx calls this ratio, will be :, i.e.,  per cent.\n\nThere were two historical prerequisites for capital to arise: first, the accumulation of certain sums of money in the hands of individuals under conditions of a relatively high level of development of commodity production in general; secondly, the existence of a worker who is \u201cfree\u201d in a double sense: free of all constraint or restriction on the scale of his labor power, and free from the land and all means of production in general, a free and unattached laborer, a \u201cproletarian\u201d, who cannot subsist except by selling his labor power.\n\nThere are two main ways of increasing surplus value: lengthening the working day (\u201cabsolute surplus value\u201d), and reducing the necessary working day (\u201crelative surplus value\u201d). In analyzing the former, Marx gives a most impressive picture of the struggle of the working class for a shorter working day and of interference by the state authority to lengthen the working day (from the th century to the th) and to reduce it (factory legislation in the th century). Since the appearance of Capital, the history of the working class movement in all civilized countries of the world has provided a wealth of new facts amplifying this picture.\n\nAnalyzing the production of relative surplus value, Marx investigates the three fundamental historical stages in capitalism\u2019s increase of the productivity of labor: () simple co-operation; () the division of labor, and manufacture; () machinery and large-scale industry. How profoundly Marx has here revealed the basic and typical features of capitalist development is shown incidentally by the fact that investigations into the handicraft industries in Russia furnish abundant material illustrating the first two of the mentioned stages. The revolutionizing effect of large-scale machine industry, as described by Marx in , has revealed itself in a number of \u201cnew\u201d countries (Russia, Japan, etc.), in the course of the half-century that has since elapsed.\n\nTo continue. New and important in the highest degree is Marx\u2019s analysis of the accumulation of capital\u2014i.e., the transformation of a part of surplus value into capital, and its use, not for satisfying the personal needs of whims of the capitalist, but for new production. Marx revealed the error made by all earlier classical political economists (beginning with Adam Smith), who assumed that the entire surplus value which is transformed into capital goes to form variable capital. In actual fact, it is divided into means of production and variable capital. Of tremendous importance to the process of development of capitalism and its transformation into socialism is the more rapid growth of the constant capital share (of the total capital) as compared with the variable capital share.\n\nBy speeding up the supplanting of workers by machinery and by creating wealth at one extreme and poverty at the other, the accumulation of capital also gives rise to what is called the \u201creserve army of labor\u201d, to the \u201crelative surplus\u201d of workers, or \u201ccapitalist overpopulation\u201d, which assumes the most diverse forms and enables capital to expand production extremely rapidly. In conjunction with credit facilities and the accumulation of capital in the form of means of production, this incidentally is the key to an understanding of the crises of overproduction which occur periodically in capitalist countries\u2014at first at an average of every  years, and later at more lengthy and less definite intervals. From the accumulation of capital under capitalism we should distinguish what is known as primitive accumulation: the forcible divorcement of the worker from the means of production, the driving of the peasant off the land, the stealing of communal lands, the system of colonies and national debts, protective tariffs, and the like. \u201cPrimitive accumulation\u201d creates the \u201cfree\u201d proletarian at one extreme, and the owner of money, the capitalist, at the other.\n\nThe \u201chistorical tendency of capitalist accumulation\u201d is described by Marx in the following celebrated words:\n\n\u201cThe expropriation of the immediate producers is accomplished with merciless vandalism, and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous, the most sordid, the pettiest, the most meanly odious. Self-earned private property [of the peasant and handicraftsman], that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others.... That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers. This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself, by the centralization of capital. One capitalist always kills many. Hand in hand with this centralization, or this expropriation of many capitalists by few, develop, on an ever extending scale, the co-operative form of the labor process, the conscious technical application of science, the methodical cultivation of the soil, the transformation of the instruments of labor into instruments of labor only usable in common, the economizing of all means of production by their use as the means of production of combined, socialized labor, the entanglement of all people in the net of the world market, and with this the international character of the capitalistic regime. Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital, who usurp and monopolize all advantages of this process of transformation, grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation; but with this too grows the revolt of the working class, a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organized by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has sprung up and flourished along with, and under, it. Centralization of the means of production and socialization of labor at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument. The integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sound. The expropriators are expropriated.\u201d (Capital, Volume I)\n\nAlso new and important in the highest degree is the analysis Marx gives, in Volume Two of Capital of the reproduction of aggregate social capital. Here, too, Marx deals, not with an individual phenomenon but with a mass phenomenon; not with a fractional part of the economy of society, but with that economy as a whole. Correcting the aforementioned error of the classical economists, Marx divides the whole of social production into two big sections: (I) production of the means of production, and (II) production of articles of consumption, and examines in detail, with numerical examples, the circulation of the aggregate social capital\u2014both when reproduced in its former dimension and in the case of accumulation. Volume Three of Capital solves the problem of how the average rate of profit is formed on the basis of the law of value. This immense stride forward made by economic science in the person of Marx consists in his having conducted an analysis, from the standpoint of mass economic phenomena, of the social economy as a whole, not from the standpoint of individual cases or of the external and superficial aspects of competition, to which vulgar political economy and the modern \u201ctheory of marginal utility\u201d[] frequently restrict themselves. Marx first analyzes the origin of surplus value, and then goes on to consider its division into profit, interest, and ground rent. Profit is the ratio between surplus value and the total capital invested in an undertaking. Capital with a \u201chigh organic composition\u201d (i.e., with a preponderance of constant capital over variable capital in excess of the social average) yields a rate of profit below the average; capital with a \u201clow organic composition\u201d yields a rate of profit above the average. Competition among capitalists, and their freedom to transfer their capital from one branch to another, will in both cases reduce the rate of profit to the average. The sum total of the values of all the commodities in a given society coincides with the sum total of the prices of the commodities, but, in individual undertakings and branches of production, as a result of competition, commodities are sold not at their values at the prices of production (or production prices), which are equal to the capital expended plus the average profit.\n\nIn this way, the well-known and indisputable fact of the divergence between prices and values and of the equalization of profits is fully explained by Marx on the basis of law of value, since the sum total of values of all commodities coincides with the sum total of prices. However, the equating of (social) value to (individual) prices does not take place simply and directly, but in a very complex way. It is quite natural that in a society of separate producers of commodities, who are united only by the market, a conformity to law can be only an average, social, mass manifestation, with individual deviations in either direction mutually compensating one another.\n\nA rise in the productivity of labor implies a more rapid growth of constant capital as compared with variable capital. Inasmuch as surplus value is a function of variable capital alone, it is obvious that the rate of profit (the ratio of surplus value to the whole capital, not to its variable part alone) tends to fall. Marx makes a detailed analysis of this tendency and of a number of circumstances that conceal or counteract it. Without pausing to deal with the extremely interesting sections of Volume Three of Capital, Vol. I devoted to usurer\u2019s capital, commercial capital and money capital, we must pass on to the most important section\u2014the theory of ground rent. Since the area of land is limited and, in capitalist countries, the land is all held by individual private owners, the price of production of agricultural products is determined by the cost of production, not on soil of average quality but on the worst soil; not under average conditions but under the worst conditions of delivery of produce to the market. The difference between this price and the price of production on better soil (or in better conditions) constitutes differential rent. Analyzing this in detail, and showing how it arises out of the difference in fertility of different plots of land, and out of the difference in the amount of capital invested in land, Marx fully reveals (see also Theories of Surplus Value, in which the criticism of Rodbertus is most noteworthy) the error of Ricardo, who considered that differential rent is derived only when there is a successive transition from better land to worse. On the contrary, there may be inverse transitions, land may pass from one category into others (owing to advances in agricultural techniques, the growth of towns, and so on), and the notorious \u201claw of diminishing returns\u201d, which charges Nature with the defects, limitations and contradictions of capitalism, is profoundly erroneous. Further, the equalisation of profit in all branches of industry and the national economy in general presupposes complete freedom of competition and the free flow of capital from one branch to another. However, the private ownership of land creates monopoly, which hinders that free flow. Because of that monopoly, the products of agriculture, where a lower organic composition of capital obtains, and consequently an individually higher rate of profit, do not enter into the quite free process of the equalisation of the rate of profit. As a monopolist, the landowner can keep the price above the average, and this monopoly price gives rise to absolute rent. Differential rent cannot be done away with under capitalism, but absolute rent can\u2014for instance, by the nationalisation of the land, by making it state property. That would undermine the monopoly of private landowners, and would mean the sole consistent and full operation of freedom of competition in agriculture. That is why, as Marx points out, bourgeois radicals have again and again in the course of history advanced this progressive bourgeois demand for nationalisation of the land, a demand which, however, frightens most of the bourgeoisie, because it would too closely affect another monopoly, one that is particularly important and \u201csensitive\u201d today\u2014the monopoly of the means of production in general. (A remarkably popular, concise, and clear exposition of his theory of the average rate of profit on capital and of absolute ground rent is given by Marx himself in a letter to Engels, dated August , . See Briefwechsel, Volume , pp. -; also the letter of August , , ibid., pp. -.)\n\nWith reference to the history of ground rent it is also important to note Marx\u2019s analysis showing how labor rent (the peasant creates surplus product by working on the lord\u2019s land) is transformed into rent paid in produce or in kind (the peasant creates surplus product by working on the lord\u2019s land) is transformed into rent paid in produce or in kind (the peasant creates surplus product on his own land and hands it over to the landlord because of \u201cnon-economic constraint\u201d), then into money-rent (rent in kind, which is converted into money\u2014the obrok[] of old Russia\u2014as a result of the development of commodity production), and finally into capitalist rent, when the peasant is replaced by the agricultural entrepreneur, who cultivates the soil with the help of hired labor. In connection with this analysis of the \u201cgenesis of capitalistic ground rent\u201d, note should be taken of a number of profound ideas (of particular importance to backward countries like Russia) expressed by Marx regarding the evolution of capitalism in agriculture:\n\n\u201cThe transformation of rent in kind into money-rent is furthermore not only inevitably accompanied, but even anticipated, by the formation of a class of propertyless day-laborers, who hire themselves out for money. During their genesis, when this new class appears but sporadically, the custom necessarily develops among the more prosperous peasants, subject to rent payments, of exploiting agricultural wage-laborers for their own account, much as in feudal times, when the more well-to-do peasant serfs themselves also held serfs. In this way, they gradually acquire the possibility of accumulating a certain amount of wealth and themselves becoming transformed into future capitalists. The old self-employed possessors of land themselves just give rise to a nursery school for capitalist tenants, whose development is conditioned by the general development of capitalist production beyond the bounds of the countryside.\u201d [Capital, Vol. III]\n\n\u201cThe expropriation and eviction of a part of the agricultural population not only set free for industrial capital the laborers, their means of subsistence, and material for labor; it also created the home market.\u201d (Capital, Vol. I) In their turn, the impoverishment and ruin of the rural population play a part in the creation, for capital, or a reserve army of labor. In every capitalist country \u201cpart of the agricultural population is therefore constantly on the point of passing over into an urban or manufacturing [i.e., non-agricultural] proletariat.... This source of relative surplus population is thus constantly flowing.... The agricultural laborer is therefore reduced to the minimum of wages, and always stands with one foot already in the swamp of pauperism.\u201d (Capital, Vol. I) The peasant\u2019s private ownership of the land he tills is the foundation of small-scale production and the condition for its prospering and achieving the classical form. But such small-scale production is compatible only with a narrow and primitive framework of production and society. Under capitalism, the\n\n\u201cexploitation of the peasant differs only in form from the exploitation of the industrial proletariat. The exploiter is the same: capital. The individual capitalists exploit the individual peasant through mortgages and usury; the capitalist class exploits the peasant class through the state taxes.\u201d [The Class Struggles in France]\n\n\u201cThe small holding of the peasant is now only the pretext that allows the capitalist to draw profits, interest and rent from the soil, while leaving it to the tiller of the soil himself to see how he can extract his wages.\u201d (The Eighteenth Brumaire) As a rule, the peasant cedes to capitalist society\u2014i.e., to the capitalist class\u2014even a part of the wages, sinking \u201cto the level of the Irish tenant farmer\u2014all under the pretense of being a private proprietor.\u201d (The Class Struggles In France)\n\nWhat is \u201cone of the reasons why grain prices are lower in countries with predominant small-peasant land proprietorship than in countries with a capitalist mode of production?\u201d [Capital, Vol. III] It is that the peasant hands over gratis to society (i.e., the capitalist class) a part of his surplus product. \u201cThis lower price [of grain and other agricultural produce] is consequently a result of the producers\u2019 poverty and by no means of their labor productivity.\u201d [Capital, Vol. III] Under capitalism, the small-holding system, which is the normal form of small-scale production, degenerates, collapses, and perishes.\n\n\u201cProprietorship of land parcels, by its very nature, excludes the development of social productive forces of labor, social forms of labor, social concentration of capital, large-scale cattle raising, and the progressive application of science. Usury and a taxation system must impoverish it everywhere. The expenditure of capital in the price of the land withdraws this capital from cultivation. An infinite fragmentation of means of production and isolation of the producers themselves.\u201d\n\n(Co-operative societies, i.e., associations of small peasants, while playing an extremely progressive bourgeois role, only weakens this tendency, without eliminating it; nor must it be forgotten that these co-operative societies do much for the well-to-do peasants, and very little\u2014next to nothing\u2014for the mass of poor peasants; then the associations themselves become exploiters of hired labor.)\n\n\u201cMonstrous waste of human energy. Progressive deterioration of conditions of production and increased prices of means of production\u2014an inevitable law of proprietorship of parcels.\u201d [Capital, Volume III] In agriculture, as in industry, capitalism transforms the process of production only at the price of the \u201cmartyrdom of the producer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dispersion of the rural laborers over larger areas breaks their power of resistance, while concentration increases that of the town operatives. In modern agriculture, as in the urban industries, the increased productiveness and quantity of the labor set in motion are bought at the cost of laying waste and consuming by disease labor power itself. Moreover, all progress in capitalistic agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the laborer, but of robbing the soil.... Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth\u2014the soil and the laborer.\u201d [Capital, Volume III]\n\nSocialism\nFrom the foregoing, it is evident that Marx deduces the inevitability of the transformation of capitalist society into socialist society and wholly and exclusively from the economic law of the development of contemporary society. The socialization of labor, which is advancing ever more rapidly in thousands of forms and has manifested itself very strikingly, during the half-century since the death of Marx, in the growth of large-scale production, capitalist cartels, syndicates and trusts, as well as in the gigantic increase in the dimensions and power of finance capital, provides the principal material foundation for the inevitable advent of socialism. The intellectual and moral motive force and the physical executor of this transformation is the proletariat, which has been trained by capitalism itself. The proletariat\u2019s struggle against the bourgeoisie, which finds expression in a variety of forms ever richer in content, inevitably becomes a political struggle directed towards the conquest of political power by the proletariat (\u201cthe dictatorship of the proletariat\u201d). The socialization of production cannot but lead to the means of production becoming the property of society, to the \u201cexpropriation of the expropriators.\u201d A tremendous rise in labor productivity, a shorter working day, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins, of small-scale, primitive and disunited production by collective and improved labor\u2014such are the direct consequences of this transformation. Capitalism breaks for all time the ties between agriculture and industry, but at the same time, through its highest development, it prepares new elements of those ties, a union between industry and agriculture based on the conscious application of science and the concentration of collective labor, and on a redistribution of the human population (thus putting an end both to rural backwardness, isolation and barbarism, and to the unnatural concentration of vast masses of people in big cities). A new form of family, new conditions in the status of women and in the upbringing of the younger generation are prepared by the highest forms of present-day capitalism: the labor of women and children and the break-up of the patriarchal family by capitalism inevitably assume the most terrible, disastrous, and repulsive forms in modern society. Nevertheless,\n\n\u201cmodern industry, by assigning as it does, an important part in the socially organized process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes. It is, of course, just as absurd to hold the Teutonic-Christian form of the family to be absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the ancient Roman, the ancient Greek, or the Eastern forms which, moreover, taken together form a series in historic development. Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages, must necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of human development; although in its spontaneously developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the laborer exists for the process of production, and not the process of production for the laborer, that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery.\u201d (Capital, Vol. I, end of Chapter )\n\nThe factory system contains\n\n\u201cthe germ of the education of the future, an education that will, in the ease of every child over a given age, combine productive labor with instruction and gymnastics, not only as one of the methods of adding to the efficiency of social production, but as the only method of producing fully developed human beings.\u201d [ibid.]\n\nMarx\u2019s socialism places the problems of nationality and of the state on the same historical footing, not only in the sense of explaining the past but also in the sense of a bold forecast of the future and of bold practical action for its achievement. Nations are an inevitable product, an inevitable form, in the bourgeois epoch of social development. The working class could not grow strong, become mature and take shape without \u201cconstituting itself within the nation,\u201d without being \u201cnational\u201d (\u201cthough not in the bourgeois sense of the word\u201d). The development of capitalism, however, breaks down national barriers more and more, does away with national seclusion, and substitutes class antagonisms for national antagonism. It is, therefore, perfectly true of the developed capitalist countries that \u201cthe workingmen have no country\u201d and that \u201cunited action\u201d by the workers, of the civilized countries at least, \u201cis one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat\u201d [Communist Manifesto]. That state, which is organized coercion, inevitably came into being at a definite stage in the development of society, when the latter had split into irreconcilable classes, and could not exist without an \u201cauthority\u201d ostensibly standing above society, and to a certain degree separate from society. Arising out of class contradictions, the state becomes \u201c...the state of the most powerful, economically dominant class, which, through the medium of the state, becomes also the politically dominant class, and thus acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed class. Thus, the state of antiquity was above all the state of the slave-owners for the purpose of holding down the slaves, as the feudal state was the organ of the nobility for holding down the peasant serfs and bondsmen, and the modern representative state is an instrument of exploitation of wage labor by capital.\u201d (Engels, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, a work in which the writer expounds his own views and Marx\u2019s.) Even the democratic republic, the freest and most progressive form of the bourgeois state, does not eliminate this fact in any way, but merely modifies its form (the links between government and the stock exchange, the corruption\u2014direct and indirect\u2014of officialdom and the press, etc.). By leading to the abolition of classes, socialism will thereby lead to the abolition of the state as well. \u201cThe first act,\u201d Engels writes in Anti-D\u00fchring \u201cby virtue of which the state really constitutes itself the representative of society as a whole\u2014the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society\u2014is, at the same time, its last independent act as a state. The state interference in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and by the direction of the processes of production. The state is not \u2018abolished,\u2019 it withers away\u201d [Anti-D\u00fchring].\n\n\u201cThe society that will organize production on the basis of a free and equal association of the producers will put the whole machinery of state where it will then belong: into the Museum of Antiquities, by the side of the spinning wheel and the bronze axe.\u201d [Engels, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State].\n\nFinally, as regards the attitude of Marx\u2019s socialism towards the small peasantry, which will continue to exist in the period of the expropriation of the expropriators, we must refer to a declaration made by Engels, which expresses Marx\u2019s views:\n\n\u201c...when we are in possession of state power we shall not even think of forcibly expropriating the small peasants (regardless of whether with or without compensation), as we shall have to do in the case of the big landowners. Our task relative to the small peasant consists, in the first place, in effecting a transition of his private enterprise and private possession to co-operative ones, not forcibly but by dint of example and the proffer of social assistance for this purpose. And then of course we shall have ample means of showing to the small peasant prospective advantages that must be obvious to him even today.\u201d [Engels, The Peasant Question in France and Germany, [] published by Alexeyeva; there are errors in the Russian translation. Original in Die Neue Zeit].\n\n Tactics of the Class Struggle of the Proletariat\nAfter examining, as early as -, one of the main shortcomings in the earlier materialism\u2014namely, its inability to understand the conditions or appreciate the importance of practical revolutionary activity\u2014Marx, along with his theoretical work, devoted unremitting attention, throughout his lifetime, to the tactical problems of the proletariat\u2019s class struggle. An immense amount of material bearing on this is contained in all the works of Marx, particularly in the four volumes of his correspondence with Engels, published in . This material is still far from having been brought together, collected, examined and studied. We shall therefore have to confine ourselves here to the most general and brief remarks, emphasizing that Marx justly considered that, without this aspect, materialism is incomplete, onesided, and lifeless. The fundamental task of proletarian tactics was defined by Marx in strict conformity with all the postulates of his materialist-dialectical Weltanschauung [\u201cworld-view\u201d]. Only an objective consideration of the sum total of the relations between absolutely all the classes in a given society, and consequently a consideration of the objective stage of development reached by that society and of the relations between it and other societies, can serve as a basis for the correct tactics of an advanced class. At the same time, all classes and all countries are regarded, not statically, but dynamically \u2014i.e., not in a state of immobility\u2014but in motion (whose laws are determined by the economic conditions of existence of each class). Motion, in its turn, is regarded from the standpoint, not only of the past, but also of the future, and that not in the vulgar sense it is understood in by the \u201cevolutionists\u201d, who see only slow changes, but dialectically: \u201c...in developments of such magnitude  years are no more than a day,\u201c Marx wrote to Engels, \u201cthought later on there may come days in which  years are embodied\u201d (Briefwechsel, Vol. , p. ).[]\n\nAt each stage of development, at each moment, proletarian tactics must take account of this objectively inevitable dialectics of human history, on the one hand, utilizing the periods of political stagnation or of sluggish, so-called \u201cpeaceful\u201d development in order to develop the class-consciousness, strength and militancy of the advanced class, and, on the other hand, directing all the work of this utilization towards the \u201cultimate aim\u201d of that class\u2019s advance, towards creating in it the ability to find practical solutions for great tasks in the great days, in which \u201c years are embodied\u201d. Two of Marx\u2019s arguments are of special importance in this connection: one of these is contained in The Poverty of Philosophy, and concerns the economic struggle and economic organizations of the proletariat; the other is contained in the Communist Manifesto and concerns the asks of the proletariat. The former runs as follows:\n\n\u201cLarge-scale industry concentrates in one place a crowd of people unknown to one another. Competition divides their interests. But the maintenance of wages, this common interest which they have against their boss, unites them in a common thought of resistance\u2014combination.... Combinations, at first isolated, constitute themselves into groups ... and in face of always united capital, the maintenance of the association becomes more necessary to them [i.e., the workers] than that of wages.... In this struggle\u2014a veritable civil war\u2014all the elements necessary for coming battle unite and develop. Once it has reached this point, association takes on a political character. (Marx, The Poverty of Philosopy, )\n\nHere we have the programme and tactics of the economic struggle and of the trade union movement for several decades to come, for all the lengthy period in which the proletariat will prepare its forces for the \u201ccoming battle.\u201d All this should be compared with numerous references by Marx and Engels to the example of the British labor movement, showing how industrial \u201cproperty\u201d leads to attempts \u201cto buy the proletariat\u201d (Briefwechsel, Vol. , p. ).[] to divert them from the struggle; how this prosperity in general \u201cdemoralizes the workers\u201d (Vol. , p. ); how the British proletariat becomes \u201cbourgeoisified\u201d\u2014\u201cthis most bourgeois of all nations is apparently aiming ultimately at the possession of a bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat alongside the bourgeoisie\u201d Chartists (; Vol. , p. )[]; how the British workers\u2019 leaders are becoming a type midway between \u201ca radical bourgeois and a worker\u201d (in reference to Holyoak, Vol. , p. ); how, owning to Britain\u2019s monopoly, and as long as that monopoly lasts, \u201cthe British workingman will not budge\u201d (Vol. , p. ).[] The tactics of the economic struggle, in connection with the general course (and outcome) of the working-class movement, are considered here from a remarkably broad, comprehensive, dialectical, and genuinely revolutionary standpoint.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto advanced a fundamental Marxist principle on the tactics of the political struggle:\n\n\u201cThe Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement.\u201d That was why, in , Marx supported the party of the \u201cagrarian revolution\u201d in Poland, \u201cthat party which brought about the Krakow insurrection in .\u201d[]\n\nIn Germany, Marx, in  and , supported the extreme revolutionary democrats, and subsequently never retracted what he had then said about tactics. He regarded the German bourgeoisie as an element which was \u201cinclined from the very beginning to betray the people\u201d (only an alliance with the peasantry could have enabled the bourgeoisie to completely achieve its aims) \u201cand compromise with the crowned representatives of the old society.\u201d Here is Marx\u2019s summing-up of the German bourgeois-democratic revolution\u2014an analysis which, incidentally, is a sample of a materialism that examines society in motion, and, moreover, not only from the aspect of a motion that is backward:\n\n\u201cWithout faith in itself, without faith in the people, grumbling at those above, trembling before those below ... intimidated by the world storm ... no energy in any respect, plagiarism in every respect ... without initiative ... an execrable old man who saw himself doomed to guide and deflect the first youthful impulses of a robust people in his own senile interests....\u201d (Neue Rheinische Zeitung, ; see Literarischer Nachlass, Vol. , p. .)[]\n\nAbout  years later, Marx declared, in a letter to Engels (Briefwechsel, Vol. , p.), that the Revolution of  had failed because the bourgeoisie had preferred peace with slavery to the mere prospect of a fight for freedom. When the revolutionary period of - ended, Marx opposed any attempt to play at revolution (his struggle against Schapper and Willich), and insisted on the ability to work in a new phase, which in a quasi-\u201cpeaceful\u201d way was preparing new revolutions. The spirit in which Marx wanted this work to be conducted is to be seen in his appraisal of the situation in Germany in , the darkest period of reaction: \u201cThe whole thing in Germany will depend on the possibility of backing the proletarian revolution by some second edition of the Peasant War\u201d (Briefwechsel, Vol. , p. ).[] While the democratic (bourgeois) revolution in Germany was uncompleted, Marx focused every attention, in the tactics of the socialist proletariat, on developing the democratic energy of the peasantry. He held that Lassalle\u2019s attitude was \u201cobjectively... a betrayal of the whole workers\u2019 movement to Prussia\u201d (Vol. , p.), incidentally because Lassalle was tolerant of the Junkers and Prussian nationalism.\n\n\u201cIn a predominantly agricultural country,\u201d Engels wrote in , in exchanging views with Marx on their forthcoming joint declaration in the press, \u201c...it is dastardly to make an exclusive attack on the bourgeoisie in the name of the industrial proletariat but never to devote a word to the patriarchal exploitation of the rural proletariat under the lash of the great feudal aristocracy\u201d (Vol. , p. ).[]\n\nFrom  to , when the period of the consummation of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany was coming to an end, a period in which the Prussian and Austrian exploiting classes were struggling to complete that revolution in one way or another from above, Marx not only rebuked Lassalle, who was coquetting with Bismarck, but also corrected Liebknecht, who had \u201clapsed into Austrophilism\u201d and a defense of particularism; Marx demanded revolutionary tactics which would combat with equal ruthlessness both Bismarck and the Austrophiles, tactics which would not be adapted to the \u201cvictor\u201d\u2014the Prussian Junkers\u2014but would immediately renew the revolutionary struggle against him despite the conditions created by the Prussian military victories (Briefwechsel, Vol. , pp. , , , , , , , , , -).\n\nIn the celebrated Address of the International of September  , Marx warned the French proletariat against an untimely uprising, but when an uprising nevertheless took place (), Marx enthusiastically hailed the revolutionary initiative of the masses, who were \u201cstorming heaven\u201d (Marx\u2019s letter to Kugelmann).\n\nFrom the standpoint of Marx\u2019s dialectical materialism, the defeat of revolutionary action in that situation, as in many other, was a lesser evil, in the general course and outcome of the proletarian struggle, than the abandonment of a position already occupied, than surrender without battle. Such a surrender would have demoralised the proletariat and weakened its militancy. While fully appreciating the use of legal means of struggle during periods of political stagnation and the domination of bourgeois legality, Marx, in  and , following the passage of the Anti-Socialist Law,[] sharply condemned Most\u2019s \u201crevolutionary phrases\u201d; no less sharply, if not more so, did he attack the opportunism that had for a time come over the official Social-Democratic Party, which did not at once display resoluteness, firmness, revolutionary spirit and the readiness to resort to an illegal struggle in response to the Anti-Socialist Law (Briefwechsel, Vol. , pp. , , , , ; cf. also letters to Sorge).\n\n \n\n \n\nNotes\n[] The reference is to the democratic uprising for national liberation in the Krakow Republic which in  was placed under the joint control of Austria, Prussia and Russia. The rebels set up a National Government which issued a manifesto proclaiming abolition of feudal services and promising to give the peasants lands without redemption. In its other proclamations it announced the establishment of national workshops with higher wages and the introduction of equal rights for all citizens. Soon, however, the uprising was suppressed.\u2014Ed.\n\nBibliography\nNo complete collection of Marx\u2019s works and letters has yet been published. More works by Marx have been translated into Russian than into any other language. The following list of Marx\u2019s writings is arranged in chronological order. In  Marx wrote his thesis on Epicurus\u2019s philosophy. (It was included in Literarischer Nachiass, of which more will be said later.) In this thesis, Marx still fully adhered to the Hegelian idealist point of view. In  Marx wrote articles for Rheinische Zeitung (Cologne), among them a criticism of the free-press debate in the Sixth Rhenish Diet, an article on the laws concerning the stealing of timber, another in defence of divorcing politics from theology, etc. (partly included in Literarischer Nachiass). Here we see signs of Marx\u2019s transition from idealism to materialism and from revolutionary democracy to communism. In , under the editorship of Marx and Arnold Ruge, there appeared in Paris Deutsche-Franzosische Jahrb\u00fccher, in which this transition was finally made. Among Marx\u2019s articles published in that magazine, the most noteworthy are A Criticism of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right (besides Literarischer Nachiass, also published as a separate pamphlet) and On the Jewish Question (likewise in Literarischer Nachiass; issued as a pamphlet brought out by the Znaniye Publishers in their Cheap Library, No. ). In , Marx and Engels jointly published, in Frankfort on Main, a pamphlet entitled The Holy Family. Against Bruno Bauer and Co. (besides Literarischer Nachiass, there are two Russian editions as pamphlets: one published by Novy Gobs in St. Petersburg, , the other by Vesinik Znaniya, St. Petersburg, ). In the spring of , Marx wrote his theses on Feuerbach (published as an appendix to Frederick Engels\u2019s pamphlet entitled Ludwig Feuerbach (there is a Russian translation). In - Marx wrote a number of articles (most of which have not been collected, republished, or translated into Russian) in the papers Vorw\u00e4rts, Deutsche Br\u00e4sseler-Zeitung (); Westphalisches Dampboot (Bide. fold, -); Der Gesellschatsspiegel (Elberfeld, ). In  Marx wrote his fundamental work against Proudhon, The Poverty of Philosophy, a reply to Proudhon\u2019s work The Philosophy of Poverty. The book was published in Brussels and Paris (there have been three publications in Russian by Novy Mir, one by G. Lvovich, one by Alexeyeva, and one by Prosveshcheniye, all in -). In  the Speech on Free Trade was published in Brussels (Russian translation available), followed by the publication in London, in collaboration with Frederick Engels, of the celebrated Manifesto of the Communist Party, which has been translated into probably all the languages of Europe and into a number of other languages (there are about eight Russian publications referring to  and ; by Molot, Kolokol, Alexeyeva, etc., most of which were confiscated. These appeared under various titles: The Communist Manifesto, On Communism, Social Classes and Communism, Capitalism and Communism, The Philosophy of History. A complete and most accurate translation of this, as well as of other works by Marx, will be found in the editions of the Emancipation of Labour group, issued abroad[]). From June , , to May , , Neue Rheinische Zeitung was published in Cologne with Marx as the actual editor-in-chief. His numerous articles for that paper, which to this very day remains the finest and unsurpassed organ of the revolutionary proletariat, have not been collected and republished in full. The most important of them were included in Literarischer Nachiass. Wage-Labour and Capital, published in that paper, has been repeatedly issued as a pamphlet (four Russian editions, by Kozman, Mobot, Myagkov, and Lvovich,  and ); also from the same paper The Liberals at the Helm (published by Znaniye Publishers in their Cheap Library, No. , St. Petersburg, ). In  Marx published, in Cologne, Two Political Trials (two speeches in his own defence by Marx, who was acquitted by a jury when facing trial on the charge of having violated the press law and called for armed resistance to the government. Russian translations are available in five publications brought out in  and  by Alexayeva, Molot, Myagkov, Znaniye, and Novy Mir). In  Marx published, in Hamburg, six issues of the magazine Neue Rheinische Zeitung. The most important articles published therein were later included in Literarischer Nachiass. Especially noteworthy are Marx\u2019s articles, republished by Engels in  in a pamphlet entitled Class Struggles in France, - (Russian translation, published by M. Malykh, Library, No. -; also in the Collection of Historical Works, translated by Bazarov and Stepanov and published by Skirmunt, St. Petersburg, ; also Thoughts and Views of the th Century, St. Petersburg, ). In  a pamphlet by Marx was published in New York under the title of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (Russian translation in publications just mentioned). In the same year a pamphlet was published in London under the title of Enth\u00fcllungen fiber den Communistenprozess in K\u00f6ln (Russian translation entitled The Cologne Trial of the Communards, Popular Science Library, No. , St. Petersburg, , Oct. ).\n\nFrom August  until ,[] Marx was a regular contributor to the New York Tribune, where many of his articles appeared unsigned, as editorials. Most outstanding among these is a series of articles, Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany, which were republished after the death of Marx and Engels in a German translation (a Russian translation is available in collections translated by Bazarov and Stepanov, and then, in pamphlet form, in five editions brought out in - by Alexeyeva, Obshchestvennaya Poiza, Novy Mir, Vseobshchaya Biblioteka and Molot). Some of Marx\u2019s articles in the Tribune were later published in London as separate pamphlets, as, for instance, the one on Palmerston, published in ; Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the th Century (regarding the constant venal dependence on Russia of the British Liberal Ministers), and others. After Marx\u2019s death, his daughter, Eleanor Aveling, published a number of his Tribune articles on the Oriental question, under the title of The Eastern Question, London, . Part has been translated into Russian: War and Revolution, Issue I, Marx and Engels: Unpublished Articles (, , ), Kharkov,  (Our Thought Library). From the end of , and during , Marx contributed to the Neue Oder-Zeitung and in - to the Viennese paper Presse. These articles have not been collected, and only a few of them were reprinted in Die Neue Zeit, as were also Marx\u2019s numerous letters. The same is true about Marx\u2019s articles from Das Volk (London, ) on the diplomatic history of the Italian War of . In  Marx\u2019s Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy appeared in Berlin (Russian translations: Moscow, , edited by Manuilov; St. Petersburg, , translated by Rumyantsev), In  a pamphlet by Marx, entitled Herr Vogt, appeared in London.\n\nIn  the Address of the International Workingmen\u2019s Association, which was written by Marx, came out in London (Russian translation available). Marx was the author of numerous manifestos, appeals and resolutions of the International\u2019s General Council. This material is far from having been analysed or even collected. The first approach to this work is Gustav Jaeckh\u2019s book, Die Internationale (in the Russian translation: St. Petersburg, , Znaniye Publishers), which includes several of Marx\u2019s letters and draft resolutions. Among the documents of the International that Marx wrote was the Address of the General Council on the Paris Commune. The document appeared in  in London, as a pamphlet entitled The Civil War in France (Russian translations: one edited by Lenin, Molot Publishers, and others). Between  and  Marx corresponded with Kugelniann, a member of the International (two Russian translations: one by A. Goikhbarg, the other edited by Lenin). In  Marx\u2019s main work, Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol. , appeared in Hamburg. Volumes  and  were published by Engels in  and , after the death of Marx. The Russian translations: Vol. , in five editions (two in a translation by Danielson,  and ; two in a translation by E. A. Gurvich and L. M. Zak, edited by Struve; st ed.\u2014, nd ed.\u2014; another edited by Bazarov and Stepauov). Volumes  and  appeared in a translation by Danielson (less satisfactory) and in another under the editorship of Bazarov and Stepanov (the better). In  Marx took part in the writing of Engels\u2019s Herrn Eugen D\u00fchrings Umw\u00e4lzung der Wissenschaft (Anti-D\u00fchring); he went over the manuscript of the whole work and wrote an entire chapter dealing with the history of political economy.\n\nThe following works by Marx were published posthumously: Critique of the Gotha Programme (St. Petersburg, , and in German in Die Neue Zeit, -, No, ); Value, Price and Profit (a lecture delivered on June , ; Die Neue Zeit, XVI, -; Russian translations, brought out by Molot, , and Lvovich, ); Aus dem literarischen Nachiass von Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels und Ferdinand Lassalle, three volumes, Stuttgart,  (Russian translation, edited by Axelrod and others,  vols., St. Petersburg, : Vol.  also edited by E. Gurvich, Moscow, . Lassalle\u2019s letters to Marx, published separately, are included in Literarischer Nachiass); Letters from K. Marx and F. Engels and Others to F. A. Sorge and Others (two editions in Russian; one edited by Axeirod, another published by Dauge, with a preface by Lenin); Theorien fiber den Mehrwert, three volumes in four parts, Stuttgart, -, which is the manuscript of the fourth volume of Capital and published by Kautsky (only the first volume translated into Russian; in three editions; St. Petersburg, , edited by Plekhanov; Kiev, , edited by Zheleznov, and Kiev, , edited by Tuchapsky). In  four big volumes of Marx-Engels Correspondence came out in Stuttgart, with , letters written between September  and January , , and providing a mass of highly valuable material for a study of Marx\u2019s biography and views. In , two volumes of Marx\u2019s and Engels\u2019s works appeared, containing their articles for - (in German). This list of Marx\u2019s works must conclude with a note that many of Marx\u2019s shorter articles and letters, published, for the most part, in Die Neue Zeit, Vorw\u00fcrts, and other German-language Social-Democratic periodicals, have not been enumerated. The list of Russian translations of Marx is no doubt incomplete especially with reference to pamphlets that appeared in -.\n\nThe literature on Marx and Marxism is very extensive. We shall mention only what is most outstanding, and divide the authors into three main groups: Marxists who, in important matters, adhere to Marx\u2019s point of view; bourgeois writers, in essence hostile to Marxism; and revisionists, who, while claiming to accept certain fundamentals of Marxism, in fact replace it with bourgeois conceptions. The Narodnik attitude towards Marx should be considered a peculiarly Russian variety of revisionism. In his Em Beitrag zur Bibliographie des Marxismus (Archiv f\u00fcr Soztalwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, XX, . Heft,[] , pp. -), Werner Sombart gives some three hundred titles in a list that is far from complete. More can be found in the indexes to Die Neue Zeit, -, et seq., also in Josef Stammhammer\u2019s Bibliographie des Sozialismus und Kommunismus, Bd. I\u2014III,[] Jena (\u2014). For a detailed bibliography on Marxism see also Bibliographic der Soztalwissenschaften, Berlin. Jahrgang , , u. ff.[]\n\nSee also N. A. Rubakin, Among Books (Vol. , nd ed.). We mention here only the most important bibliographies. On the subject of Marx\u2019s biography, attention must be called first of all to Frederick Engels\u2019s articles in Volkskalender,[] published by Bracke in Brunswick in  and in Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Staatswissenschatten, Bd. , S. \u2014[]; W.

It is impossible to understand Marxism and to propound it fully without taking into account all the works of Engels.\n\nFor a critique of Marx from the point of view of anarchism, see V. Cherkezov, The Doctrines of Marxism, two parts, St. Petersburg, ; V. Tucker, In Lieu of a Book [in Russian], Moscow, ; Sorel (a syndicalist), Social Studies of Modern Economy, Moscow, .\n\n \n\n Throughout the civilised world the teachings of Marx evoke the utmost hostility and hatred of all bourgeois science (both official and liberal), which regards Marxism as a kind of \u201cpernicious sect\u201d. And no other attitude is to be expected, for there can be no \u201cimpartial\u201d social science in a society based on class struggle. In one way or another, all official and liberal science defends wage-slavery, whereas Marxism has declared relentless war on that slavery. To expect science to be impartial in a wage-slave society is as foolishly na\u00efve as to expect impartiality from manufacturers on the question of whether workers\u2019 wages ought not to be increased by decreasing the profits of capital.\n\nBut this is not all. The history of philosophy and the history of social science show with perfect clarity that there is nothing resembling \u201csectarianism\u201d in Marxism, in the sense of its being a hidebound, petrified doctrine, a doctrine which arose away from the high road of the development of world civilisation. On the contrary, the genius of Marx consists precisely in his having furnished answers to questions already raised by the foremost minds of mankind. His doctrine emerged as the direct and immediate continuation of the teachings of the greatest representatives of philosophy, political economy and socialism.\n\nThe Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is comprehensive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or defence of bourgeois oppression. It is the legitimate successor to the best that man produced in the nineteenth century, as represented by German philosophy, English political economy and French socialism.\n\nIt is these three sources of Marxism, which are also its component parts that we shall outline in brief.\n\nI\nThe philosophy of Marxism is materialism. Throughout the modern history of Europe, and especially at the end of the eighteenth century in France, where a resolute struggle was conducted against every kind of medieval rubbish, against serfdom in institutions and ideas, materialism has proved to be the only philosophy that is consistent, true to all the teachings of natural science and hostile to superstition, cant and so forth. The enemies of democracy have, therefore, always exerted all their efforts to \u201crefute\u201d, under mine and defame materialism, and have advocated various forms of philosophical idealism, which always, in one way or another, amounts to the defence or support of religion.\n\nMarx and Engels defended philosophical materialism in the most determined manner and repeatedly explained how profoundly erroneous is every deviation from this basis. Their views are most clearly and fully expounded in the works of Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach and Anti-D\u00fchring, which, like the Communist Manifesto, are handbooks for every class-conscious worker.\n\nBut Marx did not stop at eighteenth-century materialism: he developed philosophy to a higher level, he enriched it with the achievements of German classical philosophy, especially of Hegel\u2019s system, which in its turn had led to the materialism of Feuerbach. The main achievement was dialectics, i.e., the doctrine of development in its fullest, deepest and most comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of the human knowledge that provides us with a reflection of eternally developing matter. The latest discoveries of natural science\u2014radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements\u2014have been a remarkable confirmation of Marx\u2019s dialectical materialism despite the teachings of the bourgeois philosophers with their \u201cnew\u201d reversions to old and decadent idealism.\n\nMarx deepened and developed philosophical materialism to the full, and extended the cognition of nature to include the cognition of human society. His historical materialism was a great achievement in scientific thinking. The chaos and arbitrariness that had previously reigned in views on history and politics were replaced by a strikingly integral and harmonious scientific theory, which shows how, in consequence of the growth of productive forces, out of one system of social life another and higher system develops\u2014how capitalism, for instance, grows out of feudalism.\n\nJust as man\u2019s knowledge reflects nature (i.e., developing matter), which exists independently of him, so man\u2019s social knowledge (i.e., his various views and doctrines\u2014philosophical, religious, political and so forth) reflects the economic system of society. Political institutions are a superstructure on the economic foundation. We see, for example, that the various political forms of the modern European states serve to strengthen the domination of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat.\n\nMarx\u2019s philosophy is a consummate philosophical materialism which has provided mankind, and especially the working class, with powerful instruments of knowledge.\n\nII\nHaving recognised that the economic system is the foundation on which the political superstructure is erected, Marx devoted his greatest attention to the study of this economic system. Marx\u2019s principal work, Capital, is devoted to a study of the economic system of modern, i.e., capitalist, society.\n\nClassical political economy, before Marx, evolved in England, the most developed of the capitalist countries. Adam Smith and David Ricardo, by their investigations of the economic system, laid the foundations of the labour theory of value. Marx continued their work; he provided a proof of the theory and developed it consistently. He showed that the value of every commodity is determined by the quantity of socially necessary labour time spent on its production.\n\nWhere the bourgeois economists saw a relation between things (the exchange of one commodity for another) Marx revealed a relation between people. The exchange of commodities expresses the connection between individual producers through the market. Money signifies that the connection is becoming closer and closer, inseparably uniting the entire economic life of the individual producers into one whole. Capital signifies a further development of this connection: man\u2019s labour-power becomes a commodity. The wage-worker sells his labour-power to the owner of land, factories and instruments of labour. The worker spends one part of the day covering the cost of maintaining himself and his family (wages), while the other part of the day he works without remuneration, creating for the capitalist surplus-value, the source of profit, the source of the wealth of the capitalist class.\n\nThe doctrine of surplus-value is the corner-stone of Marx\u2019s economic theory.\n\nCapital, created by the labour of the worker, crushes the worker, ruining small proprietors and creating an army of unemployed. In industry, the victory of large-scale production is immediately apparent, but the same phenomenon is also to be observed in agriculture, where the superiority of large-scale capitalist agriculture is enhanced, the use of machinery increases and the peasant economy, trapped by money-capital, declines and falls into ruin under the burden of its backward technique. The decline of small-scale production assumes different forms in agriculture, but the decline itself is an indisputable fact.\n\nBy destroying small-scale production, capital leads to an increase in productivity of labour and to the creation of a monopoly position for the associations of big capitalists. Production itself becomes more and more social\u2014hundreds of thousands and millions of workers become bound together in a regular economic organism\u2014but the product of this collective labour is appropriated by a handful of capitalists. Anarchy of production, crises, the furious chase after markets and the insecurity of existence of the mass of the population are intensified.\n\nBy increasing the dependence of the workers on capital, the capitalist system creates the great power of united labour.\n\nMarx traced the development of capitalism from embryonic commodity economy, from simple exchange, to its highest forms, to large-scale production.\n\nAnd the experience of all capitalist countries, old and new, year by year demonstrates clearly the truth of this Marxian doctrine to increasing numbers of workers.\n\nCapitalism has triumphed all over the world, but this triumph is only the prelude to the triumph of labour over capital.\n\nIII\nWhen feudalism was overthrown and \u201cfree\u201d capitalist society appeared in the world, it at once became apparent that this freedom meant a new system of oppression and exploitation of the working people. Various socialist doctrines immediately emerged as a reflection of and protest against this oppression. Early socialism, however, was utopian socialism. It criticised capitalist society, it condemned and damned it, it dreamed of its destruction, it had visions of a better order and endeavoured to convince the rich of the immorality of exploitation.\n\nBut utopian socialism could not indicate the real solution. It could not explain the real nature of wage-slavery under capitalism, it could not reveal the laws of capitalist development, or show what social force is capable of becoming the creator of a new society.\n\nMeanwhile, the stormy revolutions which everywhere in Europe, and especially in France, accompanied the fall of feudalism, of serfdom, more and more clearly revealed the struggle of classes as the basis and the driving force of all development.\n\nNot a single victory of political freedom over the feudal class was won except against desperate resistance. Not a single capitalist country evolved on a more or less free and democratic basis except by a life-and-death struggle between the various classes of capitalist society.\n\nThe genius of Marx lies in his having been the first to deduce from this the lesson world history teaches and to apply that lesson consistently. The deduction he made is the doctrine of the class struggle.\n\nPeople always have been the foolish victims of deception and self-deception in politics, and they always will be until they have learnt to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral, religious, political and social phrases, declarations and promises. Champions of reforms and improvements will always be fooled by the defenders of the old order until they realise that every old institution, how ever barbarous and rotten it may appear to be, is kept going by the forces of certain ruling classes. And there is only one way of smashing the resistance of those classes, and that is to find, in the very society which surrounds us, the forces which can\u2014and, owing to their social position, must\u2014constitute the power capable of sweeping away the old and creating the new, and to enlighten and organise those forces for the struggle.\n\nMarx\u2019s philosophical materialism alone has shown the proletariat the way out of the spiritual slavery in which all oppressed classes have hitherto languished. Marx\u2019s economic theory alone has explained the true position of the proletariat in the general system of capitalism.\n\nIndependent organisations of the proletariat are multi plying all over the world, from America to Japan and from Sweden to South Africa. The proletariat is becoming enlightened and educated by waging its class struggle; it is ridding itself of the prejudices of bourgeois society; it is rallying its ranks ever more closely and is learning to gauge the measure of its successes; it is steeling its forces and is growing irresistibly. Comrades,\n\nI have not yet been able to obtain the Petrograd papers for Wednesday, October . When the full text of Kamenev's and Zinoviev's statement in the non-Party paper Novaya Zhizn was transmitted to me by telephone, I refused to believe it. But, as it has turned out, there can be no doubt about it and I have to avail myself of this opportunity to get a letter to Party members by Thursday evening or Friday morning; for to remain silent in the face of such unheard-of strike-breaking would be a crime.\n\nThe more serious the practical problem, and the more responsible and \"prominent\" the persons guilty of strikebreaking, the more dangerous it is, the more resolutely must the strike-breakers be kicked out, and the more unpardonable would it be to stop even to consider the past \"services\" of the strike-breakers.\n\nJust think of it! It has been known in Party circles that the Party has been discussing the question of an insurrection since September. Nobody has ever heard of a single letter or manifesto by either of the persons named! Now, on the eve, one might say, of the Congress of Soviets, two prominent Bolsheviks come out against the majority, and, obviously, against the Central Committee. It is not said plainly, but the harm done to the cause is all the greater, for to speak in hints is even more dangerous.\n\nIt is perfectly clear from the text of Kamenev's and Zinoviev's statement that they have gone against the Central Committee, for otherwise their statement would be meaningless. But they do not say what specific decision of the Central Committee they are disputing.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe reason is obvious: because it has not been published by the Central Committee.\n\nWhat does this boil down to?\n\nOn a burning question of supreme importance, on the eve of the critical day of October , two \"prominent Bolsheviks\" attack an unpublished decision of the Party centre and attack it in the non-Party press and, furthermore, in a paper which on this very question is hand in glove with the bourgeoisie against the workers' party!\n\nThis is a thousand times more despicable and a million times more harmful than all the statements Plekhanov, for example, made in the non-Party press in -, and which the Party so sharply condemned! At that time it was only a question of elections, whereas now it is a question of an insurrection for the conquest of power!\n\nOn such a question, after a decision has been taken by the centre, to dispute this unpublished decision in front of the Rodzyankos and Kerenskys in a non-Party paper\u2014can you imagine an act more treacherous or blacklegging any worse?\n\nI should consider it disgraceful on my part if I were to hesitate to condemn these former comrades because of my earlier close relations with them. I declare outright that I no longer consider either of them comrades and that I will fight with all my might, both in the Central Committee and at the Congress, to secure the expulsion of both of them from the Party.\n\nA workers' party, which the course of events is confronting more and more frequently with the need for an insurrection, is unable to accomplish that difficult task if, after their adoption, unpublished decisions of the centre are disputed in the non-Party press, and vacillation and confusion are brought into the ranks of the fighters.\n\nLet Mr. Zinoviev and Mr. Kamenev found their own party with the dozens of perplexed people or with candidates for election to the Constituent Assembly. The workers will not loin such a party, for its first slogan will be:\n\n\"Members of the Central Committee who are defeated at a meeting of the Central Committee on the question of a decisive fight are permitted to resort to the non-Party press for the purpose of attacking the unpublished decisions of the Party.\"\n\nLet them build themselves such a party; our workers' Bolshevik Party will only gain from it.\n\nWhen all the documents are published, the strike-breaking act of Zinoviev and Kamenev will stand out even more glaringly. Meanwhile, let the workers consider the following question:\n\n'Let us assume that the Executive Committee of an all-Russia trade union had decided, after a month of deliberation and by a majority of over  per cent, that preparations must be made for a strike, but that for the time being neither the date nor any other details should be divulged. Let us assume that, after the decision had been taken, two members, under the false pretext of a \"dissenting opinion\", not only began to write to local groups urging a reconsideration of the decision, but also permitted their letters to be communicated to non-Party newspapers. Let us assume, finally, that they themselves attacked the decision in non-Party papers, although it had not yet been published, and began to vilify the strike in front of the capitalists.\n\n'We ask, would the workers hesitate to expel such blacklegs from their midst?'\n\n* * *\nAs to the situation with regard to an insurrection now, when October  is so close at hand, I cannot judge from afar to what exact extent the cause has been damaged by the strikebreaking statement in the non-Party press. There is no doubt that very great practical damage has been done. In order to remedy the situation, it is necessary first of all to restore unity in the Bolshevik front by expelling the blacklegs.\n\nThe weakness of the ideological arguments against an insurrection will become clearer, the more we drag them into the light of day. I recently sent an article on this subject to Rabochy Put, and if the editors do not find it possible to print it, Party members will probably acquaint themselves with it in the manuscript.See pp. - of this volume\u2014Ed.\n\nThere are basically two so-called \"ideological\" arguments. First, that it is necessary to \"wait\" for the Constituent Assembly. Let us wait, perhaps we can hold on until then\u2014 that is the whole argument. Perhaps, despite famine, despite economic chaos, despite the fact that the patience of the soldiers is exhausted, despite Rodzyanko's steps to surrender Petrograd to the Germans, despite the lockouts, perhaps we can hold on.\n\nPerhaps and maybe\u2014that is the whole point of the argument.\n\nThe second is noisy pessimism. Everything is fine with the bourgeoisie and Kerensky; everything is wrong with us. The capitalists have prepared everything wonderfully; everything is wrong with the workers. The \"pessimists\" are shouting at the top of their voices about the military side of the matter, but the \"optimists\" are silent, for to disclose certain things to Rodzyanko and Kerensky is hardly pleasant to anybody but blacklegs.\n\nDifficult times. A hard task. A grave betrayal.\n\nNevertheless, the task will be accomplished; the workers will consolidate their ranks, the peasant revolt and the extreme impatience of the soldiers at the front will do their work! Let us close our ranks\u2014the proletariat must win!\n\nN. Lenin Dear Comrades,\n\nNo self-respecting party can tolerate strike-breaking and blacklegs [Scabs\u2014Transcriber] in its midst. That is obvious. The more we reflect upon Zinoviev's and Kamenev's statement in the non-Party press, the more self-evident it becomes that their action is strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. Kamenev's evasion at the meeting of the Petrograd Soviet is something really despicable. He is, don't you see, in full agreement with Trotsky: But is it so difficult to understand that in the face of the enemy, Trotsky could not have said, he had no right to say, and should not have said more than he did? Is it so difficult to understand that it is a duty to the Party which has concealed its decision from the enemy (on the necessity for an armed uprising, on the fact that the time for it is fully ripe, on the thorough preparations to be made for it, etc.), and it is this decision that makes it obligatory in public statements to fasten not only the \"blame\", but also the initiative upon the adversary? Only a child could fail to understand that. Kamenev's evasion is a sheer fraud. The same must be said of Zinoviev's evasion, at least of his letter of \"justification\"(written, I think, to the Central Organ), which is the only document I have seen(for, as to a dissenting opinion, \"an alleged dissenting opinion\", which has been trumpeted in the bourgeois press, I, a member of the Central Committee, have to this very day seen nothing of it). Among Zinoviev's \"arguments\" there is this: Lenin, he says, sent out his letters \"before any decisions were adopted\", and you did not protest. That is literally what Zinoviev wrote, himself underlining the word before four times. Is it really so difficult to understand that before a decision has been taken on a strike by the centre, it is permissible to agitate for and against it; but that after a decision in favour of a strike (with the additional decision to conceal this from the enemy), to carry on agitation against the strike is strike-breaking? Any worker will understand that. The question of insurrection has been discussed in the centre since September. That is when Zinoviev and Kamenev could and should have come out in writing, so that everybody, upon seeing their arguments, would have realised that they had completely lost their heads. To conceal one's views from the Party for a whole month before a decision is taken, and to send out a dissenting opinion after a decision is taken\u2014that is strike-breaking.\n\nZinoviev pretends not to understand this difference, he pretends not to understand that after a decision to strike has been taken by the centre, only blacklegs can carry on agitation among the lower bodies against that decision. Any worker will understand that.\n\nAnd Zinoviev did agitate and attempted to defeat the centre's decision, both at Sunday's meeting, where he and Kamenev secured not a single vote, and in his present letter. For Zinoviev has the effrontery to assert that \"the opinion of the Party has not been canvassed\" and that such questions \"cannot be decided by ten men\". Just think! Every member of the Central Committee knows that more than ten C.C. members were present at the decisive meeting, that a majority of the plenary meeting were present, that Kamenev himself declared at the meeting that \"this meeting is decisive\", that it was known with absolute certainty that the majority of the absent members of the Central Committee were not in agreement with Zinoviev and Kamenev. And now, after the Central Committee has adopted a decision at a meeting which Kamenev himself admitted to be decisive, a member of the Central Committee has the audacity to write that \"the opinion of the Party has not been canvassed\", and that such questions \"cannot be decided by ten men\".That is strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. Between Party congresses, the Central Committee decides. The Central Committee has decided. Kamenev and Zinoviev, who did not come out in writing before the decision was taken, began to dispute the Central Committee's decision after it had been taken.\n\nThat is strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. After a decision has been taken, any dispute is impermissible when it concerns immediate and secret preparations for a strike. Now Zinoviev has the insolence to blame us for \"warning the enemy\". Is there any limit to his brazenness? Who is it that has damaged the cause, frustrated the strike by \"warning the enemy\", if not those who came out in the non-Party press?\n\nHow can one come out against a \"decisive\" resolution of the Party in a paper which on this question is hand in glove with the entire, bourgeoisie?\n\nIf that is tolerated, the Party will become impossible, the Party will be destroyed.\n\nIt is ridiculing the Party to give the name of \"dissenting opinion\" to that which Bazarov learns about and publishes in a non-Party paper.\n\nKamenev's and Zinoviev's statement in the non-Party press was especially despicable for the additional reason that the Party is not in a position to refute their slanderous lie openly. I know of no decisions regarding the date, Kamenev writes and publishes his writings in his own name and in the name of Zinoviev. (After such a statement, Zinoviev bears full responsibility for Kamenev's conduct and statements.)\n\nHow can the Central Committee refute this?\n\nWe cannot tell the capitalists the truth, namely, that we have decided on a strike and have decided to conceal the moment chosen for it.\n\nWe cannot refute the slanderous lie of Zinoviev and Kamenev without doing even greater damage to the cause. And the utter baseness, the real treachery of these two individuals is precisely in their having revealed the strikers' plan to the capitalists, for, since we remain silent in the press, everybody will guess how things stand.\n\nKamenev and Zinoviev have betrayed to Rodzyanko and Kerensky the decision of the Central Committee of their Party on insurrection and the decision to conceal from the enemy preparations for insurrection and the date appointed for it. That is a fact and no evasions can refute it. Two members of the Central Committee have by a slanderous lie betrayed the decision of the workers to the capitalists. There can and must be only one answer to that: an immediate decision of the Central Committee:\n\n\"The Central Committee, regarding Zinoviev's and Kamenev's statement in the non-Party press as strike-breaking in the full sense of the term, expels both of them from the Party.\"\n\nIt is not easy for me to write in this way about former close comrades. But I should regard any hesitation in this respect as a crime, for otherwise a party of revolutionaries which does not punish prominent blacklegs would perish.\n\nThe question of insurrection, even if the blacklegs have now delayed it for a long time by betraying it to Rodzyanko and Kerensky, has not been removed from the agenda, it has not been removed by the Party. But how can we prepare ourselves for insurrection and lay plans for it, if we tolerate \"prominent\" strike-breakers in our midst? The more prominent, the more dangerous they are, and the less deserving of \"forgiveness\". On n'est trahi que par les siens, the French say. Only your own people can betray you.\n\nThe more \"prominent\" the strike-breakers are, the more imperative it is to punish them by immediate expulsion.\n\nThat is the only way for the workers' party to recuperate, rid itself of a dozen or so spineless intellectuals, rally the ranks of the revolutionaries, and advance to meet great and momentous difficulties hand in hand with the revolutionary workers.\n\nWe cannot publish the truth, namely, that after the decisive meeting of the Central Committee, Zinoviev and Kamenev at Sunday's meeting had the audacity to demand a revision, that Kamenev had the effrontery to shout: \"The Central Committee has collapsed, for it has done nothing for a whole week\" (I could not refute that because to say what really had been done was impossible), while Zinoviev with an air of innocence proposed this resolution, which was rejected by the meeting: \"No action shall be taken before consulting with the Bolsheviks who are to arrive on October  for the Congress of Soviets.\"\n\nJust imagine! After the centre has taken a decision to call a strike, it is proposed at a meeting of the rank and file that it be postponed (until October , when the Congress was to convene. The Congress was subsequently postponed\u2014the Zinovievs trust the Lieberdans) and be referred to a body such as the Party Rules do not provide for, that has no authority over the Central Committee, and that does not know Petrograd.\n\nAnd after this Zinoviev still has the insolence to write: \"This is hardly the way to strengthen the unity of the Party.\"\n\nWhat else can you call it but a threat to effect a split?\n\nMy answer to this threat is that I shall go the limit, I shall win freedom of speech for myself before the workers, and I shall, at whatever cost, brand the blackleg Zinoviev as a blackleg. My answer to the threat of a split is to declare war to a finish, war for the expulsion of both blacklegs from the Party.\n\nThe Executive Committee of a trade union, after a month of deliberation, decides that a strike is inevitable, that the time is ripe, but that the date is to be concealed from the employers. After that, two members of the Executive Committee appeal to the rank and file, disputing the decision, and are defeated. Thereupon these two come out in the press and with a slanderous lie betray the decision of the Executive Committee to the capitalists, thus more than half wrecking the strike, or delaying it to a less favourable time by warning the enemy.\n\nHere we have strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. And that is why I demand the expulsion of both the black-legs, reserving for myself the right (in view of their threat of a split) to publish everything when publication becomes possible. To Comrade Sverdlov.\n\nI learnt only last night that Zinoviev had issued a writ ten denial of his participation in Kamenev\u2019s statement in Novaya Zhizn.\n\nWhy then have you not sent me anything???\n\nI sent all the letters about Kamenev and Zinoviev to C.C. members only.\u2014You know this; is it not strange then that you seem to doubt it?\n\nIt looks as if I will not be able to attend the Plenary Meeting, because \u201cthey are looking for me\u201d. If you (+ Stalin, Sokolnikov and Dzerzhinsky) demand a compromise on the Zinoviev and Kamenev affair,{} enter a proposal against me, to have the case referred to a Party court (the facts are clear that Zinoviev was also thwarting it deliberately); this will be a postponement.\n\n\u201cKamenev\u2019s resignation has been accepted\u201d? From the C.C.? Please let me have the text of his statement. /p> There is a well-known saying that if geometrical axioms affected human interests attempts would certainly be made to refute them. Theories of natural history which conflicted with the old prejudices of theology provoked, and still provoke, the most rabid opposition. No wonder, therefore, that the Marxian doctrine, which directly serves to enlighten and organise the advanced class in modern society, indicates the tasks facing this class and demonstrates the inevitable replacement (by virtue of economic development) of the present system by a new order\u2014no wonder that this doctrine has had to fight for every step forward in the course of its life.\n\nNeedless to say, this applies to bourgeois science and philosophy, officially taught by official professors in order to befuddle the rising generation of the propertied classes and to \u201ccoach\u201d it against internal and foreign enemies. This science will not even hear of Marxism, declaring that it has been refuted and annihilated. Marx is attacked with equal zest by young scholars who are making a career by refuting socialism, and by decrepit elders who are preserving the tradition of all kinds of outworn \u201csystems\u201d. The progress of Marxism, the fact that its ideas are spreading and taking firm hold among the working class, inevitably increase the frequency and intensity of these bourgeois attacks on Marxism, which becomes stronger, more hardened and more vigorous every time it is \u201cannihilated\u201d by official science.\n\nBut even among doctrines connected with the struggle of the working class, and current mainly among the proletariat, Marxism by no means consolidated its position all at once. In the first half-century of its existence (from   the s on) Marxism was engaged in combating theories fundamentally hostile to it. In the early forties Marx and Engels settled accounts with the radical Young Hegelians whose viewpoint was that of philosophical idealism. At the end of the forties the struggle began in the field of economic doctrine, against Proudhonism. The fifties saw the completion of this struggle in criticism of the parties and doctrines which manifested themselves in the stormy year of . In the sixties the struggle shifted from the field of general theory to one closer to the direct labour movement: the ejection of Bakuninism from the International. In the early seventies the stage in Germany was occupied for a short while by the Proudhonist M\u00fchlberger, and in the late seventies by the positivist D\u00fchring. But the influence of both on the proletariat was already absolutely insignificant. Marxism was already gaining an unquestionable victory over all other ideologies in the labour movement.\n\nBy the nineties this victory was in the main completed. Even in the Latin countries, where the traditions of Proudhonism held their ground longest of all, the workers\u2019 parties in effect built their programmes and their tactics on Marxist foundations. The revived international organisation of the labour movement\u2014in the shape of periodical international congresses\u2014from the outset, and almost without a struggle, adopted the Marxist standpoint in all essentials. But after Marxism had ousted all the more or less integral doctrines hostile to it, the tendencies expressed in those doctrines began to seek other channels. The forms and causes of the struggle changed, but the struggle continued. And the second half-century of the existence of Marxism began (in the nineties) with the struggle of a trend hostile to Marxism within Marxism itself.\n\nBernstein, a one-time orthodox Marxist, gave his name to this trend by coming forward with the most noise and with the most purposeful expression of amendments to Marx, revision of Marx, revisionism. Even in Russia where\u2014owing to the economic backwardness of the country and the preponderance of a peasant population weighed down by the relics of serfdom\u2014non-Marxist socialism has naturally held its ground longest of all, it is plainly passing into   revisionism before our very eyes. Both in the agrarian question (the programme of the municipalisation of all land) and in general questions of programme and tactics, our Social-Narodniks are more and more substituting \u201camendments\u201d to Marx for the moribund and obsolescent remnants of their old system, which in its own way was integral and fundamentally hostile to Marxism.\n\nPre-Marxist socialism has been defeated. It is continuing the struggle, no longer on its own independent ground, but on the general ground of Marxism, as revisionism. Let us, then, examine the ideological content of revisionism.\n\nIn the sphere of philosophy revisionism followed in the wake of bourgeois professorial \u201cscience\u201d. The professors went \u201cback to Kant\"\u2014and revisionism dragged along after the neo-Kantians. The professors repeated the platitudes that priests have uttered a thousand times against philosophical materialism\u2014and the revisionists, smiling indulgently, mumbled (word for word after the latest Handbuch) that materialism had been \u201crefuted\u201d long ago. The professors treated Hegel as a \u201cdead dog\u201d,[] and while themselves preaching idealism, only an idealism a thousand times more petty and banal than Hegel\u2019s, contemptuously shrugged their shoulders at dialectics\u2014and the revisionists floundered after them into the swamp of philosophical vulgarisation of science, replacing \u201cartful\u201d (and revolutionary) dialectics by \u201csimple\" (and tranquil) \u201cevolution\u201d. The professors earned their official salaries by adjusting both their idealist and their \u201ccritical\u201d systems to the dominant medieval \u201cphilosophy\u201d (i.e., to theology)\u2014and the revisionists drew close to them, trying to make religion a \u201cprivate affair\u201d, not in relation to the modern state, but in relation to the party of the advanced class.\n\nWhat such \u201camendments\u201d to Marx really meant in class terms need not be stated: it is self-evident. We shall simply note that the only Marxist in the international Social-Democratic movement to criticise the incredible platitudes of the revisionists from the standpoint of consistent dialectical materialism was Plekhanov. This must be stressed. all the more emphatically since profoundly mistaken attempts are being made at the present time to smuggle in   old and reactionary philosophical rubbish disguised as a criticism of Plekhanov\u2019s tactical opportunism.[]\n\nPassing to political economy, it must be noted first of all that in this sphere the \u201camendments\u201d of the revisionists were much more comprehensive and circumstantial; attempts were made to influence the public by \u201cnew data on economic development\u201d. It was said that concentration and the ousting of small-scale production by large-scale production do not occur in agriculture at all, while they proceed very slowly in commerce and industry. It was said that crises had now become rarer and weaker, and that cartels and trusts would probably enable capital to eliminate them altogether. It was said that the \u201ctheory of collapse\u201d to which capitalism is heading was unsound, owing to the tendency of class antagonisms to become milder and less acute. It was said, finally, that it would not be amiss to correct Marx\u2019s theory of value, too, in accordance with B\u00f6hm-Bawerk.[]\n\nThe fight against the revisionists on these questions resulted in as fruitful a revival of the theoretical thought in international socialism as did Engels\u2019s controversy with D\u00fchring twenty years earlier. The arguments of the revisionists were analysed with the help of facts and figures. It was proved that the revisionists were systematically painting a rose-coloured picture of modern small-scale production. The technical and commercial superiority of large-scale production over small-scale production not only in industry, but also in agriculture, is proved by irrefutable facts. But commodity production is far less developed in agriculture, and modern statisticians and economists are, as a rule, not very skilful in picking out the special branches (sometimes even the operations) in agriculture which indicate that agriculture is being progressively drawn into the process of exchange in world economy. Small-scale production   maintains itself on the ruins of natural economy by constant worsening of diet, by chronic starvation, by lengthening of the working day, by deterioration in the quality and the care of cattle, in a word, by the very methods whereby handicraft production maintained itself against capitalist manufacture. Every advance in science and technology inevitably and relentlessly undermines the foundations of small-scale production in capitalist society; and it is the task of socialist political economy to investigate this process in all its forms, often complicated and intricate, and to demonstrate to the small producer the impossibility of his holding his own under capitalism, the hopelessness of peasant farming under capitalism, and the necessity for the peasant to adopt the standpoint of the proletarian. On this question the revisionists sinned, in the scientific sense, by superficial generalisations based on facts selected one-sidedly and without reference to the system of capitalism as a whole. From the political point of view, they sinned by the fact that they inevitably, whether they wanted to or not, invited or urged the peasant to adopt the attitude of a small proprietor (i.e., the attitude of the bourgeoisie) instead of urging him to adopt the point of view of the revolutionary proletarian.\n\nThe position of revisionism was even worse as regards the theory of crises and the theory of collapse. Only for a very short time could people, and then only the most short-sighted, think of refashioning the foundations of Marx\u2019s theory under the influence of a few years of industrial boom and prosperity. Realities very soon made it clear to the revisionists that crises were not a thing of the past: prosperity was followed by a crisis. The forms, the sequence, the picture of particular crises changed, but crises remained an inevitable component of the capitalist system. While uniting production, the cartels and trusts at the same time, and in a way that was obvious to all, aggravated the anarchy of production, the insecurity of existence of the proletariat and the oppression of capital, thereby intensifying class antagonisms to an unprecedented degree. That capitalism is heading for a break-down\u2014in the sense both of individual political and economic crises and of the complete collapse of the entire capitalist system\u2014has   been made particularly clear, and on a particularly large scale, precisely by the new giant trusts. The recent financial crisis in America and the appalling increase of unemployment all over Europe, to say nothing of the impending industrial crisis to which many symptoms are pointing\u2014all this has resulted in the recent \u201ctheories\u201d of the revisionists having been forgotten by everybody, including, apparently, many of the revisionists themselves. But the lessons which this instability of the intellectuals had given the working class must not be forgotten.\n\nAs to the theory of value, it need only be said that apart from the vaguest of hints and sighs, \u00e0 la B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, the revisionists have contributed absolutely nothing, and have therefore left no traces whatever on the development of scientific thought.\n\nIn the sphere of politics, revisionism did really try to revise the foundation of Marxism, namely, the doctrine of the class struggle. Political freedom, democracy and universal suffrage remove the ground for the class struggle\u2014we were told\u2014and render untrue the old proposition of the Communist Manifesto that the working men have no country. For, they said, since the \u201cwill of the majority\u201d prevails in a democracy, one must neither regard the state as an organ of class rule, nor reject alliances with the progressive, social-reform bourgeoisie against the reactionaries.\n\nIt cannot be disputed that these arguments of the revisionists amounted to a fairly well-balanced system of views, namely, the old and well-known liberal-bourgeois views. The liberals have always said that bourgeois parliamentarism destroys classes and class divisions, since the right to vote and the right to participate in the government of the country are shared by all citizens without distinction. The whole history of Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, and the whole history of the Russian revolution in the early twentieth, clearly show how absurd such views are. Economic distinctions are not mitigated but aggravated and intensified under the freedom of \u201cdemocratic\u201d capitalism. Parliamentarism does not eliminate, but lays bare the innate character even of the most democratic bourgeois republics as organs of class oppression. By helping to enlighten and to organise immeasurably wider   masses of the population than those which previously took an active part in political events, parliamentarism does not make for the elimination of crises and political revolutions, but for the maximum intensification of civil war during such revolutions. The events in Paris in the spring of  and the events in Russia in the winter of  showed as clearly as could be how inevitably this intensification comes about. The French bourgeoisie without a moment\u2019s hesitation made a deal with the enemy of the whole nation, with the foreign army which had ruined its country, in order to crush the proletarian movement. Whoever does not understand the inevitable inner dialectics of parliamentarism and bourgeois democracy\u2014which leads to an even sharper decision of the argument by mass violence than formerly\u2014will never be able on the basis of this parliamentarism to conduct propaganda and agitation consistent in principle, really preparing the working-class masses for victorious participation in such \u201carguments\u201d. The experience of alliances, agreements and blocs with the social-reform liberals in the West and with the liberal reformists (Cadets) in the Russian revolution, has convincingly shown that these agreements only blunt the consciousness of the masses, that they do not enhance but weaken the actual significance of their struggle, by linking fighters with elements who are least capable of fighting and most vacillating and treacherous. Millerandism in France\u2014the biggest experiment in applying revisionist political tactics on a wide, a really national scale\u2014has provided a practical appraisal of revisionism that will never be forgotten by the proletariat all over the world.\n\nA natural complement to the economic and political tendencies of revisionism was its attitude to the ultimate aim of the socialist movement. \u201cThe movement is everything, the ultimate aim is nothing\"\u2014this catch-phrase of Bernstein\u2019s expresses the substance of revisionism better than many long disquisitions. To determine its conduct from case to case, to adapt itself to the events of the day and to the chopping and changing of petty politics, to forget the primary interests of the proletariat and the basic features of the whole capitalist system, of all capitalist evolution, to sacrifice these primary interests for the   real or assumed advantages of the moment\u2014such is the policy of revisionism. And it patently follows from the very nature of this policy that it may assume an infinite variety of forms, and that every more or less \u201cnew\u201d question, every more or less unexpected and unforeseen turn of events, even though it change the basic line of development only to an insignificant degree and only for the briefest period, will always inevitably give rise to one variety of revisionism or another.\n\nThe inevitability of revisionism is determined by its class roots in modern society. Revisionism is an international phenomenon. No thinking socialist who is in the least informed can have the slightest doubt that the relation between the orthodox and the Bernsteinians in Germany, the Guesdists and the Jaur\u00e8sists (and now particularly the Broussists) in France, the Social Democratic Federation and the Independent Labour Party in Great Britain, Brouck\u00e8re and Vandervelde in Belgium, the Integralists and the Reformists in Italy, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks in Russia, is everywhere essentially similar, notwithstanding the immense variety of national conditions and historical factors in the present state of all these countries. In reality, the \u201cdivision\u201d within the present international socialist movement is now proceeding along the same lines in all the various countries of the world, which testifies to a tremendous advance compared with thirty or forty years ago, when heterogeneous trends in the various countries were struggling within the one international socialist movement. And that \u201crevisionism from the left\u201d which has taken shape in the Latin countries as \u201crevolutionary syndicalism\u201d,[] is also adapting itself to Marxism, \u201camending\u201d it: Labriola in Italy and Lagardelle in France frequently appeal from Marx who is understood wrongly to Marx who is understood rightly.\n\nWe cannot stop here to analyse the ideological content of this revisionism, which as yet is far from having developed to the same extent as opportunist revisionism: it has not yet become international, has not yet stood the test of a single big practical battle with a socialist party in any single country. We confine ourselves therefore to that \u201crevisionism from the right\u201d which was described above.\n\nWherein lies its inevitability in capitalist society? Why is it more profound than the differences of national peculiarities and of degrees of capitalist development? Because in every capitalist country, side by side with the proletariat, there are always broad strata of the petty bourgeoisie, small proprietors. Capitalism arose and is constantly arising out of small production. A number of new \u201cmiddle strata\u201d are inevitably brought into existence again and again by capitalism (appendages to the factory, work at home, small workshops scattered all over the country to meet the requirements of big industries, such as the bicycle and automobile industries, etc.). These new small producers are just as inevitably being cast again into the ranks of the proletariat. It is quite natural that the petty-bourgeois world-outlook should again and again crop up in the ranks of the broad workers\u2019 parties. It is quite natural that this should be so and always will be so, right up to the changes of fortune that will take place in the proletarian revolution. For it would be a profound mistake to think that the \u201ccomplete\u201d proletarianisation of the majority of the population is essential for bringing about such a revolution. What we now frequently experience only in the domain of ideology, namely, disputes over theoretical amendments to Marx; what now crops up in practice only over individual side issues of the labour movement, as tactical differences with the revisionists and splits on this basis\u2014is bound to be experienced by the working class on an incomparably larger scale when the proletarian revolution will sharpen all disputed issues, will focus all differences on points which are of the most immediate importance in determining the conduct of the masses, and will make it necessary in the heat of the fight to distinguish enemies from friends, and to cast out bad allies in order to deal decisive blows at the enemy.\n\nThe ideological struggle waged by revolutionary Marxism against revisionism at the end of the nineteenth century is but the prelude to the great revolutionary battles of the proletariat, which is marching forward to the complete victory of its cause despite all the waverings and weaknesses of the petty bourgeoisie. Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution\n.\nAn Urgent Political Question\nAt the present revolutionary juncture the question of the convocation of a popular constituent assembly is on the order of the day. Opinions are divided on the point as to how this question should be solved. Three political trends are to be observed. The tsarist government admits the necessity of convening representatives of the people, but it does not want under any circumstances to permit their assembly to be a popular and a constituent assembly. It seems willing to agree, if we are to believe the newspaper reports on the work of the Bulygin Commission,[] to an advisory assembly, to be elected without freedom to conduct agitation, and on the basis of restricted qualifications or a restricted class system. The revolutionary proletariat, inasmuch as it is led by the Social-Democratic Party, demands complete transfer of power to a constituent assembly, and for this purpose strives to obtain not only universal suffrage and complete freedom to conduct agitation, but also the immediate overthrow of the tsarist government and its replacement by a provisional revolutionary government. Finally, the liberal bourgeoisie, expressing its wishes through the leaders of the so-called \u201cConstitutional-Democratic Party\u201d,[] does not demand the overthrow of the tsarist government, does not advance the slogan of a provisional government and does not insist on real guarantees that the elections will be absolutely free and fair and that the assembly of representatives will be a genuinely popular and a genuinely constituent assembly. As a matter of fact, the liberal bourgeoisie, the only serious social support of the Osvobozhdeniye trend, is striving to effect as peaceful a deal as possible between the tsar and the revolutionary people, a deal, moreover, that would give a maximum of power to itself, the bourgeoisie, and a minimum to the revolutionary people\u2014the proletariat and the peasantry.\n\nSuch is the political situation at the present time. Such are the three main political trends, corresponding to the three main social forces in contemporary Russia. We have already shown on more than one occasion (in the Proletary, Nos. , , )[] how the Osvobozhdentsi use pseudo-democratic phrases to cover up their half-hearted, or, to put it more bluntly and plainly, their treacherous, perfidious policy towards the revolution. Let us now see how the Social-Democrats appraise the tasks of the moment. Excellent material for this purpose is provided by the two resolutions that were passed quite recently by the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and by the \u201cConference\u201d of the section which has seceded from the Party. The question as to which of these resolutions more correctly appraises the political situation and more correctly defines the tactics of the revolutionary proletariat is of enormous importance, and every Social-Democrat who is anxious to fulfil his duties as a propagandist, agitator and organiser intelligently, must study this question with the closest attention, leaving all irrelevant considerations entirely aside.\n\nBy the Party\u2019s tactics we mean the Party\u2019s political conduct, or the character, the direction and methods of its political activity. Tactical resolutions are adopted by Party congresses in order precisely to define the political conduct of the Party as a whole with regard to new tasks, or in view of a new political situation. Such a new situation has been created by the revolution that has started in Russia, i.e., the complete, resolute and open rupture between the overwhelming majority of the people and the tsarist government. The new question concerns the practical methods to be adopted in convening a genuinely popular and genuinely constituent assembly (the theoretical question concerning such an assembly was officially settled by Social-Democracy long ago, before all other parties, in its Party program). Since the people have broken with the government, and the masses realise the necessity of setting up a new order, the party which set itself the object of overthrowing the government must necessarily consider what government to put up in place of the old, deposed government. A new question concerning a provisional revolutionary government arises. In order to give a complete answer to this question the Party of the class-conscious proletariat must make clear: ) the significance of a provisional revolutionary government in the revolution that is now going on and in the entire struggle of the proletariat in general; ) its attitude towards a provisional revolutionary government; ) the precise conditions of Social-Democratic participation in this government; ) the conditions under which pressure is to be brought to bear on this government from below, i.e., in the event of there being no Social-Democrats in it. Only after all these questions are made clear, will the political conduct of the Party in this sphere be principled, clear and firm.\n\nLet us now consider how the resolution of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party answers these questions. The following is the full text of the resolution:\n\n\u201cResolution on a Provisional Revolutionary Government\n\n\u201cWhereas:\n\n\u201c) both the direct interests of the proletariat and the interests of its struggle for the final aims of socialism require the fullest possible measure of political liberty and, consequently, the replacement of the autocratic form of government by a democratic republic;\n\n\u201c) the establishment of a democratic republic in Russia is possible only as a result of a victorious popular insurrection whose organ will be a provisional revolutionary government, which alone will be capable of ensuring complete freedom of agitation during the election campaign and of convening a constituent assembly that will really express the will of the people, an assembly elected on the basis of universal and equal suffrage, direct elections and secret ballot;\n\n\u201c) under the present social and economic order this democratic revolution in Russia will not weaken, but strengthen the rule of the bourgeoisie, which at a certain moment will inevitably try, stopping at nothing, to take away from the Russian proletariat as many of the gains of the revolutionary period as possible:\n\n\u201cThe Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party resolves that:\n\n\u201ca) that it is necessary to disseminate among the working class a concrete idea of the most probable course of the revolution and of the necessity, at a certain moment in the revolution, for the appearance of a provisional revolutionary government, from which the proletariat will demand the realisation of all the immediate political and economic demands contained in our program (the minimum program);\n\n\u201cb) that subject to the relation of forces, and other factors which cannot be exactly determined beforehand, representatives of our Party may participate in the provisional revolutionary government for the purpose of relentless struggle against all counter-revolutionary attempts and of the defence of the independent interests of the working class;\n\n\u201cc) that an indispensable condition for such participation is that the Party should exercise strict control over its representatives and that the independence of the Social-Democratic Party, which is striving for a complete socialist revolution and, consequently, is irreconcilably hostile to all bourgeois parties, should be strictly maintained;\n\n\u201cd) that irrespective whether the participation of Social-Democrats in the provisional revolutionary government prove possible or not, we must propagate among the broadest masses of the proletariat the necessity for permanent pressure to be brought to bear upon the provisional government by the armed proletariat, led by the Social-Democratic Party, for the purpose of defending, consolidating and extending the gains of the revolution.\u201d\n.\nWhat Can We Learn From the Resolution of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. on a Provisional Revolutionary Government?\nAs is evident from the title, the resolution of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, is devoted wholly and exclusively to the question of a provisional revolutionary government. Hence, the participation of Social-Democrats in a provisional revolutionary government is included in it as part of that question. On the other hand, it deals only with a provisional revolutionary government and with nothing else; consequently, it completely leaves out, for example, the question of the \u201cconquest of power\u201d in general, etc. Was the Congress right in eliminating this and similar questions? Undoubtedly it was right, because the political situation in Russia does not at all give rise to such questions as immediate issues. On the contrary, the whole of the issue that has been raised by the people at the present time is the overthrow of the autocracy and the convocation of a constituent assembly. Party congresses should take up and decide not issues which this or that writer happened to mention , but those that are of vital political importance by reason of the prevailing conditions and the objective course of social development.\n\nOf what importance is a provisional revolutionary government in the present revolution, and in the general struggle of the proletariat? The resolution of the Congress explains this by pointing at the very outset to the need for the \u201cfullest possible measure of political liberty,\u201d both from the standpoint of the immediate interests of the proletariat and from the standpoint of the \u201cfinal aims of Socialism.\u201d And complete political liberty requires that the tsarist autocracy be replaced by a democratic republic, as our Party program has already recognised. The stress laid in the Congress resolution on the slogan of a democratic republic is necessary both as a matter of logic and in point of principle, for it is precisely complete freedom that the proletariat, as the foremost champion of democracy, is striving to attain. Moreover, it is all the more advisable to stress this at the present time because right now the monarchists, namely, the so-called constitutional-\u201cdemocratic\u201d party, or party of \u201cliberation,\u201d in our country, are flying the flag of \u201cdemocracy.\u201d In order to establish a republic it is absolutely necessary to have an assembly of people\u2019s representatives; and it must be a popular (elected on the basis of universal and equal suffrage, direct elections and secret ballot), and a constituent assembly. This exactly what is recognised in the Congress resolution, further on. But the resolution does not stop there. In order to establish the new order \u201cthat will really express the will of the people\u201d it is not enough to call a representative assembly a constituent assembly. This assembly must have the authority and power to \u201cconstitute.\u201d Taking this into consideration, the resolution of the Congress does not confine itself to the formal slogan of a \u201cconstituent assembly,\u201d but adds the material conditions which alone will enable that assembly really to carry out its tasks. Such specification of the conditions that will enable an assembly which is constituent in name to become constituent in fact is imperatively necessary, for, as we have pointed out more than once, the liberal bourgeoisie, as represented by the Constitutional-Monarchist Party, is deliberately distorting the slogan of a popular constituent assembly and reducing it to a hollow phrase.\n\nThe Congress resolution states that a provisional revolutionary government on its own \u2014 one, moreover, that will be the organ of a victorious popular insurrection \u2014 can secure full freedom of agitation in the election campaign and convene an assembly that will really express the will of the people. Is this postulate correct? Whoever took it into his head to dispute it would have to assert that it is possible for the tsarist government not to side with the reaction, that it is capable of being neutral during the elections, that it will see to it that the will of the people is really expressed. Such assertions are so absurd that no one would venture to defend them openly; but they are being surreptitiously smuggled in under liberal colours, by our liberationists. Somebody must convene the constituent assembly, somebody must guarantee the freedom and fairness of the elections; somebody must invest such an assembly with full power and authority. Only a revolutionary government, which is the organ of the insurrection, can desire this in all sincerity and be capable of doing all that is required to achieve this. The tsarist government will inevitably counteract this. A liberal government, which will come to terms with the tsar, and which does not rely in full on the popular uprising, cannot sincerely desire this, and could not accomplish it even if it most sincerely desired to. Therefore, the resolution of the Congress gives the only correct and entirely consistent democratic slogan.\n\nBut an appraisal of a provisional revolutionary government\u2019s significance would be incomplete and wrong if the class nature of the democratic revolution were lost sight of. The resolution therefore adds that the revolution will strengthen the rule of the bourgeoisie. This is inevitable under the present, i.e., capitalist, social and economic system. And the strengthening of the bourgeoisie\u2019s rule over the proletariat which has secured some measure of political liberty must inevitably lead to a desperate struggle between them for power, must lead to desperate attempts on the part of the bourgeoisie \u201cto take away from the proletariat the gains of the revolutionary period.\u201d Therefore the proletariat, which is fighting for democracy in front of all and at the head of all, must not for a single moment forget about the new antagonisms that are inherent in bourgeois democracy and about the new struggle.\n\nThus, the section of the resolution which we have just reviewed fully appraises the significance of a provisional revolutionary government in its relation to the struggle for freedom and for a republic, in its relation to a constituent assembly and in its relation to the democratic revolution, which clears the ground for a new class struggle.\n\nThe next question is that of the proletariat\u2019s attitude in general towards a provisional revolutionary government. The Congress resolution answers this first of all by directly advising the Party to spread among the working class the conviction that a provisional revolutionary government is necessary. The working class must be made aware of this necessity. Whereas the \u201cdemocratic\u201d bourgeoisie leaves the question of overthrowing the tsarist government in the shade, we must push it to the fore and insist on the need for a provisional revolutionary government. More than that, we must outline for such a government a program of action that will conform with the objective conditions of the historic period through which we are now passing and with the aims of proletarian democracy. This program is the entire minimum program of our Party, the program of the immediate political and economic reforms which, on the one hand, can be fully realised on the basis of the existing social and economic relationships and, on the other hand, are requisite for the next step forward, for the achievement of Socialism.\n\nThus, the resolution fully clearly defines the nature and aims of a provisional revolutionary government. In its origin and fundamental nature such a government must be the organ of the popular insurrection. Its formal purpose must be to serve as the instrument for convening a popular constituent assembly. The content of its activities must be to put into effect the minimum program of proletarian democracy, the only program capable of safeguarding the interests of the people which has risen against the autocracy.\n\nIt might be argued that being only provisional, a provisional government cannot carry out a constructive program which has not yet received the approval of the entire people. Such an argument would merely be the sophistry of reactionaries and \u201cabsolutists.\u201d To abstain from carrying out a constructive program means tolerating the existence of the feudal regime of the putrid autocracy. Such a regime could be tolerated only by a government of traitors to the cause of the revolution, but not by a government which is the organ of a popular insurrection. It would be mockery for anyone to propose that we should refrain from exercising freedom of assembly pending the confirmation of such freedom by a constituent assembly, on the plea that the constituent assembly might not confirm freedom of assembly! It is equal mockery to object to the immediate execution of the minimum program by a provisional revolutionary government.\n\nFinally, we will note that the resolution, by making implementation of the minimum program provisional revolutionary government\u2019s task eliminates the absurd, semi-anarchist ideas about giving immediate effect to the maximum program, and the conquest of power for a socialist revolution. The degree of economic development of Russia (an objective condition) and the degree of class consciousness and organisation of the broad masses of the proletariat (a subjective condition inseparably connected with the objective condition) make the immediate complete emancipation of the working class impossible. Only the most ignorant people can ignore the bourgeois nature of the democratic revolution which is now taking place; only the most naive optimists can forget how little as yet the masses of the workers are informed about the aims of Socialism and about the methods of achieving it. And we are all convinced that the emancipation of the workers can be effected only by the workers themselves; a socialist revolution is out of the question unless the masses become class conscious and organised, trained and educated in open class struggle against the entire bourgeoisie. In answer to the anarchist objections that we are putting off the socialist revolution, we say: we are not putting it off, but we are taking the first step towards it in the only possible way, along the only correct road, namely, the road of a democratic republic. Whoever wants to reach Socialism by a different road, other than that of political democracy, will inevitably arrive at conclusions that are absurd and reactionary both in the economic and the political sense. If any workers ask us at the given moment why we should not go ahead and carry out our maximum program, we shall answer by pointing out how far the masses of the democratically-minded people still are from Socialism, how undeveloped class antagonisms still are, how unorganised the proletarians still are. Organise hundreds of thousands of workers all over Russia; enlist the sympathy of millions for our program! Try to do this without confining yourselves to high-sounding but hollow anarchist phrases\u2014and you will see at once that in order to achieve this organisation, in order to spread this socialist enlightenment, we must achieve the fullest possible measure of democratic reforms.\n\nLet us continue. Once we are clear about the importance of a provisional revolutionary government and the attitude of the proletariat toward it, the following question arises: is it permissible for us to participate in it (action from above) and, if so, under what conditions? What should be our action from below? The resolution supplies precise answers to both these questions. It emphatically declares that it is permissible in principle for Social-Democrats to participate in a provisional revolutionary government (during the period of a democratic revolution, the period of struggle for a republic). By this declaration we once and for all dissociate ourselves both from the anarchists, who answer this question in the negative on principle, and from the khvostists among the Social-Democrats (like Martynov and the new Iskra-ists) who have tried to frighten us with the prospect of a situation wherein it might prove necessary for us to participate in such a government. By this declaration the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party rejected, once and for all, the idea expressed by the new Iskra that the participation of Social-Democrats in a provisional revolutionary government would be a variety of Millerandism,[] that it is impermissible in principle, as sanctifying the bourgeois order, etc.\n\nIt stands to reason, however, that the question of permissibility in principle does not solve the question of practical expediency. Under what conditions is this new form of struggle\u2014the struggle \u201cfrom above\u201d recognised by the Party Congress\u2014expedient? It goes without saying that at the present time it is impossible to speak of concrete conditions, such as relation of forces, etc., and the resolution, naturally, refrains from defining these conditions in advance. No intelligent person would venture at the present time to prophesy anything on this subject. What we can and must do is determine the nature and aim of our participation. This is precisely what is done in the resolution, which points out two objectives of our participation: ) a relentless struggle against counter-revolutionary attempts, and ) the defence of the independent interests of the working class. At a time when the liberal bourgeoisie is beginning to talk assiduously about the psychology of reaction (see Mr. Struve\u2019s most instructive \u201cOpen Letter\u201d in the Osvobozhdeniye, No. ) in an attempt to frighten the revolutionary people and induce it to show compliance towards the autocracy\u2014at such a time it is particularly appropriate for the party of the proletariat to call attention to the task of waging a real war against counterrevolution. In the final analysis, force alone settles the great problems of political liberty and the class struggle, and it is our business to prepare and organise this force and to employ it actively, not only for defence, but also for attack. The long reign of political reaction in Europe, which has lasted almost uninterruptedly since the days of the Paris Commune, has too greatly accustomed us to the idea that action can proceed only \u201cfrom below,\u201d has too greatly inured us to seeing only defensive struggles. We have now, undoubtedly, entered a new era: a period of political upheavals and revolutions has begun. In a period such as Russia is passing through at the present time, it is impermissible to confine ourselves to old, stereotyped formulae. We must propagate the idea of action from above, we must prepare for the most energetic, offensive action, and must study the conditions for and forms of such actions. The Congress resolution puts two of these conditions into the forefront: one refers to the formal aspect of Social-Democratic participation in a provisional revolutionary government (strict control by the Party over its representatives), the other to the very nature of such participation (never for an instant to lose sight of the aim of effecting a complete socialist revolution).\n\nHaving thus explained from all aspects the Party\u2019s policy with regard to action \u201cfrom above\u201d\u2014this new, hitherto almost unprecedented method of struggle\u2014the resolution also provides for the eventuality that we shall not be able to act from above. We must exercise pressure on the provisional revolutionary government from below in any case. In order to be able to exercise this pressure from below, the proletariat must be armed\u2014for in a revolutionary situation matters develop with exceptional rapidity to the stage of open civil war\u2014and must be led by the Social-Democratic Party. The object of its armed pressure is that of \u201cdefending, consolidating and extending the gains of the revolution,\u201d i.e., those gains which from the standpoint of the interests of the proletariat must consist in the fulfilment of the whole of our minimum program.\n\nWith this we conclude our brief analysis of the resolution of the Third Congress on a provisional revolutionary government. As the reader can see, the resolution explains the importance of this new question, the attitude of the Party of the proletariat toward it, and the policy the Party must pursue both inside a provisional revolutionary government and outside of it.\n\nLet us now consider the corresponding resolution of the \u201cConference.\u201d\n\n.\nWhat Is A \u201cDecisive Victory of the Revolution Over Tsarism\u201d?\nThe resolution of the \u201cConference\u201d is devoted to the question: \u201cThe conquest of power and participation in a provisional government.\u201d[] As we have already pointed out, the very manner in which the question is presented betrays confusion. On the one hand, the question is presented in a narrow way: it deals only with our participation in a provisional government and not with the Party\u2019s tasks in regard to a provisional revolutionary government in general. On the other hand, two totally different questions are confused, viz., the question of our participation at one of the stages of the democratic revolution, and the question of the socialist revolution. Indeed, the \u201cconquest of power\u201d by Social-Democracy is a socialist revolution, nor can it be anything else if we use these words in their direct and usually accepted sense. If, however, we are to understand these words to mean the conquest of power for a democratic revolution and not for a socialist revolution, then what is the point in talking not only about participation in a provisional revolutionary government but also about the \u201cconquest of power\u201d in general? Obviously our \u201cConferencers\u201d were not very clear themselves as to what they should talk about: the democratic or the socialist revolution. Those who have followed the literature on this question know that it was Comrade Martynov, in his notorious Two Dictatorships; the new-Iskrists are reluctant to recall the manner in which this question was presented (even before January )[] [the date of Bloody Sunday] in that model of tail-ender writing. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that it exerted an ideological influence on the Conference.\n\nBut let us leave the title of the resolution. Its contents reveal mistakes incomparably more profound and serious. Here is the first part:\n\n\u201cA decisive victory of the revolution over tsarism may be marked either by the establishment of a provisional government, which will emerge from a victorious popular insurrection, or by the revolutionary initiative of a representative institution of one kind or another, which, under direct revolutionary pressure of the people, decides to set up a popular constituent assembly.\u201d\n\nThus, we are told that a decisive victory of the revolution over tsarism may be marked either by a victorious insurrection, or ... by a decision of a representative institution to set up a constituent assembly! What does this mean? How are we to understand it? A decisive victory may be marked by a \u201cdecision\u201d to set up a constituent assembly?? And such a \u201cvictory\u201d is put side by side with the establishment of a provisional government which will \u201cemerge from a victorious popular insurrection\u201d!! The Conference failed to note that a victorious popular insurrection and the establishment of a provisional government would signify the victory of the revolution in actual fact, whereas a \u201cdecision\u201d to set up a constituent assembly would signify a victory of the revolution in words only.\n\nThe Conference of the Mensheviks, or new-Iskra, fell into the very same error that the liberals, the Osvobozhdeniye are constantly committing. The Osvobozhdeniye group prattle about a \u201cconstituent\u201d assembly and bashfully shut their eyes to the fact that power and authority remain in the hands of the tsar, forgetting that in order to \u201cconstitute\u201d one must possess the power to do so. The Conference also forgot that it is a far cry from a \u201cdecision\u201d adopted by representatives\u2014no matter who they are\u2014to the fulfilment of that decision. The Conference further forgot that so long as power remained in the hands of the tsar, all decisions passed by any representatives whatsoever would remain empty and miserable prattle, as was the case with the \u201cdecisions\u201d of the Frankfurt Parliament, famous in the history of the German Revolution of . In his Neue Rheinische Zeitung[] Marx, the representative of the revolutionary proletariat, castigated the Frankfurt liberal Osvobozhdentsi with merciless sarcasm precisely because they uttered fine words, adopted all sorts of democratic \u201cdecisions,\u201d \u201cconstituted\u201d all kinds of liberties, while actually they left power in the hands of the king and failed to organise an armed struggle against the military forces at the disposal of the king. And while the Frankfurt Osvobozbdentsi were prattling\u2014the king bided his time, consolidated his military forces, and the counterrevolution, relying on real force, utterly routed the democrats with all their fine \u201cdecisions.\u201d\n\nThe Conference put on a par with a decisive victory the very thing that lacks the essential condition of victory. How was it possible for Social-Democrats who recognise the republican program of our Party to commit such an error? In order to understand this strange phenomenon we must turn to the resolution of the Third Congress on the section which has seceded from the Party.[] This resolution refers to the fact that various trends \u201cakin to Economism\u201d have survived in our Party. Our \u201cConferencers\u201d (it is not for nothing that they are under the ideological guidance of Martynov) talk of the revolution in exactly the same way as the Economists talked of the political struggle or the eight hour day. The Economists immediately gave currency to the \u201ctheory of stages\u201d: ) the struggle for rights,\n) political agitation,\n) political struggle; or, ) a ten-hour day,\n) a nine-hour day,\n) an eight-hour day. The results of this \u201ctactics-as-a-process\u201d are sufficiently well known to all. Now we are invited nicely to divide the revolution too in advance into the following stages: ) the tsar convenes a representative body; ) this representative body \u201cdecides\u201d under pressure of the \u201cpeople\u201d to set up a constituent assembly; ) ... the Mensheviks have not yet agreed among themselves as to the third stage; they have forgotten that the revolutionary pressure of the people will meet with the counter-revolutionary pressure of tsarism and that, therefore, either the \u201cdecision\u201d will remain unfulfilled or the issue will be decided after all by the victory or the defeat of the popular insurrection. The resolution of the Conference is an exact reproduction of the following reasoning of the Economists: a decisive victory of the workers may be marked either by the realisation of the eight-hour day in a revolutionary way, or by the grant of a ten-hour day and a \u201cdecision\u201d to go over to a nine-hour day.... the duplication is perfect.\n\nThe objection may be made to us that the authors of the resolution did not mean to place on a par the victory of an insurrection with the \u201cdecision\u201d of a representative institution convened by the tsar, that they only wanted to provide for the Party\u2019s tactics in either case. To this our answer would be: ) The text of the resolution plainly and unambiguously describes the decision of a representative institution as \u201ca decisive victory of the revolution over tsarism.\u201d Perhaps that is the result of careless wording, perhaps it could be corrected after consulting the minutes, but, so long as it is not corrected, the present wording can have only one meaning, and this meaning is entirely in keeping with the Osvobozhdeniye line of reasoning. ) The Osvobozbdeniye line of reasoning, into which the authors of the resolution have drifted, stands out in incomparably greater relief in other literary productions of the new Iskra-ists. For instance, the organ of the Tiflis Committee, (in the Georgian language; praised by the Iskra in No. ), in the article \u201cThe Zemsky Sobor[] and Our Tactics,\u201d Sotsial-Demokrat,[] organ of the Tiflis Committee (published in the Georgian language; praised by Iskra in No. ) goes so far as to say that the \u201cTactics\u201d \u201cwhich make the Zemsky Sobor the centre of our activities\u201d (about the convocation of which, we may add, nothing definite is known as yet!) \u201care more advantageous for us\u201d than the \u201ctactics\u201d of armed insurrection and the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government. We shall refer to this article again further on. ) No objection can be made to a preliminary discussion of what tactics the Party should adopt in the event of the victory of the revolution as well as in the event of its defeat, in the event of a successful insurrection as well as in the event of the insurrection failing to develop into a serious force. It is possible that the tsarist government will succeed in convening a representative assembly for the purpose of coming to terms with the liberal bourgeoisie; providing for that eventuality, the resolution of the Third Congress speaks plainly about \u201chypocritical policy,\u201d \u201cpseudo democracy,\u201d \u201ca travesty of popular representation, something like the so-called Zemsky Sobor.\u201d[] But the whole point is that this is not said in the resolution on a provisional revolutionary government, for it has nothing to do with a provisional revolutionary government. This eventuality defers the problem of the insurrection and of the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government; it alters this problem, etc. The point in question now is not that all kinds of combinations are possible, that both victory and defeat are possible, that there may be direct or circuitous paths; the point is that it is impermissible for a Social-Democrat to cause confusion in the minds of the workers concerning the genuinely revolutionary path, that it is impermissible, to describe in the Osvobozhdeniye manner, as a decisive victory that which lacks the main requisite for victory. It is possible that we shall win even the eight-hour day, not at one stroke, but only by a long and roundabout way; but what would you say of a man who calls such impotence, such weakness as renders the proletariat incapable of counteracting procrastination, delays, haggling, treachery and reaction, a victory for the workers? It is possible that the Russian revolution will end in an \u201cabortive constitution,\u201d as was once stated in the Vperyod,[] but can this justify a Social-Democrat, who on the eve of a decisive struggle would call this abortion a \u201cdecisive victory over tsarism\u201d? It is possible that, at the worst, not only will we not win a republic, but that even the constitution we will get will be an illusory one, a constitution \u201c\u00e0 la Shipov\u201d,[] but would it be pardonable for a Social-Democrat to obscure our slogan of a republic?\n\nOf course the new-Iskraists have not as yet gone so far as to obscure it. But the degree to which the revolutionary spirit has fled from them, the degree to which lifeless pedantry has blinded them to the militant tasks of the moment is most vividly shown by the fact that in their resolution they, of all things, forgot to say a word about the republic. It is incredible, but it is a fact. All the slogans of Social-Democracy were endorsed, repeated, explained and presented in detail in the various resolutions of the Conference\u2014even the election of shop stewards and deputies by the workers was not forgotten, but in a resolution on a provisional revolutionary government they simply did not find occasion to mention the republic. To talk of the \u201cvictory\u201d of the people\u2019s insurrection, of the establishment of a provisional government, and not to indicate what relation these \u201csteps\u201d and acts have to the winning of a republic\u2014means writing a resolution not for the guidance of the proletarian struggle, but for the purpose of hobbling along at the tail end of the proletarian movement.\n\nTo sum up: the first part of the resolution ) gave no explanation whatever of the significance of a provisional revolutionary government from the standpoint of the struggle for a republic and of securing a genuinely popular and genuinely constituent assembly; ) confused the democratic consciousness of the proletariat by placing on a par with a decisive victory of the revolution over tsarism a state of affairs in which precisely the main requisite for a real victory is lacking.\n.\nThe Abolition of the Monarchist System and the Republic\nLet us go over to the next section of the resolution: \u201c...in either case such a victory will inaugurate a new phase in the revolutionary epoch.\n\n\u201cThe final abolition of the whole regime of the monarchy and the social estates in the process of mutual struggle between the elements of politically emancipated bourgeois society for the satisfaction of their social interests and for the direct acquisition of power\u2014such is the task in this new phase which the objective conditions of social development spontaneously evoke.\n\n\u201cTherefore, a provisional government that would under take to carry out the tasks of this revolution, bourgeois in its historical nature, would, in regulating the mutual struggle between antagonistic classes of a nation in the process of emancipation, not only have to advance revolutionary development, but also to combat factors in that development threatening the foundations of the capitalist system.\u201d\n\nLet us examine this section which forms an independent part of the resolution. The basic idea in the arguments quoted above coincides with the one set forth in the third clause of the Congress resolution. However, collation of these parts of the two resolutions will at once reveal the following radical difference between them. The Congress resolution, which briefly describes the social and economic basis of the revolution, concentrates attention entirely on the clear-cut struggle of classes for definite gains, and places in the fore front the militant tasks of the proletariat. The resolution of the Conference, which carries a long, nebulous, and confused description of the socio-economic basis of the revolution, speaks very vaguely about a struggle for definite gains. and leaves the militant tasks of the proletariat completely in the background. The resolution of the Conference speaks of the old order in the process of mutual struggle among the various elements of society. The Congress resolution says that we, the party of the proletariat, must effect this abolition; that only establishment of a democratic republic signifies genuine abolition of the old order; that we must win that republic; that we shall fight for it and for complete liberty, not only against the autocracy, but also against the bourgeoisie, when it attempts (and it will surely do so) to wrest our gains from us. The Congress resolution calls on a definite class to wage a struggle for a precisely defined immediate aim. The Conference resolution discourses on the mutual struggle of various forces. One resolution expresses the psychology of active struggle, the other that of the passive onlooker; one resounds with the call for live action, the other is steeped in lifeless pedantry. Both resolutions state that the present revolution is only our first step, which will be followed by a second; but from this, one resolution draws the conclusion that we must take this first step all the sooner, get it over all the sooner, win a republic, mercilessly crush the counter-revolution, and prepare the ground for the second step. The other resolution, however, oozes, so to speak, with verbose descriptions of the first step and (excuse the crude expression) simply masticates it. The Congress resolution takes the old, yet eternally new, ideas of Marxism (the bourgeois nature of a democratic revolution) as a preface or first premise, whence it draws conclusions as to the progressive tasks of the progressive class, which is fighting both for the democratic and for the socialist revolution. The Conference resolution does not go beyond the preface, chewing it over and over again, and trying to be clever about it.\n\nThis is the very distinction which has long divided the Russian Marxists into two wings: the moralising and the militant wings of the old days of \u201clegal Marxism\u201d, and the economic and political wings of the period of the nascent mass movement. From the correct Marxist premise concerning the deep economic roots of the class struggle in general and of the political struggle in particular, the Economists have drawn the singular conclusion that we must turn our backs on the political struggle and retard its development, narrow its scope, and reduce its aims. The political wing, on the contrary, has drawn a different conclusion from these same premises, namely, that the deeper the roots of our present struggle, the more widely, the more boldly, the more resolutely, and with greater initiative must we wage this struggle. We have the very same controversy before us now, only under different circumstances and in a different form. From the premises that a democratic revolution is far from being a socialist revolution, that the poor and needy are by no means the only ones to be \u201cinterested\u201d in it, that it is deeply rooted in the inescapable needs and requirements of the whole of bourgeois society\u2014from these premises we draw the conclusion that the advanced class must formulate its democratic aims all the more boldly, express them all the more sharply and completely, put forward the immediate slogan of a republic, and popularise the idea of the need to establish a provisional revolutionary government and to crush the counter revolution ruthlessly. Our opponents, the new-Iskra group, however, deduce from these very same premises that the democratic conclusions should not be expressed fully, that the republic may be omitted from the practical slogans, that we can refrain from popularising the idea of the need for a provisional revolutionary government, that a mere decision to convene a constituent assembly can be termed a decisive victory, that there is no need to advance the task of combating counter-revolution as our active aim, so that it may be submerged in a nebulous (and, as we shall presently see, wrongly formulated) reference to a \u201cprocess of mutual struggle\u201d. This is not the language of political leaders, but of archive fogeys.\n\nThe more closely one examines the various formulations in the resolution of the new-Iskra group, the clearer its aforementioned basic features become. We are told, for in stance, of a \u201cprocess of mutual struggle between the elements of politically emancipated bourgeois society\u201d. Bearing in mind the subject this resolution deals with (a provisional revolutionary government) one asks in astonishment, \u201cIf you are referring to the process of mutual struggle, how can you keep silent about the elements which are politically enslaving bourgeois society? Do the \u2019conferees\u2019 really imagine that, since they have assumed the revolution will be victorious, these elements have already disappeared?\u201d Such an idea would be absurd in general and an expression of the greatest political na\u00edvet\u00e9 and political short-sightedness in particular. After the revolution\u2019s victory over counter revolution the latter will not disappear; on the contrary, it will inevitably start a new and even more desperate struggle. Since the purpose of our resolution is to analyse the tasks that will confront us when the revolution is victorious, it is our duty to devote tremendous attention to the tasks of repelling counter-revolutionary attacks (as is done in the Congress resolution), and not to submerge these immediate, urgent, and vital political tasks of a militant party in general discussions on what will happen after the present revolutionary period, or what will happen when a \u201cpolitically emancipated society\u201d already exists. Just as the Economists would, by repeating the truism that politics are subordinated to economics, cover up their incapacity to understand urgent political tasks, so the newIskra-ists, by repeating the general truism that struggles will take place in a politically emancipated society, cover up their failure to understand the urgent revolutionary tasks of the political emancipation of this society.\n\nTake the expression \u201cthe final abolition of the whole regime of social estates and the monarchy.\u201d In plain language, the final abolition of the monarchist system means the establishment of a democratic republic. But our good Martynov and his admirers think that this expression is far too simple and clear. They insist on rendering it \u201cmore profound\u201d and saying it more \u201ccleverly.\u201d As a result, we get, on the one hand, ridiculous and vain efforts to appear profound; on the other hand, we get a description instead of a slogan, a sort of melancholy looking backward instead of a stirring appeal to march forward. We get the impression, not of living people eager to fight for a republic here and now, but of fossilised mummies who, sub specie aeternitatis,[] consider the question from the standpoint of plusquamperfectum viewpoint.\nLet us proceed further: \u201c... the provisional government ... would undertake to carry out the tasks of this ... bourgeois revolution.\u201d ...Here we see at once the result of the fact that our \u201cConferencers\u201d have overlooked a concrete question which confronts the political leaders of the proletariat. The concrete question of a provisional revolutionary government was obscured from their field of vision by the question of the future series of governments which will carry out the aims of the bourgeois revolution in general. If you want to consider the question \u201chistorically,\u201d the example of any European country will show you that it was a series of governments, not by any means \u201cprovisional,\u201d that carried out the historical aims of the bourgeois revolution, that even the governments which defeated the revolution were nonetheless forced to carry out the historical aims of that defeated revolution. But what is called a \u201cprovisional revolutionary government\u201d is something altogether different from what you are referring to: that is the name given to the government of a revolutionary epoch, which directly replaces the overthrown government and rests on the insurrection of the people, and not on some kind of representative institutions coming from the people. A provisional revolutionary government is the organ of struggle for the immediate victory of the revolution, for immediately repelling counter-revolutionary attempts, and not by any means an organ for carrying out the historical aims of the bourgeois revolution in general. Gentlemen, let us leave it to the future historians of a future Russkaya Starina[] to determine exactly what aims of the bourgeois revolution we, or this or that government, shall have achieved\u2014there will be time enough to do that thirty years from now; at present we must put forward slogans and give practical directives for the struggle for a republic and for the proletariat\u2019s most active participation in this struggle.\n\nFor the reasons stated, the final propositions in the forgoing section of the resolution which we have quoted above are also unsatisfactory. The expression that the provisional government would have to \u201cregulate\u201d the mutual struggle among the antagonistic classes is exceedingly inapt, or at any rate awkwardly put; Marxists should not use such liberal, Osvobozhdeniye formulations, which lead one to believe that it is possible to have governments which serve not as organs of the class struggle but as its \u201cregulators\u201d. . . . The government would \u201cnot only have to push revolutionary development further forward but also fight against those of its factors which threaten the foundations of the capitalist system.\u201d But it is the proletariat, the very same in whose name the resolution is speaking, that constitutes this \u201cfactor\u201d! Instead of indicating just how the proletariat should \u201cpush revolutionary development further forward\u201d at the present time (push it further than the constitutionalist bourgeois would care to go), instead of advice to prepare definite ways and means of combating the bourgeoisie when the latter turns against the conquests of the revolution, we are offered a general description of a process, which does not say a word about the concrete aims of our activity. The new Iskra-ist method of expressing its views reminds one of Marx\u2019s opinion (in his famous \u201ctheses\u201d on Feuerbach) of the old materialism, which was alien to the ideas of dialectics. The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways, said Marx, the point, however, is to change it.[] Similarly, the new-Iskraists can give a tolerable description and explanation of the process of struggle which is taking place before their eyes, but they are altogether incapable of giving a correct slogan for this struggle. Good marchers but bad leaders, they belittle the materialist conception of history by ignoring the active, leading and guiding part in history which can and must be played by parties that understand the material prerequisites of a revolution and that have placed themselves at the head of the progressive classes.\n\n.\nHow Should \u201cThe Revolution Be Pushed Forward\u201d?\nLet us quote the next section of the resolution:\n\n\u201cUnder such conditions, Social-Democracy must strive to maintain during the whole course of the revolution, a position which will best of all secure for it the possibility of pushing the revolution forward, which will not tie the hands of Social-Democracy in its struggle against the inconsistent and self-seeking policy of the bourgeois parties and which will preserve it from being merged in bourgeois democracy.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Social-Democracy must not set itself the aim of seizing or sharing power in the provisional government, but must remain the party of extreme revolutionary opposition.\u201d\n\nThe advice to occupy a position which best ensures the possibility of advancing the revolution pleases us very much indeed. We would only desire that this piece of good advice should be accompanied by a direct indication as to how Social-Democracy should further advance the revolution right now, in the present political situation, in a period of rumours, conjectures, and talk and schemes about the convocation of the people\u2019s representatives. Can the revolution now be further advanced by those who fail to understand the danger of the Osvobozhdeniye theory of \u201ccompromise\u201d between the people and the tsar, by those who call a mere \u201cdecision\u201d to convene a constituent assembly a victory, who do not set themselves the task of carrying on active propaganda of the idea of the need for a provisional revolutionary government, or who leave the slogan of a democratic republic in the background? Such people actually pull the revolution back, because, as far as practical politics are concerned, they have stopped at the level of the Osvobozhdeniye stand. What is the use of their recognising a programme which demands that the autocracy be replaced by a republic, if in a resolution on tactics that defines the Party\u2019s present and immediate tasks in the period of revolution they omit the slogan of a struggle for a republic? It is the Osvobozhdeniye position, the position of the constitutionalist bourgeoisie, that is now actually characterised by the fact that a decision to convene a popular constituent assembly is considered a decisive victory, while a prudent silence is maintained on the subject of a provisional revolutionary government and a republic! To advance the revolution, to take it beyond the limits to which the monarchist bourgeoisie advances it, it is necessary actively to produce, emphasise, and bring into the forefront slogans that will preclude the \u201cinconsistency\u201d of bourgeois democracy. At present there are only two such slogans: ) a provisional revolutionary government, and ) a republic, because the slogan of a popular constituent assembly has been accepted by the monarchist bourgeoisie (see the programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League) and accepted for the very purpose of devitalising the revolution, preventing its complete victory, and enabling the big bourgeoisie to strike a huckster\u2019s bargain with tsarism. And now we see that of the two slogans, which alone are capable of advancing the revolution, the Conference completely forgot the slogan of a republic, and plainly put the slogan of a provisional revolutionary government on a par with the Osvobozhdeniye slogan of a popular constituent assembly, calling both the one and the other \u201ca decisive victory of the revolution\u201d!!\n\nIndeed, such is the undoubted fact, which, we are sure, will serve as a landmark for the future historian of Russian Social-Democracy. The Conference of Social-Democrats held in May  passed a resolution which contains fine words about the necessity of advancing the democratic revolution, but in fact pulls it back and goes no farther than the democratic slogans of the monarchist bourgeoisie.\n\nThe new-Iskra group likes to accuse us of ignoring the danger of the proletariat becoming dissolved in bourgeois democracy. We should like to see the person who would undertake to prove this charge on the basis of the text of the resolutions passed by the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Our reply to our opponents is\u2014a Social-Democratic Party which operates in a bourgeois society cannot take part in politics without marching, in certain cases, side by side with bourgeois democracy. The difference between us in this respect is that we march side by side with the revolutionary and republican bourgeoisie, without merging with it, whereas you march side by side with the liberal and the monarchist bourgeoisie, without merging with it either. That is how matters stand.\n\nThe tactical slogans you have formulated in the name of the Conference coincide with the slogans of the \u201cConstitutional-Democratic\u201d Party, i.e., the party of the monarchist bourgeoisie; moreover, you have not even noticed or realised this coincidence, thus actually following in the wake of the Osvobozhdeniye fraternity.\n\nThe tactical slogans we have formulated in the name of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party coincide with the slogans of the democratic-revolutionary and republican bourgeoisie. In Russia this bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie have not yet formed themselves into a big people\u2019s party.[] But only one who is utterly ignorant of what is now taking place in Russia can doubt that elements of such a party exist. We intend to guide (if the great Russian revolution makes progress) not only the proletariat, organised by the Social-Democratic Party, but also this petty bourgeoisie, which is capable of marching side by side with us.\n\nThrough its resolution the Conference unconsciously descends to the level of the liberal and monarchist bourgeoisie. The Party Congress in its resolution consciously raises to its own level those elements of the revolutionary democracy that are capable of waging a struggle and not of acting as brokers.\n\nSuch elements are mostly to be found among the peasants. In classifying the big social groups according to their political tendencies we can, without danger of serious error, identify revolutionary and republican democracy with the mass of the peasants\u2014of course, in the same sense and with the same reservations and implied conditions as we can identify the working class with Social-Democracy. In other words, we can also formulate our conclusions in the following terms: in a revolutionary period the Conference in its national-wide[] political slogans unconsciously descends to the level of the mass of the landlords. The Party Congress in its national political slogans raises the peasant masses to the revolutionary level. We challenge anyone who because of this conclusion may accuse us of evincing a penchant for paradoxes, to refute the proposition that if we are not strong enough to bring the revolution to a successful conclusion, if the revolution terminates in a \u201cdecisive victory\u201d in the Osvobozhdentsi sense, i.e., exclusively in the form of a representative assembly convened by the tsar, which could be called a constituent assembly only in derision\u2014then this will be a revolution in which the landlord and big bourgeois element will preponderate. On the other hand, if we are destined to live through a really great revolution, if history prevents a \u201cmiscarriage\u201d this time, if we are strong enough to carry the revolution to a successful conclusion, to a decisive victory, not in the Osvobozhdeniye or the new Iskra sense of the word, then it will be a revolution in which the peasant and proletarian element will preponderate.\n\nSome people may, perhaps, interpret our admission that such a preponderance is possible as a renunciation of the view that the impending revolution will be bourgeois in character. This is very likely, considering how this concept is misused in the Iskra. For this reason it will not be at all superfluous to dwell on this question.\n\n.\nFrom what Direction is the Proletariat Threatened with the Danger of Having its Hands Tied in the Struggle Against the Inconsistent Bourgeoisie?\nMarxists are absolutely convinced of the bourgeois character of the Russian revolution. What does this mean? It means that the democratic reforms in the political system and the social and economic reforms, which have become a necessity for Russia, do not in themselves imply the undermining of capitalism, the undermining of bourgeois rule; on the contrary, they will, for the first time, really clear the ground for a wide and rapid, European, and not Asiatic, development of capitalism; they will, for the first time, make it possible for the bourgeoisie to rule as a class. The Socialist-Revolutionaries cannot grasp this idea, for they are ignorant of the rudiments of the laws of development of commodity and capitalist production; they fail to see that even the complete success of a peasant insurrection, even the redistribution of the whole of the land for the benefit of the peasants and in accordance with their desires (\u201cBlack Redistribution\u201d or something of that kind), will not destroy capitalism at all, but will, on the contrary, give an impetus to its development and hasten the class disintegration of the peasantry itself. The failure to grasp this truth makes the Socialist-Revolutionaries unconscious ideologists of the petty bourgeoisie. Insistence on this truth is of enormous importance for Social-Democracy, not only from the theoretical standpoint but also from the standpoint of practical politics, for from it follows that the complete class independence of the party of the proletariat in the present \u201cgeneral democratic\u201d movement is obligatory.\n\nBut it does not at all follow from this that a democratic revolution (bourgeois in its social and economic substance) is not of enormous interest for the proletariat. It does not at all follow from this that the democratic revolution cannot take place in a form advantageous mainly to the big capitalist, the financial magnate and the \u201cenlightened\u201d landlord, as well as in a form advantageous to the peasant and to the worker.\n\nThe new-Iskraists thoroughly misunderstand the meaning and significance of the category: bourgeois revolution. Through their arguments there constantly runs the idea that a bourgeois revolution is a revolution which can be advantageous only to the bourgeoisie. And yet nothing is more erroneous than such an idea. A bourgeois revolution is a revolution which does not go beyond the limits of the bourgeois, i.e., capitalist, social and economic system. A bourgeois revolution expresses the need for the development of capitalism, and far from destroying the foundations of capitalism, it does the opposite, it broadens and deepens them. This revolution therefore expresses the interests not only of the working class, but of the entire bourgeoisie as well. Since the rule of the bourgeoisie over the working class is inevitable under capitalism, it is quite correct to say that a bourgeois revolution expresses the interests not so much of the proletariat as of the bourgeoisie. But it is entirely absurd to think that a bourgeois revolution does not express the interests of the proletariat at all. This absurd idea boils down either to the hoary Narodnik theory that a bourgeois revolution runs counter to the interests of the proletariat, and that therefore we do not need bourgeois political liberty; or to anarchism, which rejects all participation of the proletariat in bourgeois politics, in a bourgeois revolution and in bourgeois parliamentarism. From the standpoint of theory, this idea disregards the elementary propositions of Marxism concerning the inevitability of capitalist development where commodity production exists. Marxism teaches that a society which is based on commodity production, and which has commercial intercourse with civilised capitalist nations, at a certain stage of its development, itself, inevitably takes the road of capitalism. Marxism has irrevocably broken with the ravings of the Narodniks and the anarchists to the effect that Russia, for instance, can avoid capitalist development, jump out of capitalism, or skip over it and proceed along some path other than the path of the class struggle on the basis and within the framework of this same capitalism.\n\nAll these principles of Marxism have been proved and explained over and over again in minute detail in general and with regard to Russia in particular. And from these principles it follows that the idea of seeking salvation for the working class in anything save the further development of capitalism is reactionary. In countries like Russia, the working class suffers not so much from capitalism as from the insufficient development of capitalism. The working class suffers not so much from capitalism as from the insufficient development of capitalism. The working class is therefore decidedly interested in the broadest, freest and most rapid development of capitalism. The removal of all the remnants of the old order which are hampering the broad, free and rapid development of capitalism is of decided advantage to the working class. The bourgeois revolution is precisely a revolution that most resolutely sweeps away the survivals of the past, the remnants of serfdom (which include not only autocracy but monarchy as well) and most fully guarantees the broadest, freest and most rapid development of capitalism.\n\nThat is why a bourgeois revolution is in the highest degree advantageous to the proletariat. A bourgeois revolution is absolutely necessary in the interests of the proletariat. The more complete and determined, the more consistent the bourgeois revolution, the more assured will be the proletarian struggle against the bourgeoisie for Socialism. Only those who are ignorant of the rudiments of scientific Socialism can regard this conclusion as new or strange, paradoxical. And from this conclusion, among other things, follows the thesis that, in a certain sense, a bourgeois revolution is more advantageous to the proletariat than to the bourgeoisie. This thesis is unquestionably correct in the following sense: it is to the advantage of the bourgeoisie to rely on certain remnants of the past as against the proletariat, for instance, on the monarchy, the standing army, etc. It is to the advantage of the bourgeoisie if the bourgeois revolution does not too resolutely sweep away all the remnants of the past, but leaves some of them, i.e., if this revolution is not fully consistent, if it is not complete and if it is not determined and relentless. Social-Democrats often express this idea somewhat differently by stating that the bourgeoisie betrays its own self, that the bourgeoisie betrays the cause of liberty, that the bourgeoisie is incapable of being consistently democratic. It is of greater advantage to the bourgeoisie if the necessary changes in the direction of bourgeois democracy take place more slowly, more gradually, more cautiously, less resolutely, by means of reforms and not by means of revolution; if these changes spare the \u201cvenerable\u201d institutions of serfdom (such as the monarchy) as much as possible; if these changes develop as little as possible the independent revolutionary activity, initiative and energy of the common people, i.e., the peasantry and especially the workers, for otherwise it will be easier for the workers, as the French say, \u201cto hitch the rifle from one shoulder to the other,\u201d i.e., to turn against the bourgeoisie the guns which the bourgeois revolution will place in their hands, the liberty which the revolution will bring, the democratic institutions which will spring up on the ground that is cleared of serfdom.\n\nOn the other hand, it is more advantageous for the working class if the necessary changes in the direction of bourgeois democracy take place by way of revolution and not by way of reform; for the way of reform is the way of delay, of procrastination, of the painfully slow decomposition of the putrid parts of the national organism. It is the proletariat and the peasantry that suffer first of all and most of all from their putrefaction. The revolutionary way is the way of quick amputation, which is the least painful to the proletariat, the way of the direct removal of the decomposing parts, the way of fewest concessions to and least consideration for the monarchy and the disgusting, vile, rotten and contaminating institutions which go with it.\n\nSo it is not only because of the censorship, not only \u201cfor fear of the Jews,\u201d that our bourgeois-liberal press deplores the possibility of a revolutionary way, is afraid of revolution, tries to frighten the tsar with the bogey of revolution, is anxious to avoid revolution, grovels and toadies for the sake of miserable reforms as a basis for a reformist way. This standpoint is shared not only by the Russkiye Vedomosti,[] Syn Otechestva,[] Nasha Zhizn[] and Nashi Dni,[] but also by the illegal, uncensored Osvobozhdeniye. The very position the bourgeoisie occupies as a class in capitalist society inevitably causes it to be inconsistent in a democratic revolution. The very position the proletariat occupies as a class compels it to be consistently democratic. The bourgeoisie looks backward, fearing democratic progress, which threatens to strengthen the proletariat. The proletariat has nothing to lose but its chains, but with the aid of democracy it has the whole world to gain. That is why the more consistent the bourgeois revolution is in achieving its democratic changes, the less will it limit itself to what is of advantage exclusively to the bourgeoisie. The more consistent the bourgeois revolution, the more does it guarantee the proletariat and the peasantry the benefits accruing from the democratic revolution.\n\nMarxism teaches the proletarian not to keep aloof from the bourgeois revolution, not to be indifferent to it, not to allow the leadership of the revolution to be assumed by the bourgeoisie but, on the contrary, to take a most energetic part in it, to fight most resolutely for consistent proletarian democracy, for carrying the revolution to its conclusion. We cannot jump out of the bourgeois-democratic boundaries of the Russian revolution, but we can vastly extend these boundaries, and within these boundaries we can and must fight for the interests of the proletariat, for its immediate needs and for the conditions that will make it possible to prepare its forces for the future complete victory. There is bourgeois democracy and bourgeois democracy. The Zemstvo monarchist who favours an upper chamber, and who \u201casks\u201d for universal suffrage while secretly, on the sly, striking a bargain with tsarism for a curtailed constitution, is also a bourgeois-democrat. And the peasant who is fighting, arms in hand, against the landlords and the government officials and with a \u201cna\u00efve republicanism\u201d proposes \u201cto send the tsar packing\u201d,[] is also a bourgeois-democrat. There are bourgeois-democratic regimes like the one in Germany and also in England, like the one in Austria and also like those in America or Switzerland. He would be a fine Marxist indeed, who in a period of democratic revolution failed to see the difference between the degrees of democracy, the difference of its various forms and confined himself to \u201cclever\u201d remarks to the effect that, after all, this is \u201ca bourgeois revolution,\u201d the fruits of a \u201cbourgeois revolution.\u201d\n\nOur new-Iskraists are just such clever fellows flaunting their shortsightedness. They confine themselves to disquisitions on the bourgeois character of the revolution just when and where it is necessary to be able to draw a distinction between republican-revolutionary and monarchist-liberal bourgeois democracy, to say nothing of the distinction between inconsistent bourgeois democratism and consistent proletarian democratism. They are satisfied\u2014as if they had really become like the \u201cman in the muffler\u201d[]\u2014to converse dolefully about a \u201cprocess of mutual struggle of antagonistic classes,\u201d when the question is one of giving democratic leadership in the present revolution, of emphasising progressive democratic slogans as distinguished from the treacherous slogans of Mr. Struve and Co., of bluntly and straight forwardly stating the immediate aims of the really revolutionary struggle of the proletariat and the peasantry, as distinguished from the liberal haggling of the landlords and factory owners. Such now is the gist of the matter, which you, gentlemen, have missed: will our revolution result in a real, immense victory, or merely in a wretched deal, will it go so far as the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, or will it \u201cpeter out\u201d in a liberal constitution \u00e0 la Shipov?\n\nAt first sight it may appear that in raising this question we are deviating entirely from our subject. But this may appear to be so only at first sight. As a matter of fact, it is precisely this question that lies at the root of the difference in principle which has already become clearly marked between the Social-Democratic tactics of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and the tactics initiated by the Conference of the new Iskra supporters. The latter have already taken not two but three steps back, resurrecting the mistakes of Economism in solving problems that are incomparably more complex, more important and more vital to the workers\u2019 party, viz., questions of its tactics in time of revolution. That is why we must analyse the question we have raised with all due attention.\n\nThe above-quoted section of the new-Iskraists resolution which we have quoted above points to the danger of Social-Democracy tying its hands in the struggle against the inconsistent policy of the bourgeoisie, of its becoming dissolved in bourgeois democracy. The idea of this danger runs like a thread through all the literature typical of the new Iskra, it is the real pivot of the principle involved in our Party split (ever since the elements of squabbling in this split were wholly eclipsed by the elements of a turn towards Economism). And without any equivocation we admit that this danger really exists, that just at the present time, at the height of the Russian revolution, this danger has become particularly grave. The pressing and extremely responsible duty that devolves on all of us theoreticians or\u2014as I should prefer to say of myself\u2014 publicists of Social-Democracy, is to find out from what direction this danger actually threatens. For the source of our disagreement is not a dispute as to whether such a danger exists, but the dispute as to whether it is caused by the so-called khvostism of the \u201cMinority\u201d or the so-called revolutionism of the \u201cMajority.\u201d\n\nTo remove all misinterpretations and misunderstandings, let us first of all note that the danger to which we are referring lies not in the subjective, but in the objective aspect of the matter, not in the formal position which Social-Democracy will take in the struggle, but in the material outcome of the entire present revolutionary struggle. The question is not whether this or that Social-Democratic group will want to dissolve in bourgeois democracy or whether they are conscious of the fact that they are merging. Nobody suggests that. We do not suspect any Social-Democrat of harbouring such a desire, and this is not at all a question of desires. Nor is it a question of whether this or that Social-Democratic group will formally retain its separate identity, individuality and independence of bourgeois democracy throughout the course of the revolution. They may not only proclaim such \u201cindependence\u201d but even retain it formally, and yet it may turn out that their hands will nonetheless be tied in the struggle against the inconsistency of the bourgeoisie. The final political result of the revolution may prove to be that, in spite of the formal \u201cindependence\u201d of Social-Democracy, in spite of its complete organisational individuality as a separate party, it will in fact not be independent, it will not be able to put the imprint of its proletarian independence on the course of events, will prove so weak that, on the whole and in the last analysis, its \u201cdissolving\u201d in the bourgeois democracy will nonetheless be a historical fact.\n\nThat is what constitutes the real danger. Now let us see from what direction the danger threatens: from the fact that Social-Democracy as represented by the new Iskra is deviating to the Right\u2014as we believe; or from the fact that Social-Democracy as represented by the \u201cMajority,\u201d the Vperyod, etc., is deviating to the Left\u2014as the new-Iskraists believe.\n\nThe answer to this question, as we have pointed out, depends on the objective combination of the actions of the various social forces. The character of these forces has been defined theoretically by the Marxian analysis of Russian life; at the present time it is being defined in practice by the open action of groups and classes in the course of the revolution. Thus, the entire theoretical analysis made by the Marxists long before the period we are now passing through, as well as all the practical observations of the development of revolutionary events, show that from the standpoint of objective conditions there are two possible courses and outcomes of the revolution in Russia. A change in the economic and political system in Russia along bourgeois-democratic lines is inevitable and unavoidable. No power on earth can prevent such a change. But the combined actions of the existing forces which are effecting that change may result in one of two things, may bring about one of two forms of that change. Either ) the result will be a \u201cdecisive victory of the revolution over tsarism,\u201d or ) the forces will be inadequate for a decisive victory and the matter will end in a deal between tsarism and the most \u201cinconsistent\u201d and most \u201cself-seeking\u201d elements of the bourgeoisie. By and large all the infinite variety of detail and combinations, which no one is able to foresee, lead to one or the other.\n\nLet us now consider these two outcomes, first, from the standpoint of their social significance and, secondly, from the standpoint of the position of Social-Democracy (its \u201cdissolving\u201d or \u201chaving its hands tied\u201d) in one or the other case.\n\nWhat is a \u201cdecisive victory of the revolution over tsarism\u201d? We have already seen that in using this expression the new-Iskraists fail to grasp even its immediate political significance. Still less do they seem to understand the class essence of this concept. Surely, we Marxists must not under any circumstances allow ourselves to be deluded by words such as \u201crevolution\u201d or \u201cthe great Russian revolution,\u201d as do many revolutionary democrats (of the Gapon type). We must be perfectly clear in our minds as to what real social forces are opposed to \u201ctsarism\u201d (which is a real force, perfectly intelligible to all) and are capable of gaining a \u201cdecisive victory\u201d over it. Such a force cannot be the big bourgeoisie, the landlords, the factory owners, \u201csociety\u201d which follows the lead of the Osvobozhdentsi. We see that these do not even want a decisive victory. We know that owing to their class position they are incapable of waging a decisive struggle against tsarism; they are too heavily fettered by private property, capital and land to enter into a decisive struggle. They need tsarism with its bureaucratic, police and military forces for use against the proletariat and the peasantry too much to be able to strive for its destruction. No, the only force capable of gaining \u201ca decisive victory over tsarism,\u201d is the people, i.e., the proletariat and the peasantry, if we take the main, big forces and distribute the rural and urban petty bourgeoisie (also part of \u201cthe people\u201d) between the two. \u201cA decisive victory of the revolution over tsarism\u201d is the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. Our new-Iskraists cannot escape from this conclusion, which Vperyod pointed out long ago. No one else is capable of gaining a decisive victory over tsarism.\n\nAnd such a victory will be precisely a dictatorship, i.e., it must inevitably rely on military force, on the arming of the masses, on an insurrection, and not on institutions of one kind or another, established in a \u201clawful\u201d or \u201cpeaceful\u201d way. It can be only a dictatorship, for the realisation of the changes which are urgently and absolutely indispensable for the proletariat and the peasantry will call forth the desperate resistance of the landlords, of the big bourgeoisie and of tsarism. Without a dictatorship it is impossible to break down that resistance and to repel the counter-revolutionary attempts. But of course it will be a democratic, not a socialist dictatorship. It will not be able (without a series of intermediary stages of revolutionary development) to affect the foundations of capitalism. At best it may bring about a radical redistribution of landed property in favour of the peasantry, establish consistent and full democracy including the formation of a republic, eradicate all the oppressive features of Asiatic bondage, not only in village but also in factory life, lay the foundation for a thorough improvement in the position of the workers and for a rise in their standard of living, and\u2014last but not least\u2014carry the revolutionary conflagration into Europe. Such a victory will by no means as yet transform our bourgeois revolution into a socialist revolution; the democratic revolution will not directly overstep the bounds of bourgeois social and economic relationships; nevertheless, the significance of such a victory for the future development of Russia and of the whole world will be immense. Nothing will raise the revolutionary energy of the world proletariat so much, nothing will shorten the path leading to its complete victory to such an extent, as this decisive victory of the revolution that has now started in Russia.\n\nHow far such a victory is probable, is another question. We are not in the least inclined to be unreasonably optimistic on that score, we do not for a moment forget the immense difficulties of this task, but since we are out to fight we must desire victory and be able to point out the right road to it. Tendencies capable of leading to such a victory undoubtedly exist. True, our, Social-Democratic, influence on the masses of the proletariat is as yet very, very inadequate; the revolutionary influence on the mass of the peasantry is altogether insignificant; the proletariat, and especially the peasantry, are still frightfully scattered, backward and ignorant. But revolution unites quickly and enlightens quickly. Every step in its development rouses the masses and attracts them with irresistible force to the side of the revolutionary program, as the only program that fully and consistently expresses their real and vital interests.\n\nAccording to a law of mechanics, every action produces an equal reaction. In history also the destructive force of a revolution is to a considerable degree dependent on how strong and protracted the suppression of the striving for liberty had been, and how profound the contradiction between the antediluvian \u201csuperstructure\u201d and the living forces of the present epoch. The international political situation, too, is in many respects shaping itself in a way most advantageous for the Russian revolution. The insurrection of the workers and peasants has already commenced; it is sporadic, spontaneous, weak, but it unquestionably and undoubtedly proves the existence of forces capable of waging a decisive struggle and marching towards a decisive victory.\n\nIf these forces prove inadequate, tsarism will have time to conclude the deal which is already being prepared on two sides, by Messrs. the Bulygins on the one side, and Messrs. the Struves, on the other. Then the whole thing will end in a curtailed constitution, or, if the worst comes to the worst, even in a travesty of a constitution. This will also be a \u201cbourgeois revolution,\u201d but it will be a miscarriage, a premature birth, a mongrel. Social-Democracy entertains no illusions on that score, it knows the treacherous nature of the bourgeoisie, it will not lose heart or abandon its persistent, patient, sustained work of giving the proletariat class training even in the most drab, humdrum days of bourgeois-constitutional, \u201cShipov\u201d bliss. Such an outcome would be more or less similar to the outcome of almost all the democratic revolutions in Europe during the nineteenth century, and our Party development would then proceed along the difficult, hard, long, but familiar and beaten track.\n\nThe question now arises: in which of these two possible outcomes will Social-Democracy find its hands actually tied in the fight against the inconsistent and self-seeking bourgeoisie, find itself actually \u201cdissolved,\u201d or almost so, in bourgeois democracy?\n\nIt is sufficient to put this question clearly to have not a moment\u2019s difficulty in answering it.\n\nIf the bourgeoisie succeeds in frustrating the Russian revolution by coming to terms with tsarism, Social-Democracy will find its hands actually tied in the fight against the inconsistent bourgeoisie; Social-Democracy will find itself dissolved \u201cin bourgeois democracy\u201d in the sense that the proletariat will not succeed in putting its clear imprint on the revolution, will not succeed in settling accounts with tsarism in the proletarian or, as Marx once said, \u201cin the plebeian\u201d way.\n\nIf the revolution gains a decisive victory\u2014then we shall settle accounts with tsarism in the Jacobin, or, if you like, in the plebeian way. \u201cThe whole French terrorism,\u201d wrote Marx in  in the famous Neue Rheinische Zeitung, \u201cwas nothing but a plebeian manner of settling accounts with the enemies of the bourgeoisie, with absolutism, feudalism and philistinism\u201d (see Marx, Nachlass, Mehring\u2019s edition, Volume III, p. ).[] Have those people who, in a period of a democratic revolution, try to frighten the Social-Democratic workers in Russia with the bogey of \u201cJacobinism\u201d ever stopped to think of the significance of these words of Marx?\n\nThe Girondists of contemporary Russian Social-Democracy, the new Iskra-ists, do not merge with the Osvobozhdentsi, but in point of fact they, by reason of the nature of their slogans, follow at the tail of the latter. And the Osvobozhdentsi, i.e., the representatives of the liberal bourgeoisie, wish to settle accounts with the autocracy gently, in a reformist way, in a yielding manner, so as not to offend the aristocracy, the nobles, the Court\u2014cautiously, without breaking anything\u2014kindly and politely, as befits gentlemen in white gloves (like the ones Mr. Petrunkevich borrowed from a bashi-bazouk to wear at the reception of \u201crepresentatives of the people\u201d[?] held by Nicholas the Bloody[] . See Proletary, No. [] ).\n\nThe Jacobins of contemporary Social-Democracy\u2014the Bolsheviks, the Vperyodovtsi, Syezdovtsi, Proletartsi (e.g. supporters of the Vperyod, the \u201cCongress\u201d group, or supporters of Proletary) \u2014 all names given to the Bolsheviks, derived from their publication of the two papers mentioned, and \u201cSyezdovtsi\u201d because they convened the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. or whatever we may call them\u2014wish by their slogans to raise the revolutionary and republican petty bourgeoisie, and especially the peasantry, to the level of the consistent democratism of the proletariat, which fully retains its individuality as a class. They want the people, i.e., the proletariat and the peasantry, to settle accounts with the monarchy and the aristocracy in the \u201cplebeian way,\u201d ruthlessly destroying the enemies of liberty, crushing their resistance by force, making no concessions whatever to the accursed heritage of serfdom, of Asiatic barbarism and human degradation.\n\nThis, of course, does not mean that we necessarily propose to imitate the Jacobins of , to adopt their views, program, slogans and methods of action. Nothing of the kind. Our program is not an old one, it is a new one\u2014the minimum program of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. We have a new slogan: the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. We shall also have, if we live to see a real victory of the revolution, new methods of action, in harmony with the nature and aims of the working-class party that is striving for a complete socialist revolution. By our comparison we merely want to explain that the representatives of the progressive class of the twentieth century, of the proletariat, i.e., the Social-Democrats, are divided into two wings (the opportunist and the revolutionary) similar to those into which the representatives of the progressive class of the eighteenth century, the bourgeoisie, were divided, i.e., the Girondists and the Jacobins.\n\nOnly in the event of a complete victory of the democratic revolution will the proletariat have its hands free in the struggle against the inconsistent bourgeoisie, only in that event will it not become \u201cdissolved\u201d in bourgeois democracy, but will leave its proletarian or rather proletarian-peasant imprint on the whole revolution.\n\nIn a word, in order to avoid finding itself with its hands tied in the struggle against the inconsistent bourgeois democrats, the proletariat must be sufficiently class conscious and strong to rouse the peasantry to revolutionary consciousness, to direct its attack, and thereby to pursue the line of consistent proletarian democratism independently.\n\nThis is how matters stand with regard to the question, so ineptly dealt with by the new Iskragroup, of the danger of our hands being tied in the struggle against the inconsistent bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie will always be inconsistent. There is nothing more na\u00efve and futile than attempts to set forth conditions and points[] , which if satisfied, would enable us to consider that the bourgeois democrat is a sincere friend of the people. Only the proletariat can be a consistent fighter for democracy. It may become a victorious fighter for democracy only if the peasant masses join its revolutionary struggle. If the proletariat is not strong enough for this, the bourgeoisie will be at the head of the democratic revolution and will impart to it an inconsistent and self-seeking nature. Nothing short of a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry can prevent this.\n\nThus, we arrive at the indubitable conclusion that it is precisely the new Iskra tactics, by its objective significance, that are playing into the hands of the bourgeois democrats. Preaching organisational diffusion that goes to the length of plebiscites, the principle of compromise and the divorcement of Party literature from the Party, belittling the aims of armed insurrection, confusing the popular political slogans of the revolutionary proletariat with those of the monarchist bourgeoisie, distorting the requisites for a \u201cdecisive victory of the revolution over tsarism\u201d\u2014all this taken together constitutes that very policy of khvostism in a revolutionary period which perplexes the proletariat, disorganises it, confuses its understanding and belittles the tactics of Social-Democracy, instead of pointing out the only way to victory and of rallying all the revolutionary and republican elements of the people to the proletariat\u2019s slogan.\n\n*     *\n*\nTo bear out this conclusion, reached by us through analysis of the resolution, let us approach this same question from other angles. Let us see, first, how in the Georgian Sotsial-Demokrat a na\u00efve and outspoken Menshevik illustrates the new-Iskra. Secondly, let us see who is actually making use of the new Iskra slogans in the present political situation.\n\n.\nThe Tactics of \u201cEliminating The Conservatives from the Government\u201d\nThe article in the organ of the Tiflis Menshevik \u201cCommittee\u201d (Sotsial-Demokrat, No. ) to which we have just referred is entitled \u201cThe Zemsky Sobor and Our Tactics.\u201d Its author has not yet entirely forgotten our program; he advances the slogan of a republic, but this is how he discusses tactics:\n\n\u201cIt is possible to point to two ways of achieving this goal\u201d (a republic): \u201ceither completely ignore the Zemsky Sobor that is being convened by the government and defeat the government by force of arms, form a revolutionary government and convene a constituent assembly, or declare the Zemsky Sobor the centre of our actions, influencing its composition and activity by force of arms and either forcibly compelling it to declare itself a constituent assembly or convening a constituent assembly through it. These two tactics differ very sharply from one another. Let us see which of them is more advantageous to us.\u201d\n\nThis is how the Russian new-Iskraists set forth the ideas that were subsequently incorporated in the resolution we have analysed. Note that this was written before the battle of Tsushima,[] when the Bulygin \u201cscheme\u201d had not yet seen the light of the day. Even the liberals were losing patience and expressing their lack of confidence in the pages of the legal press; but a new Iskra-ist Social-Democrat proved more credulous than the liberals. He declares that the Zemsky Sobor \u201cis being convened\u201d and trusts the tsar so much that he proposes to make this as yet non-existent Zemsky Sobor (or, possibly, \u201cState Duma\u201d or \u201cAdvisory Legislative Assembly\u201d?) the centre of our actions. Being more outspoken and straightforward than the authors of the resolution adopted at the Conference, our Tiflisian does not put the two \u201ctactics\u201d (which he expounds with inimitable na\u00efvet\u00e9) on a par but declares that the second is more \u201cadvantageous.\u201d Just listen:\n\n\u201cThe first tactics. As you know, the coming revolution is a bourgeois revolution, i.e., its purpose is to effect such changes in the present system as are of interest not only to the proletariat but to the whole of bourgeois society. All classes are opposed to the government, even the capitalists themselves. The militant proletariat and the militant bourgeoisie are in a certain sense marching together and jointly attacking the autocracy from different sides. The government is completely isolated and lacks public sympathy. For this reason it is very easy to destroy it. The Russian proletariat as a whole is not yet sufficiently class conscious and organised to be able to carry out the revolution by itself. And even if it were able to do so, it would carry through a proletarian (socialist) revolution and not a bourgeois revolution. Hence, it is in our interest that the government remain without allies, that it be unable to disunite the opposition, unable to ally the bourgeoisie to itself and leave the proletariat isolated....\u201d\n\nSo, it is in the interests of the proletariat that the tsarist government shall not be able to disunite the bourgeoisie and the proletariat! Is it not by mistake that this Georgian organ is called Sotsial-Demokrat instead of Osvobozhdeniye? And note its peerless philosophy of democratic revolution! Is it not obvious that this poor Tiflisian is hopelessly confused by the pedantic khvostist interpretation of the concept \u201cbourgeois revolution\u201d? He discusses the question of the possible isolation of the proletariat in a democratic revolution and forgets ... forgets about a trifle ... about the peasantry! of the possible allies of the proletariat he knows and favours the landowning Zemstvo-ists and is not aware of the peasants. And this in the Caucasus! Well, were we not right when we said that by its method of reasoning the new Iskra was sinking to the level of the monarchist bourgeoisie instead of raising the revolutionary peasantry to the position of our ally?\n\n\u201c... Otherwise the defeat of the proletariat and the victory of the government is inevitable. This is just what the autocracy is striving for. In its Zemsky Sobor it will undoubtedly attract to its side the representatives of the nobility, of the Zemstvos, the cities, the universities and similar bourgeois institutions. It will try to appease them with petty concessions and thereby reconcile them to itself. Strengthened in this way, it will direct all its blows against the working people who will have been isolated. It is our duty to prevent such an unfortunate outcome. But can this be done of the first method? Let us assume that we paid no attention whatever to the Zemsky Sobor, but started to prepare for insurrection ourselves, and one fine day came out in the streets armed and ready for battle. The result would be that we would be confronted not with one but with two enemies: the government and the Zemsky Sobor. While we were preparing, they would manage to come to terms, enter into an agreement with one another, draw up a constitution advantageous to themselves and divide power between them. These tactics are of direct advantage to the government, and we must reject them in the most energetic fashion....\u201d\n\nNow this is frank! We must resolutely reject the \u201ctactics\u201d of preparing an insurrection because \u201cmeanwhile\u201d the government would come to terms with the bourgeoisie! Can one find in the old literature of the most rabid \u201cEconomism\u201d anything that would even approximate such a disgrace to revolutionary Social-Democracy? That insurrections and outbreaks of workers and peasants are occurring, first in one place and then in another, is a fact. The Zemsky Sobor, however, is a Bulygin promise. And the Sotsial-Demokrat of the city of Tiflis decides: to reject the tactics of preparing an insurrection and to wait for a \u201ccentre of influence\u201d\u2014the Zemsky Sobor....\n\n\u201c...The second tactics, on the contrary, consist in placing the Zemsky Sobor under our surveillance, in not giving it the opportunity to act according to its own will and enter into an agreement with the government.[]\n\n\u201cWe support the Zemsky Sobor to the extent that it fights the autocracy, and we fight it in those cases when it becomes reconciled with the autocracy. By energetic interference and force we shall cause a split among the deputies[] , rally the radicals to our side, eliminate the conservatives from the government and thus put the whole Zemsky Sobor on the path of revolution. Thanks to such tactics the government will always remain isolated, the opposition strong and the establishment of a democratic system will thereby be facilitated.\u201d\n\nWell, well! Let anyone now say that we exaggerate the new Iskra-ists\u2019 turn to the most vulgar semblance of Economism. This is positively like the famous powder for exterminating flies: you catch the fly, sprinkle it with the powder and the fly will die. Split the deputies of the Zemsky Sobor by force, \u201celiminate the conservatives from the government\u201d\u2014and the whole Zemsky Sobor will take the path of revolution. . . . No \u201cJacobin\u201d armed insurrection of any sort, but just like that, in genteel, almost parliamentary fashion, \u201cinfluencing\u201d the members of the Zemsky Sobor.\n\nPoor Russia! It has been said that she always wears the old-fashioned bonnets that Europe discards. We have no parliament as yet, even Bulygin has not yet promised one, but we have any amount of parliamentary cretinism.[]\n\n\u201c. . . How should this interference be effected? First of all, we shall demand that the Zemsky Sobor be convened on the basis of universal and equal suffrage, direct elections and secret ballot. Simultaneously with the announcement[] of this method of election, complete freedom to carry on the election campaign, i.e., freedom of assembly, of speech and of the press, the inviolability of the electors and the candidates and the release of all political prisoners must be made law.[] The elections themselves must be fixed as late as possible so that we have sufficient time to inform and prepare the people. And since the drafting of the regulations governing the convocation of the Sobor has been entrusted to a commission headed by Bulygin, Minister of the Interior, we should also exert pressure on this commission and on its members.[] If the Bulygin Commission refuses to satisfy our demands[] and grants suffrage only to property owners, then we must interfere in these elections and, by revolutionary means, force the voters to elect progressive candidates and in the Zemsky Sobor demand a constituent assembly. Finally, we must, by all possible measures: demonstrations, strikes and insurrection if need be, compel the Zemsky Sobor to convene a constituent assembly or declare itself to be such. The armed proletariat must constitute itself the defender of the constituent assembly, and both together[] will march forward to a democratic republic.\n\n\u201cSuch are the Social-Democratic tactics, and they alone will secure us victory.\u201d\n\nLet not the reader imagine that this incredible nonsense is simply a maiden attempt at writing on the part of some new Iskra adherent with no authority or influence. No, this is what is stated in the organ of an entire committee of new Iskra-ists, the Tiflis Committee. More than that. This nonsense has been openly endorsed by the \u201cIskra\u201d in No.  of which we read the following about that issue of the Sotsial-Demokrat :\n\n\u201cThe first issue is edited in a lively and talented manner. The experienced hand of a capable editor and writer is perceptible. . . . It may be said with all confidence that the newspaper will brilliantly carry out the task it has set itself.\u201d\n\nYes! If that task is clearly to show all and sundry the utter ideological decay of new Iskra, then it has indeed been carried out \u201cbrilliantly.\u201d No one could have expressed the new Iskra degradation to liberal bourgeois opportunism in a more \u201clively, talented and capable\u201d manner.\n\n.\nOsvobozhdeniyeism and New Iskra Trends\nLet us now proceed to another striking confirmation of the political meaning of new-Iskra trend.\n\nIn a splendid, remarkable and most instructive article, entitled \u201cHow to Find Oneself\u201d (Osvobozhdeniye, No. ), Mr. Struve wages war against the \u201cprogrammatic revolutionism\u201d of our extreme parties. Mr. Struve is particularly displeased with me personally.[] Mr. Struve could not please me more: I could not wish for a better ally in the fight against the renascent Economism of the new-Iskraists and the utter lack of principle displayed by the \u201cSocialist-Revolutionaries.\u201d On some other occasion we shall relate how Mr. Struve and the Osvobozhdeniye proved in practice how utterly reactionary are the \u201camendments\u201d to Marxism made in the draft program of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. We have already repeatedly[] spoken about how Mr. Struve rendered me honest, faithful and real service every time he approved of the new-Iskraists in principle and we shall say so once more now.\n\nMr. Struve\u2019s article contains a number of very interesting statements, which we can note here only in passing. He intends \u201cto create Russian democracy by relying on class collaboration and not on class struggle,\u201d in which case \u201cthe socially privileged intelligentsia\u201d (something in the nature of the \u201ccultured nobility\u201d to which Mr. Struve makes obeisance with the grace of a truly high-society . . . lackey) will bring the weight of its \u201csocial position\u201d (the weight of its moneybags) to this \u201cnon-class\u201d party. Mr. Struve expresses the desire to show the youth the worthlessness \u201cof the hackneyed radical opinion that the bourgeoisie has become frightened and has sold out the proletariat and the cause of liberty.\u201d (We welcome this desire with all our heart. Nothing will confirm the correctness of this Marxian \u201chackneyed\u201d opinion better than a war waged against it by Mr. Struve. Please, Mr. Struve, don\u2019t pigeonhole this splendid plan of yours!)\n\nFor the purposes of our subject it is important to note the practical slogans against which this politically sensitive representative of the Russian bourgeoisie, who is so responsive to the slightest change in the weather, is fighting at the present time. First, he is fighting against the slogan of republicanism. Mr. Struve is firmly convinced that this slogan is \u201cincomprehensible and foreign to the masses of the people\u201d (he forgets to add: comprehensible, but not of advantage to the bourgeoisie!). We should like to see what reply Mr. Struve would get from the workers in our study circles and at our mass meetings! Or are the workers not the people? And the peasants? They are given to what Mr. Struve calls \u201cna\u00efve republicanism\u201d (\u201cto kick out the tsar\u201d)\u2014but the liberal bourgeoisie believes that na\u00efve republicanism will be replaced not by enlightened republicanism but by enlightened monarchism! \u00c7a d\u00e9pend, Mr. Struve; it will depend on circumstances. Neither tsarism nor the bourgeoisie can help opposing a radical improvement in the condition of the peasantry at the expense of the landed estates, whereas the working class cannot help assisting the peasantry in this respect.\n\nSecondly, Mr. Struve assures us that \u201cin a civil war the attacking party always proves to be in the wrong.\u201d This idea verges closely on the above-mentioned trends of the new Iskra ideas. We will not say, of course, that in civil war it is always advantageous to attack; no, sometimes defensive tactics are obligatory for a time. But to apply a proposition like the one Mr. Struve has made to Russia in  means precisely displaying a little of the \u201chackneyed radical opinion\u201d (\u201cthe bourgeoisie takes fright and betrays the cause of liberty\u201d). Whoever now refuses to attack the autocracy and reaction, whoever is not making preparations for such an attack, whoever is not advocating it, takes the name of adherent of the revolution in vain.\n\nMr. Struve condemns the slogans: \u201csecrecy\u201d and \u201crioting\u201d (a riot being \u201can insurrection in miniature\u201d). Mr. Struve spurns both the one and the other\u2014and he does so from the standpoint of \u201capproaching the masses.\u201d We should like to ask Mr. Struve whether he can point to any passage in, for instance, What Is To Be Done?\u2014the work of an extreme revolutionary from his standpoint\u2014which advocates rioting. As regards \u201csecrecy\u201d is there really much difference between, for example, us and Mr. Struve? Are we not both working on \u201cillegal\u201d newspapers which are being smuggled into Russia \u201csecretly\u201d and which serve the \u201csecret\u201d groups of either the Osvobozhdeniye League or the R.S.D.L.P.? Our workers\u2019 mass meetings are often held \u201csecretly\u201d \u2014that sin does exist. But what about the meetings of the gentlemen of the Osvobozhdeniye League? Is there any reason why you should brag, Mr. Struve, and look down upon the despised partisans of despised secrecy?\n\nTrue, the supplying of arms to the workers demands strict secrecy. On this point Mr. Struve is rather more outspoken. Just listen: \u201cAs regards armed insurrection, or a revolution in the technical sense, only mass propaganda in favour of a democratic program can create the social-psychological conditions for a general armed insurrection. Thus, even from the point of view that an armed insurrection is the inevitable consummation of the present struggle for emancipation\u2014a view I do not share\u2014the permeation of the masses with ideas of democratic reform is a most fundamental and most necessary task.\u201d\n\nMr. Struve tries to evade the issue. He speaks of the inevitability of an insurrection instead of speaking about its necessity for the victory of the revolution. The insurrection\u2014unprepared, spontaneous, sporadic\u2014has already begun. No one can positively vouch that it will develop into an entire and integral popular armed insurrection, for that depends on the state of the revolutionary forces (which can be fully gauged only in the course of the struggle itself), on the behaviour of the government and the bourgeoisie, and on a number of other circumstances which it is impossible to estimate exactly. There is no point in speaking about inevitability, in the sense of absolute certainty with regard to some definite event, as Mr. Struve does. What you must discuss, if you want to be a partisan of the revolution is whether insurrection is necessary for the victory of the revolution, whether it is necessary to proclaim it vigorously, to advocate and make immediate and energetic preparations for it. Mr. Struve cannot fail to understand this difference: he does not, for instance, obscure the question of the necessity of universal suffrage\u2014which is indisputable for a democrat\u2014by raising the question of whether its attainment is inevitable in the course of the present revolution\u2014which is debatable and of no urgency for people engaged in political activity. By evading the issue of the necessity of an insurrection, Mr. Struve expresses the inner most essence of the political position of the liberal bourgeoisie. In the first place, the bourgeoisie would prefer to come to terms with the autocracy rather than crush it; secondly, the bourgeoisie in any case thrusts the armed struggle upon the shoulders of the workers. This is the real meaning of Mr. Struve\u2019s evasiveness. That is why he backs out of the question of the necessity of an insurrection towards the question of the \u201csocial-psychological conditions\u201d for it, of preliminary \u201cpropaganda.\u201d Just as the bourgeois windbags in the Frankfurt Parliament of  engaged in drawing up resolutions, declarations and decisions, in \u201cmass propaganda\u201d and in preparing the \u201csocial-psychological conditions\u201d at a time when it was a matter of repelling the armed force of the government, when the movement \u201cled to the necessity\u201d for an armed struggle, when verbal persuasion alone (which is a hundredfold necessary during the preparatory period) became banal, bourgeois inactivity and cowardice\u2014so also Mr. Struve evades the question of insurrection, screening himself behind phrases. Mr. Struve vividly shows us what many Social-Democrats stubbornly fail to see, namely, that a revolutionary period differs from ordinary, everyday preparatory periods in history in that the temper, excitement and convictions of the masses must and do reveal themselves in action.\n\nVulgar revolutionism fails to see that the word is also a deed; this proposition is indisputable when applied to history generally, or to those periods of history when no open political mass actions take place, and when they can not be replaced or artificially evoked by putsches of any sort. Khvostist revolutionaries fail to understand that\u2014when a revolutionary period has started, when the old \u201csuperstructure\u201d has cracked from top to bottom, when open political action on the part of the classes and masses who are creating a new superstructure for themselves has become a fact, when civil war has begun\u2014then, to confine oneself to \u201cwords\u201d as of old, and fail to advance the direct slogan to pass to \u201cdeeds,\u201d still to try avoid deeds by pleading the need for \u201cpsychological conditions\u201d and \u201cpropaganda\u201d in general, is apathy, lifelessness, pedantry, or else betrayal of the revolution and treachery to it. The Frankfurt windbags of the democratic bourgeoisie are a memorable historical example of just such treachery, or of just such pedantic stupidity.\n\nWould you like an explanation of this difference between vulgar revolutionism and the khvostism of revolutionaries by an example taken from the history of the Social Democratic movement in Russia? We shall give you such an explanation. Call to mind the years  and , which are so recent but which already seem ancient history to us today. Demonstrations had begun. The protagonists of vulgar revolutionism raised a cry about \u201cstorming\u201d (Rabocheye Dyelo[]) \u201cbloodthirsty leaflets\u201d were issued (of Berlin origin, if my memory does not fail me), attacks were made on the \u201cliterature writing\u201d and armchair nature of the idea of conducting agitation on a national scale through a newspaper (Nadezhdin).[] On the other hand, the khvostism of revolutionaries was revealed in preaching that \u201cthe economic struggle is the best means of political agitation.\u201d What was the attitude of the revolutionary Social-Democrats? They attacked both these trends. They condemned flash in-the-pan methods and the cries about storming, for it was or should have been obvious to all that open mass action was a matter of the days to come. They condemned khvostism and bluntly issued the slogan even of a popular armed insurrection, not in the sense of a direct appeal (Mr. Struve would not discover any appeals to \u201criots\u201d in our utterances of that period), but in the sense of a necessary deduction, in the sense of \u201cpropaganda\u201d (about which Mr. Struve has bethought himself only now\u2014our honourable Mr. Struve is always several years behind the times), in the sense of preparing those very \u201csocial-psychological conditions\u201d about which the representatives of the bewildered, huckstering bourgeoisie are now holding forth \u201csadly and inappropriately.\u201d At that time propaganda and agitation, agitation and propaganda, were really pushed to the fore by the objective state of affairs. At that time the work of publishing an all-Russian political newspaper, the weekly issuance of which was regarded as an ideal, could be proposed (and was proposed in What Is To Be Done?) as the touchstone of the work of preparing for an insurrection. At that time the slogans advocating mass agitation instead of direct armed action, preparation of the social-psychological conditions for insurrection instead of flash-in-the-pan methods, were the only correct slogans for the revolutionary Social-Democratic movement. At the present time the slogans have been superseded by events, the movement has left them behind, they have become tatters, rags fit only to cloth the hypocrisy of the Osvobozhdeniye and of the new Iskra tailism!\n\nOr perhaps I am mistaken? Perhaps the revolution has not yet begun? Perhaps the time for open political action of classes has not yet arrived? Perhaps there is still no civil war, and the criticism of weapons should not as yet be the necessary and obligatory successor, heir, trustee and wielder of the weapon of criticism?\n\nLook around, poke your head out of your study and look into the street for an answer. Has not the government itself started civil war by shooting down hosts of peaceful and unarmed citizens everywhere? Are not the armed Black Hundreds acting as \u201carguments\u201d of the autocracy? Has not the bourgeoisie\u2014even the bourgeoisie\u2014recognised the need for a citizens\u2019 militia? Does not Mr. Struve himself, the ideally moderate and punctilious Mr. Struve, say (alas, he says so only to evade the issue!) that \u201cthe open nature of revolutionary action\u201d (that\u2019s the sort of fellows we are today!) \u201cis now one of the most important conditions for exerting an educational influence upon the masses of the people\u201d?\n\nThose who have eyes to see can have no doubt as to how the question of armed insurrection must be presented by the partisans of revolution at the present time. Just take a look at the three ways in which this question has been presented in the organs of the free press which are at all capable of influencing the masses.\n\nPresentation one. The resolution of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.[] It is publicly acknowledged and declared that the general democratic revolutionary movement has already brought about the necessity of an armed insurrection. The organisation of the proletariat for an insurrection has been placed on the order of the day as one of the essential, principal and indispensable tasks of the Party. Instructions are issued to adopt the most energetic measures to arm the proletariat and to ensure the possibility of directly leading the insurrection.\n\nThe second presentation. An article in the Osvobozhdeniye, containing a statement of principles, by the \u201cleader of the Russian constitutionalists\u201d (as Mr. Struve was recently described by such an influential organ of the European bourgeoisie as the Frankfurter Zeitung[]), or the leader of the Russian progressive bourgeoisie. He does not share the opinion that an insurrection is inevitable. Secret activity and riots are the specific methods of irrational revolutionism. Republicanism is a method of stunning. The question of armed insurrection is really a mere technical question, whereas \u201cthe fundamental and most necessary task\u201d is to carry on mass propaganda and to prepare the social-psychological conditions.\n\nThe third presentation. The resolution of the new Iskra-ist Conference. Our task is to prepare an insurrection. A planned insurrection is out of the question. Favourable conditions for an insurrection are created by the disorganisation of the government, by our agitation, and by our organisation. Only then \u201ccan technical military preparations acquire more or less serious significance.\u201d\n\nAnd is that all? Yes, that is all. The new Iskra-ist leaders of the proletariat still do not know whether insurrection has become a necessity. It is still not clear to them whether the task of organising the proletariat for direct battle has become an urgent one. It is not necessary to urge the adoption of the most energetic measures; it is far more important (in , and not in ) to explain in general outlines under what conditions these measures \u201cmay\u201d acquire \u201cmore or less serious\u201d significance....\n\nDo you see now, comrades of the new Iskra, where your turn to Martynovism has led you? Do you realise that your political philosophy has proved to be a rehash of the Osvobozhdeniye philosophy?\u2014that (against your will and with out your being aware of it) you are following at the tail of the monarchist bourgeoisie? Is it clear to you now that, while repeating what you have learned by rote and attaining perfection in sophistry, you have lost sight of the fact that\u2014in the memorable words of Peter Struve\u2019s memorable article\u2014\u201cthe open nature of revolutionary action is now one of the most important conditions for exerting an educational influence upon the masses of the people\u201d?\n.\nWhat Does Being A Party of Extreme Opposition In Time of Revolution Mean?\nLet us return to the resolution on a provisional government. We have shown that the tactics of the new-Iskraists do not push the revolution forward\u2014which they may have wanted to make possible by their resolution\u2014but back. We have shown that it is precisely these tactics that tie the hands of Social-Democracy in the struggle against the inconsistent bourgeoisie and do not safeguard it against being dissolved in bourgeois democracy. Naturally, the false premises of the resolution lead to the false conclusion that: \u201cTherefore, Social-Democracy must not set itself the aim of seizing or sharing power in the provisional government, but must remain the party of extreme revolutionary opposition.\u201d Consider the first half of this conclusion, which is part of a statement of aims. Do the new-Iskraists declare the aim of Social-Democratic activity to be a decisive victory of the revolution over tsarism? They do. They are unable correctly to formulate the requisites for a decisive victory and stray into the Osvobozhdeniye formulation, but they do set themselves the aforementioned aim. Further: do they connect a provisional government with insurrection? Yes, they do so plainly, by stating that a provisional government \u201cwill emerge from a victorious popular insurrection.\u201d Finally, do they set themselves the aim of leading the insurrection? Yes, they do. Like Mr. Struve, they do not admit that an insurrection is an urgent necessity, but at the same time, unlike Mr. Struve, they say that \u201cSocial-Democracy strives to subject it\u201d (the insurrection) \u201cto its influence and leadership and to use it in the interests of the working class.\u201d\n\nHow nicely this hangs together, does it not? We set ourselves the aim of subjecting the insurrection of both the proletarian and non-proletarian masses to our influence and our leadership, and of using it in our interests. Hence, we set ourselves the aim of leading, in the insurrection, both the proletariat and the revolutionary bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie (\u201cthe non-proletarian groups\u201d), i.e., of \u201csharing\u201d the leadership of the insurrection between the Social-Democracy and the revolutionary bourgeoisie. We set ourselves the aim of securing victory for the insurrection, which is to lead to the establishment of a provisional government (\u201cwhich will emerge from a victorious popular insurrection\u201d). Therefore. . . therefore we must not set ourselves the aim of seizing power or of sharing it in a provisional revolutionary government!!\n\nOur friends cannot dovetail their arguments. They vacillate between the standpoint of Mr. Struve, who is evading the issue of an insurrection, and the standpoint of revolutionary Social-Democracy, which calls upon us to undertake this urgent task. They vacillate between anarchism, which on principle condemns all participation in a provisional revolutionary government as treachery to the proletariat, and Marxism, which demands such participation on condition that the Social-Democratic Party exercises the leading influence in the insurrection.[] They have no independent position whatever: neither that of Mr. Struve, who wants to come to terms with tsarism and is therefore compelled to resort to evasions and subterfuges on the question of insurrection, nor that of the anarchists, who condemn all action \u201cfrom above\u201d and all participation in a bourgeois revolution. The new-Iskraists confuse a deal with tsarism with a victory over tsarism. They want to take part in a bourgeois revolution. They have gone somewhat beyond Martynov\u2019s Two Dictatorships. They even consent to lead the insurrection of the people\u2014in order to renounce that leadership immediately after victory is won (or, perhaps, immediately before the victory?), i.e., in order not to avail themselves of the fruits of victory but to turn all these fruits over entirely to the bourgeoisie. This is what they call \u201cusing the insurrection in the interests of the working class....\u201d\n\nThere is no need to dwell on this muddle any longer. It will be more useful to examine how this muddle originated in the formulation which reads: \u201cto remain the party of extreme revolutionary opposition.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the familiar propositions of international revolutionary Social-Democracy. It is a perfectly correct proposition. It has become a commonplace for all opponents of revisionism or opportunism in parliamentary countries. It has become generally accepted as the legitimate and necessary rebuff to \u201cparliamentary cretinism,\u201d Millerandism, Bernsteinism,[] and the Italian reformism of the Turati brand. Our good new-Iskraists have learned this excellent proposition by heart and are zealously applying it . . . quite inappropriately. Categories of the parliamentary struggle are introduced into resolutions written for conditions in which no parliament exists. The concept \u201copposition,\u201d which has become the reflection and the expression of a political situation in which no one seriously speaks of an insurrection, is senselessly applied to a situation in which insurrection has begun and in which all the supporters of the revolution are thinking and talking about leadership in it. The desire to \u201cstick to\u201d old methods, i.e., action only \u201cfrom below,\u201d is expressed with pomp and clamour precisely at a time when the revolution has confronted us with the necessity, in the event of the insurrection being victorious, of acting from above.\n\nNo, our new-Iskraists are decidedly out of luck! Even when they formulate a correct Social-Democratic proposition they don\u2019t know how to apply it correctly. They failed to take into consideration that in a period in which a revolution has begun, when there is no parliament, when there is civil war, when insurrectionary outbreaks occur, the concepts and terms of parliamentary struggle are changed and transformed into their opposites. They failed to take into consideration the fact that, under the circumstances referred to amendments are moved by means of street demonstrations, interpolations are introduced by means of offensive action by armed citizens, opposition to the government is effected by forcibly overthrowing the government.\n\nLike the well-known hero of our folklore, who repeated good advice just when it was inappropriate, our admirers of Martynov repeat the lessons of peaceful parliamentarism just at a time when, as they themselves state, actual hostilities have commenced. There is nothing more ridiculous than this pompous emphasis of the slogan \u201cextreme opposition\u201d in a resolution which begins by referring to a \u201cdecisive victory of the revolution\u201d and to a \u201cpopular insurrection\u201d! Try to visualise, gentlemen, what it means to be the \u201cextreme opposition\u201d in a period of insurrection. Does it mean exposing the government or deposing it? Does it mean voting against the government or defeating its armed forces in open battle? Does it mean refusing the government replenishments for its exchequer or the revolutionary seizure of this exchequer in order to use it for the requirements of the uprising, to arm the workers and peasants and to convoke a constituent assembly? Are you not beginning to understand, gentlemen, that the term \u201cextreme opposition\u201d expresses only negative actions\u2014to expose, to vote against, to refuse? Why is this so? Because this term applies only to the parliamentary struggle and, moreover, to a period when no one makes \u201cdecisive victory\u201d the immediate object of the struggle. Are you not beginning to understand that things undergo a cardinal change in this respect from the moment the politically oppressed people launch a determined attack along the whole front in desperate struggle for victory?\n\nThe workers ask us: Is it necessary energetically to take up the urgent business of insurrection? What is to be done to make the incipient insurrection victorious? What use should be made of the victory? What program can and should then be applied? The new Iskra-ists, who are making Marxism more profound, answer: We must remain the party of extreme revolutionary opposition. . . . Well, were we not right in calling these knights past masters in philistinism?\n\n.\n\u201cRevolutionary Communes\u201d and the Revolutionary-Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Peasantry\nThe Conference of the new-Iskraists did not keep to the anarchist position into which the new Iskra had talked itself (only \u201cfrom below,\u201d not \u201cfrom below and from above\u201d). The absurdity of admitting the possibility of an insurrection and not admitting the possibility of victory and participation in a provisional revolutionary government was too glaring. The resolution therefore introduced certain reservations and restrictions into the solution of the question proposed by Martynov and Martov. Let us consider these reservations as stated in the following section of the resolution:\n\n\u201cThese tactics\u201d (\u201cto remain the party of extreme revolutionary opposition\u201d) \u201cdo not, of course, in any way exclude the expediency of a partial and episodic seizure of power and the establishment of revolutionary communes in one or another city, in one or another district, exclusively for the purpose of helping to spread the insurrection and of disrupting the government.\u201d\n\nThat being the case, it means that in principle they admit the possibility of action not only from below, but also from above. It means that the proposition laid down in L. Martov\u2019s well-known article in the Iskra (No. ) is discarded and that the tactics of Vperyod, i.e., not only \u201cfrom below,\u201d but also \u201cfrom above,\u201d are acknowledged as correct.\n\nFurther, the seizure of power (even if partial, episodic, etc.) obviously presupposes the participation not only of Social-Democrats and not only of the proletariat. This follows from the fact that it is not only the proletariat that is interested and takes an active part in a democratic revolution. This follows from the fact that the insurrection is a \u201cpopular\u201d one, as is stated in the beginning of the resolution we are discussing, that \u201cnon-proletarian groups\u201d (the words used in the Conference resolution on the uprising), i.e., the bourgeoisie, also take part in it. Hence, the principle that any participation of Socialists in a provisional revolutionary government jointly with the petty bourgeoisie is treachery to the working class was thrown overboard by the Conference, which is what the Vperyod [Lenin\u2019s articles \u201cSocial-Democracy and the Provisional Revolutionary Government\u201d, and \u201cThe Revolutionary-Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Peasantry\u201d ] sought to achieve. \u201cTreachery\u201d does not cease to be treachery because the action which constitutes it is partial, episodic, local, etc. Hence, the parallel drawn between the participation in a provisional revolutionary government and vulgar Jaur\u00e8sism was thrown overboard by the Conference, which is what the Vperyod sought to achieve.[] A government does not cease to be a government because its power does not extend to many cities but is confined to a single city, does not extend to many districts but is confined to a single district; nor because of the name that is given to it. Thus, the formulation of the principles of this question which the new Iskra tried to give was discarded by the Conference.\n\nLet us see whether the restrictions imposed by the Conference on the formation of revolutionary governments and participation in them, which is now admitted in principle, are reasonable. What difference there is between the concept \u201cepisodic\u201d and the concept \u201cprovisional\u201d[] we do not know. We are afraid that this \u201cnew\u201d and foreign word is merely a screen for lack of clear thinking. It seems \u201cmore profound,\u201d but actually it is only more obscure and confused. What is the difference between the \u201cexpediency\u201d of a partial \u201cseizure of power\u201d in a city or district, and participation in a provisional revolutionary government of the entire state? Do not \u201ccities\u201d include a city like St. Petersburg, where the events of January  took place? Do not districts include the Caucasus, which is bigger than many a state? Will not the problems (which at one time vexed the new Iskra) of what to do with the prisons, the police, public funds, etc., confront us the moment we \u201cseize power\u201d in a single city, let alone in a district? No one will deny, of course, that if we lack sufficient forces, if the insurrection is not wholly successful, or if the victory is indecisive, it is possible that provisional revolutionary governments will be set up in separate localities, in individual cities and the like. But what is the point of such an assumption, gentlemen? Do not you yourselves speak in the beginning of the resolution about a \u201cdecisive victory of the revolution,\u201d about a \u201cvictorious popular insurrection\u201d?? Since when have the Social-Democrats taken over the job of the anarchists: to divide the attention and the aims of the proletariat, to direct its attention to the \u201cpartial\u201d instead of the general, the single, the integral and complete? While presupposing the \u201cseizure of power\u201d in a city, you yourselves speak of \u201cspreading the insurrection\u201d\u2014to another city, may we venture to think? to all cities, may we dare to hope? Your conclusions, gentlemen, are as unsound and haphazard, as contradictory and confused as your premises. The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. gave an exhaustive and clear answer to the question of a provisional revolutionary government in general. And this answer covers all cases of local provisional governments as well. The answer given by the Conference however, by artificially and arbitrarily singling out a part of the question, merely evades (but unsuccessfully) the issue as a whole, and creates confusion.\n\nWhat does the term \u201crevolutionary communes\u201d mean? Does it differ from the term \u201cprovisional revolutionary government,\u201d and, if so, in what respect? The Conference gentlemen themselves do not know. Confusion of revolutionary thought leads them, as very often happens, to revolutionary phrase-mongering. Yes, the use of the words \u201crevolutionary commune\u201d in a resolution passed by representatives of Social-Democracy is revolutionary phrase-mongering and nothing else. Marx more than once condemned such phrase-mongering, when \u201cfascinating\u201d terms of the bygone past were used to hide the tasks of the future. In such cases a fascinating term that has played its part in history becomes futile and pernicious trumpery, a child\u2019s rattle. We must give the workers and the whole people a clear and unambiguous explanation as to why we want a provisional revolutionary government to be set up, and exactly what changes we shall accomplish, if we exercise decisive influence on the government, on the very morrow of the victory of the popular insurrection which has already commenced. These are the questions that confront political leaders.\n\nThe Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. gave perfectly clear answers to these questions and drew up a complete program of these changes\u2014the minimum program of our Party. The word \u201ccommune,\u201d however, is not an answer at all; it only serves to confuse people by the distant echo of a sonorous phrase, or empty rhetoric. The more we cherish the memory of the Paris Commune of , for instance, the less permissible is it to refer to it offhand, without analysing its mistakes and the special conditions attending it. To do so would be to follow the absurd example of the Blanquists\u2014whom Engels ridiculed\u2014who (in , in their \u201cManifesto\u201d) paid homage to every act of the Commune.[] What reply will a \u201cConference\u201d give to a worker who asks him about this \u201crevolutionary commune\u201d that is mentioned in the resolution? He will only be able to tell him that this is the name, known in history, of a workers\u2019 government that was unable to, and could not at that time, distinguish between the elements of a democratic revolution and those of a socialist revolution, that confused the tasks of fighting for a republic with the tasks of fighting for Socialism, that was unable to carry out the task of launching an energetic military offensive against Versailles, that made a mistake in not seizing the Bank of France, etc. In short, whether in your answer you refer to the Paris Commune or to some other commune, your answer will be: it was a government such as ours should not be. A fine answer, indeed! Does it not testify to pedantic moralising and impotence on the part of a revolutionary who says nothing about the practical program of the Party and in appropriately begins to give lessons in history in a resolution? Does this not reveal the very mistake which they unsuccessfully accuse us of having committed, i.e., of confusing a democratic revolution with a socialist revolution, between which none of the \u201ccommunes\u201d was able to distinguish?\n\nExtending the insurrection and the disorganising the government are presented as the \u201cexclusive\u201d aim of the provisional government. (so in appropriately termed a \u201ccommune\u201d). Taken in its literal sense, the word \u201cexclusively\u201d eliminates all other aims; it is an echo of the absurd theory of \u201conly from below.\u201d Such elimination of other aims is another instance of short-sightedness and lack of reflection. A \u201crevolutionary commune,\u201d i.e., a revolutionary government, even if only in a single city, will inevitably have to administer (even if provisionally, \u201cpartly, episodically\u201d) all the affairs of state, and it is the height of folly to hide one\u2019s head under one\u2019s wing and refuse to see this. This government will have to enact an eight-hour working day, establish workers\u2019 inspection of factories, institute free universal education, introduce the election of judges, set up peasant committees, etc.; in a word, it will certainly have to carry out a number of reforms. To designate these reforms as \u201chelping to spread the insurrection\u201d would be playing with words and deliberately causing greater confusion in a matter which requires absolute clarity.\n\n*     *\n*\nThe concluding part of the new Iskra-ists\u2019 resolution does not provide any new material for a criticism of the trends of principles of \u201cEconomism\u201d which has revived in our Party, but it illustrates from a somewhat different angle, what has been said above.\n\nHere is that part:\n\n\u201cOnly in one event should Social-Democracy, on its own initiative, direct its efforts towards seizing power and holding it as long as possible\u2014namely, in the event of the revolution spreading to the advanced countries of Western Europe, where conditions for the achievement of Socialism have already reached a certain\u201d(?) \u201cdegree of maturity. In that event the limited historical scope of the Russian revolution can be considerably widened and the possibility of entering the path of socialist reforms will arise.\n\n\u201cBy framing its tactics in accordance with the view that, during the whole period of the revolution, the Social-Democratic Party will retain the position of extreme revolutionary opposition to all the governments that may succeed one another in the course of the revolution, Social-Democracy will best be able to prepare itself to utilise governmental power if it falls\u201d (??) \u201cinto its hands.\u201d\n\nThe basic idea here is the one that the Vperyod has repeatedly formulated, stating that we must not be afraid (as is Martynov) of a complete victory for Social-Democracy in a democratic revolution, i.e., of a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, for such a victory will enable us to rouse Europe, and the socialist proletariat of Europe, after throwing off the yoke of the bourgeoisie, will in its turn help us to accomplish the socialist revolution. But see how this idea is worsened in the new Iskra-ists\u2019 rendering of it. We shall not dwell on details\u2014on the absurd assumption that power could \u201cfall\u201d into the hands of a class-conscious party which considers seizure of power harmful tactics; on the fact that in Europe the conditions for Socialism have reached not a certain degree of maturity, but are already mature; on the fact that our Party program does not speak of socialist changes at all, but only of a socialist revolution. Let us take the principal and basic difference between the idea presented by the Vperyod and that presented in the resolution. The Vperyod set the revolutionary proletariat of Russia an active aim: to win the battle for democracy and to use this victory for carrying the revolution into Europe. The resolution fails to grasp this connection between our \u201cdecisive victory\u201d (not in the new Iskra sense) and the revolution in Europe, and therefore it speaks not about the tasks of the proletariat, not about the prospects of its victory, but about one of the possibilities in general: \u201cin the event of the revolution spreading....\u201d The Vperyod pointedly and definitely indicated\u2014and this was incorporated in the resolution of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party\u2014how \u201cgovernmental power\u201d can and must \u201cbe utilised\u201d in the interests of the proletariat, bearing in mind what can be achieved immediately, at the given stage of social development, and what must first be achieved as a democratic prerequisite of the struggle for Socialism. Here, also, the resolution hopelessly drags at the tail when it states: \u201cwill be able to prepare itself to utilise,\u201d but fails to say how it will be able, how it will prepare itself, and to utilise for what? We have no doubt, for instance, that the new-Iskraists may be \u201cable to prepare themselves to utilise\u201d the leading position in the Party; but the point is that the way they have utilised, their preparation up till now, do not hold out much hope of possibility being transformed into reality. . . .\n\nThe Vperyod quite definitely stated wherein lies the real \u201cpossibility of holding power\u201d\u2014namely, in the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, in their joint mass strength, which is capable of outweighing all the forces of counterrevolution, in the inevitable concurrence of their interests in democratic changes. Here, too, the resolution of the Conference gives us nothing positive, it merely evades the question. Surely, the possibility of holding power in Russia must be determined by the composition of the social forces in Russia itself, by the circumstances of the democratic revolution which is now taking place in our country. A victory of the proletariat in Europe (it is still somewhat of a far cry between carrying the revolution into Europe and the victory of the proletariat) will give rise to a desperate counter-revolutionary struggle on the part of the Russian bourgeoisie\u2014yet the resolution of the new-Iskraists does not say a word about this counter-revolutionary force, the importance of which has been appraised in the resolution of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. If in our fight for a republic and democracy we could not rely upon the peasantry as well as on the proletariat, the prospect of our \u201cholding power\u201d would be hopeless. But if it is not hopeless, if a \u201cdecisive victory of the revolution over tsarism\u201d opens up such a possibility, then we must point to it, we must actively call for its transformation into reality and issue practical slogans not only for the contingency of the revolution being carried into Europe, but also for the purpose of carrying it there. The reference made by the khvostist Social-Democrats to the \u201climited historical scope of the Russian revolution\u201d merely serves to cover up their limited understanding of the aims of this democratic revolution and of the leading role of the proletariat in this revolution!\n\nOne of the objections raised to the slogan of \u201cthe revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry\u201d is that dictatorship presupposes a \u201csingle will\u201d (Iskra, No. ), and that there can be no single will of the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie. This objection is unsound, for it is based on an abstract, \u201cmetaphysical\u201d interpretation of the term \u201csingle will.\u201d There can be a single will in one respect and not a single will in another. The absence of unity on questions of Socialism and in the struggle for Socialism does not preclude singleness of will on questions of democracy and in the struggle for a republic. To forget this would be tantamount to forgetting the logical and historical difference between a democratic and a socialist revolution. To forget this would be tantamount to forgetting the character of the democratic revolution as a revolution of the whole people: if it is \u201cof the whole people\u201d it means that there is \u201csingleness of will\u201d precisely in so far as this revolution satisfies the common needs and requirements of the whole people. Beyond the bounds of democracy there can be no question of the proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie having a single will. Class struggle between them is inevitable; but it is in a democratic republic that this struggle will be the most thoroughgoing and widespread struggle of the people for Socialism. Like everything else in the world, the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry has a past and a future. Its past is autocracy, serfdom, monarchy and privilege. In the struggle against this past, in the struggle against counterrevolution, a \u201csingle will\u201d of the proletariat and the peasantry is possible, for here there is unity of interests.\n\nIts future is the struggle against private property the struggle of the wage worker against the employer the struggle for Socialism. Here singleness of will is impossible.[] Here our path lies not from autocracy to a republic but from a petty-bourgeois democratic republic to Socialism.\n\nOf course, in actual historical circumstances, the elements of the past become interwoven with those of the future, the two paths cross. Wage labour, with its struggle against private property, exists under the autocracy as well; it is generated even under serfdom. But this does not in the least prevent us from drawing a logical and historical dividing line between the major stages of development. We all draw a distinction between bourgeois revolution and socialist revolution, we all absolutely insist on the necessity of drawing a most strict line between them; but can it be denied that individual, particular elements of the two revolutions become interwoven in history? Have there not been a number of socialist movements and attempts at establishing Socialism in the period of democratic revolutions in Europe? And will not the future socialist revolution in Europe still have to do a very great deal that has been left undone in the field of democracy?\n\nA Social-Democrat must never for a moment forget that the proletariat will inevitably have to wage the class struggle for Socialism even against the most democratic and republican bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. This is beyond doubt. Hence the absolute necessity of a separate, independent, strictly class party of Social-Democracy. Hence the temporary nature of our tactics of \u201cstriking jointly\u201d with the bourgeoisie and the duty of keeping a strict watch \u201cover our ally, as over an enemy,\u201d etc. All this is also beyond the slightest doubt. But it would be ridiculous and reactionary to deduce from this that we must forget, ignore or neglect these tasks which, although transient and temporary, are vital at the present time. The fight against the autocracy is a temporary and transient task of the Socialists, but to ignore or neglect this task in any way would be tantamount to betraying Socialism and rendering a service to reaction. The revolutionary-Democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry is unquestionably only a transient, temporary aim of the Socialists, but to ignore this aim in the period of a democratic revolution would be downright reactionary.\n\nConcrete political aims must be set in concrete circumstances. All things are relative, all things flow and all things change. The program of the German Social-Democratic Party does not contain the demand for a republic. The situation in Germany is such that this question can in practice hardly be separated from the question of Socialism (although even as regards Germany, Engels, in his comments on the draft of the Erfurt Program in , warned against belittling the importance of a republic and of the struggle for a republic!).[] In the Russian Social-Democratic Party the question of eliminating the demand for a republic from its program and agitation has never even arisen, for in our country there can be no talk of an indissoluble connection between the question of a republic and the question of Socialism. It was quite natural for a German Social-Democrat of  not to put the special question of a republic in the forefront, and this evokes neither surprise nor condemnation. But a German Social-Democrat who in  would have left the question of a republic in the shade would have been a downright traitor to the revolution. There is no such thing as abstract truth. Truth is always concrete.\n\nThe time will come when the struggle against the Russian autocracy will end and the period of democratic revolution will be over in Russia; then it will be ridiculous to talk about \u201csingleness of will\u201d of the proletariat and the peasantry, about a democratic dictatorship, etc. When that time comes we shall attend directly to the question of the socialist dictatorship of the proletariat and deal with it at greater length. But at present the party of the advanced class cannot but strive most energetically for a decisive victory of the democratic revolution over tsarism. And a decisive victory means nothing else than the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry.\nNote[]\n\n) We would remind the reader that in the polemics between the Iskra and the Vperyod, the former referred among other things to Engels\u2019 letter to Turati, in which Engels warned the (future) leader of the Italian reformists not to confuse the democratic with the socialist revolution.[] The impending revolution in Italy\u2014wrote Engels about the political situation in Italy in \u2014will be a petty-bourgeois, democratic and not a socialist revolution. The Iskra reproached the Vperyod with having departed from the principle laid down by Engels. This reproach was unjustified, because the Vperyod (No. )[] fully acknowledged, on the whole, the correctness of Marx\u2019s theory of the difference between the three main forces in the revolutions of the nineteenth century. According to this theory, the following forces take a stand against the old order, against the autocracy, feudalism, serfdom: ) the liberal big bourgeoisie,\n) the radical petty bourgeoisie,\n) the proletariat. The first fights for nothing more than a constitutional monarchy; the second, for a democratic republic; the third, for a socialist revolution. To confuse the petty-bourgeois struggle for a complete democratic revolution with the proletarian struggle for a socialist revolution spells political bankruptcy for a Socialist. Marx\u2019s warning to this effect is quite justified. But it is precisely for this very reason that the slogan \u201crevolutionary communes\u201d is erroneous, because the very mistake committed by the communes that have existed in history is that they confused the democratic revolution with the socialist revolution. On the other hand, our slogan\u2014a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry\u2014fully safeguards us against this mistake. While recognising the uncontestably bourgeois nature of the revolution, which is incapable of directly overstepping the bounds a mere democratic revolution, our slogan pushes forward this particular revolution and strives to mould it into forms most advantageous to the proletariat; consequently, it strives to make the very most of the democratic revolution in order to attain the greatest success in the further struggle of the proletariat for Socialism.\n\n.\nA Cursory Comparison Between Several of the Resolutions of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and Those of the \u201cConference\u201d\nThe question of the provisional revolutionary government is the pivot of the tactical questions of the Social-Democratic movement at the present time. It is neither possible nor necessary to dwell in as great detail on the other resolutions of the Conference. We shall confine ourselves merely to indicating briefly a few points which confirm the difference in principle, analysed above, between the tactical trends of the resolutions of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and those of the Conference resolutions.\n\nTake the question of the attitude towards the tactics of the government on the eve of the revolution. Once again you will find a comprehensive answer to this question in one of the resolutions of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. This resolution takes into consideration all the multifarious conditions and tasks of the particular moment: the exposure of the hypocrisy of the government\u2019s concessions, the utilisation of \u201ctravesties of popular representation,\u201d the achievement by revolutionary means of the urgent demands of the working class (the principal one being the eight-hour working day), and, finally, resistance to the Black Hundreds. In the Conference resolutions this question is scattered over several sections: \u201cresistance to the dark forces of reaction\u201d is mentioned only in the preamble of the resolution on the attitude to other parties. Participation in elections to representative bodies is considered separately from the question of \u201ccompromises\u201d between tsarism and the bourgeoisie. Instead of calling for the achievement of an eight-hour working day by revolutionary means, a special resolution, with the high-sounding title \u201cOn the Economic Struggle,\u201d merely repeats (after high-flown and very stupid phrases about \u201cthe central place occupied by the labour question in the public life of Russia\u201d) the old slogan of agitation for \u201cthe legislative institution of an eight-hour working day.\u201d The inadequacy and the belatedness of this slogan at the present time are too obvious to require proof.\n\nThe question of open political action. The Third Congress takes into consideration the impending radical change in our activity. Secret activity and the development of the secret apparatus must on no account be abandoned: this would be playing into the hands of the police and be of the utmost advantage to the government. But at the same time we cannot start too soon thinking about open action as well. Expedient forms of such action and, consequently, special apparatus\u2014less secret\u2014must be prepared immediately for this purpose. The legal and semi-legal societies must be made use of with a view to transforming them, as far as possible, into bases of the future open Social-Democratic Labour Party in Russia.\n\nHere too the Conference divides up the question, and fails to issue any integral slogans. There bobs up as a separate point the ridiculous instruction to the Organisation Commission to see to the \u201cplacing\u201d of its legally functioning publicists. There is the wholly absurd decision \u201cto subordinate to its influence the democratic newspapers that set themselves the aim of rendering assistance to the working-class movement.\u201d This is the professed aim of all our legal liberal newspapers, nearly all of which are of the Osvobozhdeniye trend. Why should not the editors of the Iskra make a start themselves in carrying out their advice and give us an example of how to subject the Osvobozhdeniye to Social-Democratic influence? ... Instead of the slogan of utilising the legally existing unions for the purpose of establishing bases for the Party, we are given, first, particular advice about the \u201ctrade\u201d unions only (that all Party members must join them) and, secondly, advice to guide \u201cthe revolutionary organisations of the workers\u201d = \u201corganisations not officially constituted\u201d = \u201crevolutionary workers\u2019 clubs.\u201d How these \u201cclubs\u201d come to be classed as unofficially constituted organisations, what these \u201cclubs\u201d really are\u2014goodness only knows. Instead of definite and clear instructions from a supreme Party body, we have some jottings of ideas and the rough drafts of publicists. We get no complete picture of the beginning of the Party\u2019s transition to an entirely new basis in all its work.\n\nThe \u201cpeasant question\u201d was presented by the Party Congress and by the Conference in entirely different ways. The Congress drew up a resolution on the \u201cattitude to the peasant movement,\u201d the Conference on \u201cwork among the peasants.\u201d In the one case prime importance is attached to the task of guiding the widespread revolutionary-democratic movement in the general national interests of the fight against tsarism. In the other instance, the question is reduced to mere \u201cwork\u201d among a particular section of society. In the one case, a central practical slogan for our agitation is advanced, calling for the immediate organisation of revolutionary peasant committees in order to carry out all the democratic changes. In the other, a \u201cdemand for the organisation of committees\u201d is to be presented to a constituent assembly. Why must we wait for this constituent assembly? Will it really be constituent? Will it be stable without the preliminary and simultaneous establishment of revolutionary peasant committees? All these questions are ignored by the Conference. All its decisions reflect the general idea which we have traced\u2014namely, that in the bourgeois revolution we must do only our special work, without setting ourselves the aim of leading the entire democratic movement and of doing this independently. Just as the Economists constantly harped on the idea that the Social-Democrats should concern themselves with the economic struggle, leaving it to the liberals to take care of the political struggle, so the new-Iskraists keep harping in all their discussions on the idea that we should creep into a modest corner out of the way of the bourgeois revolution, leaving it to the bourgeoisie to do the active work of carrying out the revolution.\n\nFinally, we cannot but note also the resolution on the attitude toward other parties. The resolution of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. speaks of exposing all the limitations and inadequacies of the bourgeois movement for emancipation, without entertaining the na\u00efve idea of enumerating every possible instance of such limitation from congress to congress or of drawing a line of distinction between bad bourgeois and good bourgeois. The Conference, repeating the mistake made by Starover, persistently searched for such a line, developed the famous \u201clitmus paper\u201d theory. Starover started from a very good idea: to put the strictest possible terms to the bourgeoisie. Only he forgot that any attempt to separate in advance the bourgeois democrats who are worthy of approval, agreements, etc., from those who are unworthy leads to a \u201cformula\u201d which is immediately thrown overboard by the development of events and which introduces confusion into the proletarian class consciousness. The emphasis is shifted from real unity in the struggle to declarations, promises, slogans. Starover was of the opinion that \u201cuniversal and equal suffrage, direct elections and secret ballot\u201d was such a radical slogan. But before two years elapsed the \u201clitmus paper\u201d proved its worthlessness, the slogan of universal suffrage was taken over by the Osvobozbdentsi, who not only came no closer to Social-Democracy as a result of this, but, on the contrary, tried by means of this very slogan to mislead the workers and divert them from Socialism.\n\nNow the new-Iskraists are setting \u201cterms\u201d that are even \u201cstricter,\u201d they are \u201cdemanding\u201d from the enemies of tsarism \u201cenergetic and unequivocal\u201d (!?) \u201csupport of every determined action of the organised proletariat,\u201d etc., up to and including \u201cactive participation in the self-armament of the people.\u201d The line has been drawn much further\u2014but nonetheless this line is again already obsolete, it revealed its worthlessness at once. Why, for instance, is there no slogan of a republic? How is it that the Social-Democrats\u2014in the interest of \u201crelentless revolutionary war against all the foundations of the system of social estates and the monarchy\u201d\u2014\u201cdemand\u201d from the bourgeois democrats anything you like except a fight for a republic?\n\nThat this question is not mere captiousness, that the mistake of the new-Iskraists is of most vital political significance is proved by the \u201cRussian Liberation League\u201d (see Proletary, No. ).[] These \u201cenemies of tsarism\u201d will fully meet all the \u201crequirements\u201d of the new Iskra supporters. And yet we have shown that the spirit of Osvobozhdeniye reigns in the program (or lack of program) of this \u201cRussian Liberation League\u201d and that the Osvobozhdentsi can easily take it in tow. The Conference, however, declares in the concluding section of the resolution that \u201cSocial-Democracy will continue to oppose the hypocritical friends of the people, all those political parties which, though they display a liberal and democratic banner, refuse to render genuine support to the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat.\u201d The \u201cRussian Liberation League\u201d not only does not refuse this support but offers it most insistently. Is that a guarantee that the leaders of this League are not \u201chypocritical friends of the people,\u201d even though they are Osvobozhdentsi?\n\nYou see: by inventing \u201cterms\u201d in advance and presenting \u201cdemands\u201d which are ludicrous by reason of their grim impotence, the new-Iskraists immediately put themselves in a ridiculous position. Their terms and demands immediately prove inadequate when it comes to gauging living realities. Their chase after formulae is hopeless, for no formula can embrace all the various manifestations of hypocrisy, inconsistency and limitations of the bourgeois democrats. It is not a matter of \u201clitmus paper,\u201d of forms, or written and printed demands, nor is it a matter of drawing, in advance, a line of distinction between hypocritical and sincere \u201cfriends of the people\u201d; it is a matter of real unity in the struggle, of unabating criticism by Social-Democrats of every \u201cuncertain\u201d step taken by bourgeois democracy. What is needed for a \u201cgenuine consolidation of all the social forces interested in democratic change\u201d is not the \u201cpoints\u201d over which the Conference laboured so assiduously and so vainly, but the ability to put forward genuinely revolutionary slogans. For this slogans are needed that will raise the revolutionary and republican bourgeoisie to the level of the proletariat and not reduce the aims of the proletariat to the level of the monarchist bourgeoisie. For this the most energetic participation in the insurrection and not sophist evasions of the urgent task of armed insurrection is needed.\n.\nWill the Sweep of the Democratic Revolution be Diminished if the Bourgeoisie Recoils from it?\nThe foregoing lines were already written when we received a copy of the resolutions adopted by the Caucasian Conference of the new Iskra supporters, published by the Iskra. Better material than this pour la bonne bouche (for dessert) we could not even have invented.\n\nThe editors of the Iskra quite justly remark: \u201cOn the fundamental question of tactics, the Caucasian Conference also arrived at a decision analogous\u201d (in truth!) \u201cto the one adopted by the All-Russian Conference\u201d (i.e., of the new Iskra-ists). \u201cThe question of the attitude of Social-Democracy towards a provisional revolutionary government has been settled by the Caucasian comrades in the spirit of most outspoken opposition to the new method advocated by the Vpeyod group and by the delegates of the so-called Congress who joined it.\u201d \u201cIt must be admitted that the formulation of the tactics of the proletarian party in a bourgeois revolution as given by the Conference is very apt.\u201d\n\nWhat is true is true. No one could have given a more \u201capt\u201d formulation of the fundamental error of the new Iskra-ists. We shall quote this formulation in full, indicating in parentheses first the blossoms and then the fruit presented at the end.\n\nHere is the resolution of the Caucasian Conference of new-Iskraists on a provisional revolutionary government:\n\n\u201cWhereas we consider it to be our task to take advantage of the revolutionary situation to render more profound\u201d (of course! They should have added: \u201c\u00e0 la Martynov!\u201d) \u201cthe Social-Democratic consciousness of the proletariat\u201d (only to render the consciousness more profound, and not to win a republic? What a \u201cprofound\u201d conception of revolution ) \u201cand in order to secure for the Party fullest freedom to criticise the nascent bourgeois-state system\u201d (it is not our business to secure a republic! Our business is only to secure freedom of criticism. Anarchist ideas give rise to anarchist language: \u201cbourgeois-state\u201d system!), \u201cthe Conference declares against the formation of a Social-Democratic provisional government and joining such a government\u201d (recall the resolution passed by the Bakunists ten months before the Spanish revolution and referred to by Engels: see the Proletary, No. ),[] \"and considers it to be the most expedient course to exercise pressure from without\" (from below and not from above) \u201cupon the bourgeois provisional government in order to secure a feasible measure\u201d (?!) \u201cof democratisation of the state system. The Conference believes that the formation of a provisional government by Social-Democrats, or their joining such a government, would lead, on the one hand, to the masses of the proletariat becoming disappointed in the Social-Democratic Party and abandoning it because the Social-Democrats, in spite of the fact that they had seized power, would not be able to satisfy the pressing needs of the working class, including the establishment of Socialism\u201d (a republic is not a pressing need! The authors, in their innocence, do not notice that they are speaking a purely anarchist language, as if they were repudiating participation in bourgeois revolutions!), \u201cand, on the other hand, would cause the bourgeois classes to recoil from the revolution and diminish its sweep.\u201d\n\nThat is the crux of the matter. That is where anarchist ideas become interwoven (as is constantly the case among the West-European Bernsteinians also) with the purest opportunism. Just think of it: not to join a provisional government because this will cause the bourgeoisie to recoil from the revolution and thus diminish the sweep of the revolution! Here, indeed, we have the new Iskra philosophy in its complete, pure and consistent form: the revolution is a bourgeois revolution, therefore we must bow down to bourgeois philistinism and make way for it. If we are guided, even in part, even for a moment, by the consideration that our participation may cause the bourgeoisie to recoil, we thereby simply yield leadership in the revolution entirely to the bourgeois classes. We thereby place the proletariat entirely under the tutelage of the bourgeoisie (while retaining complete \u201cfreedom of criticism\u201d!!), compelling the proletariat to be meek and mild so as not to cause the bourgeoisie to recoil. We emasculate the most vital needs of the proletariat, namely, its political needs\u2014which the Economists and their epigones have never properly understood\u2014so as not to cause the bourgeoisie to recoil. We completely abandon the field of revolutionary struggle for the achievement of democracy to the extent required by the proletariat for the field of bargaining with the bourgeoisie, betraying our principles, betraying the revolution to purchase the bourgeoisie\u2019s voluntary consent (\u201cthat it might not recoil\u201d).\n\nIn two brief lines, the Caucasian new-Iskraists managed to express the quintessence of the tactics of betrayal of the revolution and of converting the proletariat into a wretched appendage of the bourgeois classes. The tendency, which we traced above to the mistakes of the new Iskra-ists, now stands out before us as a clear and definite principle, viz., to drag at the tail of the monarchist bourgeoisie. Since the establishment of a republic would cause (and is already causing: Mr. Struve, for example) the bourgeoisie to recoil, therefore, down with the fight for a republic. Since every resolute and consistent democratic demand of the proletariat always and everywhere in the world causes the bourgeoisie to recoil, therefore, hide in your lairs, comrades and fellow workers, act only from without, do not dream of using the instruments and weapons of the \u201cbourgeois-state\u201d system in the interests of the revolution, and reserve for yourselves \u201cfreedom to criticize\u201d!\n\nThe fundamental fallacy of their very conception of the term \u201cbourgeois revolution\u201d has come to the surface. The Martynov or new Iskra \u201cconception\u201d of this term leads straight to a betrayal of the cause of the proletariat to the bourgeoisie.\n\nThose who have forgotten the old Economism, those who do not study it or remember it, will find it difficult to under stand the present echo of Economism. Recall the Bernsteinian Credo.[] From \u201cpurely proletarian\u201d views and programs, people arrived at the conclusion: we, the Social-Democrats, must concern ourselves with economics, with the real cause of labour, with freedom to criticise all political chicanery, with rendering Social-Democratic work really more profound. Politics are for the liberals. God save us from dropping into \u201crevolutionism\u201d: that will cause the bourgeoisie to recoil. Those who read the whole Credo over again or the Supplement to No.  of the Rabochaya Mysl (September )[] will be able to follow this entire line of reasoning.\n\nToday we have the same thing, only on a large scale, applied to an appraisal of the whole of the \u201cgreat\u201d Russian revolution\u2014alas, already vulgarised and reduced to a travesty in advance by the theoreticians of orthodox philistinism! We, the Social-Democrats, must concern ourselves with freedom of criticism, with rendering class consciousness more profound, with action from without. They, the bourgeois classes, must have freedom to act, a free field for revolutionary (read: liberal) leadership, freedom to put through \u201creforms\u201d from above.\n\nThese vulgarizers of Marxism have never pondered over what Marx said about the need of substituting the criticism of weapons for the weapon of criticism.[] Taking the name of Marx in vain, they, in actual fact, draw up resolutions on tactics wholly in the spirit of the Frankfurt bourgeois windbags, who freely criticised absolutism and rendered democratic consciousness more profound, but failed to understand that the time of revolution is the time of action, of action both from above and from below. Having converted Marxism into pedantry, they have made the ideology of the advanced, most determined and energetic revolutionary class the ideology of its most undeveloped strata, which shrink from the difficult revolutionary-democratic tasks and leave it to Messrs. the Struves to take care of these democratic tasks.\n\nIf the bourgeois classes recoil from the revolution because the Social-Democrats join the revolutionary government, they will thereby \u201cdiminish the sweep\u201d of the revolution.\n\nListen to this, Russian workers: The sweep of the revolution will be mightier if it is carried out by Messrs. the Struves, who are not frightened away by the Social-Democrats and who want, not victory over tsarism, but to come to terms with it. The sweep of the revolution will be mightier if, of the two possible outcomes which we have outlined above, the first eventuates, i.e., if the monarchist bourgeoisie comes to terms with the autocracy concerning a \u201cconstitution\u201d \u00e0 la Shipov!\n\nSocial-Democrats who write such disgraceful things in resolutions intended for the guidance of the whole Party, or who approve of such \u201capt\u201d resolutions, are so blinded by their pedantry, which has utterly eroded the living spirit out of Marxism, that they do not see how these resolutions convert all their other fine words into mere phrase-mongering. Take any of their articles in the Iskra, or take even the notorious pamphlet written by our celebrated Martynov\u2014you will read there about a popular insurrection, about carrying the revolution to completion, about striving to rely upon the common people in the fight against the inconsistent bourgeoisie. But then all these excellent things become miserable phrase-mongering immediately you accept or approve of the idea that \u201cthe sweep of the revolution\u201d will be \u201cdiminished\u201d as a consequence of the alienation of the bourgeoisie. One of two things, gentlemen: either we, together with the people, must strive to carry out the revolution and win a complete victory over tsarism in spite of the inconsistent, self-seeking and cowardly bourgeoisie, or we do not accept this \u201cin spite of,\u201d we fear lest the bourgeoisie \u201crecoil\u201d from the revolution, in which case we betray the proletariat and the people to the bourgeoisie\u2014to the inconsistent, self-seeking and cowardly bourgeoisie.\n\nDon\u2019t try to misinterpret what I have said. Don\u2019t start howling that you are being accused of deliberate treachery. No, you have always been crawling and have at last crawled into the mire as unconsciously as the Economists of old, drawn inexorably and irrevocably down the inclined plane of making Marxism \u201cmore profound\u201d to anti-revolutionary, soulless and lifeless \u201cphilosophising.\u201d\n\nHave you ever considered, gentlemen, what real social forces determine \u201cthe sweep of the revolution\u201d? Let us leave aside the forces of foreign politics, of international combinations, which have turned out very favourably for us at the present time, but which we all leave out of our discussion, and rightly so, inasmuch as we are concerned with the question of the internal forces of Russia. Look at these internal social forces. Aligned against the revolution are the autocracy, the imperial court, the police, the bureaucracy, the army and the handful of high nobility. The deeper the indignation of the people grows, the less reliable become the troops, and the more the bureaucracy wavers. Moreover, the bourgeoisie, on the whole, is now in favour of the revolution, is zealously making speeches about liberty, holding forth more and more frequently in the name of the people, and even in the name of the revolution.[] But we Marxists all know from theory and from daily and hourly observation of our liberals, Zemstvo people and Orvobozhdentsi, that the bourgeoisie is inconsistent, self-seeking and cowardly in its support of the revolution. The bourgeoisie, in the mass, will inevitably turn towards counterrevolution, towards the autocracy, against the revolution and against the people, immediately its narrow, selfish interests are met, immediately it \u201crecoils\u201d from consistent democracy (and it is already recoiling from it!). There remains the \u201cpeople,\u201d that is, the proletariat and the peasantry: the proletariat alone can be relied on to march to the end, for it is going far beyond the democratic revolution. That is why the proletariat fights in the front ranks for a republic and contemptuously rejects silly and unworthy advice to take care not to frighten away the bourgeoisie. The peasantry includes a great number of semi-proletarian as well as petty-bourgeois elements. This causes it also to be unstable and compels the proletariat to unite in a strictly class party. But the instability of the peasantry differs radically from the instability of the bourgeoisie, for at the present time the peasantry is interested not so much in the absolute preservation of private property as in the confiscation of the landed estates, one of the principal forms of private property. While this does not make the peasantry become socialist or cease to be petty-bourgeois, it is capable of becoming a wholehearted and most radical adherent of the democratic revolution. The peasantry will inevitably become such if only the progress of revolutionary events, which is enlightening it, is not checked too soon by the treachery of the bourgeoisie and the defeat of the proletariat. Subject to this condition, the peasantry will inevitably become a bulwark of the revolution and the republic, for only a completely victorious revolution can give the peasantry everything in the sphere of agrarian reforms\u2014everything that the peasants desire, of which they dream, and of which they truly stand in need (not for the abolition of capitalism as the \u201cSocialist-Revolutionaries\u201d imagine, but) in order to emerge from the mire of semi-serfdom, from the gloom of oppression and servitude, in order to improve their living conditions as much as it is possible to improve them under the system of commodity production.\n\nMoreover, the peasantry is attached to the revolution not only by the prospect of radical agrarian reform but by its general and permanent interests. Even in fighting the proletariat the peasantry stands in need of democracy, for only a democratic system is capable of giving exact expression to its interests and of ensuring its predominance as the mass, as the majority. The more enlightened the peasantry becomes (and since the war with Japan it is becoming enlightened much more rapidly than those who are accustomed to measure enlightenment by the school standard suspect), the more consistently and determinedly will it favour a thoroughgoing democratic revolution; for, unlike the bourgeoisie, it has nothing to fear from the supremacy of the people, but, on the contrary, stands to gain by it. A democratic republic will become the ideal of the peasantry as soon as it begins to free itself from its na\u00efve monarchism, because the enlightened monarchism of the bourgeois stock-jobbers (with an upper chamber, etc.) implies for the peasantry the same disfranchisement and the same down-troddenness and ignorance as it suffers from today, only slightly glossed over with the varnish of European constitutionalism.\n\nThat is why the bourgeoisie as a class naturally and inevitably strives to come under the wing of the liberal-monarchist party, while the peasantry, in the mass, strives to come under the leadership of the revolutionary and republican party. That is why the bourgeoisie is incapable of carrying the democratic revolution to its consummation, while the peasantry is capable of doing so, and we must exert all our efforts to help it to do so.\n\nIt may be objected: but this requires no proof, this is all ABC; all Social-Democrats understand this perfectly well. But that is not so. It is not understood by those who can talk about \u201cthe sweep\u201d of the revolution being \u201cdiminished\u201d because the bourgeoisie will fall away from it. Such people repeat the words of our agrarian program that they have learned by rote without understanding their meaning, for otherwise they would not be frightened by the concept of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, which inevitably follows from the entire Marxian world outlook and from our program; otherwise they would not restrict the sweep of the great Russian revolution to the limits to which the bourgeoisie is prepared to go. Such people defeat their abstract Marxian revolutionary phrases by their concrete anti-Marxian and anti-revolutionary resolutions.\n\nThose who really understand the role of the peasantry in a victorious Russian revolution would not dream of saying that the sweep of the revolution would be diminished if the bourgeoisie recoiled from it. For, as a matter of fact, the Russian revolution will begin to assume its real sweep, will really assume the widest revolutionary sweep possible in the epoch of bourgeois-democratic revolution, only when the bourgeoisie recoils from it and when the masses of the peasantry come out as active revolutionaries side by side with the proletariat. In order that it may be consistently carried to its conclusion, our democratic revolution must rely on such forces as are capable of paralysing the inevitable inconsistency of the bourgeoisie (i.e., capable precisely of \u201ccausing it to recoil from the revolution,\u201d which the Caucasian adherents of Iskra fear so much because of their lack of judgement).\n\nThe proletariat must carry to completion the democratic revolution, by allying to itself the mass of the peasantry in order to crush by force the resistance of the autocracy and to paralyse the instability of the bourgeoisie. The proletariat must accomplish the socialist revolution, by allying to itself the mass of the semi-proletarian elements of the population in order to crush by force the resistance of the bourgeoisie and to paralyse the instability of the peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie. Such are the tasks of the proletariat which the new-Iskraists present so narrowly in all their arguments and resolutions about the sweep of the revolution.\n\nOne circumstance, however, must not be forgotten, although it is frequently lost sight of in discussions about the \u201csweep\u201d of the revolution. It must not be forgotten that the point at issue is not the difficulties this problem presents, but the road along which we must seek and attain its solution. The point is not whether it is easy or difficult to make the sweep of the revolution mighty and invincible, but how we must act in order to make this sweep more powerful. It is precisely on the fundamental nature of our activity, on the direction it should take, that our views differ. We emphasise this because careless and unscrupulous people too frequently confuse two different questions, namely, the question of the direction in which the road leads, i.e., the selection of one of two different roads, and the question of how easily the goal can be reached, or of how near the goal is on the given road.\n\nWe have not dealt with this last question at all in the foregoing because it has not evoked any disagreement or divergency in the Party. But it goes without saying that the question itself is extremely important and deserves the most serious attention of all Social-Democrats. It would be a piece of unpardonable optimism to forget the difficulties which accompany the task of drawing into the movement the masses not only of the working class, but also of the peasantry. These difficulties have more than once been the rock against which the efforts to carry a democratic revolution to completion have been wrecked; and it was the inconsistent and self-seeking bourgeoisie which triumphed most of all, because it \u201cmade capital\u201d in the shape of monarchist protection against the people, and at the same time \u201cpreserved the virginity\u201d of liberalism . . . or of the Osvobozhdeniye trend. But difficult does not mean impossible. The important thing is to be convinced that the path chosen is the correct one, and this conviction will multiply a hundred-fold the revolutionary energy and revolutionary enthusiasm which can perform miracles.\n\nThe depth of the rift among present-day Social-Democrats on the question of the path to be chosen can be seen at once by comparing the Caucasian resolution of the new-Iskraists with the resolution of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Congress resolution says: the bourgeoisie is inconsistent, it will certainly try to deprive us of the gains of the revolution. Therefore, make more energetic preparations for the fight, comrades and fellow workers! Arm yourselves, win the peasantry to your side! We shall not surrender our revolutionary gains to the self-seeking bourgeoisie without a fight. The resolution of the Caucasian new-Iskraists says: the bourgeoisie is inconsistent, it may recoil from the revolution. Therefore, comrades and fellow workers, please do not think of joining a provisional government, for, if you do, the bourgeoisie will certainly recoil, and the sweep of the revolution will thereby be diminished!\n\nOne side says: advance the revolution forward, to its consummation, in spite of the resistance or the passivity of the inconsistent bourgeoisie.\n\nThe other side says: do not think of carrying the revolution to completion independently, for if you do, the inconsistent bourgeoisie will recoil from it.\n\nAre these not two diametrically opposite paths? Is it not obvious that one set of tactics absolutely excludes the other? That the first tactics are the only correct tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy, while the second are in fact purely Osvobozhdeniye tactics?\n\n.\nConclusion. Dare We Win?\nPeople who are superficially acquainted with the state of affairs in Russian Social-Democracy, or who judge as mere onlookers without knowing the whole history of our internal Party struggle since the days of Economism, very often also dismiss the disagreements on tactics which have now become crystallised, especially after the Third Congress, with the Page  of the MSsimple argument that there are two natural, inevitable and quite reconcilable trends in every Social-Democratic movement. One side, they say, lays special emphasis on the ordinary, current, everyday work, on the necessity of developing propaganda and agitation, of preparing forces, deepening the movement, etc., while the other side lays emphasis on the militant, general political, revolutionary tasks of the movement, points to the necessity of armed insurrection, advances the slogans: for a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship, for a provisional revolutionary government. Neither one side nor the other should exaggerate, they say; extremes are bad, both here and there (and, generally speaking, everywhere in the world), etc., etc.\n\nThe cheap truisms of worldly (and \u201cpolitical\u201d in quotation marks) wisdom, which such arguments undoubtedly contain, too often cover up a failure to understand the urgent and acute needs of the Party. Take the differences on tactics that now exist among the Russian Social-Democrats. of course, the special emphasis laid on the everyday, routine aspect of the work, such as we observe in the new Iskra-ist arguments about tactics, could not in itself present any danger and could not give rise to any divergence of opinion regarding tactical slogans. But the moment you compare the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party with the resolutions of the Conference this divergence becomes strikingly obvious.\n\nWhat, then, is the trouble? The trouble is that, in the first place, it is not enough to point abstractly to the two currents in the movement and to the harmfulness of extremes. One must know concretely what the given movement is suffering from at the given time, what constitutes the real political danger to the Party at the present time. Secondly, one must know what real political forces are profiting by this or that tactical slogan\u2014or perhaps by the absence of this or that slogan. To listen to the new Iskra-ists, one would arrive at the conclusion that the Social-Democratic Party is threatened with the danger of throwing overboard propaganda and agitation, the economic struggle and criticism of bourgeois democracy, of becoming inordinately absorbed in military preparations, armed attacks, the seizure of power, etc. Actually, however, real danger is threatening the Party from an entirely different quarter. Anyone who is at all closely familiar with the state of the movement, anyone who follows it carefully and thoughtfully, cannot fail to see the ridiculous side of the new Iskra\u2019s fears. The entire work of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party has already been fully moulded into firm, immutable forms which absolutely guarantee that our main attention will be fixed on propaganda and agitation, impromptu and mass meetings, on the distribution of leaflets and pamphlets, assisting in the economic struggle and championing the slogans of that struggle. There is not a single Party committee, not a single district committee, not a single central delegates\u2019 meeting or a single factory group where ninety-nine per cent of all the attention, energy and time are not always and constantly devoted to these functions, which have become firmly established ever since the middle of the \u2019nineties. Only those who are entirely unfamiliar with the movement are ignorant of this. Only very na\u00efve or ill-informed people can be taken in by the new Iskra-ists\u2019 repetition of stated truths when it is done with an air of great importance.\n\nThe fact is that not only is no excessive zeal displayed among us with regard to the tasks of insurrection, to the general political slogans and to the matter of leading the entire popular revolution, but, on the contrary, it is backwardness in this very respect that stands out most strikingly, constitutes our weakest spot and a real danger to the movement, which may degenerate, and in some places is degenerating, from one that is revolutionary in deeds into one that is revolutionary in words. Among the many, many hundreds of organisations, groups and circles that are conducting the work of the Party you will not find a single one which has not from its very inception conducted the kind of everyday work about which the wiseacres of the new Iskra now talk with the air of people who have discovered new truths. On the other hand, you will find only an insignificant percentage of groups and circles that have understood the tasks an armed insurrection entails, which have begun to carry them out, and have realised the necessity of leading the entire popular revolution against tsarism, the necessity of advancing for that purpose certain definite progressive slogans and no other.\n\nWe are incredibly behind in our progressive and genuinely revolutionary tasks, in very many instances we have not even become conscious of them; here and there we have failed to notice the strengthening of revolutionary bourgeois democracy owing to our backwardness in this respect. But the writers in the new Iskra, turning their backs on the course of events and on the requirements of the times, keep repeating insistently: Don\u2019t forget the old! Don\u2019t let yourselves be carried away by the new! This is the principal and unvarying leitmotif of all the important resolutions of the Conference; whereas in the Congress resolutions you just as unvaryingly read: while confirming the old (and without stopping to chew it over and over, for the very reason that it is old and has already been settled and recorded in literature, in resolutions and by experience), we put forward a new task, draw attention to it, issue a new slogan, and demand that the genuinely revolutionary Social-Democrats immediately set to work to put it into effect.\n\nThat is how matters really stand with regard to the question of the two trends in Social-Democratic tactics. The revolutionary period has called forth new tasks, which only the totally blind can fail to see. And some Social-Democrats unhesitatingly recognise these tasks and place them on the order of the day, declaring: the armed insurrection brooks no delay, prepare yourselves for it immediately and energetically, remember that it is indispensable for a decisive victory, issue the slogans of a republic, of a provisional government, of a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. Others, however, draw back, mark time, write prefaces instead of giving slogans; instead of pointing to the new while confirming the old, they chew this old tediously and at great length, inventing pretexts to avoid the new, unable to determine the conditions for a decisive victory or to issue the slogans which alone are in line with the striving to attain complete victory.\n\nThe political result of this khvostism stares us in the face. The fable about a rapprochement between the \u201cmajority\u201d of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and the revolutionary bourgeois democracy remains a fable which has not been confirmed by a single political fact, by a single important resolution of the \u201cBolsheviks\u201d or a single act of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. On the other hand, the opportunist, monarchist bourgeoisie, as represented by the Osvobozhdeniye, has long been welcoming the trends of the \u201cprinciples\u201d of new Iskra-ism and now it is actually running its mill with their grist, is adopting their catchwords and \u201cideas\u201d directed against \u201csecrecy\u201d and \u201criots,\u201d against exaggerating the \u201ctechnical\u201d side of the revolution, against openly proclaiming the slogan of armed insurrection, against the \u201crevolutionism\u201d of extreme demands, etc., etc. The resolution of a whole conference of \u201cMenshevik\u201d Social-Democrats in the Caucasus, and the endorsement of that resolution by the editors of the new Iskra, sums it all up politically in an unmistakable way: lest the bourgeoisie recoil if the proletariat takes part in a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship! This puts it in a nutshell. This gives the finishing touch to the transformation of the proletariat into an appendage of the monarchist bourgeoisie. The political meaning of the khvostism of the new Iskra is thereby proved in fact, not by a casual declaration of some individual, but by a resolution especially endorsed by a whole trend.\n\nAnyone who ponders over these facts will understand the real significance of the stock reference to the two sides and the two trends in the Social-Democratic movement. For a study of these trends on a large scale, take Bernsteinism. The Bernsteinians have been dinning into our ears in exactly the same way that it is they who understand the true needs of the proletariat, the tasks connected with the growth of its forces, with rendering the entire activity more profound, with preparing the elements of a new society, with propaganda and agitation! Bernstein says: we demand a frank recognition of what is, thus sanctifying a \u201cmovement\u201d without \u201cfinal aims,\u201d sanctifying defensive tactics only, preaching the tactics of fear \u201clest the bourgeoisie recoil.\u201d The Bernsteinians also raised an outcry against the \u201cJacobinism\u201d of the revolutionary Social-Democrats, against the \u201cpublicists\u201d who fail to understand the \u201cinitiative of the workers,\u201d etc., etc. In reality, as everyone knows, the revolutionary Social-Democrats have never even thought of abandoning the everyday, petty work, the mustering of forces, etc., etc. All they demanded was a clear understanding of the final aim, a clear presentation of the revolutionary tasks; they wanted to raise the semi-proletarian and semi-petty-bourgeois strata to the revolutionary level of the proletariat, not to reduce this level to that of opportunist considerations such as \u201clest the bourgeoisie recoil.\u201d Perhaps the most vivid expression of this rift between the intellectual opportunist wing and the proletarian revolutionary wing of the Party was the question: durfen wir siegen? \u201cDare we win?\u201d Is it permissible for us to win? Would it not be dangerous for us to win? Ought we to win? This question, which seems so strange at first sight, was raised, however, and had to be raised, because the opportunists were afraid of victory, were frightening the proletariat away from it, were predicting that trouble would come of it, were ridiculing the slogans that straightforwardly called for it.\n\nThe same fundamental division into an intellectual-opportunist and proletarian-revolutionary trend exists also among us, with the very material difference, however, that here we are faced with the question of a democratic revolution, and not of a socialist revolution. The question \u201cdare we win?\u201d which seems so absurd at first sight, has been raised among us also. It was raised by Martynov in his Two Dictatorships, in which he prophesied dire misfortune if we prepare well for and carry out an insurrection quite successfully. The question has been raised in all the new Iskra literature dealing with a provisional revolutionary government, and all the time persistent though futile efforts have been made to liken Millerand\u2019s participation in a bourgeois-opportunist government to Varlin\u2019s[] participation in a petty-bourgeois revolutionary government. It is embodied in a resolution: \u201clest the bourgeoisie recoil.\u201d And although Kautsky, for instance, now tries to wax ironical and says that our dispute about a provisional revolutionary government is like dividing the skin of a bear before the bear has been killed, this irony only proves that even clever and revolutionary Social-Democrats are liable to put their foot in it when they talk about something they know of only by hearsay. German Social-Democracy is not yet so near to killing its bear (carrying out a socialist revolution), but the dispute as to whether we \u201cdare\u201d kill the bear was of enormous importance from the point of view of principles and of practical politics. Russian Social-Democrats are not yet so near to being strong enough to \u201ckill their bear\u201d (to carry out a democratic revolution), but the question as to whether we \u201cdare\u201d kill it is of extreme importance for the whole future of Russia and for the future of Russian Social-Democracy. An army cannot be energetically and successfully mustered and led unless we are sure that we \u201cdare\u201d win.\n\nTake our old Economists. They too howled that their opponents were conspirators, Jacobins (see the Rabocheye Dyelyo, especially No. , and Martynov\u2019s speech in the debate on the program at the Second Congress), that by plunging into politics they were divorcing themselves from the masses, that they were losing sight of the fundamentals of the working-class movement, ignoring the initiative of the workers, etc., etc. In reality these supporters of the \u201cinitiative of the workers\u201d were opportunist intellectuals who tried to foist on the workers their own narrow and philistine conception of the tasks of the proletariat. In reality the opponents of Economism, as everyone can see from the old Iskra, did not neglect or push into the background any of the aspects of Social-Democratic work, nor did they in the least forget the economic struggle; but they were able at the same time to present the urgent and immediate political tasks in their full scope and they opposed the transformation of the workers\u2019 party into an \u201ceconomic\u201d appendage of the liberal bourgeoisie.\n\nThe Economists had learned by rote that politics are based on economics and \u201cunderstood\u201d this to mean that the political struggle should be reduced to the level of the economic struggle. The new-Iskraists have learned by rote that the economic basis of the democratic revolution is the bourgeois revolution, and \u201cunderstood\u201d this to mean that the democratic aims of the proletariat should be degraded to the level of bourgeois moderation, to the limits beyond which \u201cthe bourgeoisie will recoil.\u201d On the pretext of rendering their work more profound, on the pretext of rousing the initiative of the workers and pursuing a purely class policy, the Economists were actually delivering the working class into the hands of the liberal-bourgeois politicians, i.e., were leading the Party along a path which objectively meant exactly that. On the same pretexts, the new-Iskraists are actually betraying the interests of the proletariat in the democratic revolution to the bourgeoisie, i.e., are leading the Party along a path which objectively means exactly that. The Economists thought that leadership in the political struggle was no concern of the Social-Democrats but properly the business of the liberals. The new-Iskraists think that the active conduct of the democratic revolution is no concern of the Social-Democrats but properly the business of the democratic bourgeoisie, for, they argue, if the proletariat takes the leading and pre-eminent part it will \u201cdiminish the sweep\u201d of the revolution.\n\nIn short, the new-Iskraists are the epigones of Economism, not only in their origin at the Second Party Congress, but also in the manner in which they now present the tactical tasks of the proletariat in the democratic revolution. They, too, constitute an intellectual-opportunist wing of the Party. In the sphere of organisation they made their debut with the anarchist individualism of intellectuals and finished with \u201cdisorganisation-as-a-process,\u201d fixing in the \u201cRules\u201d[] [The \u201cRules of Organisation\u201d adopted at the Geneva Menshevik Conference in ] adopted by the Conference the separation of the Party\u2019s publishing activities from the Party organisation, an indirect and practically four-stage system of elections, a system of Bonapartist plebiscites instead of democratic representation, and finally the principle of \u201cagreements\u201d between the part and the whole. In Party tactics they continued to slide down the same inclined plane. In the \u201cplan of the Zemstvo campaign\u201d they declared that speeches to Zemstvo-ists were \u201cthe highest type of demonstration,\u201d finding only two active forces on the political scene (on the eve of January !)\u2014the government and the democratic bourgeoisie. They made the pressing problem of arming \u201cmore profound\u201d by substituting for the direct and practical slogan of an appeal to arm, the slogan: arm the people with a burning desire to arm themselves. The tasks connected with an armed insurrection, with the establishment of a provisional government and with a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship have now been distorted and blunted by them in their official resolutions. \u201cLest the bourgeoisie recoil\u201d\u2014this final chord of their last resolution throws a glaring light on the question of where their path is leading the Party.\n\nThe democratic revolution in Russia is a bourgeois revolution by reason of its social and economic content. But a mere repetition of this correct Marxian proposition is not enough. It must be properly understood and properly applied in political slogans. In general, all political liberties that are founded on present-day, i.e., capitalist, relations of production are bourgeois liberties. The demand for liberty expresses primarily the interests of the bourgeoisie. Its representatives were the first to raise this demand. Its supporters have everywhere used the liberty they acquired like masters, reducing it to moderate and meticulous bourgeois doses, combining it with the most subtle methods of suppressing the revolutionary proletariat in peaceful times and with brutally cruel methods in stormy times.\n\nBut only the rebel Narodniks, the anarchists and the \u201cEconomists\u201d could deduce from this that the struggle for liberty should be rejected or disparaged. These intellectual-philistine doctrines could be foisted on the proletariat only for a time and against its will. The proletariat always realised instinctively that it needed political liberty, needed it more than anyone else, despite the fact that its immediate effect would be to strengthen and to organise the bourgeoisie. The proletariat expects to find its salvation not by avoiding the class struggle but by developing it, by widening it, increasing its consciousness, its organisation and determination. Whoever degrades the tasks of the political struggle transforms the Social-Democrat from a tribune of the people into a trade union secretary. Whoever degrades the proletarian tasks in a democratic bourgeois revolution transforms the Social-Democrat from a leader of the people\u2019s revolution into a leader of a free labour union.\n\nYes, the people\u2019s revolution. Social-Democracy has fought, and is quite rightly fighting against the bourgeois-democratic abuse of the word \u201cpeople.\u201d It demands that this word shall not be used to cover up failure to understand the class antagonisms within the people. It insists categorically on the need for complete class independence for the party of the proletariat. But it divides the \u201cpeople\u201d into \u201cclasses,\u201d not in order that the advanced class may become shut up within itself, confine itself to narrow aims and emasculate its activity for fear that the economic rulers of the world will recoil, but in order that the advanced class, which does not suffer from the halfheartedness, vacillation and indecision of the intermediate classes, may with all the greater energy and enthusiasm fight for the cause of the whole of the people, at the head of the whole of the people.\n\nThat is what the present-day new-Iskraists so often fail to understand and why they substitute for active political slogans in the democratic revolution a mere pedantic repetition of the word \u201cclass,\u201d parsed in all genders and cases!\n\nThe democratic revolution is a bourgeois revolution. The slogan of a Black Redistribution, or \u201cland and liberty\u201d\u2014this most widespread slogan of the peasant masses, down trodden and ignorant, yet passionately yearning for light and happiness\u2014is a bourgeois slogan. But we Marxists should know that there is not, nor can there be, any other path to real freedom for the proletariat and the peasantry, than the path of bourgeois freedom and bourgeois progress. We must not forget that there is not, nor can there be, at the present time, any other means of bringing Socialism nearer, than complete political liberty, than a democratic republic, than the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. As the representatives of the advanced and only revolutionary class, revolutionary without reservations, doubts or looking back, we must present to the whole of the people, as widely, as boldly and with the utmost initiative possible, the tasks of the democratic revolution. To degrade these tasks in theory means making a travesty of Marxism, distorting it in philistine fashion, while in practical politics it means delivering the cause of the revolution into the hands of the bourgeoisie, which will inevitably recoil from the task of consistently carrying out the revolution. The difficulties that lie on the road to the complete victory of the revolution are very great. No one will be able to blame the representatives of the proletariat if, having done everything in their power, their efforts are defeated by the resistance of the reaction, the treachery of the bourgeoisie and the ignorance of the masses. But everybody and the class-conscious proletariat above all, will condemn Social-Democracy if it curtails the revolutionary energy of the democratic revolution and dampens revolutionary ardour because it is afraid to win, because it is actuated by the consideration: lest the bourgeoisie recoil.\n\nRevolutions are the locomotives of history, said Marx.[] [In The Class Struggles in France] Revolutions are the festivals of the oppressed and the exploited. At no other time are the masses of the people in a position to come forward so actively as creators of a new social order as at a time of revolution. At such times the people are capable of performing miracles, if judged by the narrow, philistine scale of gradual progress. But the leaders of the revolutionary parties must also make their aims more comprehensive and bold at such a time, so that their slogans shall always be in advance of the revolutionary initiative of the masses, serve as a beacon, reveal to them our democratic and socialist ideal in all its magnitude and splendour and show them the shortest and most direct route to complete, absolute and decisive victory. Let us leave to the opportunists of the Osvobozhdeniye bourgeoisie the task of inventing roundabout, circuitous paths of compromise out of fear of the revolution and of the direct path. If we are compelled by force to drag ourselves along such paths, we shall be able to fulfil our duty in petty, everyday work also. But let ruthless struggle first decide the choice of the path. We shall be traitors to and betrayers of the revolution if we do not use this festive energy of the masses and their revolutionary ardour to wage a ruthless and self-sacrificing struggle for the direct and decisive path. Let the bourgeois opportunists contemplate the future reaction with craven fear. The workers will not be frightened either by the thought that the reaction promises to be terrible or by the thought that the bourgeoisie proposes to recoil. The workers are not looking forward to striking bargains, are not asking for sops; they are striving to crush the reactionary forces without mercy, i.e., to set up the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry.\n\nOf course, greater dangers threaten the ship of our Party in stormy times than in periods of the smooth \u201csailing\u201d of liberal progress, which means the painfully slow sweating of the working class by its exploiters. of course, the tasks of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship are a thousand times more difficult and more complicated than the tasks of an \u201cextreme opposition\u201d or of the exclusively parliamentary struggle. But whoever can deliberately prefer smooth sailing and the path of safe \u201copposition\u201d in the present revolutionary situation had better abandon Social-Democratic work for a while, had better wait until the revolution is over, until the festive days have passed, when humdrum everyday life starts again and his narrow routine standards no longer strike such an abominably discordant note, or constitute such an ugly distortion of the tasks of the advanced class.\n\nAt the head of the whole of the people, and particularly of the peasantry\u2014for complete freedom, for a consistent democratic revolution, for a republic! At the head of all the toilers and the exploited\u2014for Socialism! Such must in practice be the policy of the revolutionary proletariat, such is the class slogan which must permeate and determine the solution of every tactical problem, every practical step of the workers\u2019 party during the revolution. The publication of the book Moscow in December  (Moscow, ) could not have been more timely. It is an urgent task of the workers\u2019 party to assimilate the lessons of the December uprising. Unfortunately, this book is like a barrel of honey spoilt by a spoonful of tar: most interesting material\u2014despite its incompleteness\u2014and incredibly slovenly, incredibly trite conclusions. We shall deal with these conclusions on another occasion[] ; at present we shall turn our attention to the burning political question of the day, to the lessons of the Moscow uprising.\n\nThe principal forms of the December movement in Moscow were the peaceful strike and demonstrations, and these were the only forms of struggle in which the vast majority of the workers took an active part. Yet, the December action in Moscow vividly demonstrated that the general strike, as an independent and predominant form of struggle, is out of date, that the movement is breaking out of these narrow bounds with elemental and irresistible force and giving rise to the highest form of struggle\u2014an uprising.\n\nIn calling the strike, all the revolutionary parties, all the Moscow unions recognised and even intuitively felt that it must inevitably grow into an uprising. On December  the Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies resolved to \u201cstrive to transform the strike into an armed uprising\u201d. As a matter of fact, however, none of the organisations were prepared for this. Even the Joint Council of Volunteer Fighting Squads[] spoke (on December !) of an uprising as of something remote, and it is quite evident that it had no hand in or control of   the street fighting that took place. The organisations failed to keep pace with the growth and range of the movement.\n\nThe strike was growing into an uprising, primarily as a result of the pressure of the objective conditions created after October. A general strike could no longer take the government unawares: it had already organised the forces of counter-revolution, and they were ready for military action. The whole course of the Russian revolution after October, and the sequence of events in Moscow in the December days, strikingly confirmed one of Marx\u2019s profound propositions: revolution progresses by giving rise to a strong and united counter-revolution, i.e., it compels the enemy to resort to more and more extreme measures of defence and in this way devises ever more powerful means of attack.[]\n\nDecember  and : a peaceful strike, peaceful mass demonstrations. Evening of the th: the siege of the Aquarium.[] The morning of the th: the crowd in Strastnaya Square is attacked by the dragoons. Evening: the Fiedler building[] is raided. Temper rises. The unorganised street crowds, quite spontaneously and hesitatingly, set up the first barricades.\n\nThe th: artillery fire is opened on the barricades and the crowds in the streets. Barricades are set up more deliberately, and no longer in isolated cases, but on a really mass scale. The whole population is in the streets; all the main centres of the city are covered by a network of barricades. For several days the volunteer fighting units wage a stubborn guerrilla battle against the troops, which exhausts the troops and compels Dubasov[] to beg for reinforcements. Only on December  did the superiority of the government forces become complete, and on December  the Semyonovsky Regiment[] crushed Presnya District, the last stronghold of the uprising.\n\nFrom a strike and demonstrations to isolated barricades. From isolated barricades to the mass erection of barricades and street fighting against the troops. Over the heads of the organisations, the mass proletarian struggle developed from a strike to an uprising. This is the greatest historic gain the Russian revolution achieved in December ; and like all preceding gains it was purchased at the price of enormous sacrifices. The movement was raised from a   general political strike to a higher stage. It compelled the reaction to go to the limit in its resistance, and so brought vastly nearer the moment when the revolution will also go to the limit in applying the means of attack. The reaction cannot go further than the shelling of barricades, buildings and crowds. But the revolution can go very much further than the Moscow volunteer fighting units, it can go very, very much further in breadth and depth. And the revolution has advanced far since December. The base of the revolutionary crisis has become immeasurably broader\u2014the blade must now be sharpened to a keener edge.\n\nThe proletariat sensed sooner than its leaders the change in the objective conditions of the struggle and the need for a transition from the strike to an uprising. As is always the case, practice marched ahead of theory. A peaceful strike and demonstrations immediately ceased to satisfy the workers; they asked: What is to be done next? And they demanded more resolute action. The instructions to set up barricades reached the districts exceedingly late, when barricades were already being erected in the centre of the city. The workers set to work in large numbers, but even this did not satisfy them; they wanted to know: what is to be done next?\u2014 they demanded active measures. In December, we, the leaders of the Social-Democratic proletariat, were like a commander-in-chief who has deployed his troops in such an absurd way that most of them took no active part in the battle. The masses of the workers demanded, but failed to receive, instructions for resolute mass action.\n\nThus, nothing could be more short-sighted than Plekhanov\u2019s view, seized upon by all the opportunists, that the strike was untimely and should not have been started, and that \u201cthey should not have taken to arms\u201d. On the contrary, we should have taken to arms more resolutely, energetically and aggressively; we should have explained to the masses that it was impossible to confine things to a peaceful strike and that a fearless and relentless armed fight was necessary. And now we must at last openly and publicly admit that political strikes are inadequate; we must carry on the widest agitation among the masses in favour of an armed uprising and make no attempt to obscure this question by talk about   \u201cpreliminary stages\u201d, or to befog it in any way. We would be deceiving both ourselves and the people if we concealed from the masses the necessity of a desperate, bloody war of extermination, as the immediate task of the coming revolutionary action.\n\nSuch is the first lesson of the December events. Another lesson concerns the character of the uprising, the methods by which it is conducted, and the conditions which lead to the troops coming over to the side of the people. An extremely biased view on this latter point prevails in the Right wing of our Party. It is alleged that there is no possibility of fighting modern troops; the troops must become revolutionary. Of course, unless the revolution assumes a mass character and affects the troops, there can be no question of serious struggle. That we must work among the troops goes without saying. But we must not imagine that they will come over to our side at one stroke, as a result of persuasion or their own convictions. The Moscow uprising clearly demonstrated how stereotyped and lifeless this view is. As a matter of fact, the wavering of the troops, which is inevitable in every truly popular movement, leads to a real fight for the troops whenever the revolutionary struggle be comes acute. The Moscow uprising was precisely an example of the desperate, frantic struggle for the troops that takes place between the reaction and the revolution. Dubasov himself declared that of the fifteen thousand men of the Moscow garrison, only five thousand were reliable. The government restrained the waverers by the most diverse and desperate measures: they appealed to them, flattered them, bribed them, presented them with watches, money, etc.; they doped them with vodka, they lied to them, threatened them, confined them to barracks and disarmed them, and those who were suspected of being least reliable were removed by treachery and violence. And we must have the courage to confess, openly and unreservedly, that in this respect we lagged be hind the government. We failed to utilise the forces at our disposal for such an active, bold, resourceful and aggressive fight for the wavering troops as that which the government waged and won. We have carried on work in the army and we will redouble our efforts in the future ideologically to \u201cwin over\u201d the troops. But we shall prove to be miserable   pedants if we forget that at a time of uprising there must also be a physical struggle for the troops.\n\nIn the December days, the Moscow proletariat taught us magnificent lessons in ideologically \u201cwinning over\u201d the troops, as, for example, on December  in Strastnaya Square, when the crowd surrounded the Cossacks, mingled and fraternised with them, and persuaded them to turn back. Or on December , in Presnya District, when two working girls, carrying a red flag in a crowd of , people, rushed out to meet the Cossacks crying: \u201cKill us! We will not surrender the flag alive!\u201d And the Cossacks were disconcerted and galloped away, amidst the shouts from the crowd: \u201cHurrah for the Cossacks!\u201d These examples of courage and heroism should be impressed forever on the mind of the proletariat.\n\nBut here are examples of how we lagged behind Dubasov. On December , soldiers were marching down Bolshaya Serpukhovskaya Street singing the Marseillaise, on their way to join the insurgents. The workers sent delegates to meet them. Malakhov himself galloped at breakneck speed towards them. The workers were too late, Malakhov reached them first. He delivered a passionate speech, caused the soldiers to waver, surrounded them with dragoons, marched them off to barracks and locked them in. Malakhov reached the soldiers in time and we did not, although within two days , people had risen at our call, and these could and should have organised the patrolling of the streets. Malakhov surrounded the soldiers with dragoons, whereas we failed to surround the Malakhovs with bomb-throwers. We could and should have done this; and long ago the Social-Democratic press (the old Iskra[]) pointed out that ruthless extermination of civil and military chiefs was our duty during an uprising. What took place in Bolshaya Serpukhovskaya Street was apparently repeated in its main features in front of the Nesvizhskiye Barracks and the Krutitskiye Barracks, and also when the workers attempted to \u201cwithdraw\u201d the Ekaterinoslav Regiment, and when delegates were sent to the sappers in Alexandrov, and when the Rostov artillery on its way to Moscow was turned back, and when the sappers were disarmed in Kolomna, and so on. During the uprising we proved unequal to our task in the fight for the wavering troops.\n\nThe December events confirmed another of Marx\u2019s profound propositions, which the opportunists have forgotten, namely, that insurrection is an art and that the principal rule of this art is the waging of a desperately bold and irrevocably determined offensive.[] We have not sufficiently assimilated this truth. We ourselves have not sufficiently learned, nor have we taught the masses, this art, this rule to attack at all costs. We must make up for this omission with all our energy. It is not enough to take sides on the question of political slogans; it is also necessary to take sides on the question of an armed uprising. Those who are opposed to it, those who do not prepare for it, must be ruthlessly dismissed from the ranks of the supporters of the revolution, sent packing to its enemies, to the traitors or cowards; for the day is approaching when the force of events and the conditions of the struggle will compel us to distinguish between enemies and friends according to this principle. It is not passivity that we should preach, not mere \u201cwaiting\u201d until the troops \u201ccome over\u201d. No! We must proclaim from the house tops the need for a bold offensive and armed attack, the necessity at such times of exterminating the persons in command of the enemy, and of a most energetic fight for the wavering troops.\n\nThe third great lesson taught by Moscow concerns the tactics and organisation of the forces for an uprising. Military tactics depend on the level of military technique. This plain truth Engels demonstrated and brought home to all Marxists.[] Military technique today is not what it was in the middle of the nineteenth century. It would be folly to contend against artillery in crowds and defend barricades with revolvers. Kautsky was right when he wrote that it is high time now, after Moscow, to review Engels\u2019s conclusions, and that Moscow had inaugurated \u201cnew barricade tactics\u201d.[] These tactics are the tactics of guerrilla warfare. The organisation required for such tactics is that of mobile and exceedingly small units, units of ten, three or even two persons. We often meet Social-Democrats now who scoff whenever units of five or three are mentioned. But scoffing is only a cheap way of ignoring the new question of tactics and organisation raised by street fighting under the conditions imposed by modern military technique. Study carefully the story   of the Moscow uprising, gentlemen, and you will understand what connection exists between \u201cunits of five\u201d and the question of \u201cnew barricade tactics\u201d.\n\nMoscow advanced these tactics, but failed to develop them far enough, to apply them to any considerable extent, to a really mass extent. There were too few volunteer fighting squads, the slogan of bold attack was not issued to the masses of the workers and they did not apply it; the guerrilla detachments were too uniform in character, their arms and methods were inadequate, their ability to lead the crowd was almost undeveloped. We must make up for all this and we shall do so by learning from the experience of Moscow, by spreading this experience among the masses and by stimulating their creative efforts to develop it still further. And the guerrilla warfare and mass terror that have been taking place throughout Russia practically without a break since December, will undoubtedly help the masses to learn the correct tactics of an uprising. Social-Democracy must recognise this mass terror and incorporate it into its tactics, organising and controlling it of course, subordinating it to the interests and conditions of the working-class movement and the general revolutionary struggle, while eliminating and ruthlessly lopping off the \u201chooligan\u201d perversion of this guerrilla warfare which was so splendidly and ruthlessly dealt with by our Moscow comrades during the uprising and by the Letts during the days of the famous Lettish republics.[]\n\nThere have been new advances in military technique in the very recent period. The Japanese War produced the hand grenade. The small-arms factories have placed automatic rifles on the market. Both these weapons are already being successfully used in the Russian revolution, but to a degree that is far from adequate. We can and must take advantage of improvements in technique, teach the workers\u2019 detachments to make bombs in large quantities, help them and our fighting squads to obtain supplies of explosives, fuses and automatic rifles. If the mass of the workers takes part in uprisings in the towns, if mass attacks are launched on the enemy, if a determined and skilful fight is waged for the troops, who after the Duma, after Sveaborg and Kronstadt are wavering more than ever\u2014and if we ensure participation   of the rural areas in the general struggle\u2014victory will be ours in the next all-Russian armed uprising.\n\nLet us, then, develop our work more extensively and set our tasks more boldly, while mastering the lessons of the great days of the Russian revolution. The basis of our work is a correct estimate of class interests and of the requirements of the nation\u2019s development at the present juncture. We are rallying, and shall continue to rally, an increasing section of the proletariat, the peasantry and the army under the slogan of overthrowing the tsarist regime and convening a constituent assembly by a revolutionary government. As hitherto, the basis and chief content of our work is to develop the political understanding of the masses. But let us not forget that, in addition to this general, constant and fundamental task, times like the present in Russia impose other, particular and special tasks. Let us not become pedants and philistines, let us not evade these special tasks of the moment, these special tasks of the given forms of struggle, by meaningless references to our permanent duties, which remain unchanged at all times and in all circumstances.\n\nLet us remember that a great mass struggle is approaching. It will be an armed uprising. It must, as far as possible, be simultaneous. The masses must know that they are entering upon an armed, bloody and desperate struggle. Contempt for death must become widespread among them and will ensure victory. The onslaught on the enemy must be pressed with the greatest vigour; attack, not defence, must be the slogan of the masses; the ruthless extermination of the enemy will be their task; the organisation of the struggle will become mobile and flexible; the wavering elements among the troops will be drawn into active participation. And in this momentous struggle, the party of the class-conscious proletariat must discharge its duty to the full. A year of disintegration, a year of ideological and political disunity, a year of Party driftage lies behind us. The membership of all our Party organisations has dropped. Some of them\u2014namely, those whose membership was least proletarian\u2014have fallen to pieces. The Party\u2019s semi-legal institutions created by the revolution have been broken up time after time. Things reached a point when some elements within the Party, under the impact of the general break-up, began to ask whether it was necessary to preserve the old Social-Democratic Party, whether it was necessary to continue its work, whether it was necessary to go \u201cunderground\u201d once more, and how this was to be done. And the extreme Right (the liquidationist trend, so called) answered this question in the sense that it was necessary to legalise ourselves at all costs, even at the price of an open renunciation of the Party programme, tactics and organisation. This was undoubtedly an ideological and political crisis as well as an organisational one.\n\nThe recent All-Russian Conference of the Russian Social- Democratic Labour Party has led the Party out on to the road, and evidently marks a turning-point in the development of the Russian working-class movement after the victory of the counter-revolution. The decisions of the conference, published in a special Report issued by the Central Committee of our Party, have been confirmed by the Central Committee, and therefore, pending the next Congress, stand as the decisions of the whole Party. These decisions give a very definite answer to the question of the causes and the significance of the crisis, as well as the means of overcoming it. By working in the spirit of the conference   resolutions, by striving to make all Party workers realise clearly and fully the present tasks of the Party, our organisations will be able to strengthen and consolidate their forces for united and effective revolutionary Social-Democratic work.\n\nThe main cause of the Party crisis is indicated in the preamble of the resolution on organisation. This main cause is the wavering intellectual and petty-bourgeois elements, of which the workers\u2019 party had to rid itself; elements who joined the working-class movement mainly in the hope of an early triumph of the bourgeois-democratic revolution and could not stand up to a period of reaction. Their instability was revealed both in theory (\"retreat from revolutionary Marxism\u201d: the resolution on the present situation) and in tactics (the \u201cwhittling down of slogans\u201d), as well as in Party organisation. The class-conscious workers repelled this instability, came out resolutely against the liquidators, began to take the management and guidance of the Party organisations into their own hands. If this hard core of our Party was unable at the outset to overcome the elements of disunity and crisis, this was not only because the task was a great and difficult one amidst the triumph of the counter-revolution, but also because a certain indifference towards the Party showed itself among those workers who, although revolutionary-minded, were not sufficiently socialist-minded. It is precisely to the class-conscious workers of Russia that the decisions of the conference are addressed in the first place\u2014as the crystallised opinion of Social- Democracy concerning the means of combating disunity and vacillation.\n\nA Marxist analysis of present-day class relations and of the new policy of tsarism; an indication of the immediate aim of the struggle which our Party continues as before to set itself; an appreciation of the lessons of the revolution as regards the correctness of the revolutionary Social-Democrats\u2019 tactics; elucidation of the causes of the Party crisis; pointing out the role in combating it of the proletarian elements of the Party; solution of the problem of relations between the illegal and legal organisations; recognition of the necessity of utilising the Duma tribune and drawing up precise instructions for the guidance of     our Duma group, linked with direct criticism of its mistakes\u2014such was the principal content of the decisions of the conference, which provide a complete answer to the question of the party of the working class choosing a definite path in the present difficult period. Let us examine this answer more carefully.\n\nThe interrelation of classes in their political groupings remains the same as that which prevailed during the past period of direct revolutionary struggle of the masses. The overwhelming majority of the peasants cannot but strive for an agrarian revolution which would destroy semi-feudal landownership, and which cannot be achieved without the overthrow of tsarism. The triumph of reaction has borne down heavily on the democratic elements of the peasantry, which is incapable of forming a solid organisation; but despite all oppression, despite the Black-Hundred Duma, despite the extreme instability of the Trudoviks, the revolutionary mood of the peasant masses is clearly evidenced even by the debates in the Third Duma. The fundamental position of the proletariat in regard to the tasks of the bourgeois- democratic revolution in Russia remains unaltered: to guide the democratic peasantry and to wrest it from the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie, the Cadet Party\u2014which continues to draw closer and closer to the Octobrists notwithstanding petty private squabbles, and which recently has been striving to establish national-liberalism and to sup port tsarism and reaction by chauvinist agitation. The struggle goes on as before\u2014says the resolution\u2014for the complete abolition of the monarchy and the conquest of political power by the proletariat and the revolutionary peasantry.\n\nThe autocracy, as hitherto, is the principal enemy of the proletariat and of all democratic trends. It would be a mistake, however, to imagine that it remains unchanged. The Stolypin \u201cconstitution\u201d and Stolypin\u2019s agrarian policy mark a new stage in the break-down of the old, semi-patriarchal, semi-feudal tsarism, a new step towards its transformation into a bourgeois monarchy. The delegates from the Caucasus, who wished either to delete such a characterisation of the present situation altogether, or to substitute \u201cplutocratic\u201d for \u201cbourgeois\u201d, were wrong. The autocracy has long been plutocratic; but it is only after the first stage   of the revolution, under the impact of its blows, that. the autocracy is becoming bourgeois, both in its agrarian policy and its direct, nationally-organised alliance with certain strata of the bourgeoisie. The autocracy has been nursing the bourgeoisie for a long time now; the bourgeoisie, by means of the ruble, has long been winning its way to \u201cthe top\u201d, securing influence on legislation and administration, and a place beside the noble aristocracy. But the peculiar feature of the present situation is that the autocracy has been forced to set up a representative assembly for certain strata of the bourgeoisie, to balance between them and the feudalist landlords, to form an alliance of these sections in the Duma; it has been forced to abandon all the hopes it had placed in the patriarchalism of the muzhik, and to seek support against the rural masses among the rich peas ants, who are ruining the village commune.\n\nThe autocracy cloaks itself with pseudo-constitutional institutions, but at the same time its class essence is being exposed as never before, owing to the alliance concluded by the tsar with the Purishkeviches and the Guchkovs, and with no one else. The autocracy is attempting to take upon itself the fulfilment of those tasks of the bourgeois revolution which are objectively necessary\u2014the setting-up of a representative assembly of the people which would really manage the affairs of bourgeois society, and the purging of the countryside of medieval, entangled and antiquated agrarian relations. But the practical results of these new steps taken by the autocracy are, so far, exactly nil, and this only shows more clearly than ever that other forces and other means are necessary for the fulfilment of the historical task. In the minds of millions of people inexperienced in politics, the autocracy was hitherto contrasted with popular representation in general; now, the struggle is narrowing its aims, and is more concretely defining its task as the struggle for power in the state, which determines the character and significance of representation itself. That is why the Third Duma marks a special stage in the break-down of the old tsarism, in the intensification of its adventurist character, in the deepening of the old revolutionary aims, in the widening of the field of struggle (and of the numbers taking part in the struggle) for these aims.\n\nWe must get over this stage. The present new conditions require new forms of struggle. The use of the Duma tribune is an absolute necessity. A prolonged effort to educate and organise the masses of the proletariat becomes particularly important. The combination of illegal and legal organisation raises special problems before the Party. The popularisation and clarification of the experience of the revolution, which the liberals and liquidationist intellectuals are seeking to discredit, are necessary both for theoretical and practical purposes. But the tactical line of the Party\u2014which must be able to take the new conditions into account in its methods and means of struggle\u2014remains unchanged. The correctness of revolutionary Social-Democratic tactics, states one of the resolutions of the conference, is confirmed by the experience of the mass struggle in -. The defeat of the revolution resulting from this first campaign revealed, not that the tasks were wrong, not that the immediate aims were \u201cutopian\u201d, not that the methods and means were mistaken, but that the forces were insufficiently prepared, that the revolutionary crisis was insufficiently wide and deep\u2014and Stolypin and Co. are working to widen and deepen it with most praiseworthy zeal! Let the liberals and terrified intellectuals lose heart after the first genuinely mass battle for freedom, let them repeat like cowards: don\u2019t go where you have been beaten before, don\u2019t tread that fatal path again. The class-conscious proletariat will answer them: the great wars in history, the great problems of revolutions, were solved only by the advanced classes returning to the attack again and again\u2014and they achieved victory after having learned the lessons of defeat. Defeated armies learn well. The revolutionary classes of Russia have been defeated in their first campaign, but the revolutionary situation remains. In new forms and by other ways, sometimes much more slowly than we would wish, the revolutionary crisis is approaching, coming to a head again. We must carry on with the lengthy work of preparing larger masses for that crisis; this preparation must be more serious, taking account of higher and more concrete tasks; and the more successfully we do this work, the more certain will be our victory in the new struggle. The Russian proletariat can be proud of the fact that in , under its leadership, a nation   of slaves for the first time became a million-strong host, an army of the revolution, striking at tsarism. And now the same proletariat will know how to do persistently, staunchly and patiently t.he work of educating and training the new cadres of a still mightier revolutionary force.\n\nAs we have said, utilisation of the Duma tribune is an essential element of this work of education and training. The conference resolution on the Duma group indicates to our Party that road which comes nearest\u2014if we are to seek instances in history\u2014to the experience of German Social- Democracy at the time of the Anti-Socialist Law. The illegal Party must know how to use, it must learn how to use, the legal Duma group; it must train up the latter into a Party organisation equal to its tasks. The most mistaken tactics, the most regrettable deviation, from consistent proletarian work, dictated by the conditions of the present period, would be to raise the question of recalling the group from the Duma (there were two \u201cotzovists\u201d at the conference, but they did not raise the question openly), or to refrain from directly and openly criticising its mistakes and from enumerating them in the resolution (as some delegates insisted at the conference). The resolution fully recognises that the group has committed mistakes for which it was not alone to blame, and which were quite similar to the inevitable mistakes of all our Party organisations. But there are other mistakes\u2014 departures from the political line of the Party. Since these departures occurred, since they were made by an organisation openly acting in the name of the whole Party, the Party was bound to declare clearly and definitely that these were deviations. In the history of West-European socialist parties there have been a number of instances of abnormal relations between the parliamentary groups and the Party; to this.day these relations are quite often abnormal in the Latin countries, where the groups do not display sufficient Party spirit. We must from the very outset organise Social-Democratic parliamentarism in Russia on a different basis; we must at once establish team-work in this field\u2014so that every Social- Democratic deputy may really feel that he has the Party behind him, that the Party is deeply concerned over his mistakes and tries to straighten out his path\u2014so that every Party worker may take part in the general Duma work of the   Party, learning from the practical Marxist criticism of its steps, feeling it his duty to assist it, and striving to gear the special work of the group to the whole propaganda and agitation activity of the Party.\n\nThe conference was the first authoritative meeting of delegates from the biggest Party organisations to discuss the work of the Duma Social-Democratic group during the whole session. And the decision of the conference shows very clearly how our Party will shape its Duma work, how very exacting it will be in this field both to itself and to the group, how undeviatingly and consistently it proposes to work on developing genuinely Social-Democratic parliamentarism.\n\nThe question of our attitude to the Duma group has a tactical and an organisational aspect. In the latter respect the resolution on the Duma group is only the application of our general principles of organisational policy to a particular case, principles laid down by the conference in the resolution giving instructions on the question of organisation. The conference has recorded that two main tendencies exist in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party on this question: one of them throws the weight of emphasis on the illegal Party organisation, the other\u2014which is more or less akin to liquidationism\u2014throws the weight of emphasis on the legal and semi-legal organisations. The point is that the present situation is characterised, as we have already pointed out, by a certain number of Party workers leaving the Party\u2014especially intellectuals, but also some proletarians. The liquidationist trend raises the question as to whether it is the best, the most active elements that are abandoning the Party and choosing the legal organisations as their field of activity, or whether it .is the \u201cvacillating intellectualist and petty-bourgeois elements\u201d that are leaving the Party. Needless to say, by emphatically rejecting and condemning liquidationism, the conference replied that it was the latter elements. The most proletarian elements of the Party, and those elements of the intelligentsia that were most consistent in principle and most Social Democratic, remained true to the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The desertions from the Party mean its purification, they mean getting rid of its least stable element,   of its unreliable friends, of its \u201cfellow-travellers\u201d (Mitl\u00e4ufer), who always joined the proletariat for a while and who were recruited from among the petty bourgeoisie or from among the \u201cdeclassed\u201d, i. e., people thrown out of the orbit of some definite class.\n\nFrom this evaluation of the principle of Party organisation logically follows the line of organisational policy adopt ed by the conference. To strengthen the illegal Party organisation, to create Party cells in all spheres of work, to set up first of all \u201centirely Party committees consisting of workers, even if their number be small, in each industrial enterprise\u201d, to concentrate the functions of leadership in the hands of leaders of the Social-Democratic movement from among the workers themselves\u2014such is the task today. Need less to say, the task of these cells and committees must be to utilise all the semi-legal and, as far as possible, legal organisations, to maintain \u201cclose contact with the masses\u201d, and to direct the work in such a way that Social-Democracy responds to all the needs of the masses. Every Party cell and workers\u2019 committee must become a \u201cbase for agitation, propaganda and practical organising work among the masses\u201d, i. e., they must go where the masses go, and try at every step to push the consciousness of the masses in the direction of socialism, to link up every specific question with the general tasks of the proletariat, to transform every act of organisation into one of class consolidation, to win by dint of energy and ideological influence (not by their ranks and titles, of course) the leading role in all the proletarian legal organisations. Even if these cells and commit tees be very small at times, they will be linked together by Party tradition and Party organisation, by a definite class programme; and two or three Social-Democratic members of the Party will thus be able to avoid becoming sub merged in an amorphous legal organisation and to pursue their Party line under all conditions, in all circumstances and in all kinds of situations, to influence their environment in the spirit of the whole Party, and not allow the environment to swallow them up.\n\nThough mass organisations of one type or another may be dissolved, though the legal trade unions may be hounded out of existence, though every open act of workers\u2019 initiative   under a regime of counter-revolution may be ruined by the police on one pretext or another\u2014no power on earth can prevent the concentration of masses of workers in a capitalist country, such as Russia has already become. One way or another, legally or semi-legally, openly or covertly, the working class will find its own rallying points; the class- conscious Party Social-Democrats will everywhere and always march in front of the masses, everywhere and always act together in order to influence the masses in the spirit of the Party. And Social-Democracy, which has proved in open revolution that it is the party of the class, the party that succeeded in leading millions in strikes, in the uprising of , as well as in the elections of -, will now also be able to remain the party of the class, the party of. the masses, the vanguard, which in the hardest times will not lose touch with the bulk of the army, but will be able to help the latter overcome these hard times, consolidate its ranks once more, and train more and more new fighters.\n\nLet the Black-Hundred diehards rejoice and howl inside the Duma and outside it, in the capital and in the remote provinces, let the reaction rage\u2014the ever so wise Mr. Stolypin cannot take a single step without bringing the precariously balancing autocracy nearer its fall, without creating a new tangle of political impossibilities and absurdities, without adding new and fresh forces to the ranks of the proletariat and to the ranks of the revolutionary elements of the peasant masses. A party which succeeds in consolidating itself for persistent work in contact with the masses, a party of the advanced class, which succeeds in organising its vanguard, and which directs its forces in such a way as to influence in a Social-Democratic spirit every sign of life of the proletariat\u2014such a party will win no matter what happens.\n\n One hundred years have elapsed since Herzen\u2019s birth. The whole of liberal Russia is paying homage to him, studiously evading, however, the serious questions of socialism, and taking pains to conceal that which distinguished Herzen the revolutionary from a liberal. The Right-wing press, too, is commemorating the Herzen centenary, falsely asserting that in his last years Herzen renounced revolution. And in the orations on Herzen that are made by the liberals and Narodniks abroad, phrase-mongering reigns supreme.\n\nThe working-class party should commemorate the Herzen centenary, not for the sake of philistine glorification, but for the purpose of making clear its own tasks and ascertaining the place actually held in history by this writer who played a great part in paving the way for the Russian revolution.\n\nHerzen belonged to the generation of revolutionaries among the nobility and landlords of the first half of the last century. The nobility gave Russia the Birons and Arakcheyevs,[] innumerable \u201cdrunken officers, bullies, gamblers, heroes of fairs, masters of hounds, roisterers, floggers, pimps\u201d, as well as amiable Manilovs.[] \u201cBut,\u201d wrote Herzen, \u201camong them developed the men of December ,[] a phalanx of heroes reared, like Romulus and Remus, on the milk of a wild beast.... They were veritable titans, hammered out of pure steel from head to foot, comrades-in-arms who deliberately went to certain death in order to awaken the young generation to a new life and to purify the children born in an environment of tyranny and servility.\u201d[]\n\nHerzen was one of those children. The uprising of the Decembrists awakened and \u201cpurified\u201d him. In the feudal Russia of the forties of the nineteenth century, he rose to a   height which placed him on a level with the greatest thinkers of his time. He assimilated Hegel\u2019s dialectics. He realised that it was \u201cthe algebra of revolution\u201d. He went further than Hegel, following Feuerbach to materialism. The first of his Letters on the Study of Nature, \u201cEmpiricism and Idealism\u201d, written in , reveals to us a thinker who even now stands head and shoulders above the multitude of modern empiricist natural scientists and the host of present-day idealist and semi-idealist philosophers. Herzen came right up to dialectical materialism, and halted\u2014before historical materialism.\n\nIt was this \u201chalt\u201d that caused Herzen\u2019s spiritual ship wreck after the defeat of the revolution of . Herzen had left Russia, and observed this revolution at close range. He was at that time a democrat, a revolutionary, a socialist. But his \u201csocialism\u201d was one of the countless forms and varieties of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois socialism of the period of , which were dealt their death-blow in the June days of that year. In point of fact, it was not socialism at all, but so many sentimental phrases, benevolent visions, which were the expression at that time of the revolutionary character of the bourgeois democrats, as well as of the proletariat, which had not yet freed itself from the influence of those democrats.\n\nHerzen\u2019s spiritual shipwreck, his deep scepticism and pessimism after , was a shipwreck of the bourgeois illusions of socialism. Herzen\u2019s spiritual drama was a pro duct and reflection of that epoch in world history when the revolutionary character of the bourgeois democrats was already passing away (in Europe), while the revolutionary character of the socialist proletariat had not yet matured. This is something the Russian knights of liberal verbiage, who are now covering up their counter-revolutionary nature by florid phrases about Herzen\u2019s scepticism, did not and could not understand. With these knights, who betrayed the Russian revolution of , and have even forgotten to think of the great name of revolutionary, scepticism is a form of transition from democracy to liberalism, to that toadying, vile, foul and brutal liberalism which shot down the workers in , restored the shattered thrones and applauded Napoleon III, and which Herzen cursed, unable to understand its class nature.\n\nWith Herzen, scepticism was a form of transition from the illusion of a bourgeois democracy that is \u201cabove classes\u201d to the grim, inexorable and invincible class struggle of the proletariat. The proof: the Letters to an Old Comrade\u2014to Bakunin\u2014written by Herzen in , a year before his death. In them Herzen breaks with the anarchist Bakunin. True, Herzen still sees this break as a mere disagreement on tactics and not as a gulf between the world outlook of the proletarian who is confident of the victory of his class and that of the petty bourgeois who has despaired of his salvation. True enough, in these letters as well, Herzen repeats the old bourgeois-democratic phrases to the effect that socialism must preach \u201ca sermon addressed equally to workman and master, to farmer and townsman\u201d. Nevertheless, in breaking with Bakunin, Herzen turned his gaze, not to liberalism, but to the International\u2014to the international led by Marx, to the International which had begun to \u201crally the legions\u201d of the proletariat, to unite \u201cthe world of labour\u201d, which is \u201cabandoning the world of those who enjoy without working\u201d.[]\n\nFailing as he did to understand the bourgeois-democratic character of the entire movement of  and of all the forms of pre-Marxian socialism, Herzen was still less able to understand the bourgeois nature of the Russian revolution. Herzen is the founder of \u201cRussian\u201d socialism, of \u201cNarodism\u201d. He saw \u201csocialism\u201d in the emancipation of the peasants with land, in community land tenure[] and in the peasant idea of \u201cthe right to land\u201d. He set forth his pet ideas on this subject an untold number of times.\n\nActually, there is not a grain of socialism in this doctrine of Herzen\u2019s, as, indeed, in the whole of Russian. Narodism, including the faded Narodism of the present-day Socialist-Revolutionaries. Like the various forms of \u201cthe socialism of \u201d in the West, this is the same sort of sentimental phrases, of benevolent visions, in which is expressed the revolutionism of the bourgeois peasant democracy in Russia. The more land the peasants would have received in [] and the less they would have had to pay for it, the more would the power of the feudal landlords have been   undermined and the more rapidly, freely and widely would capitalism have developed in Russia. The idea of the \u201cright to land\u201d and of \u201cequalised division of the land\u201d is nothing but a formulation of the revolutionary aspiration for equality cherished by the peasants who are fighting for the complete overthrow of the power of the landlords, for the complete abolition of landlordism.\n\nThis was fully proved by the revolution of : on the one hand, the proletariat came out quite independently at the head of the revolutionary struggle, having founded the Social-Democratic Labour Party; on the other band, the revolutionary peasants (the Trudoviks and the Peasant Union[]), who fought for every form of the abolition of landlordism even to \u201cthe abolition of private landownership\u201d, fought precisely as proprietors, as small entrepreneurs.\n\nToday, the controversy over the \u201csocialist nature\u201d of the right to land, and so on, serves only to obscure and cover up the really important and serious historical question concerning the difference of interests of the liberal bourgeoisie and the revolutionary peasantry in the Russian bourgeois revolution;, in other words, the question of the liberal and the democratic, the \u201ccompromising\u201d (monarchist) and the republican trends manifested in that revolution. This is exactly the question posed by Herzen\u2019s Kolokol,[] if we turn our attention to the essence of the matter and not to the words, if we investigate the class struggle as the basis of \u201ctheories\u201d and doctrines and not vice versa.\n\nHerzen founded a free Russian press abroad, and that is the great service rendered by him. Polyarnaya Zvezda[] took up the tradition of the Decembrists. Kolokol (\u2013) championed the emancipation of the peasants with might and main. The slavish silence was broken.\n\nBut Herzen came from a landlord, aristocratic milieu. He left Russia in ; he had not seen the revolutionary people and could have no faith in it. Hence his liberal appeal to the \u201cupper ranks\u201d. Hence his innumerable sugary letters in Kolokol addressed to Alexander II the Hangman, which today one cannot read without revulsion. Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov and Serno-Solovyevich, who represented the new generation of revolutionary raznochintsi,[] were a thousand times right when they reproached Herzen for these   departures from democracy to liberalism. However, it must be said in fairness to Herzen that, much as he vacillated between democracy and liberalism, the democrat in him gained the upper hand nonetheless.\n\nWhen Kavelin, one of the most repulsive exponents of liberal servility\u2014who at one time was enthusiastic about Kolokol precisely because of its liberal tendencies\u2014rose in arms against a constitution, attacked revolutionary agitation, rose against \u201cviolence\u201d and appeals for it, and began to preach tolerance, Herzen broke with that liberal sage. Herzen turned upon Kavelin\u2019s \u201cmeagre, absurd, harmful pamphlet\u201d written \u201cfor the private guidance of a government pretending to be liberal\u201d; he denounced Kavelin\u2019s \u201csentimental political maxims\u201d which represented \u201cthe Russian people as brutes and the government as an embodiment of intelligence\u201d. Kolokol printed an article entitled \u201cEpitaph\u201d, which lashed out against \u201cprofessors weaving the rot ten cobweb of their superciliously paltry ideas, ex-professors, once open-hearted and subsequently embittered because they saw that the healthy youth could not sympathise with their scrofulous thinking\u201d. Kavelin at once recognised himself in this portrait.\n\nWhen Chernyshevsky was arrested, the vile liberal Kavelin wrote: \u201cI see nothing shocking in the arrests ... the revolutionary party considers all means fair to overthrow the government, and the latter defends itself by its own means.\u201d As if in retort to this Cadet, Herzen wrote concerning Chernyshevsky\u2019s trial: \u201cAnd here are wretches, weed-like people, jellyfish, who say that we must not reprove the gang of robbers and scoundrels that is governing us.\u201d\n\nWhen the liberal Turgenev[] wrote a private letter to Alexander II assuring him of his loyalty, and donated two goldpieces for the soldiers wounded during the suppression of the Polish insurrection, Kolokol wrote of \u201cthe grey-haired Magdalen (of the masculine gender) who wrote to the tsar to tell him that she knew no sleep because she was tormented by the thought that the tsar was not aware of the repentance that had overcome her\u201d. And Turgenev at once recognised himself.\n\nWhen the whole band of Russian liberals scurried away from Herzen for his defence of Poland, when the whole of   \u201ceducated society\u201d turned its back on Kolokol, Herzen was not dismayed. He went on championing the freedom of Po land and lashing the suppressors, the butchers, the hangmen in the service of Alexander II. Herzen saved the honour of Russian democracy. \u201cWe have saved the honour of the Russian name,\u201d he wrote to Turgenev, \u201cand for doing so we have suffered at the hands of the slavish majority.\u201d\n\nWhen it was reported that a serf peasant had killed a landlord for an attempt to dishonour the serf\u2019s betrothed, Herzen commented in Kolokol: \u201cWell done!\u201d When it was reported that army officers would be appointed to supervise the \u201cpeaceable\u201d progress of \u201cemancipation\u201d, Herzen wrote: \u201cThe first wise colonel who with his unit joins the peasants instead of crushing them, will ascend the throne of the Romanovs.\u201d When Colonel Reitern shot himself in Warsaw () because he did not want to be a helper of hangmen, Herzen wrote: \u201cIf there is to be any shooting, the ones to be shot should be the generals who give orders to fire upon unarmed people.\u201d When fifty peasants were massacred in Bezdna, and their leader, Anton Petrov, was executed (April , ), Herzen wrote in Kolokol:\n\n\u201cIf only my words could reach you, toiler and sufferer of the land of Russia!... How well I would teach you to despise your spiritual shepherds, placed over you by the St. Petersburg Synod and a German tsar.... You hate the landlord, you hate the official, you fear them, and rightly so; but you still believe in the tsar and the bishop ... do not believe them. The tsar is with them, and they are his men. It is him you now see\u2014you, the father of a youth murdered in Bezdna, and you, the son of a father murdered in Penza.... Your shepherds are as ignorant as you, and as poor.... Such was another Anthony (not Bishop Anthony, but Anton of Bezdna) who suffered for you in Kazan.... The dead bodies of your martyrs will not per form forty-eight miracles, and praying to them will not cure a tooth ache; but their living memory may produce one miracle\u2014your emancipation.\u201d\n\nThis shows how infamously and vilely Herzen is being slandered by our liberals entrenched in the slavish \u201clegal\u201d press, who magnify Herzen\u2019s weak points and say nothing about his strong points. It was not Herzen\u2019s fault but his misfortune that he could not see the revolutionary people in Russia itself in the s. When in the sixties he came to see the revolutionary people, he sided fearlessly with the revolutionary democracy against liberalism. He fought for a   victory of the people over tsarism, not for a deal between the liberal bourgeoisie and the landlords\u2019 tsar. He raised aloft the banner of revolution.\n\nIn commemorating Herzen, we clearly see the three generations, the three classes, that were active in the Russian revolution. At first it was nobles and landlords, the Decembrists and Herzen. These revolutionaries formed but a narrow group. They were very far removed from the people. But their effort was not in vain. The Decembrists awakened Herzen. Herzen began the work of revolutionary agitation.\n\nThis work was taken up, extended, strengthened, and tempered by the revolutionary raznochintsi\u2014from Chernyshevsky to the heroes of Narodnaya Volya.[] The range of fighters widened, their contact with the people became closer. \u201cThe young helmsmen of the gathering storm\u201d is what Herzen called them. But it was not yet the storm itself.\n\nThe storm is the movement of the masses themselves. The proletariat, the only class that is thoroughly revolutionary, rose at the head of the masses and for the first time aroused millions of peasants to open revolutionary struggle. The first onslaught in this storm took place in . The next is beginning to develop under our very eyes.\n\nIn commemorating Herzen, the proletariat is learning from his example to appreciate the great importance of revolutionary theory. It is learning that selfless devotion to the revolution and revolutionary propaganda among the people are not wasted even if long decades divide the sowing from the harvest. It is learning to ascertain the role of the various classes in the Russian and in the international revolution. Enriched by these lessons, the proletariat will fight its way to a free alliance with the socialist workers of all lands, having crushed that loathsome monster, the tsarist monarchy, against which Herzen was the first to raise the great banner of struggle by addressing his free Russian word to the masses. What a lot of talk, argument and vociferation there is nowadays about nationality and the fatherland! Liberal and radical cabinet ministers in Britain, a host of \u201cforward-looking\u201d journalists in France (who have proved in full agreement with their reactionary colleagues), and a swarm of official Cadet and progressive scribblers in Russia (including several Narodniks and \u201cMarxists\u201d)\u2014all have effusive praise for the liberty and independence of their respective countries, the grandeur of the principle of national independence. Here one cannot tell where the venal eulogist of the butcher Nicholas Romanov[] or of the brutal oppressors of Negroes and Indians ends, and where the common philistine begins, who from sheer stupidity or spinelessness drifts with the streams, begins. Nor is that distinction important. We see before us an extensive and very deep ideological trend, whose origins are closely interwoven with the interests of the landowners and the capitalists of the dominant nations. Scores and hundreds of millions are being spent every year for the propaganda of ideas advantageous to those classes: it is a pretty big mill-race that takes its waters from all sources\u2014from Menshikov, a chauvinist by conviction, to chauvinists for reason of opportunism or spinelessness such as Plekhanov and Maslov, Rubanovich and Smirnov, Kropotkin and Burtsev.\n\nLet us, Great-Russian Social-Democrats, also try to define our attitude to this ideological trend. It would be unseemly for us, representatives of a dominant nation in the far east of Europe and a goodly part of Asia, to forget the immense significance of the national question\u2014especially   in a country which has been rightly called the \u201cprison of the peoples\u201d, and particularly at a time when, in the far east of Europe and in Asia, capitalism is awakening to life and self-consciousness a number of #;new\u201d nations, large and small; at a moment when the tsarist monarchy has called up millions of Great Russians and non-Russians, so as to \u201csolve\u201d a number of national problems in accordance with the interests of the Council of the United Nobility[] and of the Guchkovs, Krestovnikovs, Dolgorukovs, Kutlers and Rodichevs.\n\nIs a sense of national pride alien to us, Great-Russian class-conscious proletarians? Certainly not! We love our language and our country, and we are doing our very utmost to raise her toiling masses (i.e., nine-tenths of her population) to the level of a democratic and socialist consciousness. To us it is most painful to see and feel the outrages, the oppression and the humiliation our fair country suffers at the hands of the tsar\u2019s butchers, the nobles and the capitalists. We take pride in the resistance to these outrages put up from our midst, from the Great Russians; in that midst having produced Radishchev,[] the Decembrists[] and the revolutionary commoners of the seventies[]; in the Great-Russian working class having created, in , a mighty revolutionary party of the masses; and in the Great-Russian peasantry having begun to turn towards democracy and set about overthrowing the clergy and the landed proprietors.\n\nWe remember that Chernyshevsky, the Great-Russian democrat, who dedicated his life to the cause of revolution, said half a century ago: \u201cA wretched nation, a nation of slaves, from top to bottom\u2014all slaves.\"[] The overt and covert Great-Russian slaves (slaves with regard to the tsarist monarchy) do not like to recall these words. Yet, in our opinion, these were words of genuine love for our country, a love distressed by the absence of a revolutionary spirit in the masses of the Great-Russian people. There was none of that spirit at the time. There is little of it now, but it already exists. We are full of national pride because the Great-Russian nation, too, has created a revolutionary class, because it, too, has proved capable of providing mankind with great models of the struggle for freedom and socialism, and not only with great pogroms, rows of   gallows, dungeons, great famines and great servility to priests, tsars, landowners and capitalists.\n\nWe are full of a sense of national pride, and for that very reason we particularly hate our slavish past (when the landed nobility led the peasants into war to stifle the freedom of Hungary, Poland, Persia and China), and our slavish present, when these selfsame landed proprietors, aided by the capitalists, are loading us into a war in order to throttle Poland and the Ukraine, crush the democratic movement in Persia and China, and strengthen the gang of Romanovs, Bobrinskys and Purishkeviches, who are a disgrace to our Great-Russian national dignity. Nobody is to be blamed for being born a slave; but a slave who not only eschews a striving for freedom but justifies and eulogises his slavery (e.g., calls the throttling of Poland and the Ukraine, etc., a \u201cdefence of the fatherland\u201d of the Great Russians)\u2014such a slave is a lickspittle and a boor, who arouses a legitimate feeling of indignation, contempt, and loathing.\n\n\"No nation can be free if it oppresses other nations,\u201d said Marx and Engels, the greatest representatives of consistent nineteenth century democracy, who became the teachers of the revolutionary proletariat. And, full of a sense of national pride, we Great-Russian workers want, come what may, a free and independent, a democratic, republican and proud Great Russia, one that will base its relations with its neighbours on the human principle of equality, and not on the feudalist principle of privilege, which is so degrading to a great nation. Just because we want that, we say: it is impossible, in the twentieth century and in Europe (even in the far east of Europe), to \u201cdefend the fatherland\u201d otherwise than by using every revolutionary means to combat the monarchy, the landowners and the capitalists of one\u2019s own fatherland, i.e., the worst enemies of our country. We say that the Great Russians cannot \u201cdefend the fatherland\u201d otherwise than by desiring the defeat of tsarism in any war, this as the lesser evil to nine-tenths of the inhabitants of Great Russia. For tsarism not only oppresses those nine-tenths economically and politically, but also demoralises, degrades, dishonours and prostitutes them by teaching them to oppress other nations and to cover up this shame with hypocritical and quasi-patriotic phrases.\n\nThe objection may be advanced that, besides tsarism and under its wing, another historical force has arisen and become strong, viz., Great-Russian capitalism, which is carrying on progressive work by economically centralising and welding together vast regions. This objection, however, does not excuse, but on the contrary still more condemns our socialist-chauvinists, who should be called tsarist-Purishkevich socialists[] (just as Marx called the Lassalleans Royal-Prussian socialists).[] Let us even assume that history will decide in favour of Great-Russian dominant-nation capitalism, and against the hundred and one small nations. That is not impossible, for the entire history of capital is one of violence and plunder, blood and corruption. We do not advocate preserving small nations at all costs; other conditions being equal, we are decidedly for centralisation and are opposed to the petty-bourgeois ideal of federal relationships. Even if our assumption were true, however, it is, firstly, not our business, or that of democrats (let alone of socialists), to help Romanov-Bobrinsky-Purishkevich throttle the Ukraine, etc. In his own Junker fashion, Bismarck accomplished a progressive historical task, but he would be a fine \u201cMarxist\u201d indeed who, on such grounds, thought of justifying socialist support for Bismarck! Moreover, Bismarck promoted economic development by bringing together the disunited Germans, who were being oppressed by other nations. The economic prosperity and rapid development of Great Russia, however, require that the country be liberated from Great-Russian oppression of other nations\u2014that is the difference that our admirers of the true-Russian would-be Bismarcks overlook.\n\nSecondly, if history were to decide in favour of Great Russian dominant-nation capitalism, it follows hence that the socialist role of the Great-Russian proletariat, as the principal driving force of the communist revolution engendered by capitalism, will be all the greater. The proletarian revolution calls for a prolonged education of the workers in the spirit of the fullest national equality and brotherhood. Consequently, the interests of the Great-Russian proletariat require that the masses be systematically educated to champion\u2014most resolutely, consistently, boldly and in a revolutionary manner\u2014complete equality and the right to self-determination for all the nations oppressed   by the Great Russians. The interests of the Great Russians\u2019 national pride (understood, not in the slavish sense) coincide with the socialist interests of the Great-Russian (and all other) proletarians. Our model will always be Marx, who, after living in Britain for decades and becoming half-English, demanded freedom and national independence for Ireland in the interests of the socialist movement of the British workers.\n\nIn the second hypothetical case we have considered, our home-grown socialist-chauvinists, Plekhanov, etc., etc., will prove traitors, not only to their own country\u2014a free and democratic Great Russia, but also to the proletarian brotherhood of all the nations of Russia, i.e., to the cause of socialism. The first revolution engendered by the imperialist world war has broken out. The first revolution but certainly not the last.\n\nJudging by the scanty information available in Switzer land, the first stage of this first revolution, namely, of the Russian revolution of March , , has ended. This first stage of our revolution will certainly not be the last.\n\nHow could such a \u201cmiracle\u201d have happened, that in only eight days\u2014the period indicated by Mr. Milyukov in his boastful telegram to all Russia\u2019s representatives abroad\u2014a monarchy collapsed that had maintained itself for centuries, and that in spite of everything had managed to maintain itself throughout the three years of the tremendous, nation-wide class battles of \u2013?\n\nThere are no miracles in nature or history, but every abrupt turn in history, and this applies to every revolution, presents such a wealth of content, unfolds such unexpected and specific combinations of forms of struggle and alignment of forces of the contestants, that to the lay mind there is much that must appear miraculous.\n\nThe combination of a number of factors of world-historic importance was required for the tsarist monarchy to have collapsed in a few days. We shall mention the chief of them.\n\nWithout the tremendous class battles and the revolutionary energy displayed by the Russian proletariat during the three years \u2013, the second revolution could not possibly have been so rapid in the sense that its initial stage was   completed in a few days. The first revolution () deeply ploughed the soil, uprooted age-old prejudices, awakened millions of workers and tens of millions of peasants to political life and political struggle and revealed to each other\u2014and to the world\u2014all classes (and all the principal parties) of Russian society in their true character and in the true alignment of their interests, their forces, their modes of action, and their immediate and ultimate aims. This first revolution, and the succeeding period of counter-revolution (\u2013), laid bare the very essence of the tsarist monarchy, brought it to the \u201cutmost limit\u201d, exposed all the rottenness and infamy, the cynicism and corruption of the tsar\u2019s clique, dominated by that monster, Rasputin. It exposed all the bestiality of the Romanov family\u2014those pogrom-mongers who drenched Russia in the blood of Jews, workers and revolutionaries, those landlords, \u201cfirst among peers\u201d, who own millions of dessiatines of land and are prepared to stoop to any brutality, to any crime, to ruin and strangle any number of citizens in order to preserve the \u201csacred right of property\u201d for themselves and their class.\n\nWithout the Revolution of \u2013 and the counter-revolution of \u2013, there could not have been that clear \u201cself determination\u201d of all classes of the Russian people and of the nations inhabiting Russia, that determination of the relation of these classes to each other and to the tsarist monarchy, which manifested itself during the eight days of the February-March Revolution of . This eight-day revolution was \u201cperformed\u201d, if we may use a metaphorical expression, as though after a dozen major and minor rehearsals; the \u201cactors\u201d knew each other, their parts, their places and their setting in every detail, through and through, down to every more or less important shade of political trend and mode of action.\n\nFor the first great Revolution of , which the Guchkovs and Milyukovs and their hangers-on denounced as a \u201cgreat rebellion\u201d, led after the lapse of twelve years, to the \u201cbrilliant\u201d, the \u201cglorious\u201d Revolution of \u2014the Guchkovs and Milyukovs have proclaimed it \u201cglorious\u201d because it has put them in power (for the time being). But this required a great, mighty and all-powerful \u201cstage manager\u201d, capable, on the one hand, of vastly accelerating the course of world   history, and, on the other, of engendering world-wide crises of unparalleled intensity\u2014economic, political, national and international. Apart from an extraordinary acceleration of world history, it was also necessary that history make particularly abrupt turns, in order that at one such turn the filthy and blood-stained cart of the Romanov monarchy should be overturned at one stroke.\n\nThis all-powerful \u201cstage manager\u201d, this mighty accelerator was the imperialist world war.\n\nThat it is a world war is now indisputable, for the United States and China are already half-involved today, and will be fully involved tomorrow.\n\nThat it is an imperialist war on both sides is now likewise indisputable. Only the capitalists and their hangers-on, the social-patriots and social-chauvinists, or\u2014if instead of general critical definitions we use political names familiar in Russia\u2014only the Guchkovs and Lvovs, Milyukovs and Shingaryovs on the one hand, and only the Gvozdyovs, Potresovs, Chkhenkelis, Kerenskys and Chkheidzes on the other, can deny or gloss over this fact. Both the German and the Anglo-French bourgeoisie are waging the war for the plunder of foreign countries and the strangling of small nations, for financial world supremacy and the division and redivision of colonies, and in order to save the tottering capitalist regime by misleading and dividing the workers of the various countries.\n\nThe imperialist war was bound, with objective inevitability, immensely to accelerate and intensify to an unprecedented degree the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie; it was bound to turn into a civil war between the hostile classes.\n\nThis transformation has been started by the February\u2013March Revolution of , the first stage of which has been marked, firstly, by a joint blow at tsarism struck by two forces: one, the whole of bourgeois and landlord Russia, with all her unconscious hangers-on and all her conscious leaders, the British and French ambassadors and capitalists, and the other, the Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies, which has begun to win over the soldiers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 deputies.[]\n\nThese three political camps, these three fundamental political forces\u2014() the tsarist monarchy, the head of the feudal   landlords, of the old bureaucracy and the military caste; () bourgeois and landlord-Octobrist-Cadet Russia, behind which trailed the petty bourgeoisie (of which Kerensky and Chkheidze are the principal representatives); () the Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies, which is seeking to make the entire proletariat and the entire mass of the poorest part of the population its allies\u2014these three fundamental political forces fully and clearly revealed themselves even in the eight days of the \u201cfirst stage\u201d and even to an observer so remote from the scene of events as the present writer, who is obliged to content himself with the meagre foreign press dispatches.\n\nBut before dealing with this in greater detail, I must return to the part of my letter devoted to a factor of prime importance, namely, the imperialist world war.\n\nThe war shackled the belligerent powers, the belligerent groups of capitalists, the \u201cbosses\u201d of the capitalist system, the slave-owners of the capitalist slave system, to each other with chains of iron. One bloody clot\u2014such is the social and political life of the present moment in history.\n\nThe socialists who deserted to the bourgeoisie on the outbreak of the war\u2014all these Davids and Scheidemanns in Germany and the Plekhanovs, Potresovs, Gvozdyovs and Co. in Russia\u2014clamoured loud and long against the \u201cillusions\u201d of the revolutionaries, against the \u201cillusions\u201d of the Basle Manifesto, against the \u201cfarcical dream\u201d of turning the imperialist war into a civil war. They sang praises in every key to the strength, tenacity and adaptability allegedly revealed by capitalism\u2014they, who had aided the capitalists to \u201cadapt\u201d, tame, mislead and divide the working classes of the various countries!\n\nBut \u201che who laughs last laughs best\u201d. The bourgeoisie has been unable to delay for long the revolutionary crisis engendered by the war. That crisis is growing with irresistible force in all countries, beginning with Germany, which, according to an observer who recently visited that country, is suffering \u201cbrilliantly organised famine\u201d, and ending with England and France, where famine is also looming, but where organisation is far less \u201cbrilliant\u201d.\n\nIt was natural that the revolutionary crisis should have broken out first of all in tsarist Russia, where the disorganisation was most appalling and the proletariat most revolutionary   (not by virtue of any special qualities, but because of the living traditions of ). This crisis was precipitated by the series of extremely severe defeats sustained by Russia and her allies. They shook up the old machinery of government and the old order and roused the anger of all classes of the population against them; they embittered the army, wiped out a very large part of the old commanding personnel, composed of die-hard aristocrats and exceptionally corrupt bureaucratic elements, and replaced it by a young, fresh, mainly bourgeois, commoner, petty-bourgeois personnel. Those who, grovelling to the bourgeoisie or simply lacking backbone, howled and wailed about \u201cdefeatism\u201d, are now faced by the fact of the historical connection between the defeat of the most backward and barbarous tsarist monarchy and the beginning of the revolutionary conflagration.\n\nBut while the defeats early in the war were a negative factor that precipitated the upheaval, the connection between Anglo-French finance capital, Anglo-French imperialism, and Russian Octobrist-Cadet capital was a factor that hastened this crisis by the direct organisation of a plot against Nicholas Romanov.\n\nThis highly important aspect of the situation is, for obvious reasons, hushed up by the Anglo-French press and maliciously emphasised by the German. We Marxists must soberly face the truth and not allow ourselves to be confused either by the lies, the official sugary diplomatic and ministerial lies, of the first group of imperialist belligerents, or by the sniggering and smirking of their financial and military rivals of the other belligerent group. The whole course of events in the February-March Revolution clearly shows that the British and French embassies, with their agents and \u201cconnections\u201d, who had long been making the most desperate efforts to prevent \u201cseparate\u201d agreements and a separate peace between Nicholas II (and last, we hope, and we will endeavour to make him that) and Wilhelm II, directly organised a plot in conjunction with the Octobrists and Cadets, in conjunction with a section of the generals and army and St. Petersburg garrison officers, with the express object of deposing Nicholas Romanov.\n\nLet us not harbour any illusions. Let us not make the mistake of those who\u2014like certain O.C. supporters or Mensheviks   who are oscillating between Gvozdyov-Potresov policy and internationalism and only too often slip into petty-bourgeois pacifism\u2014are now ready to extol \u201cagreement\u201d between the workers\u2019 party and the Cadets, \u201csupport\u201d of the latter by the former, etc. In conformity with the old (and by no means Marxist) doctrine that they have learned by rote, they are trying to veil the plot of the Anglo-French imperialists and the Guchkovs and Milyukovs aimed at deposing the \u201cchief warrior\u201d, Nicholas Romanov, and putting more energetic, fresh and more capable warriors in his place.\n\nThat the revolution succeeded so quickly and\u2014seemingly, at the first superficial glance\u2014so radically, is only due to the fact that, as a result of an extremely unique historical situation, absolutely dissimilar currents, absolutely heterogeneous class interests, absolutely contrary political and social strivings have merged, and in a strikingly \u201charmonious\u201d manner. Namely, the conspiracy of the Anglo-French imperialists, who impelled Milyukov, Guchkov and Co. to seize power for the purpose of continuing the imperialist war, for the purpose of conducting the war still more ferociously and obstinately, for the purpose of slaughtering fresh millions of Russian workers and peasants in order that the Guchkovs might obtain Constantinople, the French capitalists Syria, the British capitalists Mesopotamia, and so on. This on the one hand. On the other, there was a profound proletarian and mass popular movement of a revolutionary character (a movement of the entire poorest section of the population of town and country) for bread, for peace, for real freedom.\n\nIt would simply be foolish to speak of the revolutionary proletariat of Russia \u201csupporting\u201d the Cadet-Octobrist imperialism, which has been \u201cpatched up\u201d with English money and is as abominable as tsarist imperialism. The revolutionary workers were destroying, have already destroyed to a considerable degree and will destroy to its foundations the infamous tsarist monarchy. They are neither elated nor dismayed by the fact that at certain brief and exceptional historical conjunctures they were aided by the struggle of Buchanan, Guchkov, Milyukov and Co. to replace one monarch by another monarch, also preferably a Romanov!\n\nSuch, and only such, is the way the situation developed. Such, and only such, is the view that can be taken by a politician   who does not fear the truth, who soberly weighs the balance of social forces in the revolution, who appraises every \u201ccurrent situation\u201d not only from the standpoint of all its present, current peculiarities, but also from the standpoint of the more fundamental motivations, the deeper interest-relationship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, both in Russia and throughout the world.\n\nThe workers of Petrograd, like the workers of the whole of Russia, self-sacrificingly fought the tsarist monarchy\u2014fought for freedom, land for the peasants, and for peace, against the imperialist slaughter. To continue and intensify that slaughter, Anglo-French imperialist capital hatched Court intrigues, conspired with the officers of the Guards, incited and encouraged the Guchkovs and Milyukovs, and fixed up a complete new government, which in fact did seize power immediately the proletarian struggle had struck the first blows at tsarism.\n\nThis new government, in which Lvov and Guchkov of the Octobrists and Peaceful Renovation Party,[] yesterday\u2019s abettors of Stolypin the Hangman, control really important posts, vital posts, decisive posts, the army and the bureaucracy\u2014this government, in which Milyukov and the other Cadets[] are more than anything decorations, a signboard\u2014they are there to deliver sentimental professorial speeches\u2014and in which the Trudovik[] Kerensky is a balalaika on which they play to deceive the workers and peasants\u2014this government is not a fortuitous assemblage of persons.\n\nThey are representatives of the new class that has risen to political power in Russia, the class of capitalist land lords and bourgeoisie which has long been ruling our country economically, and which during the Revolution of \u2013, the counter-revolutionary period of \u2013, and finally\u2014and with especial rapidity\u2014the war period of \u2013, was quick to organise itself politically, taking over control of the local government bodies, public education, congresses of various types, the Duma, the war industries committees, etc. This new class was already \u201calmost completely\u201d in power by , and therefore it needed only the first blows to bring tsarism to the ground and clear the way for the bourgeoisie. The imperialist war, which required an incredible exertion of effort, so accelerated the course of backward   Russia s development that we have \u201cat one blow\u201d (seemingly at one blow) caught up with Italy, England, and almost with France. We have obtained a \u201ccoalition\u201d, a \u201cnational\u201d (i.e., adapted for carrying on the imperialist slaughter and for fooling the people) \u201cparliamentary\u201d government.\n\nSide by side with this government\u2014which as regards the present war is but the agent of the billion-dollar \u201cfirm\u201d \u201cEngland and France\u201d\u2014there has arisen the chief, unofficial, as yet undeveloped and comparatively weak workers\u2019 government, which expresses the interests of the proletariat and of the entire poor section of the urban and rural population. This is the Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies in Petrograd, which is seeking connections with the soldiers and peasants, and also with the agricultural workers, with the latter particularly and primarily, of course, more than with the peasants.\n\nSuch is the actual political situation, which we must first endeavour to define with the greatest possible objective precision, in order that Marxist tactics may he based upon the only possible solid foundation\u2014the foundation of facts.\n\nThe tsarist monarchy has been smashed, but not finally destroyed.\n\nThe Octobrist-Cadet bourgeois government, which wants to fight the imperialist war \u201cto a finish\u201d, and which in reality is the agent of the financial firm \u201cEngland and France\u201d, is obliged to promise the people the maximum of liberties and sops compatible with the maintenance of its power over the people and the possibility of continuing the imperialist slaughter.\n\nThe Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies is an organisation of the workers, the embryo of a workers\u2019 government, the representative of the interests of the entire mass of the poor section of the population, i.e., of nine-tenths of the population, which is striving for peace, bread and freedom.\n\nThe conflict of these three forces determines the situation that has now arisen, a situation that is transitional from the first stage of the revolution to the second.\n\nThe antagonism between the first and second force is not profound, it is temporary, the result solely of the present conjuncture of circumstances, of the abrupt turn of events in the imperialist war. The whole of the new government is monarchist, for Kerensky\u2019s verbal republicanism simply   cannot be taken seriously, is not worthy of a statesman and, objectively, is political chicanery. The new government, which has not dealt the tsarist monarchy the final blow, has already begun to strike a bargain with the landlord Romanov Dynasty. The bourgeoisie of the Octobrist-Cadet type needs a monarchy to serve as the head of the bureaucracy and the army in order to protect the privileges of capital against the working people.\n\nHe who says that the workers must support the new government in the interests of the struggle against tsarist reaction (and apparently this is being said by the Potresovs, Gvozdvovs. Chkhenkelis and also, all evasiveness notwithstanding, by Chkheidze) is a traitor to the workers, a traitor to the cause of the proletariat, to the cause of peace and freedom. For actually, precisely this new government is already bound hand and foot by imperialist capital, by the imperialist policy of war and plunder, has already begun to strike bargain (without consulting the people!) with the dynasty, is already working to restore the tsarist monarchy, is already soliciting the candidature of Mikhail Romanov as the new kinglet, is already taking measures to prop up the throne, to substitute for the legitimate (lawful, ruling by virtue of the old law) monarchy a Bonapartist, plebiscite monarchy (ruling by virtue of a fraudulent plebiscite).\n\nNo, if there is to lie a real struggle against the tsarist monarchy, if freedom is to be guaranteed in fact and not merely in words, in the glib promises of Milyukov and Kerensky, the workers must not support the new government; the government must \u201csupport\u201d the workers! For the only guarantee of freedom and of the complete destruction of tsarism lies in arming the proletariat, in strengthening, extending and developing the role, significance and power of the Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies.\n\nAll the rest is mere phrase-mongering and lies, self-deception on the part of the politicians of the liberal and radical camp, fraudulent trickery.\n\nHelp, or at least do not hinder, the arming of the workers, and freedom in Russia will be invincible, the monarchy irrestorable, the republic secure.\n\nOtherwise the Guchkovs and Milyukovs will restore the monarchy and grant none, absolutely none of the \u201cliberties\u201d   they promised. All bourgeois politicians in all bourgeois revolutions \u201cfed\u201d the people and fooled the workers with promises.\n\nOurs is a bourgeois revolution, therefore, the workers must support the bourgeoisie, say the Potresovs, Gvozdyovs and Chkheidzes, as Plekhanov said yesterday.\n\nOurs is a bourgeois revolution, we Marxists say, therefore the workers must open the eyes of the people to the deception practised by the bourgeois politicians, teach them to put no faith in words, to depend entirely on their own strength, their own organisation, their own unity, and their own weapons.\n\nThe government of the Octobrists and Cadets, of the Guchkovs and Milyukovs, cannot, even if it sincerely wanted to (only infants can think that Guchkov and Lvov are sincere), cannot give the people either peace, bread, or freedom.\n\nIt cannot give peace because it is a war government, a government for the continuation of the imperialist slaughter, a government of plunder, out to plunder Armenia, Galicia and Turkey, annex Constantinople, reconquer Poland, Courland, Lithuania, etc. It is a government bound hand and foot by Anglo-French imperialist capital. Russian capital is merely a branch of the world-wide \u201cfirm\u201d which manipulates hundreds of billions of rubles and is called \u201cEngland and France\u201d.\n\nIt cannot give bread because it is a bourgeois government. At best, it can give the people \u201cbrilliantly organised famine\u201d, as Germany has done. But the people will not accept famine. They will learn, and probably very soon, that there is bread and that it can be obtained, but only by methods that do not respect the sanctity of capital and landownership.\n\nIt cannot give freedom because it is a landlord and capitalist government which fears the people and has already begun to strike a bargain with the Romanov dynasty.\n\nThe tactical problems of our immediate attitude towards this government will be dealt with in another article. In it, we shall explain the peculiarity of the present situation, which is a transition from the first stage of the revolution to the second, and why the slogan, the \u201ctask of the day\u201d, at this moment must he: Workers, you hare performed miracles of proletarian heroism, the heroism of the people, in the   civil war against tsarism. You must perform miracles of organisation, organisation of the proletariat and of the whole people, to prepare the way for your victory in the second stage of the revolution.\n\nConfining ourselves for the present to an analysis of the class struggle and the alignment of class forces at this stage of the revolution, we have still to put the question: who are the proletariat\u2019s allies in this revolution?\n\nIt has two allies: first, the broad mass of the semi-proletarian and partly also of the small-peasant population, who number scores of millions and constitute the overwhelming majority of the population of Russia. For this mass peace, bread, freedom and land are essential It is inevitable that to a certain extent this mass will be under the influence of the bourgeoisie, particularly of the petty bourgeoisie, to which it is most akin in its conditions of life, vacillating between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The cruel lessons of war, and they will be the more cruel the more vigorously the war is prosecuted by Guchkov, Lvov, Milyukov and Co., will inevitably push this mass towards the proletariat, compel it to follow the proletariat. We must now take advantage of the relative freedom of the new order and of the Soviets of Workers\u2019 Deputies to enlighten and organise this mass first of all and above all. Soviets of Peasants\u2019 Deputies and Soviets of Agricultural Workers\u2014that is one of our most urgent tasks. In this connection we shall strive not only for the agricultural workers to establish their own separate Soviets, but also for the propertyless and poorest peasants to organise separately from the well-to-do peasants. The special tasks and special forms of organisation urgently needed at the present time will be dealt with in the next letter.\n\nSecond, the ally of the Russian proletariat is the proletariat of all the belligerent countries and of all countries in general. At present this ally is to a large degree repressed by the war, and all too often the European social-chauvinists speak in its name\u2014men who, like Plekhanov, Gvozdyov and Potresov in Russia, have deserted to the bourgeoisie. But the liberation of the proletariat from their influence has progressed with every month of the imperialist war, and the Russian revolution will inevitably immensely hasten this process.\n\nWith these two allies, the proletariat, utilising the peculiarities of the present transition situation, can and will proceed, first, to the achievement of a democratic republic and complete victory of the peasantry over the landlords, instead of the Guchkov-Milyukov semi-monarchy, and then to socialism, which alone can give the war-weary people peace, bread and freedom.\n\nN. Lenin ) All landed estates and privately-owned lands, as well as crown and church lands, etc., are to be turned over immediately to the people without any compensation.\n\n) The peasantry must in an organised manner, through their Soviets of Peasants\u2019 Deputies, immediately take over all the land in their localities for the purpose of its economic exploitation, without however in any way prejudicing thereby the final establishment of land regulations by the Constituent Assembly or by the All-Russia Council of Soviets, should the people decide to vest the central power of the state in such a Council of Soviets.\n\n) Private property in land must be abolished altogether, i.e., all the land shall belong only to the nation as a whole, and its disposal shall be placed in the hands of the local democratic institutions.\n\n) The peasants must reject the advice of the capitalists and landowners and their Provisional Government to come to \u201can agreement\u201d with the local landowners on the immediate disposal of the land; the disposal of all the land must be governed by the organised decision of the majority of the local peasants, and not by an agreement between the majority, i.e., the peasants, and the minority, and an insignificant minority at that, i.e., the landowners.\n\n) Not only the landowners are fighting and will continue to fight as hard as they can against the transfer of all landed estates to the peasants without compensation, but also the capitalists, who wield great power both because of their money and because of their influence on the as yet unenlightened   masses through the newspapers and the numerous officials, employees, etc., who are accustomed to the domination of capital. Hence, the transfer of all the landed estates to the peasantry without compensation cannot be carried through on a complete and secure basis unless the confidence of the peasant masses in the capitalists Is destroyed, unless a close alliance is established between the peasantry and the urban workers, and unless state power is taken over completely by the Soviets of Workers\u2019, Soldiers\u2019, Peasants\u2019, and other Deputies. Only state power wielded by such Soviets and administering the state not through a police, or a bureaucracy, or a standing army isolated from the people, but through a nation-wide, universal and armed militia of the workers and peasants, can guarantee the realisation of the above-mentioned agrarian reforms, which are being demanded by the entire peasantry.\n\n) Agricultural labourers and poor peasants, i.e., those who, because of the lack of sufficient land, cattle, and implements, earn a living partly by working for hire, must strive their hardest to organise themselves independently into separate Soviets, or into separate groups within the general peasants\u2019 Soviets, in order to protect their interests against the rich peasants, who inevitably strive towards an alliance with the capitalists and landowners.\n\n) As a result of the war, Russia, like all other belligerent and many neutral (non-belligerent) countries, is facing an economic debacle, disaster and famine owing to the shortage of workers, coal, iron, etc. The only way to save the country is by the workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 deputies assuming control and management of the entire production and distribution of goods. It is therefore necessary to proceed immediately to arrange agreements between Soviets of Peasants\u2019 Deputies and Soviets of Workers\u2019 Deputies on the exchange of grain and other rural products for implements, footwear, clothing, etc., without the medium of the capitalists, who must be removed from the management of the factories. With the same purpose in view, the peasant committees must be encouraged to take over the livestock and implements of the landowners, such livestock and implements to be used in common. Similarly, the conversion of all large landed estates into model farms must be encouraged, the   land to be cultivated collectively with the aid of the best implements under the \u2019direction of agricultural experts and in accordance with the decision of the local Soviets of Agricultural Labourers\u2019 Deputies.\nComrades, the resolution that I am privileged to present to you in the name of the Social-Democratic group of the Peasants\u2019 Soviet has been printed and distributed to the delegates. If any delegates have not received it we shall have more copies printed tomorrow for distribution to all who wish to have them.\n\nIn a short report I can, of course, deal only with the main, basic questions, those that are of greatest interest to the peasantry and the working class. To those interested in the question in greater detail, I can recommend the resolution of our Party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks), published as a Supplement to Soldatskaya Pravda No. , and repeatedly dealt with in our newspaper Pravda.[] At the moment I shall have to confine myself to elucidating the more important points of my resolution and of our Party programme on the agrarian question that are most controversial or give rise to misunderstanding. One of the first of these debatable points is that touched upon yesterday or the day before in the Chief Land Committee[] at the session you have probably heard about or read about in the newspapers of yesterday or the day before. That session of the Chief Land Committee was attended by a representative of our Party, Comrade Smilga, a colleague of mine on   the Central Committee. He proposed to the session that the Chief Land Committee should express itself in favour of the immediate organised seizure by the peasants of the landed estates, but a number of violent objections were raised to Comrade Smilga\u2019s proposal. (Voice: \u201cHere, too.\u201d) I am now told that a number of comrades here will also speak against that proposal. All the more reason for my clarifying that point in our programme, because I believe that most of the objections against our programme are based on a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of our views.\n\nWhat do all our Party resolutions, all the articles in our newspaper Pravda say? We say that all the land, without exception, must become the property of the whole nation. We have come to this conclusion after having studied, in particular, the peasant movement of  and the statements made by peasant deputies to the First and Second Dumas, where many peasant deputies from all over Russia were able to speak with relative\u2014relative, of course\u2014freedom.\n\nAll the land must be the property of the whole nation. From this it follows that in advocating the immediate transfer, without payment, of the landed estates to the local peasants we do not by any means advocate the seizure of those estates as private property, we do not by any means advocate the division of those estates. We believe the land should be taken by the local peasantry for one sowing in accordance with a decision adopted by the majority of local peasant deputies. We do not by any means advocate the transfer of this land as private property to those peasants who are now taking it for one sowing. All objections of this kind to our proposal that I am constantly hearing and reading in the columns of the capitalist newspapers are based on a sheer misinterpretation of our views. Since we have said\u2014and I repeat: we have said that in all our resolutions\u2014that the land must be the property of the whole nation and must be taken over by it without payment\u2014it is obvious that arrangements for the final disposal of the land, the final establishment of land regulations must be made only by a central state power, that is, by a Constituent Assembly or an All-Russia Council of Soviets, should the masses of peas ants and workers establish such state power as a Council   of Soviets. On this score there are no differences of opinion.\n\nThe differences begin after this, when we are told: \u201cIf that is so, then any immediate uncompensated transfer of the landed estates to the peasantry would be an unauthorised act.\u201d That is the view that was expressed most exactly, most authoritatively and most weightily by Minister of Agriculture Shingaryov in his well-known telegram; we consider this view to be fallacious, unfair, most prejudicial to the peasantry, prejudicial to the farmers, and the least likely to ensure the country a supply of grain. Allow me to read that telegram to show you what we mostly object to.\n\n\u201cAn independent solution of the land question in the absence of a general state law is inadmissible. Arbitrary action will lead to a national calamity ... the lawful solution of the land question is the business of the Constituent Assembly. At the present time agricultural conciliation chambers have been set up by the tillers of the land and the landowners in each local area under the rural supply committees.\u201d\n\nThis is the chief passage from the government\u2019s statement on this question. If you acquaint yourselves with the resolution of the Chief Land Committee on this question adopted yesterday or the day before, and the resolution adopted, also the other day, at a private meeting of Duma deputies, you will see that the two resolutions proceed from the same viewpoint. The peasants who want land handed over immediately to the peasants without payment and distributed by local peasant committees are accused of unauthorised acts on the assumption that only a voluntary agreement between peasants and landowners, between the tillers and the owners of the land, would be in accordance with the needs and interests of the state. That is what we deny, that is what we dispute.\n\nLet us examine the objections raised to our proposal.\n\nThe usual objections are that the land in Russia is distributed very unevenly, both between individual small units such as villages and volosts and between the bigger units such as gubernias and regions. It is said that if the local population were to take over the land by a majority decision against the will of the landowners and without payment at that, the unevenness would remain and there would even be a danger of it becoming perpetuated. We say in reply that this argument   is based on a misunderstanding. The uneven distribution will remain in any case until the Constituent Assembly or some other central state power finally establishes a new system. Until such a system is established the uneven distribution will remain whether the question is settled in the peas ant\u2019s or in the landowner\u2019s way, whether in our way, with the immediate transfer of the land to the peasants, or in the way of the landowners, who are prepared to lease their land out at a high rent provided the tenant farmer and the landowner each retains his own rights. This objection is obviously incorrect and unjust. We say that a central state power must be established as quickly as possible, one that not only relies on the will and the decision of the peas ant majority, but also directly expresses the opinion of that majority. There are no differences on this score. When we hear objections to the Bolsheviks, attacks levelled against us in the capitalist newspapers accusing us of being anarchists, we repudiate such accusations most emphatically and regard them as an attempt to spread malicious lies and slander.\n\nAnarchists are those who deny the need for a state power, whereas we say that a state power is absolutely necessary, not only for Russia today but for any state, even one that goes over directly to socialism. Without doubt the firmest possible authority is necessary. All we want is for that power to be wholly and exclusively in the hands of the majority of workers\u2019, soldiers\u2019, and peasants\u2019 deputies. That is where we differ from other parties. By no means do we deny the need for a firm state power; we only say that all landed estates must pass into the hands of the peasants without payment, in accordance with a decision of the local peasant committee adopted by the majority, and on the condition that no damage is done to property. This is stated most explicitly in our resolution. We emphatically reject any allegation that our view implies an arbitrary act.\n\nIn our opinion, on the contrary, if the landowners keep back the land for their own use or charge money for it, that is an arbitrary act, but if the majority of peasants say that the landed estates must not remain in the hands of their owners, and that the peasantry has known nothing but oppression by those landowners for decades, for centuries, that is not   arbitrary, that is the restitution of justice, and we cannot put off that restitution. If the land is transferred to the peas ants immediately the unevenness among the regions cannot be eliminated, that is indisputable; but nobody can eliminate that unevenness until the Constituent Assembly meets. If you were to ask Shingaryov today\u2014that same Shingaryov who raises objections to us and reviles the champions of our views in official papers for \u201carbitrary action\u201d\u2014if you were to ask him what he proposes to do about that unevenness, he would be unable to answer you. He does not and cannot propose anything.\n\nHe speaks about \u201cvoluntary agreement between peasants and landowners\u201d. What does that mean? I will cite two basic figures on landownership in European Russia. These figures show that at one end of the Russian village there are the most wealthy landowners, among them the Romanovs, the richest and the worst of landowners, and at the other end are the extremely poor peasants. I am citing two figures to show you the significance of the sermon preached by Shingaryov and all landowners and capitalists. These are the two figures: if we take the richest landowners of European Russia, we shall see that the biggest of them, numbering less than ,, own about ,, dessiatines of land. That works out at over , dessiatines each. If you take the upper crust of rich Russian landowners, irrespective of what social estate they belong to (most of them are nobles, but there are other landowners as well), you find that there are , of them and they own ,, dessiatines! And if you take the poor peasants according to the same  Census, which is the latest available information gathered uniformly throughout Russia\u2014information, which, like all statistics gathered in tsarist times by tsarist civil servants, is none too trustworthy, although it does give some approximation of the truth, some data can be compared\u2014if you take the poor peasantry you get ,, households owning from ,, to ,, dessiatines of land. This means that one person has over , dessiatines and the other seven and a half dessiatines per household! And they say the peasants are guilty of arbitrary acts if they do not enter into a voluntary agreement. What is meant by \u201cvoluntary agreement\u201d? It means that the landowners may perhaps let   you have land for a good rent but will not give it up to any body without payment. Is that just? Of course it is not. Is that profitable to the peasant population? Of course it is not. The form in which landed property will ultimately be established is for the future central state authority to decide, but at the present time the landed estates must be immediately transferred to the peasantry without compensation, provided the seizure is organised. Minister Chernov, opposing my colleague Smilga in the Chief Land Committee, said that the two words \u201corganised seizure\u201d are a contradiction in terms; if it\u2019s a seizure, then it is unorganised, and if it\u2019s organised, then it is not a seizure. I do not think this criticism is correct. I think that if the peasantry make a majority decision in any village or volost, any uyezd or gubernia\u2014in some gubernias, if not all, the peasant congresses have set up local authorities representing the interests and will of the majority, the will of the population, i.e., of the majority of the tillers of the soil\u2014once these authorities are set up in the localities the decision they make will be the decision of authorities recognised by the peas ants. The local peasantry are certain to respect these authorities, for there is no doubt that these freely elected authorities will decide that the landed estates must immediately pass into the hands of the peasants. Let the peasant know that he is taking the estate of the landowner, and if he pays anything, let him pay it into a local peasant fund, and let him know that the money will go towards farm improvements, paving and road building, etc. Let him know that the land he is taking is not his land, nor is it the land owner\u2019s, but the common property of the people, which the Constituent Assembly will, in the end, dispose of. For this reason the landowners must have no right to the land from the very beginning of the revolution, from the moment the first land committee was set up, and no payment should be required for it.\n\nThe basic difference between ourselves and our-opponents is in our respective understanding of what order is and what law is. Up to now law and order have been regarded as things that suited the landowners and bureaucrats, but we maintain that law and order are things that suit the majority of the peasantry. Until there is an All-Russia Council of Soviets,   until there is a Constituent Assembly, local authority\u2014uyezd and gubernia committees\u2014constitutes the supreme law and order! We call it lawlessness when one landowner, on the basis of ancient rights, demands a \u201cvoluntary\u201d agreement with three hundred peasant families who have an average of seven and a half dessiatines of land each! We say: \u201cLet a decision be taken by the majority; we want the peasants to obtain the landed estates now, without losing a single month, a single week or even a single day.\u201d\n\nWe are told: \u201cIf the peasants seize the land now, It is the richer peasants who will get it, those who have animals, implements, etc.; would this, therefore, not be dangerous from the point of view of the poor peasants?\u201d Comrades, I must dwell on this argument, because our Party, in all our decisions, programmes and appeals to the people, declares: \u201cWe are the party of wage-workers and poor peasants; it is their interests we are out to protect; it is through them, and through them alone, through those classes, that mankind can escape the horrors into which the capitalists\u2019 war has plunged it.\u201d\n\nTo objections like these, claiming that our decisions are contrary to the interests of the poor peasants, we pay careful attention and invite a most careful study of them because they touch the very heart of the matter, the very root of the problem. And the heart of the matter Is this: how can the interests of the wage-workers, both urban and rural, and the interests of the poor peasants be protected in the revolution, in the transformation of the political system, that is now taking place in Russia, how can and should their interests be protected against those of the landowners or rich peasants who are also capitalists? That, of course, is the crux of the matter, the nub of the whole problem. But we are told that if we advise the peasants to seize the land immediately, it is those who have implements and animals who will mostly do the seizing and the poor will be left out of the picture. And now I ask you\u2014will a voluntary agreement with the landowners help?\n\nYou know very well that the landowners are not anxious to rent out land to those peasants who have not got a kopek in their pockets, but, on the contrary, resort to \u201cvoluntary\u201d agreements where they are promised substantial payment.   Up to now the landowners do not seem to have been giving their land away for nothing\u2014at least nobody in Russia ever noticed it.\n\nTo speak of voluntary agreements with the landowners means greatly increasing and consolidating the privileged, preferential position and the advantages enjoyed by the rich peasant, because the rich peasant can certainly pay the land owner and every landowner regards him as a person who is good for his money. The landowner knows that the rich peasant can pay and that he can be sued for the money, so that the rich peasant has more to gain by such \u201cvoluntary\u201d deals with the landowners than the poor peasant. If there is any possibility of helping the poor peasant straight away, it is by a measure such as I propose\u2014the land must go to the peasants immediately and without payment.\n\nLanded estates always have been and will be a flagrant injustice. The free tenure of that land by the peasants, if the tenure is in accordance with the will of the majority, \u2019will not be an arbitrary act but a restitution of justice. That is our point of view, and that is why we consider the argument that the poor peasantry would lose by it to be a great injustice. The agreement is called \u201cvoluntary\u201d\u2014only Shingaryov could call it that\u2014when one landowner has , dessiatines and  peasants have an average of seven and a half per family. To call such an agreement voluntary is sheer mockery of the peasants. For the peasant it is not a voluntary agreement, but a compulsory one, and will be such until every volost, gubernia or uyezd peasant Soviet or the All-Russia Council of Soviets declares that the landed estates are a gross injustice and that they must be abolished without losing a single hour, a single minute.\n\nThe land must be the property of the entire people, and must be declared such by a central state power. Until that power is established, the local authorities, I again repeat, should take over the landed estates and should do so In an organised manner according to the will of the majority. It. Is not true, as the newspapers assert, that disorder reigns in Russia! It isn\u2019t true\u2014there is greater order in the country side than ever before, because majority decisions are being   made; there have been scarcely any acts of violence against tile landowners; unfair treatment of the landowners has occurred only in isolated cases; they are insignificant and in Russia as a whole are not more in number than those which formerly occurred.\n\nNow I want to mention another argument that I have heard and had occasion to deal with in our newspaper Pravda in connection with the immediate transfer of the land to the peasantry.[]\n\nThe argument is this: It we advise the peasants to take over the landed estates immediately and without payment, this will cause discontent, annoyance and anxiety and perhaps even indignation among the soldiers at the front who may say, \u201cIf the peasants take the land now and we have to stay at the front, we shall be left without land.\u201d Perhaps the soldiers would all leave the front and chaos and anarchy would result. But in answer to this we say that this objection has nothing to do with the real issue; whether the land is taken for payment, by agreement with the landowners, or by a decision of the majority of the peasantry, in either case the soldiers will remain at the front and will certainly remain there as long as the war lasts and will not be able to return to their villages. Why should the soldiers at the front not be anxious about the landowners imposing unfavourable terms in the form of a voluntary agreement, why should they be anxious about the peasants making a majority decision against the landowners? Why should the soldier at the front place his trust in the landowner, in a \u201cvoluntary\u201d agreement with the landowner? I can understand the political parties of the landowners and capitalists talking like this, but I do not believe that the Russian soldier at the front sees it that way. If there is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d agreement with the landowner, tile soldier will not call it good order, will not place his trust in it, or is more likely to see in it a continuation of the old disorder that existed under the landowners.\n\nIf the soldier is told that the land is being taken over by the people, that the local peasants are renting land and   paying rent, not to the landowner but to their own committee for the common good, for those very soldiers at the front, and not for the landowner, he is more likely to have faith in this. If this is a majority decision, the soldier at the front will know that there cannot be any \u201cvoluntary\u201d agreements with landowners, that the landowners are also citizens with equal rights whom nobody wishes to wrong; the land belongs to the entire nation, consequently it belongs also to the landowner, not as a privilege of the nobility, but in the same way as it belongs to any other citizen. From the day the power of the tsar was overthrown\u2014a tsar who was the biggest landowner and oppressor of the masses\u2014there must be no privileges for the landowners. With the establishment of liberty, the power of the landowners must be considered overthrown once and for all. The soldier at the front does not stand to lose anything from this point of view; on the contrary, he will have much greater faith in the state authorities, he will not worry about his household or about his family being treated unjustly or being neglected.\n\nThere remains one other objection that has been raised to our proposal. This argument is that if the peasants were to seize the landed estates immediately, such immediate, poorly prepared seizure might lead to a deterioration in the tilling and sowing of the land. I must say that a government of the majority, a central state power, has not yet been established, the peasants have not yet acquired sufficient confidence in themselves and have not lost their trust in the landowners and capitalists; I believe that we are drawing closer to this day by day, that the peasantry are day by day losing their confidence in the old state power and realising that only the peasants\u2019, soldiers\u2019, workers\u2019 and other elected deputies and nobody else can constitute the government in Russia; I believe that every passing day brings us closer to this, not because any political party has advised it\u2014millions of people will never listen to the advice of parties if that advice does not fall in with their own experience. We are rapidly approaching the time when there will be no other state power in Russia except the power of the representatives of the peasants and workers. When I am told that the immediate seizure of the land is likely to lead to   its being poorly cultivated, that the sowing will be poor, I must say that our peasants cultivate the land very poorly because of their downtrodden condition, because of centuries of oppression by the landowners. There is, of course, a fearful crisis in Russia, a crisis that has hit her as it has other belligerent countries, and Russia can only weather it by better cultivation of the land and the greatest economy of manpower. But today, at the time of the first sowing of crops, can anything be changed by \u201cvoluntary\u201d agreements with the landowners? Are we to understand that the land owners will better look after the cultivation of the soil, that the peasants will sow worse if they know they are sowing land which is the property of the whole people and not of the landowner? If they pay rent into their own peasant funds and not to the landowner? This is such nonsense that I am astonished to hear such arguments; it is absolutely unbelievable and is nothing but a ruse on the part of the landowners.\n\nThe landowners realise that they can no longer rule by means of the big stick; they realise that very well, and are adopting a form of rule that is new to Russia but which has existed for a long time in Western Europe, in the West-European countries. Two revolutions in Russia have shown that the rule of the stick is no longer possible, and in the West-European countries dozens of revolutions have demonstrated it. Those revolutions have taught the landowners and capitalists a lesson; they have taught them that they have to rule the people by deception, by flattery; that they have to adapt themselves, wear a red badge on their jackets, and, sharks though they are, declare: \u201cWe are revolutionary democrats, please wait a bit and we\u2019ll do everything for you.\u201d The argument that the peasants will make a worse job of the sowing now if they sow land which no longer belongs to the landowners but is national property, is simply making fun of the peasants, it is an attempt to maintain rule over them by means of deception.\n\nI repeat\u2014there must be no landed proprietorship at all; tenure is not proprietorship, tenure is a temporary measure and it changes from year to year. The peasant who rents a plot of land does not dare regard the land as his own. The land is not his nor the landowner\u2019s, it belongs to the people.   I repeat that this cannot make the sowing of crops this year, this spring, any worse. That assumption is so monstrous and improbable that there is only one thing for me to say\u2014beware of the landowners, do not trust them, do not be taken in by fair words and promises. It must be remembered that a decision made by a majority of peasants, who are careful enough in making decisions, is a lawful decision of state significance. In this respect the peasants are to be relied upon. I have, for example, a decision passed by Penza peasants which is worded throughout with extraordinary caution; the peasants are not planning any immediate changes for the whole of Russia, but they do not want to place them selves in intolerable bondage, and in this they are right. The greatest bondage was that of the peasant to the landowner, and such it remains, bondage to the landowners and oppressors. The abolition of that bondage, therefore, must not be put off for a single week, even a single hour; but every seizure must be an organised seizure, not to make property of the seized land, not to divide it up, but to use it in common, as the property of the \u2019whole people.\n\nI could finish with this question of the seizure of land by answering that the objections against our proposal are based on deception when they come from the landowners and capitalists, and on misunderstanding, on a too credulous belief in what the landowners and capitalists say untruthfully against us when they come from those who are neither land owners nor capitalists but people who have the interests of the working people at heart. If you examine our arguments you will see that the just demand that the landed estates be abolished immediately and similarly that property in land belong to the people cannot be put into effect until a central government is established, but what we do advise, and urge most insistently, is that the peasants themselves, right on the spots in the localities, take over the land so as to avoid any breach of good order. We offer this advice in our resolutions, but perhaps it is superfluous, since the peasants are doing this without our advice.\n\nI shall pass to the second question, the one to which the greatest attention should be drawn, the question of what we think should be done with the land in the best interests of the masses when it becomes the property of the whole people,   when private property is abolished. That time is close at hand in Russia. In fact, the landowners\u2019 power, if not destroyed, has been undermined. When all the peasants are in possession of the land, when there are no landowners, how are we to distribute the land? It seems to me that we must have some sort of common, basic view on this question, be cause, obviously, local arrangements will always be made by the peasantry. It cannot be otherwise in a democratic state; this is so obvious that there is no need even to talk about it. But in answer to the question of what must be done to secure the land for the working people, we say: \u201cWe want to protect the interests of the wage-workers and poor peasants.\u201d Our Russian Social-Democratic Party of Bolsheviks regards this as its duty. We ask ourselves: If we say that the land will belong to the nation is that the same as saying the land will belong to the working people? Our answer is: No, it is not the same thing! By saying that the land will belong to the nation, we mean that landed property will be abolished; we mean that all the land will belong to the whole people; we mean that anyone who uses land will rent it from the nation. If such an arrangement is made no differences in land tenure will remain, all the land will be alike, and, as the peasants often say, \u201cAll the old bounds and barriers will fall away, the land will be unfenced\u2014there will be free soil, and free labour.\u201d\n\nDoes that mean that the land will be handed over to all working people? No, it does not. Free labour on free soil means that all the old forms of land tenure will be abolished and there will be no other form of ownership than national ownership; everyone rents land from the state; there is a single state authority, that of all the workers and peasants; a peas ant can rent land from it as a leaseholder; between the peasant and the state there are no middlemen; the terms on which land is rented are equal for all; that is free labour on free soil.\n\nDoes that mean that the land will be handed over to all the working people? No, it does not. You cannot eat land, and to farm it you need implements, animals, equipment, and money; without money, without implements, you cannot farm. And so, when you set up a system of free labour on free soil, there will be no landed estates, no categories on   the land.[] There will be only land which is national property and free tenants renting land from the state. When you set up this system it will not mean the transfer of the land to all the working people, it will merely mean that every farmer will freely dispose of his land; anybody who wants land will be free to rent it from the state. That will be a big step forward compared with the Russia of the tsars and landowners, It will be a big step forward because Russia of the tsars and landowners was a country in which ,, dessiatines were given over to , Markovs, Romanovs and other such landowners; it will be a Russia in which there will be free labour on free soil. This has already been done in many places. Already now Russia is ahead of the Russia of the tsars and landowners, but this is not a transfer of land to the working people, it is the transfer of land to the farmer, because if the land belongs to the state, and those people take it who want to farm it, that is not enough; it is not enough to want to farm, the ability to farm is also needed, and even ability is not enough. Any farm labourer or day-labourer has that ability, but he does not have sufficient animals, implements, and capital, so that no matter how many decisions are taken, no matter how much we talk about it, we shall not establish free labour on free soil in that way. Even if we were to hang up notices about free soil in every volost administration, it would not improve matters as far as the working people are concerned, any more than the prisons in West-European republics would cease to be prisons because they had the words \u201cLiberty, Equality and Fraternity\u201d inscribed on them. If the words \u201cLiberty, Equality and Fraternity\u201d are written on a factory, as in America, the factory does not thereby cease to be a hell for the workers and a paradise for the capitalists.\n\nAnd so we have to think of what to do further, how to ensure that there should not be merely free labour\u2014that is a step forward, but it is still not a step towards protecting the interests of the working people; it is a step towards liberation from the landowner sharks, from exploitation by the landowners, liberation from the Markovs, from the police, etc., but it is not a step towards protecting the interests of the working people, because the poor, propertyless peasant cannot do anything with the land without animals,   implements, and capital. That is why I am very sceptical about the two so-called norms or standards of land tenure, the labour standard and the subsistence standard. I know that arguments about these two norms and explanations of them are always to be met with in the Narodnik parties. I know that those parties hold the view that these two norms, these two standards, must be established\u2014the labour standard is the largest amount of land a family can till; the subsistence standard is one just sufficient to feed the family, less would mean hunger. I have said that I am very sceptical about this question of standards or norms and I believe it is a bureaucrat\u2019s plan that will not do any good; it can\u2019t be put into practice even if it were decided upon here. That is the crux of the whole matter! That plan cannot relieve the position of the hired labourers and poor peasants to any appreciable extent, and even if you accept it, it will remain on paper so long as capitalism dominates. That plan does not help us find the true road for the transition from capitalism to socialism.\n\nWhen people speak of these two norms, these two standards, they imagine that only two things exist\u2014the land and the citizen, as if there had never been anything else in the world. If that were so, the plan would be a good one. But that is not so\u2014there exists the power of capital, the power of money; without money there cannot be any farming on the freest land, no matter what \u201cstandards\u201d of it you have, because as long as money remains wage-labour \u2019will remain. And this means that the rich peasants\u2014and there are no less than a million families of them in Russia\u2014are oppressing and exploiting hired labourers, and will continue to oppress them on the \u201cfree\u201d soil. Those rich peasants constantly, not by way of exception but as a general rule, resort to the hiring of workers by the year, by the season and by the day, that is, they resort to the exploitation of the poor peasants, the proletarians. Alongside this you have millions and millions of peasants who have no horses and cannot exist without selling their labour-power, without doing seasonal work for somebody else, etc. As long as the power of money, the power of capital, remains, no matter what \u201cstandards\u201d of land tenure you establish they will at best be useless in practice because they do not take into consideration the chief factor\u2014that   property in Implements, animals, and money is distributed unevenly; they do not take into consideration the existence of the hired labour that is exploited. That is a basic fact in the present-day life of Russia, and there is no getting away from it; but if we establish any kind of \u201cstandards\u201d, life will bypass them and they will remain on paper. To protect the interests of the propertyless, poor peasants in this great transformation of Russia in which you are now engaged and which you will undoubtedly carry through, when private property in land will be abolished and a step forward will have been made towards the better, socialist future; to protect the interests of the workers and poor peasants in this great work of transformation that you are only just beginning, which will go a long way forward and which, it may be said without exaggeration, will undoubtedly be brought to completion in Russia because there is no power that can stop it, we must not take the road of establishing norms or standards, but must find some other way.\n\nI and my Party comrades, in whose name I have the honour to speak, know of only two ways of protecting the interests of agricultural labourers and poor peasants, and we recommend these two ways to the Peasants\u2019 Soviet for its attention.\n\nThe first way is to organise the agricultural labourers and poor peasants. We should like, and we advise it, to have in each peasant committee, in each volost, uyezd and gubernia, a separate group of agricultural labourers and poor peasants who will have to ask themselves: \u201cIf the land becomes the property of the whole people tomorrow\u2014and it certainly will, because the people want it to\u2014then where do we come in? Where shall we, who have no animals or implements, got them from? How are we to farm the land? How must we protect our interests? How are we to make sure that the land, which will belong to the whole people, which will really be the property of the nation, should not fall only into the hands of proprietors? If it falls into the hands of those who own enough animals and implements, shall we gain anything by it? Is that what we made this great revolution for? Is that what we wanted?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpeople\u201d will have the land, but that is not enough to protect the interests of agricultural labourers. It is not   a matter of us here, from above, or the peasant committee, establishing a \u201cstandard\u201d of land to be held by individuals. Such measures will not help as long as capital is dominant, and they will not offer deliverance from the domination of capitalism. There is only one way to escape the yoke of capitalism and ensure that the people\u2019s land goes to the working people, and that is by organising the agricultural labourers, who will be guided by their experience, their observations and their distrust of what the village sharks tell them, even though these sharks wear red rosettes in their buttonholes and call themselves \u201crevolutionary democrats\u201d.\n\nThe poor peasants can only be taught by independent organisation in the localities, they can only learn from their own experience. That experience will not be easy, we cannot and do not promise them a land flowing with milk and honey. The landowners will be thrown out because the people wish it, but capitalism will remain. It is much more difficult to do away with capitalism, and the road to its overthrow is a different one. It is the road of independent, separate organisation of the agricultural labourers and the poor peasants. And that is what our Party proposes in the first instance.\n\nOnly this road promises a gradual, difficult, but real and certain transfer of the land to the working people.\n\nThe second stop which our Party recommends is that every big economy, for example, every big landed estate, of which there are , in Russia, should be organised as soon as possible into a model farm for the common cultivation of the land jointly by agricultural labourers and scientifically trained agronomists, using the animals, implements, etc., of the landowner for that purpose. \u2019Without this common cultivation under the direction of the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers the land will not go entirely to the working people. To be sure, joint cultivation is a difficult business and it would be madness of course for anybody to imagine that joint cultivation of the land can be decreed from above and imposed on people, because the centuries-old habit of farming on one s own cannot suddenly disappear, and because money will be needed for it and adaptation to the new mode of life. If this advice, this view, on the common cultivation of the land with commonly owned animals and implements to be used to the best purpose jointly with agronomists\u2014if this advice were the invention of individual political parties, the case would be a bad one, because changes are not made in the life of a people on the advice of a party, because tens of millions of people do not make a revolution on the advice of a party, and such a change would be much more of a revolution than the overthrow of the weak-minded Nicholas Romanov. I repeat, tens of millions of people will not make a revolution to order, but will do so when driven to it by dire need, when their position is an impossible one, when the joint pressure and determination of tens of millions of people break down the old barriers and are actually capable of creating a new way of life. When we advise such a measure, and advise caution in the handling of it, saying that it is becoming necessary, we are not drawing that conclusion from our programme, from our socialist doctrine alone, but because we, as socialists, have come to this conclusion by studying the life of the West-European nations. We know that there have been many revolutions over there and that they have established democratic republics; we know that in America in  the slave-owners were defeated and hundreds of millions of dessiatines of land were distributed among the peasantry for nothing or next to nothing, and nevertheless capitalism dominates there more than anywhere else and oppresses the mass of the working people as badly as, if not worse than, in other countries. This is the socialist teaching, this is our study of other nations that firmly convinces us that without the common cultivation of the land by agricultural labourers using the best machinery and guided by scientifically trained agronomists there is no escape from the yoke of capitalism. But if we were to be guided only by the experience of the West-European countries it would be very bad for Russia, because the Russian people in the mass are only capable of taking a serious step along that new path when the direst need arises. And we say to you: the time has now come when that dire need for the entire Russian people is knocking at the door. The dire need I speak of is precisely this\u2014we cannot continue farming in the old way. If we continue as before on our small isolated farms, albeit as free citizens on free soil, we are still faced with imminent   ruin, for the debacle is drawing nearer day by day, hour by hour. Everyone is talking about it; it is a grim fact, due not to the malice of individuals but to the world war of conquest, to capitalism.\n\nThe war has exterminated millions of people, has drenched the world in blood, brought it to the brink of disaster. This is no exaggeration, nobody can vouch for what will happen tomorrow; everyone is talking about it. Take the newspaper Izvestia of the Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies\u2014everybody there is saying that the capitalists are resorting to slow-down tactics and lockouts. That means there is no work and the capitalists are laying off large numbers of workers. That is what this criminal war has brought all countries to, and not Russia alone.\n\nThat is why we say that farming on individual plots, even if it is \u201cfree labour on free soil\u201d, is no way out of the dreadful crisis, it offers no deliverance from the general ruin. A universal labour service is necessary, the greatest economy of manpower is necessary, an exceptionally strong and firm authority is necessary, an authority capable of effecting that universal labour service; it cannot be done by officials, it can be done only by the Soviets of Workers\u2019, Soldiers\u2019, and Peasants\u2019 Deputies, because they are the people, they are the masses, because they are not a government of officials, because they, knowing the life of the peasant from top to bottom, can organise labour conscription, can organise that protection of human labour that would not permit the squandering of the peasant\u2019s labour, and the transition to common cultivation would, under these circumstances, be carried out gradually and with circumspection. It is a difficult business, but ii; is necessary to go over to common cultivation on big model farms; if that is not done it will be impossible for Russia to find a way out of the debacle, out of the truly desperate situation in which she finds herself, and it would be the greatest mistake to think that such a gigantic transformation in the life of the people can be made at a single stroke. That cannot be done, it requires the greatest labour effort, it requires concentration, determination and energy on the part of each peasant and worker at his own place, at his own particular job, which he knows and has been working at for years. It is not a thing that can   be done by any sort of decree, but it is a thing that must be done, because this war of conquest has brought all mankind to the brink of destruction; tens of millions of lives have been lost, and still more will be lost in this terrible war unless we strain our efforts, unless all organisations of the Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Deputies take joint and determined action towards the common cultivation of the soil without the capitalists and without the landowners. That path is the only one that will lead to the real transfer of the land to the working people. Comrades, in the brief time at my disposal, I can dwell\u2014and I think this best\u2014only on the main questions of principle raised by the Executive Committee rapporteur and by subsequent speakers.\n\nThe first and fundamental issue before us was: what is this assembly we are attending, what are these Soviets now gathered at the All-Russia Congress, and what is this revolutionary democracy that people here speak so much about to conceal their utter misunderstanding and complete repudiation of it? To talk about revolutionary democracy at the All-Russia Congress of Soviets and obscure this institution\u2019s character, its class composition and its role in the revolution\u2014not to say a word about this and yet lay claim to the title of democrats really is peculiar. They map out a programme to us for a bourgeois parliamentary republic, the sort of programme that has existed all over Western Europe; they map out a programme to us for reforms which are now recognised by all bourgeois governments, including our own, and yet they talk to us about revolutionary democracy. Whom are they talking to? To the Soviets. But I ask you, is there a country in Europe, a bourgeois, democratic, republican country, where anything like these Soviets exists? You have to admit there isn\u2019t. Nowhere is there, nor can there be, a similar institution because you must have one or the other: either a bourgeois government with \u201cplans\u201d for reforms like those just mapped out to us and proposed dozens of times in every country but remaining on paper, or the institution to which they are now referring, the new type of \u201cgovernment\u201d created by the revolution, examples of which   can be found only at a time of greatest revolutionary upsurge, as in France,  and , or in Russia, . The Soviets are an institution which does not exist in any ordinary bourgeois-parliamentary state and cannot exist side by side with a bourgeois government. They are the new, more democratic type of state which we in our Party resolutions call a peasant-proletarian democratic republic, with power belonging solely to the Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies. People are wrong in thinking that this is a theoretical issue. They are wrong in pretending that it can be evaded and in protesting that at present certain institutions exist side by side with the Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies. Yes, they do exist side by side. But this is what breeds countless misunderstandings, conflicts and friction. And this is why the original upswing, the original advance, of the Russian revolution is giving way to stagnation and to those steps backwards which we can now see in our coalition government, in its entire home and foreign policy, in connection with preparations for an imperialist offensive.\n\nOne or the other: either the usual bourgeois government, in which case the peasants\u2019, workers\u2019, soldiers\u2019 and other Soviets are useless and will either be broken up by the generals, the counter-revolutionary generals, who keep a hold on the armed forces and pay no heed to Minister Kerensky\u2019s fancy speeches, or they will die an inglorious death. They have no other choice. They can neither retreat nor stand still. They can exist only by advancing. This is a type of state not invented by the Russians but advanced by the revolution because the revolution can win in no other way. Within the All-Russia Congress, friction and the struggle of parties for power are inevitable. But this will be the elimination of possible mistakes and illusions through the political experience of the masses themselves (commotion), and not through the reports of Ministers who refer to what they said yesterday, what they will write tomorrow and what they will promise the day after tomorrow. This, comrades, is ridiculous from the point of view of the institution created by the Russian revolution and now faced with the question: to be or not to be? The Soviets cannot continue to exist as they do now. Grown people, workers and peasants, are made to meet, adopt resolutions and listen to reports that cannot   be subjected to any documentary verification! This kind of institution is a transition to a republic which will establish a stable power without a police and a standing army, not in words alone but in action, a power which cannot yet exist in Western Europe and without which the Russian revolution cannot win in the sense of victory over the landowners and over imperialism.\n\nWithout this power there can be no question of our gaining such a victory by ourselves. And the deeper we go into the programme recommended to us here, and into the facts with which we are confronted, the more glaringly the fundamental contradiction stands out. We are told by the rapporteur and by other speakers that the first Provisional Government was a bad one! But when the Bolsheviks, those wretched Bolsheviks, said, \"No support for and no confidence in this government\", how often we were accused of \u201canarchism\u201d! Now everybody says that the previous government was a bad one. But how does the coalition government with its near socialist Ministers differ from the previous one? Haven\u2019t we had enough talk about programmes and drafts? Haven\u2019t we had enough of them? Isn\u2019t it time to get down to business? A month has passed since May  when the coalition government was formed. Look at the facts, look at the ruin prevailing in Russia and other countries involved in the imperialist war. What is the reason for the ruin? The predatory nature of the capitalists. There\u2019s your real anarchy. And this is admitted in statements published, not in our newspaper, not in any Bolshevik newspaper\u2014Heaven forbid!\u2014but in the ministerial Rabochaya Gazeta which has reported that industrial coal prices were raised by the \u201crevolutionary\u201d government!! The coalition government hasn\u2019t changed a thing in this respect. We are asked whether socialism can be introduced in Russia, and whether, generally speaking, radical changes can be made at once. That is all empty talk comrades. The doctrine of Marx and Engels, as they always explained, says: \"Our doctrine is not a dogma, but a guide to action.\u201d[] Nowhere in the world is there pure capitalism developing into pure socialism, nor can there be in war-time. But there is something in between, something new and unprecedented, because hundreds of millions of people who have been involved in the criminal war among the capitalists   are losing their lives. It is not a question of promising reforms\u2014that is mere talk. It is a question of taking the step we now need.\n\nIf you want to talk of \"revolutionary\" democracy, then you must distinguish this concept from reformist democracy under a capitalist Ministry, because it is high time to stop talking about \"revolutionary democracy\", handing out mutual congratulations on \"revolutionary democracy\", and get on with a class definition, as we have been taught by Marxism, and by scientific socialism generally. It is being proposed that we should pass to reformist democracy under a capitalist Ministry. That may be all well and good from the standpoint of the usual West-European models. A number of countries, however, are today on the brink of destruction, and we can clearly see the practical measures said to be too complicated to carry out easily, and in need of special elaboration, according to the previous speaker, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. He said there was no political party in Russia expressing its readiness to assume full power. I reply: \"Yes, there is. No party can refuse this, and our Party certainly doesn\u2019t. It is ready to take over full power at any moment.\" (Applause and laughter.) You can laugh as much as you please, but if the Minister confronts us with this question side by side with a party of the Right, he will receive a suitable reply. No party can refuse this. And at a time when liberty still prevails, when threats of arrest and exile to Siberia\u2014threats from the counter-revolutionaries with whom our near socialist Ministers are sharing government\u2014are still no more than threats, every party says: give us your confidence and we shall give you our programme.\n\nThis programme was given by our conference on April .[] Unfortunately, it is being ignored and not taken as a guide. It seems to need a popular exposition. I shall try to give the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs a popular exposition of our resolution and our programme. With regard to the economic crisis, our programme is immediately\u2014it need not be put off\u2014to demand the publication of all the fabulous profits\u2014running as high as  and  per cent\u2014which the capitalists are making on war supplies, and not as capitalists in the open market under \u201cpure\u201d capitalism. This is where workers\u2019 control really is necessary and possible. This is a   measure which, if you call yourselves \u201crevolutionary\u201d democrats, you should carry out in the name of the Congress, a measure which can be carried out overnight. It is not socialism. It is opening the people\u2019s eyes to the real anarchy and the real playing with imperialism, the playing with the property of the people, with the hundreds of thousands of lives that tomorrow will be lost because we continue to throttle Greece. Make the profits of the capitalists public, arrest fifty or a hundred of the biggest millionaires. Just keep them in custody for a few weeks, if only in the same privileged conditions in which Nicholas Romanov is being held, for the simple purpose of making them reveal the hidden springs, the fraudulent practices, the filth and greed which even under the new government are costing our country thousands and millions every day. That is the chief cause of anarchy and ruin. That is why we say that everything remains as of old, that the coalition government hasn\u2019t changed a thing and has only added a heap of declarations, of pompous statements. However sincere people may be, however sincerely they may wish the working people well, things have not changed\u2014the same class remains in power. The policy they are pursuing is not a democratic policy.\n\nYou talk to us about \"democratisation of the central and local power\". Don\u2019t you know that these words are a novelty only in Russia, and that elsewhere dozens of near-socialist Ministers have given their countries similar promises? What are they worth when we are faced by the real, concrete fact that while the population elects the authorities locally, the elementary principles of democracy are violated by the centre claiming the right to appoint or confirm the local authorities? The capitalists continue to plunder the people\u2019s property. The imperialist war continues. And yet we are promised reforms, reforms and more reforms, which cannot be accomplished at all under these circumstances, because the war crushes and determines everything. Why do you disagree with those who say the war is not being waged over capitalist profits? What is the criterion? It is, first of all, which class is in power, which class continues to be the master, which class continues to make hundreds of thousands of millions from banking and financial operations. It is the same capitalist class and the war therefore continues to be   imperialist. Neither the first Provisional Government nor the government with the near-socialist Ministers has changed anything. The secret treaties remain secret. Russia is fighting for the Straits, fighting to continue Lyakhov\u2019s policy in Persia, and so on.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want this, that most of you don\u2019t want it, and that the Ministers don\u2019t want it, because no one can want it, for it means the slaughter of hundreds of millions of people. But take the offensive which the Milyukovs and Maklakovs are now talking about so much. They know full well what that means. They know it is linked with the question of power, with the question of revolution. We are told we must distinguish between political and strategic issues. It is ridiculous to raise this question at all. The Cadets perfectly understand that the point at issue is a political one.\n\nIt is slander to say the revolutionary struggle for peace that has begun from below might lead to a separate peace treaty. The first step we should take if we had power would be to arrest the biggest capitalists and cut all the threads of their intrigues. Without this, all talk about peace without annexations and indemnities is utterly meaningless. Our second step would be to declare to all people over the head of their governments that we regard all capitalists as robbers\u2014Tereshchenko, who is not a bit better than Milyukov, just a little less stupid, the French capitalists, the British capitalists, and all the rest.\n\nYour own Izvestia has got into a muddle and proposes to keep the status quo instead of peace without annexations and indemnities. Our idea of peace \"without annexations\" is different. Even the Peasant Congress comes nearer the truth when it speaks of a \u201cfederal\u201d republic, thereby expressing the idea that the Russian republic does not want to oppress any nation, either in the new or in the old way, and does not want to force any nation, either Finland or the Ukraine, with both of whom the War Minister is trying so hard to find fault and with whom impermissible and intolerable conflicts are being created. We want a single and undivided republic of Russia with a firm government. But a firm government can be secured only by the voluntary agreement of all people concerned. \"Revolutionary democracy\" are big   words, but they are being applied to a government that by its petty fault-finding is complicating the problem of the Ukraine and Finland, which do not even want to secede. They only say, \"Don\u2019t postpone the application of the elementary principles of democracy until the Constituent Assembly!\u201d\n\nA peace treaty without annexations and indemnities cannot be concluded until you have renounced your own annexations. It is ridiculous, a comedy, every worker in Europe is laughing at us, saying: You talk very eloquently and call on the people to overthrow the bankers, but you send your own bankers into the Ministry. Arrest them, expose their tricks, get to know the hidden springs! But that you don\u2019t do although you have powerful organisations which cannot be resisted. You have gone through  and . You know that revolution is not made to order, that revolutions in other countries were made by the hard and bloody method of insurrection, and in Russia there is no group, no class, that would resist the power of the Soviets. In Russia, this revolution can, by way of exception, be a peaceful one. Were this revolution to propose peace to all peoples today or tomorrow, by breaking with all the capitalist classes, both France and Germany, their people, that is, would accept very soon, because these countries are perishing, because Germany\u2019s position is hopeless, because she cannot save herself, and because France\u2014(Chairman: \"Your time is up.\")\n\nI shall finish in half a minute. (Commotion; requests from the audience that the speaker continue; protests and applause.)\n\n(Chairman: \"I inform the Congress that the Steering Committee proposes the speaker\u2019s time be extended. Any objections? The majority are in favour of an extension.\")\n\nI stopped at the point that if the revolutionary democrats in Russia were democrats in fact and not merely in words, they would further the revolution and not compromise with the capitalists, not talk about peace without annexations and indemnities but abolish annexations by Russia, and declare in so many words that they consider all annexations criminal and predatory. It would then be possible to avert the imperialist offensive which is threatening death to thousands and millions of people over the partitioning of Persia and the Balkans. The way to peace would then be open, not an easy   way\u2014we do not say it is easy\u2014and one which does not preclude a truly revolutionary war.\n\nWe do not put this question as Bazarov does in today\u2019s Novaya Zhizn.[] All we say is that Russia has been placed in such a position that at the end of the imperialist war her tasks are easier than might have been expected. And her geographical position is such that any power would have a hard job on its hands if it risked using capital and its predatory interests and risked rising against the Russian working class and the semi-proletariat associated with it, i.e., the poor peasants. Germany is on the brink of defeat, and since the war was joined by the United States, which wants to swallow up Mexico and which tomorrow will probably start fighting Japan, Germany\u2019s position has become hopeless, and she will be destroyed. France, who suffers more than the others because of her geographical position and whose state of exhaustion is reaching the limit\u2014this country, while not starving as much as Germany, has lost infinitely more people than Germany. Now if the first step were to restrict the profits of the Russian capitalists and deprive them of all possibility of raking in hundreds of millions in profits, if you were to propose to all nations a peace treaty directed against the capitalists of all countries and openly declare that you will not enter into any negotiations or relations with the German capitalists and with those who abet them directly or indirectly or are involved with them, and that you refuse to speak with the French and British capitalists, then you would be acting to condemn them in the eyes of the workers. You would not regard it as a victory that a passport has been issued to MacDonald,[] a man who has never waged a revolutionary struggle against capital and who is being allowed to come because he has never expressed the ideas, principles, practice or experience of the revolutionary struggle against the British capitalists, a struggle for which our Comrade MacLean and hundreds of other British socialists are in prison, and for which our Comrade Liebknecht is confined to a convict prison because he said, \"German soldiers, fire on your Kaiser!\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be more proper to consign the imperialist capitalists to that penal servitude which most of the Provisional Government members in an expressly reconstituted   Third Duma\u2014I don\u2019t know, incidentally, whether it is the Third or the Fourth Duma\u2014are daily preparing for us and promising us and about which the Ministry of Justice is already drafting new Bills? MacLean and Liebknecht\u2014those are the names of socialists who are putting the idea of a revolutionary struggle against imperialism into practice. That is what we must say to all governments if we want to fight for peace. We must condemn them before their people. You will then put all the imperialist governments in a difficult position. But now you have complicated your own position by addressing your Peace Manifesto of March  to the people and saying, \"Overthrow your tsars, your kings and your bankers!\" while we who possess an organisation unprecedentedly rich in number, experience and material strength, the Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies, join a bloc with our bankers, institute a coalition, near-socialist government, and draft the kind of reforms that have been drafted in Europe for decades. People there in Europe laugh at this kind of peace struggle. There they will understand it only when the Soviets take power and act in a revolutionary way.\n\nOnly one country in the world can at the moment take steps to stop the imperialist war on a class scale, in the face of the capitalists and without a bloody revolution. Only one country can do it, and that country is Russia. And she will remain the only one as long as the Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies exists. The Soviet cannot exist long side by side with the ordinary type of Provisional Government, and will remain what it is only until the offensive is taken. The offensive will be a turning-point in the whole policy of the Russian revolution, that is, it will be a transition from waiting, from paving the way for peace by means of a revolutionary uprising from below, to the resumption of the war. The path that opened up was transition from fraternisation on one front to fraternisation on every front, from spontaneous fraternisation, such as the exchange of a crust of bread with a hungry German worker for a penknife\u2014which is punishable by penal servitude\u2014to conscious fraternisation.\n\nWhen we take power into our own hands, we shall curb the capitalists, and then the war will not be the kind of war that is being waged now, because the nature of a war is   determined by what class wages it, not by what is written on paper. You can write on paper anything you like. But as long as the capitalist class has a majority in the government the war will remain an imperialist war no matter what you write, no matter how eloquent you are, no matter how many near-socialist Ministers you have. Everyone knows that, and everyone can see it. And the cases of Albania, Greece and Persia[] have shown this so clearly and graphically that I am surprised everyone is attacking our written declaration about the offensive,[] and no one says a word about specific cases! It is easy to promise Bills, but specific measures are being postponed time and again. It is easy to write a declaration about peace without annexations, but the Albanian, Greek and Persian events took place after the coalition Ministry was formed. After all, it was Dyelo Naroda,[] not an organ of our Party, but a government organ, a ministerial organ, which said that it is Russian democracy that is being subjected to this humiliation, and that Greece is being strangled. And this very same Milyukov, whom you imagine to be heaven knows who, although he is just an ordinary member of his party\u2014Tereshchenko in no way differs from him\u2014wrote that the pressure exerted on Greece came from Allied diplomats. The war remains an imperialist war, and however much you may desire peace, however sincere your sympathy for the working people and your desire for peace\u2014I am fully convinced that by and large it must be sincere\u2014you are powerless, because the war can only be ended by taking the revolution further. When the revolution began in Russia, a revolutionary struggle for peace from below also began. If you were to take power into your hands, if power were to pass to the revolutionary organisations to be used for combating the Russian capitalists, then the working people of some countries would believe you and you could propose peace. Then our peace would be ensured at least from two sides, by the two nations who are being bled white and whose cause is hopeless\u2014Germany and France. And if circumstances then obliged us to wage a revolutionary war\u2014no one knows, and we do not rule out the possibility\u2014we should say: \"We are not pacifists, we do not renounce war when the revolutionary class is in power and has actually deprived the capitalists of the opportunity to influence things   in any way, to exacerbate the economic dislocation which enables them to make hundreds of millions.\" The revolutionary government would explain to absolutely every nation that every nation must be free, and that just as the German nation must not fight to retain Alsace and Lorraine, so the French nation must not fight for its colonies. For, while France is fighting for her colonies, Russia has Khiva and Bokhara, which are also something like colonies. Then the division of colonies will begin. And how are they to be divided? On what basis? According to strength. But strength has changed. The capitalists are in a situation where their only way out is war. When you take over revolutionary power, you will have a revolutionary way of securing peace, namely, by addressing a revolutionary appeal to all nations and explaining your tactics by your own example. Then the way to peace secured by revolutionary means will be open to you, and you will most probably be able to avert the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. Then you may be certain that the German and French people will declare in your favour. As for the British, American and Japanese capitalists, even if they wanted a war against the revolutionary working class\u2014whose strength will grow tenfold once the capitalists have been curbed and put down and control has passed into the hands of the working class\u2014even if the American, British and Japanese capitalists wanted a war, the chances would be a hundred to one against them being able to wage it. For peace to be ensured, you will only have to declare that you are not pacifists, that you will defend your republic, your workers\u2019, proletarian democracy, against the German, French and other capitalists.\n\nThat is why we attached such fundamental importance to our declaration about the offensive. The time has come for a radical turn in the whole history of the Russian revolution. When the Russian revolution began it was assisted by the imperialist bourgeoisie of Britain who imagined Russia to be something like China or India. Yet, side by side with a government in which the landowners and capitalists now have a majority, the Soviets arose, a representative institution unparalleled and unprecedented anywhere in the world in strength, an institution which you are killing by taking part in a coalition Ministry of the bourgeoisie. In reality,   the Russian revolution has made the revolutionary struggle from below against the capitalist governments welcome every where, in all countries, with three times as much sympathy as before. The question is one of advance or retreat. No one can stand still during a revolution. That is why the offensive is a turn in the Russian revolution, in the political and economic rather than the strategic sense. An offensive now means the continuation of the imperialist slaughter and the death of more hundreds of thousands, of millions of people\u2014objectively, irrespective of the will or awareness of this or that Minister, with the aim of strangling Persia and other weak nations. Power transferred to the revolutionary proletariat, supported by the poor peasants, means a transition to revolutionary struggle for peace in the surest and most painless forms ever known to mankind, a transition to a state of affairs under which the power and victory of the revolutionary workers will be ensured in Russia and throughout the world. (Applause from part of the audience.)\n\nFirst published in Pravda Nos.  and , June  and  ( and ), \t\nPublished according to the Pravda text checked with the verbatim report edited by Lenin\t\n \nII\nSpeech On The War June  ()\nComrades, allow me, by way of an introduction to an analysis of the war issue, to remind you of two passages in the Manifesto to all countries published by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies on March . \"The time has come,\" said the Manifesto, \"to begin a resolute struggle against the predatory designs of the governments of all countries. The time has come for the people to take the decision on war and peace into their own hands.\" Another passage in the Manifesto, addressed to the workers of the Austro-German coalition, reads: \"Refuse to serve as tools of conquest and violence in the hands of kings, landowners and bankers.\" These are the two passages that have been repeated in different wordings in dozens, hundreds and, I should even imagine, thousands of resolutions by Russia\u2019s workers and peasants.\n\nI am sure these two passages show best of all the contradictory and hopelessly complicated position in which the revolutionary workers and peasants find themselves owing to the present policy of the Mensheviks and Narodniks.[] On the one hand, they support the war. On the other, they belong to classes which have no interest in the predatory designs of the government of any country, and they cannot help saying so. This psychology and ideology, much as it may be vague, is unusually deep-rooted in every worker and peasant. It is realisation that the war is being waged because of the predatory designs of the governments of all countries. But, together with this, it is very vaguely understood, or even not understood at all, that a government, whatever its form, expresses the interests of definite classes and that,   therefore, to contrast the government to the people, as the first passage I quoted does, is an awful theoretical muddle, utter political helplessness, and means condemning yourself and the whole of your policy to the shakiest and most unstable position and trend. By exactly the same token, the closing words in the second passage I have quoted\u2014that excellent call, \"Refuse to serve as tools of conquest and violence in the hands of kings, landowners and bankers\"\u2014are splendid. Only including your own, because if you Russian workers and peasants turn to the workers and peasants of Austria and Germany, whose governments and ruling classes are waging the same kind of predatory war of plunder as the Russian capitalists and bankers, and as those of Britain and France\u2014if you say: \"Refuse to serve as tools in the hands of your bankers\" but admit your own bankers into the Ministry and give them a seat next to socialist Ministers, you are reducing all your appeals to nothing, and in fact you are refuting your whole policy. Your excellent aspirations or wishes might just as well not exist, for you are helping Russia to wage the very same imperialist war, the very same predatory war. You are coming into conflict with the masses you represent, because these masses will never adopt the capitalist point of view, openly expressed by Milyukov, Maklakov and others, who say: \"No idea could be more criminal than that the war is being waged in the interests of capital.\u201d\n\nI wonder whether that idea is criminal. I have no doubt that from the point of view of those who half-exist today and will perhaps no longer exist tomorrow, the idea actually is criminal. But it is the only correct idea. It alone expresses our conception of this war. It alone expresses the interests of the oppressed classes as a struggle against their oppressors. And when we say the war is capitalist and predatory, we must have no illusions\u2014there is not the slightest hint that the crimes of individuals, of individual kings, could have provoked this kind of war.\n\nImperialism is a definite stage in the development of world capital. Capitalism, which has been developing for decades, created a situation in which a small group of immensely rich countries\u2014there are no more than four: Britain, France, Germany and the U.S.A.\u2014amassed wealth amounting to hundreds of thousands of millions, and   concentrated vast power in the hands of the big banks and big capitalists\u2014there are only a couple or half a dozen of them at most in each of these countries\u2014immense power encompassing the whole world, and literally divided the whole globe territorially by setting up colonies. These powers had colonies in every country of the world. They re-divided the globe among themselves economically as well, because concessions, and the threads of finance capital, penetrated into every single part of the globe. This is the basis for annexations. Annexations are not a figment of the imagination. They did not arrive because people who loved liberty unexpectedly became reactionaries. Annexations are nothing but a political expression and political form of the domination of giant banks that has arisen inevitably from capitalism, through no one\u2019s fault, because shares are the basis of banks and because the accumulation of shares is the basis of imperialism. And the big banks, which dominate the whole world through hundreds and thousands of millions in capital and link entire industries with capitalist and monopoly alliances\u2014that is where we have imperialism, which has split the whole world into three groups of immensely rich plunderers.\n\nOne group\u2014the first, which is closer to us in Europe\u2014is headed by Britain, and the other two, by Germany and the U.S.A. The other accomplices are compelled to help while capitalist relations persist. Therefore, if you have a clear idea of the essence of the matter, which every oppressed person realises instinctively and which every Russian worker and the vast majority of peasants realise instinctively\u2014if you have a clear idea of it, you will see how laughable is the idea of fighting the war with words, manifestos, leaflets and socialist congresses. It is laughable because the banks are still omnipotent no matter how many declarations you issue, no matter how many political revolutions you carry out\u2014you have overthrown Nicholas Romanov in Russia and have to some extent made her a republic; Russia has taken a gigantic stride forward, and may be said to have overtaken, almost overnight, France, which in different conditions required a hundred years to do as much and yet remained a capitalist country. And the capitalists are still there. They have lost some ground. They did so in  as well, but did that undermine their strength? While this may be new to Russians, in Europe every revolution showed that with every upswing of the revolutionary movement the workers achieved something more than they had before, but capitalist power remained. The struggle against the imperialist war is impossible unless it is a struggle waged by the revolutionary classes against the ruling classes on a world scale. It is not a question of landowners in general. There are landowners in Russia and they play a greater role in Russia than in any other country but they are not the class which brought imperialism into being. It is a question of the capitalist class led by the biggest finance magnates and banks, and there will be no way out of this war until this class, which dominates the oppressed workers allied with the poor peasants, the semi-proletarians, as our programme calls them, until this class is overthrown. The illusion that you can unite the working people of the world by leaflets and appeals to other nations can only come from the narrow Russian outlook, ignorant of how the press in Western Europe, where the workers and peasants are used to political revolutions and have seen dozens of them, laughs at such phrases and appeals. They don\u2019t know that the mass of workers has actually risen in Russia, where most of the workers are absolutely sincere in their faith and condemn the predatory designs of the capitalists of every country and want to see the people freed from the bankers. But they, the Europeans, cannot understand why you, who have an organisation which no one else on earth has, the Soviets of Workers\u2019, Peasants\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies, which are armed\u2014why you make Ministers of your socialists. After all, you are handing power to the bankers. People abroad accuse you not only of na\u00efvet\u00e9\u2014this is not the worst\u2014Europeans can no longer understand na\u00efvet\u00e9 in politics, they cannot understand that there are tens of millions of people in Russia who are stirring to life for the first time, and that people in Russia know nothing of the link between the classes and the government, of the link between the government and war. War is a continuation of bourgeois politics, nothing else. The ruling class shapes the country\u2019s policy in war-time as well. War is politics from beginning to end. It is pursuit of the same old aims by these classes using a different method. That is why, when you write in your workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 appeals   \u201coverthrow your bankers\", every politically-conscious worker in a European country either laughs at you or cries bitterly over you, saying to himself: \"What can we do since people there have overthrown a half-savage idiot and monster of a monarch, the kind we did away with a long time ago\u2014this is the only crime we have committed\u2014and now, with their \u2019near-socialist\u2019 Ministers, they back the Russian bankers?!\u201d\n\nThe bankers remain in power. They pursue a foreign policy through an imperialist war, fully supporting the treaties concluded by Nicholas II in Russia. This is particularly evident in our country. All the principles of Russia\u2019s imperialist foreign policy were predetermined not by the present day capitalists, but by the previous government and Nicholas Romanov whom we have overthrown. He concluded those treaties, they remain secret, and the capitalists cannot publish them because they are capitalists. But no worker or peasant can see his way clear of this tangle because he tells himself: \"Since we call for the overthrow of the capitalists in other countries, we must first of all get rid of our own bankers, otherwise nobody will believe in us and nobody will take us seriously. People will say we are na\u00efve Russian savages who put on paper words that are excellent in themselves but lack political substance, or, worse still, they will think us hypocrites. You would see these things in the foreign press if that press, every shade of it, passed freely into Russia across the frontier instead of being stopped by the British and French authorities at Tornea. You would see from a mere selection of quotations from foreign newspapers the glaring contradiction in which you find yourselves. You would see how incredibly ridiculous and erroneous is this idea of fighting the war with socialist-conferences, with agreements with the socialists at congresses. Had imperialism been the fault or crime of individuals, socialism could remain socialism. Imperialism is the final stage of capitalism\u2019s development, a stage at which it has gone as far as to divide the whole world, and two gigantic groups are locked in a life-and-death struggle. You must serve one group or the other, or overthrow both groups. There is no other way. When you reject a separate peace treaty, saying you don\u2019t want to serve the German imperialists, you are perfectly right, and that is why we, too, are against a separate peace treaty. Yet in effect, and in   spite of yourselves, you continue to serve the Anglo-French imperialists, who have predatory designs of the kind that the Russian capitalists have translated into treaties with the aid of Nicholas Romanov. We do not know the texts of those treaties, but anyone who has followed political writing and has glanced through at least one book on economics or diplomacy must be familiar with the content of the treaties. Moreover, as far as I can remember, Milyukov wrote in his books about those treaties and promises that they would plunder Galicia, the Straits and Armenia, retain what they had annexed earlier and get plenty of other territories. Everyone knows that, but still the treaties are kept secret, and we are told that if we annul them it will mean breaking with our Allies.\n\nWith regard to a separate peace treaty, I have already said there can be no separate peace treaty for us, and our Party resolution leaves not the slightest room for doubt that we reject it as we reject all agreement with the capitalists. To us, a separate peace treaty means coming to terms with the German plunderers, because they are plundering in the same way as the others. Coming to terms with Russian capital within the Russian Provisional Government is the same kind of separate peace treaty. The tsarist treaties remain, and they, too, help to plunder and strangle other peoples. When it is said, \"Peace without annexations and indemnities\", as every worker and every peasant in Russia should say because life teaches him so, because he has no interest in bank profits and because he wants to live, I reply: Your leaders in the present Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies from the Narodnik and Menshevik parties have become tangled up in that slogan. They have said in their Izvestia that it means retaining the status quo, that is, the pre-war state of affairs, going back to what existed before the war. Isn\u2019t that capitalist peace? And what capitalist peace, too! Since you are putting forward that slogan, you must remember that the course of events may bring your parties to power. That is possible during a revolution, and you will have to do what you say. But if you propose peace without annexations now, the Germans will accept and the British will not, because the British capitalists have not lost an inch of territory but have grabbed plenty in every part of the   world. The Germans grabbed a lot too, but they also lost a lot, and not only lost a lot but found themselves up against the U.S.A., a most formidable enemy. If you who propose peace without annexations mean retaining the status quo, you are drifting into a situation in which your proposal will produce a separate peace treaty with the capitalists, because, if you propose that, the German capitalists, being faced by the U.S.A. and Italy with whom they signed treaties in the past, will say: \"We shall accept that peace treaty without annexations. It will not be a defeat for us, it will be victory over the U.S.A. and Italy.\" Objectively, you are drifting into the same kind of separate peace treaty with the capitalists which you accuse us of, because fundamentally you are not breaking\u2014in your policy, in reality, in your practical moves\u2014with those bankers expressing imperialist domination all over the world whom you and your \u201csocialist\u201d Ministers support in the Provisional Government.\n\nYou are thereby creating a contradictory and precarious situation for yourselves in which the masses misunderstand you. The masses, who have no interest in annexations, say: \"We refuse to fight for any capitalist\u2019s sake.\" When we are told that this sort of policy can be ended by means of congresses and agreements among the socialists of the world, we reply: \"It probably could, if only imperialism were the handiwork of individual criminals; but imperialism is an outgrowth of world capitalism with which the working-class movement is connected.\u201d\n\nImperialism\u2019s victory is the beginning of an inevitable, unavoidable split of the socialists of all countries into two camps. Anyone who keeps on talking about the socialists as an integral body, as something that can be integral, is deceiving himself and others. The entire course of the war, the two and a half years of it, has been leading to this split\u2014ever since the Basle Manifesto, signed unanimously, which said that imperialist capitalism was at the root of this war. The Basle Manifesto does not say a word about \"defence of the fatherland\". No other manifesto could have been written before the war, just as today no socialist would propose writing a manifesto about \"defence of the fatherland\" in the war between Japan and the U.S.A., in which it is not a matter of risking his own skin, his own capitalists and his   own Ministers. Draft a resolution for international congresses! You know that war between Japan and the U.S.A. is a foregone conclusion. This war has been brewing for decades. It is no accident. Tactics do not depend on who fires the first shot. That is ridiculous. You know very well that Japanese and U.S. capitalism are equally predatory. There will be talk about \"defence of the fatherland\" on both sides. It will be a crime or an indication of terrible weakness due to the \u201cdefence\u201d of the interests of our capitalist enemies. That is why we say that socialism has been split irrevocably. The socialists have completely departed from socialism\u2014or rather, those who have deserted to their government, their bankers and their capitalists, no matter what they may say against them and however much they may condemn them. Condemnation is beside the point. Sometimes, however, condemnation of the Germans\u2019 backing for their capitalists covers up defence of the same \u201csin\u201d by the Russians! If you accuse the German social-chauvinists, i.e., people who are socialists in words\u2014many of them may well be socialists at heart\u2014but chauvinists in fact, people who actually defend the dirty, selfish and predatory German capitalists rather than the German people, then don\u2019t defend the British, French and Russian capitalists. The German social-chauvinists are no worse than those in our Ministry who continue the policy of secret treaties, of plunder, and cover this up with pious wishes in which there is much that is kind, and which I admit are absolutely sincere from the point of view of the masses, but in which I do not and cannot see a single word of political truth. It is merely your wish, while the war remains as imperialist and is being waged for the same secret treaties as ever! You are calling on other peoples to overthrow the bankers, yet you are backing your own! When you spoke of peace, you did not say what peace. No one answered us when we pointed out the glaring contradiction in a peace treaty on the basis of the status quo. In your resolution, speaking of peace without annexations, you cannot say that it will not mean retaining the status quo. You cannot say that it will mean retaining the status quo, that is, restoration of the pre-war state of affairs. What will it be, then? Taking the German colonies away from Britain? Try that through peaceful agreements! Everyone will laugh   at you. Try to take away from Japan, without a revolution, Kiaochow or the Pacific islands she has grabbed!\n\nYou have got yourselves mixed up in hopeless contradictions. When we say \"without annexations\", we mean that this slogan is only a subordinate part of the struggle against world imperialism. We say we want to liberate all peoples and begin with our own. You talk of war against annexations and of peace without annexations, but in Russia you continue the policy of annexations. That\u2019s simply ridiculous. You and your government, your new Ministers, actually continue the policy of annexations in regard to Finland and the Ukraine. You find fault with the Ukrainian congress and, through your Ministers, prohibit its sittings.[] Isn\u2019t that annexation? It amounts to a mockery of the rights of a nationality which was tormented by the tsars because its children wanted to speak their mother tongue. That means being afraid of separate republics. From the point of view of the workers and peasants, there is nothing terrible about that. Let Russia be a union of free republics. The workers and peasants will not fight to prevent that. Let every nation be free, and first of all let all the nationalities with which you are making the revolution in Russia be free. By not taking that step, you are condemning yourselves to being \"revolutionary democrats\" in words while your entire policy is in fact counter-revolutionary.\n\nYour foreign policy is anti-democratic and counter-revolutionary. A revolutionary policy may mean you have to wage a revolutionary war. But that is not inevitable. This point has been dealt with at length by the main speaker, and lately by the newspapers as well. I should very much like to dwell on this point.\n\nWhat is the practical way out of this war as we see it? We say: the way out of this war lies only through revolution. Support the revolution of the classes oppressed by the capitalists, overthrow the capitalist class in your country and thereby set an example to other countries. That alone is socialism. That alone means fighting the war. Everything else is empty promises, phrase-mongering or pious wishes. Socialism has been split all over the world. You continue to confuse things by associating with socialists who back their governments. You forget that in Britain and Germany, the   true socialists, who express the socialism of the masses, are isolated and have been thrown into gaol. Yet they alone express the interests of the proletarian movement. But what if in Russia the oppressed class found itself in power? When asked how we shall break out of the war by ourselves, we answer: you cannot break out of it by yourself. All our Party resolutions and all speakers at our public meetings call it absurd to say you can break out of this war by yourself. This war involves hundreds of millions of people and hundreds of thousands of millions in capital. The only way out is the transfer of power to the revolutionary class which must really break imperialism, its financial, banking and annexationist threads. Until this happens nothing will have been done. The revolution was limited to your getting, in place of tsarism and imperialism, a near-republic which is imperialist through and through and which cannot treat Finland and the Ukraine democratically, i.e., without being afraid of division, even through revolutionary worker and peasant representatives.\n\nIt is untrue to say that we are seeking a separate peace treaty. We say: No separate peace treaty with any capitalists, least of all with the Russian capitalists. But the Provisional Government has a separate peace treaty with the Russian capitalists. Down with that separate peace treaty! (Applause.) We recognise no separate peace treaty with the German capitalists and we shall not enter into any negotiations. Nor must there be a separate peace treaty with the British and French imperialists. We are told that to break with them would mean coming to terms with the German imperialists. That is not true. We must break with them immediately because it is an alliance for plunder. It is said that the treaties cannot be published because that would mean showing up the whole of our government and the whole of our policy in the eyes of every worker and peasant. If we were to publish these treaties and plainly tell the Russian workers and peasants at meetings, especially in every remote hamlet: \"What you are now fighting for is the Straits, and because they want to keep Armenia,\" they would all say: \"We want no such war.\" (The Chairman: \"Your time is up.\" Voices: \"Let him speak.\") I ask for ten minutes more. (Voices: \"Let him speak.\")\n\nI say that this contrast\u2014\"either with the British or with the German imperialists\"\u2014is wrong. It implies that if we make peace with the German imperialists we must fight the British, and vice versa. This contrasting suits those who are not breaking with their capitalists and bankers, and who accept any alliance with them. But it doesn\u2019t suit us. We speak of our defending the alliance with the oppressed class, with the oppressed people. Remain loyal to this alliance, and then you will be revolutionary democrats. It\u2019s no easy task. This task will not let you forget that under certain circumstances we shall be unable to do without a revolutionary war. No revolutionary class can rule out revolutionary war, or it will doom itself to ridiculous pacifism. We are not Tolstoyans. If the revolutionary class takes power, if its state keeps no annexed territories, and if no power is left to the banks and big capital, which is not easy to do in Russia, then that class will be waging a revolutionary war in reality and not merely in words. You cannot rule out this kind of war. That would mean succumbing to the Tolstoyan philosophy and to philistinism, forgetting the whole of Marxist science and the experience of all European revolutions.\n\nYou cannot pull Russia alone out of the war. But she is winning more and more great allies who do not believe you now because your attitude is contradictory or na\u00efve, and because you advise other peoples to \"end annexations\" while introducing them in your own country. You tell other peoples to overthrow the bankers. Yet you do not overthrow your own. Try another policy. Publish the treaties and show them up in front of every worker and peasant and at public meetings Say: No peace with the German capitalists, and a complete break with the Anglo-French capitalists. Let the British get out of Turkey and stop fighting for Baghdad. Let them get out of India and Egypt. We refuse to fight for the retention of booty that has been seized, just as we shall not put an ounce of energy into helping the German plunderers to keep their booty. If you do that\u2014so far you have only talked about it, and in politics words are not credited, which is just as well\u2014if you do that, and talk about it, then the allies you now have will show what they can do. Think of the mood of every oppressed worker and peasant. They sympathise with you and regret that you are so weak you leave the   bankers alone even though you have arms. It is the oppressed workers of the world that are your allies. It will be just what the revolution of  showed in practice. It was tremendously weak at first. But what is its international effect? How did that policy, and the history of , shape the foreign policy of the Russian revolution? Today you are conducting the Russian revolution\u2019s whole foreign policy with the capitalists. Yet  showed what the Russian revolution\u2019s foreign policy should be like. It is an indisputable fact that October , ,[] was followed by mass unrest and barricade-building in the streets of Vienna and Prague. After  came  in Turkey,  in Persia and  in China.[] If, instead of compromising with the capitalists, you call on the truly revolutionary democrats, the working class, the oppressed, you will have as allies the oppressed classes instead of the oppressors, and the nationalities which are now being rent to pieces instead of the nationalities in which the oppressing classes now temporarily predominate.\n\nWe have been reminded of the German front where the only change we proposed is the unrestricted dissemination of our appeals written in Russian on one side of the sheet and German on the reverse. In them we say: The capitalists of both countries are robbers. To get them out of the way would be merely a step towards peace. But there are other fronts. I don\u2019t know how strong our army is on the Turkish front. Let us assume it is roughly three million strong. It would be better if that army, which is now kept in Armenia and is carrying out annexations that you tolerate while preaching peace without annexations to other peoples, although you have strength and authority\u2014if that army adopted this programme, and if it made Armenia an independent Armenian republic and gave her the money which the financiers of Britain and France take from us.\n\nIt is said that we cannot do without the financial support of Britain and France. But this support \u201csupports\u201d us like the rope supporting a hanged man. Let the Russian revolutionary class say: down with that support, I refuse to recognise debts contracted with the French and British capitalists, and I call for a general revolt against the capitalists. No peace treaty with the German capitalists and no alliance with the British and French! If this policy were actually pursued,   our army fighting the Turks could be released and sent to other fronts, because all Asian peoples would see that the Russian people do not merely proclaim peace without annexations on the basis of self-determination but that the Russian worker and peasant are in fact placing themselves at the head of all oppressed nationalities, and that with them, the struggle against imperialism is not a pious wish nor a high-flown ministerial phrase but a matter of vital concern to the revolution.\n\nAs we stand now, a revolutionary war may threaten us, but this war is not bound to take place, since the British imperialists will hardly be able to wage war against us if you act as a practical example to the peoples surrounding Russia. Prove that you are liberating the Armenian republic and reaching agreement with the Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Deputies in every country, that you are for a free republic, and then the Russian revolution\u2019s foreign policy will become really revolutionary and really democratic. At present it is that only in words. In reality it is counter-revolutionary, because you are bound hand and foot by the Anglo-French imperialists and refuse to say so openly, you are afraid to admit it. Instead of issuing that appeal \"to overthrow foreign bankers\", you would have done better to tell the Russian people, the workers and peasants, in so many words: \"We are too weak, we cannot throw off the tyranny of the Anglo-French imperialists, we are their slaves and are therefore fighting.\" It would have been a bitter truth that would have been of revolutionary significance. It would actually have brought this predatory war closer to its end. That means a thousand times more than an agreement with the French and British social-chauvinists, than the convening of congresses which they would agree to attend, than the continuation of this policy by which you are actually afraid to break with the imperialists of one country while remaining the allies of another. You can draw on the support of the oppressed classes of Europe, of the oppressed people of the weaker countries which Russia strangled under the tsars and which she is still strangling now, as she is strangling Armenia. With their support, you can bring freedom by helping their workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 committees. You would put yourselves at the head of all the oppressed classes, all   oppressed peoples, in the war against the German and British imperialists, who cannot join forces against you because they are locked in a life-and-death struggle against each other, and because they are in a hopeless position, in which the Russian revolution\u2019s foreign policy, a sincere and real alliance with the oppressed classes, the oppressed peoples, can be successful it has  chances in  of being successful!\n\nRecently we read in our Moscow Party newspaper a letter from a peasant commenting on our programme. I should like to bring my speech to a close with a brief quotation from that letter, showing what a peasant makes of our programme. The letter was printed in No.  of Sotsial-Demokrat,our Moscow Party newspaper, and was reprinted in Pravda No. .[]\n\n\u201cWe must,\" says the letter, \"press the bourgeoisie harder to make them burst at the seams. Then the war will be over. But things will turn out badly if we don\u2019t press the bourgeoisie hard enough.\" (Applause.) \nComrades, according to the plan you have adopted and which has been conveyed to me, the subject of today\u2019s talk is the state. I do not know how familiar you are already with this subject. If I am not mistaken your courses have only just begun and this is the first time you will be tackling this subject systematically. If that is so, then it may very well happen that in the first lecture on this difficult subject I may not succeed in making my exposition sufficiently clear and comprehensible to many of my listeners. And if this should prove to be the case, I would request you not to be perturbed by the fact, because the question of the state is a most complex and difficult one, perhaps one that more than any other has been confused by bourgeois scholars, writers and philosophers. It should not therefore be expected that a thorough understanding of this subject can be obtained from one brief talk, at a first sitting. After the first talk on this subject you should make a note of the passages which you have not understood or which are not clear to you, and return to them a second, a third and a fourth time, so that what you have not understood may be further supplemented and elucidated later, both by reading and by various lectures and talks. I hope that we may manage to meet once again and that we shall then be able to exchange opinions on all supplementary questions and see what has remained most unclear. I also hope that in addition to talks and lectures you Will devote some time to reading at least a few of the most important works of Marx and Engels. I have no doubt that these most important works are to be found in the lists of books and in the handbooks which are available in your library for the students of the Soviet and Party school; and although, again, some of you may at first be dismayed by the difficulty of the exposition, I must again warn you that you should not let this worry you; what is unclear at a first reading will become clear at a second reading, or when you subsequently approach the question from a somewhat different. angle. For I once more repeat that the question is so complex and has been so confused by bourgeois scholars and writers that anybody who desires to study it seriously and master it independently must attack it several times, return to it again and again and consider it from various angles in order to attain a clear, sound understanding of it. Because it is such a fundamental, such a basic question in all politics, and because not only in such stormy and revolutionary times as the present, but even in the most peaceful times, you will come across it every day in any newspaper in connection with any economic or political question it will be all the easier to return to it. Every day, in one context or another, you will be returning to the question: what is the state, what is its nature, what is its significance and what is the attitude of our Party, the party that is fighting for the overthrow of capitalism, the Communist Party\u2014what is its attitude to the state? And the chief thing is that you should acquire, as a result of your reading, as a result of the talks and lectures you will hear on the state, the ability to approach this question independently, since you will be meeting with it on the most diverse occasions, in connection with the most trifling questions, in the most unexpected contexts and in discussions and disputes with opponents. Only when you learn to find your way about independently in this question may you consider yourself sufficiently confirmed in your convictions and able with sufficient success to defend them against anybody and at any time.\n\nAfter these brief remarks, I shall proceed to deal with the question itself\u2014what is the state, how did it arise and fundamentally what attitude to the state should be displayed by the party of the working class, which is fighting for the complete overthrow of capitalism\u2014the Communist Party?\n\nI have already said that you are not likely to find another question which has been so confused, deliberately and unwittingly, by representatives of bourgeois science, philosophy, jurisprudence, political economy and journalism, as the question of the state. To this day it is very often confused with religious questions; not only those professing religious doctrines (it is quite natural to expect it of them), but even people who consider themselves free from religious prejudice, very often confuse the specific question of the state with questions of religion and endeavour to build up a doctrine\u2014very often a complex one, with an ideological, philosophical approach and argumentation\u2014which claims that the state is something divine, something supernatural, that it is a certain force by virtue of which mankind has lived, that it is a force of divine origin which confers on people, or can confer on people, or which brings with it something that is not of man, but is given him from without. And it must be said that this doctrine is so closely bound up with the interests of the exploiting classes\u2014the landowners and the capitalists\u2014so serves their interests, has so deeply permeated all the customs, views and science of the gentlemen who represent the bourgeoisie, that you will meet with vestiges of it on every hand, even in the view of the state held by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, although they are convinced that they can regard the state with sober eyes and reject indignantly the suggestion that they are under the sway of religious prejudices. This question has been so confused and complicated because it affects the interests of the ruling classes more than any other question (yielding place in this respect only to the foundations of economic science). The doctrine of the state serves to justify social privilege, the existence of exploitation, the existence of capitalism\u2014and that is why it would be the greatest mistake to expect impartiality on this question, to approach it in the belief that people who claim to be scientific can give you a purely scientific view on the subject. In the question of the state, in the doctrine of the state, in the theory of the state, when you have become familiar with it and have gone into it deeply enough, you will always discern the struggle between different classes, a struggle which is reflected or expressed in a conflict of views on the state, in the estimate of the role and significance of the state.\n\nTo approach this question as scientifically as possible we must cast at least a fleeting glance back on the history of the state, its emergence and development. The most reliable thing in a question of social science, and one that is most necessary in order really to acquire the habit of approaching this question correctly and not allowing oneself to get lost in the mass of detail or in the immense variety of conflicting opinion\u2014the most important thing if one is to approach this question scientifically is not to forget the underlying historical connection, to examine every question from the standpoint of how the given phenomenon arose in history and what were the principal stages in its development, arid, from the standpoint of its development, to examine what it has become today.\n\nI hope that in studying this question of the state you will acquaint yourselves with Engels\u2019s book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. This is one of the fundamental works of modern socialism, every sentence of which can be accepted with confidence, in the assurance that it has not been said at random but is based on immense historical and political material. Undoubtedly, not all the parts of this work have been expounded in an equally popular and comprehensible way; some of them presume a reader who already possesses a certain knowledge of history and economics. But I again repeat that you should not be perturbed if on reading this work you do not understand it at once. Very few people do. But returning to it later, when your interest has been aroused, you will succeed \u2014in understanding the greater part, if not the whole of it. I refer to this book because it gives the correct approach to the question in the sense mentioned. It begins with a historical sketch of the origin of the state.\n\nThis question, like every other\u2014for example, that of the origin of capitalism, the exploitation of man by man, socialism, how socialism arose, what conditions gave rise to it\u2014can be approached soundly and confidently only if we cast a glance back on the history of its development as a whole. In connection with this problem it should first of all be noted that the state has not always existed. There was a time when there was no state. It appears wherever and whenever a division of society into classes appears, whenever exploiters and exploited appear.\n\nBefore the first form of exploitation of man by man arose, the first form of division into classes\u2014slave-owners and slaves\u2014there existed the patriarchal family, or, as it is sometimes called, the clan family. (Clan-tribe; at the time people of one kin lived together.) Fairly definite traces of these primitive times have survived in the life of many primitive peoples; and if you take any work whatsoever on primitive civilisation, you will always come across more or less definite descriptions, indications and recollections of the fact that there was a time, more or less similar\u2014to primitive communism, when the division of society into slave-owners and slaves did not exist. And in those times there was no state, no special apparatus for the systematic application of force and the subjugation of people by force. It is such an apparatus that is called the state.\n\nIn primitive society, when people lived in small family groups and were still at the lowest stages of development, in a condition approximating to savagery\u2014an epoch from which modern, civilised human society is separated by several thousand years\u2014there were yet no signs of t e existence of a state. We find the predominance of custom, authority, respect, the power enjoyed by the elders of the clan; we find this power sometimes accorded to women the position of women then was not like the downtrodden and oppressed condition of women today\u2014but nowhere do we find a special category of people set apart to rule others and who, for the sake and purpose of rule, systematically and permanently have at their disposal a certain apparatus of coercion, an apparatus of violence, such as is represented at the present time, as you all realise, by armed contingents of troops, prisons and other means of subjugating the will of others by force\u2014all that which constitutes the essence of the state.\n\nIf we get away from what are known as religious teachings, from the subtleties, philosophical arguments and various opinions advanced by bourgeois scholars, if we get away from these and try to get at the real core of the matter, we shall find that the state really does amount to such an apparatus of rule which stands outside society as a whole. When there appears such a special group of men occupied solely with government, and who in order to rule need a special apparatus of coercion to subjugate the will of others by force\u2014prisons, special contingents of men, armies, etc.\u2014then there appears the state.\n\nBut there was a time when there was no state, when general ties, the community itself, discipline and the ordering of work were maintained by force of custom and tradition, by the authority or the respect enjoyed by the elders of the clan or by women\u2014who in those times not only frequently enjoyed a status equal to that of men, but not infrequently enjoyed an even higher status\u2014and when there was no special category of persons who were specialists in ruling. History shows that the state as a special apparatus for coercing people arose wherever and whenever there appeared a division of society into classes, that is, a division into groups of people some of which were permanently in a position to appropriate the labour of others, where some people exploited others.\n\nAnd this division of society into classes must always be clearly borne in mind as a fundamental fact of history. The development of all human societies for thousands of years, in all countries without exception, reveals a general conformity to law, a regularity and consistency; so that at first we had a society without classes\u2014the original patriarchal, primitive society, in which there were no aristocrats; then we had a society based on slavery\u2014a slaveowning society. The whole of modern, civilised Europe has passed through this stage\u2014slavery ruled supreme two thousand years ago. The vast majority of peoples of the other parts of the world also passed through this stage. Traces of slavery survive to this day among the less developed peoples; you will find the institution of slavery in Africa, for example, at the present time. The division into slaveowners and slaves was the first important class division. The former group not only owned all the means of production\u2014the land and the implements, however poor and primitive they may have been in those times\u2014but also owned people. This group was known as slave-owners, while those who laboured and supplied labour for others were known as slaves.\n\nThis form was followed in history by another\u2014feudalism. In the great majority of countries slavery in the course of its development evolved into serfdom. The fundamental division of society was now into feudal lords and peasant serfs. The form of relations between people changed. The slave-owners had regarded the slaves as their property; the law had confirmed this view and regarded the slave as a chattel completely owned by the slave-owner. As far as the peasant serf was concerned, class oppression and dependence remained, but it was not considered that the feudal lord owned the peasants as chattels, but that he was only entitled to their labour, to the obligatory performance of certain services. In practice, as you know, serfdom, especially in Russia where it survived longest of all and assumed the crudest forms, in no way differed from slavery.\n\nFurther, with the development of trade, the appearance of the world market and the development of money circulation, a new class arose within feudal society\u2014the capitalist class. From the commodity, the exchange of commodities and the rise of the power of money, there derived the power of capital. During the eighteenth century, or rather, from the end of the eighteenth century and during the nineteenth century, revolutions took place all over the world. Feudalism was abolished in all the countries of Western Europe. Russia was the last country in which this took place. In  a radical change took place in Russia as well; as a consequence of this one form of society was replaced by another\u2014feudalism was replaced by capitalism, under which division into classes remained, as well as various traces and remnants of serfdom, but fundamentally the division into classes assumed a different form.\n\nThe owners of capital, the owners of the land and the owners of the factories in all capitalist countries constituted and still constitute an insignificant minority of the population who have complete command of the labour of the whole people, and, consequently, command, oppress and exploit the whole mass of labourers, the majority of whom are proletarians, wage-workers, who procure their livelihood in the process of production only by the sale of their own worker\u2019s hands, their labour-power. With the transition to capitalism, the peasants, who had been disunited and downtrodden in feudal times, were converted partly (the majority) into proletarians, and partly (the minority) into wealthy peasants who themselves hired labourers and who constituted a rural bourgeoisie.\n\nThis fundamental fact\u2014the transition of society from primitive forms of slavery to serfdom and finally to capitalism\u2014you must always bear in mind, for only by remembering this fundamental fact, only by examining all political doctrines placed in this fundamental scheme, will you be able properly to appraise these doctrines and understand what they refer to; for each of these great periods in the history of mankind, slave-owning, feudal and capitalist, embraces scores and hundreds of centuries and presents such a mass of political forms, such a variety of political doctrines, opinions and revolutions, that this extreme diversity and immense variety (especially in connection with the political, philosophical and other doctrines of bourgeois scholars and politicians) can be understood only by firmly holding, as to a guiding thread, to this division of society into classes, this change in the forms of class rule, and from this standpoint examining all social questions\u2014economic, political, spiritual, religious, etc.\n\nIf you examine the state from the standpoint of this fundamental division, you will find that before the division of society into classes, as I have already said, no state existed. But as the social division into classes arose and took firm root, as class society arose, the state also arose and took firm root. The history of mankind knows scores and hundreds of countries that have passed or are still passing through slavery, feudalism and capitalism. In each of these countries, despite the immense historical changes that have taken place, despite all the political vicissitudes and all the revolutions due to this development of mankind, to the transition from slavery through feudalism to capitalism and to the present world-wide struggle against capitalism, you will always discern the emergence of the state. It has always been a certain apparatus which stood outside society and consisted of a group of people engaged solely, or almost solely, or mainly, in ruling. People are divided into the ruled, and into specialists in ruling, those who rise above society and are called rulers, statesmen. This apparatus, this group of people who rule others, always possesses certain means of coercion, of physical force, irrespective of whether this violence over people is expressed in the primitive club, or in more perfected types of weapons in the epoch of slavery, or in the firearms which appeared in the Middle Ages, or, finally, in modern weapons, which in the twentieth century are technical marvels and are based entirely on the latest achievements of modern technology. The methods of violence changed, but whenever there was a state there existed in every society a group of persons who ruled, who commanded, who dominated and who in order to maintain their power possessed an apparatus of physical coercion, an apparatus of violence, with those weapons which corresponded to the technical level of the given epoch. And by examining these general phenomena, by asking ourselves why no state existed when there were no classes, when there were no exploiters and exploited, and why it appeared when classes appeared\u2014only in this way shall we find a definite answer to the question of what is the nature and significance of the state.\n\nThe state is a machine for maintaining the rule of one class over another. When there were no classes in society, when, before the epoch of slavery, people laboured in primitive conditions of greater equality, in conditions when the productivity of labour was still at its lowest, and when primitive man could barely procure the wherewithal for the crudest and most primitive existence, a special group of people whose function is to rule and to dominate the rest of society, had not and could not yet have emerged. Only when the first form of the division of society into classes appeared, only when slavery appeared, when a certain class of people, by concentrating on the crudest forms of agricultural labour, could produce a certain surplus, when this surplus was not absolutely essential for the most wretched existence of the slave and passed into the hands of the slave-owner, when in this way the existence of this class of slave-owners was secure\u2014then in order that it might take firm root it was necessary for a state to appear.\n\nAnd it did appear\u2014the slave-owning state, an apparatus which gave the slave-owners power and enabled them to rule over the slaves. Both society and the state were then on a much smaller scale than they are now, they possessed incomparably poorer means of communication\u2014the modern means of communication did not then exist. Mountains, rivers and seas were immeasurably greater obstacles than they are now, and the state took shape within far narrower geographical boundaries. A technically weak state apparatus served a state confined within relatively narrow boundaries and with a narrow range of action. Nevertheless,. there did exist an apparatus which compelled the slaves to remain in slavery, which kept one part of society subjugated to and oppressed by another. It is impossible to compel the greater part of society to work systematically for the other part of society without a permanent apparatus of coercion. So long as there were no classes, there was no apparatus of this sort. When classes appeared, everywhere and always, as the division grew and took firmer hold, there also appeared a special institution\u2014the state. The forms of state were extremely varied. As early as the period of slavery we find diverse forms of the state in the countries that were the most advanced, cultured and civilised according to the standards of the time\u2014for example, in ancient Greece and Rome which were based entirely on slavery. At that time there was already a difference between monarchy and republic, between aristocracy and democracy. A monarchy is the power of a single person, a republic is the absence of any non-elected authority; an aristocracy is the power of a relatively small minority, a democracy is the power of the people (democracy in Greek literally means the power of the people). All these differences arose in the epoch of slavery. Despite these differences, the state of the slave-owning epoch was a slave-owning state, irrespective of whether it was a monarchy or a republic, aristocratic or democratic.\n\nIn every course on the history of ancient times, in any lecture on this subject, you will hear about the struggle which was waged between the monarchical and republican states. But the fundamental fact is that the slaves were not regarded as human beings\u2014not only were they not regarded as citizens, they were not even regarded as human beings. Roman law regarded them as chattels. The law of manslaughter, not to mention the other laws for the protection of the person, did not extend to slaves. It defended only the slaveowners, who were alone recognised as citizens with full rights. But whether a monarchy was instituted or a republic, it was a monarchy of the slave-owners or a republic of the slave-owners. All rights were enjoyed by the slave-owners, while the slave was a chattel in the eyes of the law; and not only could any sort of violence be perpetrated against a slave, but even the killing of a slave was not considered a crime. Slave-owning republics differed in their internal organisation, there were aristocratic republics and democratic republics. In an aristocratic republic only a small number of privileged persons took part in the elections; in a democratic republic everybody took part but everybody meant only the slave-owners, that is, everybody except the slaves. This fundamental fact must be borne in mind, because it throws more light than any other on the question of the state and clearly demonstrates the nature of the state.\n\nThe state is a machine for the oppression of one class by another, a machine for holding in obedience to one class other, subordinated classes. There are various forms of this machine. The slave-owning state could be a monarchy, an aristocratic republic or even a democratic republic. In fact the forms of government varied extremely, but their essence was always the same: the slaves enjoyed no rights and constituted an oppressed class; they were not regarded as human beings. We find the same thing in the feudal state.\n\nThe change in the form of exploitation transformed the slave-owning state into the feudal state. This was of immense importance. In slave-owning society the slave enjoyed no rights whatever and was not regarded as a human being; in feudal society the peasant was bound to the soil. The chief distinguishing feature of serfdom was that the peasants (and at that time the peasants constituted the majority; the urban population was still very small) were considered bound to the land\u2014this is the very basis of \"serfdom\". The peasant might work a definite number of days for himself on the plot assigned to him by the landlord; on the other days the peasant serf worked for his lord. The essence of class society remained\u2014society was based on class exploitation. Only the owners of the land could enjoy full rights; the peasants had no rights at all. In practice their condition differed very little from the condition of slaves in the slave-owning state. Nevertheless, a wider road was opened for their emancipation, for the emancipation of the peasants, since the peasant serf was not regarded as the direct property of the lord. He could work part of his time on his own plot, could, so to speak, belong to himself to some extent; and with the wider opportunities for the development of exchange and trade relations the feudal system steadily disintegrated and the scope of emancipation of the peasantry steadily widened. Feudal society was always more complex than slave society. There was a greater development of trade and industry, which even in those days led to capitalism. In the Middle Ages feudalism predominated. And here too the forms of state varied, here too we find both the monarchy and the republic, although the latter was much more weakly expressed. But always the feudal lord was regarded as the only ruler. The peasant serfs were deprived of absolutely all political rights.\n\nNeither under slavery nor under the feudal system could a small minority of people dominate over the vast majority without coercion. History is full of the constant attempts of the oppressed classes to throw off oppression. The history of slavery contains records of wars of emancipation from slavery which lasted for decades. Incidentally, the name \"Spartacist\" now adopted by the German Communists\u2014the only German party which is really fighting against the yoke of capitalism\u2014was adopted by them because Spartacus was one of the most prominent heroes of one of the greatest revolts of slaves, which took place about two thousand years ago. For many years the seemingly omnipotent Roman Empire, which rested entirely on slavery, experienced the shocks and blows of a widespread uprising of slaves who armed and united to form a vast army under the leadership of Spartacus. In the end they were defeated, captured and put to torture by the slave-owners. Such civil wars mark the whole history of the existence of class society. I have just mentioned an example of the greatest of these civil wars in the epoch of slavery. The whole epoch of feudalism is likewise marked by constant uprisings of the peasants. For example, in Germany in the Middle Ages the struggle between the two classes\u2014the landlords and the serfs\u2014assumed wide proportions and was transformed into a civil war of the peasants against the landowners. You are all familiar with similar examples of repeated uprisings of the peasants against the feudal landowners in Russia.\n\nIn order to maintain their rule and to preserve their power, the feudal lords had to have an apparatus by which they could unite under their subjugation a vast number of people and subordinate them to certain laws and regulations; and all these laws fundamentally amounted to one thing\u2014the maintenance of the power of the lords over the peasant serfs. And this was the feudal state, which in Russia, for example, or in quite backward Asiatic countries (where feudalism prevails to this day) differed in form\u2014it was either a republic or a monarchy. When the state was a monarchy, the rule of one person was recognised; when it was \u2014a republic, the participation of the elected representatives of landowning society was in one degree or another recognised\u2014this was in feudal society. Feudal society represented a division of classes under which the vast majority\u2014the peasant serfs\u2014were completely subjected to an insignificant minority\u2014the owners of the land.\n\nThe development of trade, the development of commodity exchange, led to the emergence of a new class\u2014the capitalists. Capital took shape at the close of the Middle Ages, when, after the discovery of America, world trade developed enormously, when the quantity of precious metals increased, when silver and gold became the medium of exchange, when money circulation made it possible for individuals to possess tremendous wealth. Silver and gold were recognised as wealth all over the world. The economic power of the landowning class declined and the power of the new class\u2014the representatives of capital\u2014developed. The reconstruction of society was such that all citizens seemed to be equal, the old division into slave-owners and slaves disappeared, all were regarded as equal before the law irrespective of what capital each owned; whether he owned land as private property, or was a poor man who owned nothing but his labour-power\u2014all were equal before the law. The law protects everybody equally; it protects the property of those who have it from attack by the masses who, possessing no property, possessing nothing but their labour-power, grow steadily impoverished and ruined and become converted into proletarians. Such is capitalist society.\n\nI cannot dwell on it in detail. You will return to this when you come to discuss the Programme of the Party you will then hear a description of capitalist society. This society advanced against serfdom, against the old feudal system, under the slogan of liberty. But it was liberty for those who owned property. And when feudalism was shattered, which occurred at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century\u2014in Russia it occurred later than in other countries, in \u2014the feudal state was then superseded by the capitalist state, which proclaims liberty for the whole people as its slogan, which declares that it expresses the will of the whole people and denies that it is a class state. And here there developed a struggle between the socialists, who are fighting for the liberty of the whole people, and the capitalist state\u2014a struggle which has led to the creation of the Soviet Socialist Republic and which is spreading all over the world.\n\nTo understand the struggle that has been started against world capital, to understand the nature of the capitalist state, we must remember that when the capitalist state advanced against the feudal state it entered the fight under the slogan of liberty. The abolition of feudalism meant liberty for the representatives of the capitalist state and served their purpose, inasmuch as serfdom was breaking down and the peasants had acquired the opportunity of owning as their full property the land which they had purchased for compensation or in part by quit-rent\u2014this did not concern the state: it protected property irrespective of its origin, because the state was founded on private property. The peasants became private owners in all the modern, civilised states. Even when the landowner surrendered part of his land to the peasant, the state protected private property, rewarding the landowner by compensation, by letting him take money for the land. The state as it were declared that it would fully preserve private property, and the state accorded it every support and protection. The state recognised the property rights of every merchant, industrialist and manufacturer. And this society, based on private property, on the power of capital, on the complete subjection of the propertyless workers and labouring masses of the peasantry, proclaimed that its rule was based on liberty. Combating feudalism, it proclaimed freedom of property and was particularly proud of the fact that the state had ceased, supposedly, to be a class state.\n\nYet the state continued to be a machine which helped the capitalists to hold the poor peasants and the working class in subjection. But in outward appearance it was free. It proclaimed universal suffrage, and declared through its champions, preachers, scholars and philosophers, that it was not a class state. Even now, when the Soviet Socialist Republics have begun to fight the state, they accuse us of violating liberty, of building a state based on coercion, on the suppression of some by others, whereas they represent a popular, democratic state. And now, when the world socialist revolution has begun, and when the revolution has succeeded in some countries, when the fight against world capital has grown particularly acute, this question of the state has acquired the greatest importance and has become, one might say, the most burning one, the focus of all present-day political questions and political disputes.\n\nWhichever party we take in Russia or in any of the more civilised countries, we find that nearly all political disputes, disagreements and opinions now centre around the conception of the state. Is the state in a capitalist country, in a democratic republic\u2014especially one like Switzerland or the U.S.A.\u2014in the freest democratic republics, an expression of the popular will, the sum total of the general decision of the people, the expression of the national will, and so forth; or is the state a machine that enables the capitalists of those countries to maintain their power over the working class and the peasantry? That is the fundamental question around which all political disputes all over the world now centre. What do they say about Bolshevism? The bourgeois press abuses the Bolsheviks. You will not find a single newspaper that does not repeat the hackneyed accusation that the Bolsheviks violate popular rule. If our Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in their simplicity of heart (perhaps it is not simplicity, or perhaps it is the simplicity which the proverb says is worse than robbery) think that they discovered and invented the accusation that the Bolsheviks have violated liberty and popular rule, they are ludicrously mistaken. Today every one of the richest newspapers in the richest countries, which spend tens of millions on their distribution and disseminate bourgeois lies and imperialist policy in tens of millions of copies\u2014every one of these newspapers repeats these basic arguments and accusations against Bolshevism, namely, that the U.S.A., Britain and Switzerland are advanced states based on popular rule, whereas the Bolshevik republic is a state of bandits in which liberty is unknown, and that the Bolsheviks have violated the idea of popular rule and have even gone so far as to disperse the Constituent Assembly. These terrible accusations against the Bolsheviks are repeated all over the world. These accusations lead us directly to the question\u2014what is the state? In order to understand these accusations, in order to study them and have a fully intelligent attitude towards them, and not to examine them on hearsay but with a firm opinion of our own, we must have a clear idea of what the state is. We have before us capitalist states of every kind and all the theories in defence of them which were created before the war. In order to answer the question properly we must critically examine all these theories and views.\n\nI have already advised you to turn for help to Engels\u2019s book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. This book says that every state in which private ownership of the land and means of production exists, in which capital dominates, however democratic it may be, is a capitalist state, a machine used by the capitalists to keep the working class and the poor peasants in subjection; .while universal suffrage, a Constituent Assembly, a parliament are merely a form, a sort of promissory note, which does not change the real state of affairs.\n\nThe forms of domination of the state may vary: capital manifests its power in one way where one form exists, and in another way where another form exists\u2014but essentially the power is in the hands of capital, whether there are voting qualifications or some other rights or not, or whether the republic is a democratic one or not\u2014in fact, the more democratic it is the cruder and more cynical is the rule of capitalism. One of the most democratic republics in the world is the United States of America, yet nowhere (and those who have been there since  probably know it) is the power of capital, the power of a handful of multimillionaires over the whole of society, so crude and so openly corrupt as in America. Once capital exists, it dominates the whole of society, and no democratic republic, no franchise can change its nature.\n\nThe democratic republic and universal suffrage were an immense progressive advance as compared with feudalism; they have enabled the proletariat to achieve its present unity and solidarity, to form those firm and disciplined ranks which are waging a systematic struggle against capital. There was nothing even approximately resembling this among the peasant serfs, not to speak of the slaves. The slaves, as we know, revolted, rioted, started civil wars, but they could never create a class-conscious majority and parties to lead the struggle, they could not clearly realise what their aims were, and even in the most revolutionary moments of history they were always pawns in the hands of the ruling classes. The bourgeois republic, parliament, universal suffrage\u2014all represent great progress from the standpoint of the world development of society. Mankind moved towards capitalism, and it was capitalism alone which, thanks to urban culture, enabled the oppressed proletarian class to become conscious of itself and to create the world working-class movement, the millions of workers organised all over the world in parties\u2014the socialist parties which are consciously leading the struggle of the masses. Without parliamentarism, without an electoral system, this development of the working class would have been impossible. That is why all these things have acquired such great importance in the eyes of the broad masses of people. That is why a radical change seems to be so difficult. It is not only the conscious hypocrites, scientists and priests that uphold and defend the bourgeois lie that the state is free and that it is its mission to defend the interests of all; so also do a large number of people who sincerely adhere to the old prejudices and who cannot understand the transition from the old, capitalist society to socialism. Not only people who are directly dependent on the bourgeoisie, not only those who live under the yoke of capital or who have been bribed by capital (there are a large number of all sorts of scientists, artists, priests, etc. , in the service of capital), but even people who are simply under the sway of the prejudice of bourgeois liberty, have taken up arms against Bolshevism all over the world because when the Soviet Republic was founded it rejected these bourgeois lies and openly declared: you say your state is free, whereas in reality, as long as there is private property, your state, even if it is a democratic republic, is nothing but a machine used by the capitalists to suppress the workers, and the freer the state, the more clearly is this expressed. Examples of this are Switzerland in Europe and the United States in America. Nowhere does capital rule so cynically and ruthlessly, and nowhere is it so clearly apparent, as in these countries, although they are democratic republics, no matter how prettily they are painted and notwithstanding all the talk about labour democracy and the equality of all citizens. The fact is that in Switzerland and the United States capital dominates, and every attempt of the workers to achieve the slightest real improvement in their condition is immediately met by civil war. There are fewer soldiers, a smaller standing army, in these countries\u2014Switzerland has a militia and every Swiss has a gun at home, while in America there was no standing army until quite recently and so when there is a strike the bourgeoisie arms, hires soldiery and suppresses the strike; and nowhere is this suppression of the working-class movement accompanied by such ruthless severity as in Switzerland and the U.S.A. , and nowhere does the influence of capital in parliament manifest itself as powerfully as in these countries. The power of capital is everything, the stock exchange is everything, while parliament and elections are marionettes, puppets.... But the eyes of the workers are being opened more and more, and the idea of Soviet government is spreading farther and farther afield, especially after the bloody carnage we have just experienced. The necessity for a relentless war on the capitalists is becoming clearer and clearer to the working class.\n\nWhatever guise a republic may assume, however democratic it may be, if it is a bourgeois republic, if it retains private ownership of the land and factories, and if private capital keeps the whole of society in wage-slavery, that is, if the republic does not carry out what is proclaimed in the Programme of our Party and in the Soviet Constitution, then this state is a machine for the suppression of some people by others. And we shall place this machine in the hands of the class that is to overthrow the power of capital. We shall reject all the old prejudices about the state meaning universal equality\u2014for that is a fraud: as long as there is exploitation there cannot be equality. The landowner cannot be the equal of the worker, or the hungry man the equal of the full man. This machine called the state, before which people bowed in superstitious awe, believing the old tales that it means popular rule, tales which the proletariat declares to be a bourgeois lie\u2014this machine the proletariat will smash. So far we have deprived the capitalists of this machine and have taken it over. We shall use this machine, or bludgeon, to destroy all exploitation. And when the possibility of exploitation no longer exists anywhere in the world, when there are no longer owners of land and owners of factories, and when there is no longer a situation in which some gorge while others starve, only when the possibility of this no longer exists shall we consign this machine to the scrap-heap. Then there will be no state and no exploitation. Such is the view of our Communist Party. I hope that we shall return to this subject in subsequent lectures, return to it again and again.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nComrades, Red troops have liberated the entire Urals area from Kolchak and have begun the liberation of Siberia. The workers and peasants of the Urals and Siberia are enthusiastically welcoming Soviet power, for it is sweeping away with an iron broom all the landowner and capitalist scum who ground down the people with exactions, humiliations, floggings, and the restoration of tsarist oppression.\n\nAlthough we all rejoice at the liberation of the Urals and the entry of the Red troops into Siberia we must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of security. The enemy is still far from being destroyed. He has not even been definitely broken.\n\nEvery effort must be made to drive Kolchak and the Japanese and other foreign bandits out of Siberia, and an even greater effort is needed to destroy the enemy, to prevent him from starting his banditry again and again.\n\nHow is that to be achieved?\n\nThe harrowing experience of the Urals and Siberia, as well as the experience of all countries which have been through the torments of the four years of imperialist war, must not be without its lessons for us.\n\nHere are the five chief lessons which all workers and peasants, all working people, must draw from this experience so as to ensure themselves against a repetition of the calamities of the Kolchak rule.\n\nFirst lesson. In order to defend the power of the workers and peasants from the bandits, that is, from the landowners and capitalists, we need a powerful Red Army. We have proved\u2014not by words but by actual deeds\u2014that we are capable of creating it, that we have learned to direct it and to defeat the capitalists notwithstanding the lavish assistance in arms and equipment they are receiving from the richest countries in the world. That much the Bolsheviks have proved by actual deeds. All workers and peasants\u2014if they are class-conscious\u2014must place their faith in them, not on the strength of their word (for to believe a man on the strength of his word is foolish), but on the strength of the experience of millions upon millions of people in the Urals and Siberia. It is a most difficult problem to combine two elements\u2014arming the workers and peasants and giving the command to ex-officers, who for the most part sympathise with the landowners and capitalists. It can be solved only given splendid organising ability, strict and conscious discipline, and the confidence of the broad masses in the guiding force, the worker commissars. This most difficult problem the Bolsheviks have solved; cases of treachery on the part of ex-officers are very numerous, nevertheless the Red Army is not only in our hands, but has learned to defeat the generals of the tsar and the generals of Britain, France, and America.\n\nConsequently, everyone who seriously wishes to rid him self of the rule of Kolchak must devote all his energies, means and ability without reservation to the task of building up and strengthening the Red Army. Obey all the laws on the Red Army and all orders conscientiously and scrupulously, support discipline in it in every way, and help the Red Army, each to the best of his ability\u2014such is the prime, fundamental, and principal duty of every class-conscious worker and peasant who does not want the rule of Kolchak.\n\nFear like the plague the unruly guerrilla spirit, the arbitrary actions of isolated detachments and disobedience to the central authorities, for it spells doom as the Urals, Siberia, and the Ukraine have demonstrated.\n\nHe who does not unreservedly and selflessly assist the Red Army, or support order and discipline in it with all his might, is a traitor and treason-monger, a supporter of the rule of Kolchak, and should be shown no mercy.\n\nWith a strong Red Army we shall be invincible. Without a strong army we shall inevitably fall victim to Kolchak, Denikin, and Yudenich.\n\nSecond lesson. The Red Army cannot be strong without large state stocks of grain, for without them it is impossible to move an army freely or to train it properly. Without them we cannot maintain the workers who are producing for the army.\n\nEvery class-conscious worker and peasant must know and remember that the chief reason now that our Red Army successes are not swift and stable enough is precisely the shortage of state stocks of grain. He who does not give his surpluses of grain to the state is helping Kolchak, he is a traitor and betrayer of the workers and peasants and is responsible for the unnecessary death and suffering of tens of thousands of workers and peasants in the Red Army.\n\nRogues and profiteers and very ignorant peasants argue in this way\u2014better sell my grain at the open market price, I will get far more for it than the fixed price paid by the state.\n\nBut the whole point is that free sale promotes profiteering; a few get rich, only the wealthy are sated, while the working masses go hungry. We saw that in practice in the richest grain-bearing-districts of Siberia and the Ukraine.\n\nWith the free sale of grain capital triumphs, while labour starves and suffers.\n\nWith the free sale of grain the price rises to thousands of rubles per pood, money loses its value, a handful of profiteers benefit while the people grow poorer.\n\nWith the free sale of grain the government granaries are empty, the army is powerless, industry dies, and the victory of Kolchak and Denikin is inevitable.\n\nOnly the rich, only the worst enemies of the workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 government are consciously in favour of the free sale of grain. Those who out of ignorance are in favour of the free sale of grain should learn to understand from the example of Siberia and the Ukraine why it means victory for Kolchak and Denikin.\n\nThere are still unenlightened peasants who argue as follows: let the state first give me in exchange for my grain good wares at pre-war prices, then I will give up my surplus grain, otherwise I will not. And by this sort of argument the rogues and supporters of the landowners often hoodwink the unenlightened peasants.\n\nIt should not be difficult to understand that the workers\u2019 state which the capitalists completely devastated by four years of a predatory war for the sake of Constantinople, and which the Kolchaks and Denikins are now devastating again by way of revenge with the help of the capitalists of the whole world\u2014it should not be difficult to understand that such a state cannot at this moment supply the peasants with goods, for industry is at a standstill. There is no food, no fuel, no industry.\n\nEvery sensible peasant will agree that the surplus grain must be given to the starving worker as a loan on condition of receiving industrial goods in return.\n\nThat is the way it is now. All class-conscious and sensible peasants, all except the rogues and profiteers will agree that all surplus grain without exception must be turned over to the workers\u2019 state as a loan, because then the state will restore industry and supply industrial goods to the peasants.\n\nBut, we may be asked, will the peasants trust the workers\u2019 state sufficiently to loan their surplus grain to it?\n\nOur reply is that first, the state gives a bond for the loan in the shape of treasury notes. Secondly, all peasants know by experience that the workers\u2019 state, that is, Soviet power, helps the working people and fights the landowners and capitalists. That is why Soviet power is called workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 power. Thirdly, the peasants have no other alternative\u2014either they trust the worker or they trust the capitalist; they give their confidence and a loan either to the workers\u2019 state or to the capitalist state. There is no other alternative either in Russia or in any country in the world. The more class-conscious the peasants become, the more firmly they stand by the workers and the more resolute they are in their decision to help the workers\u2019 state in every way so as to make the return of the power of the landowners and capitalists impossible.\n\nThird lesson. If Kolchak and Denikin are to he completely destroyed the strictest revolutionary order must be maintained, the laws and instructions of the Soviet government must be faithfully observed, and care must be taken that they are obeyed by all.\n\nKolchak\u2019s victories in Siberia and the Urals have been a clear example to all of us that the least disorder, the slightest infringement of Soviet laws, the slightest laxity or negligence at once serve to strengthen the landowners and capitalists and make for their victory. For the landowners and capitalists have not been destroyed and do not consider themselves vanquished; every intelligent worker and peasant sees, knows, and realises that they have only been beaten and have gone into hiding, are lying low, very often disguising themselves by a \u201cSoviet\u201d \u201cprotective\u201d colouring. Many landowners have wormed their way into state farms, and capitalists into various \u201cchief administrations\u201d and \u201ccentral boards\u201d, acting the part of Soviet officials; they are watching every step of the Soviet government. waiting for it to make a mistake or show weakness, so as to overthrow it, to help the Czechoslovaks today and Denikin tomorrow.\n\nEverything must be done to track down these bandits, these landowners and capitalists who are lying low, and to ferret them out, no matter what guise they take, to expose them and punish them ruthlessly, for they are the worst foes of the working people, skilful, shrewd, and experienced enemies who are patiently waiting for an opportune moment to set a conspiracy going; they are saboteurs, who stop at no crime to injure Soviet power. We must be merciless towards these enemies of the working people, towards the landowners, capitalists, saboteurs, and counter-revolutionaries.\n\nAnd in order to be able to catch them we must be skilful, careful, and class-conscious, we must watch out most attentively for the least disorder, for the slightest deviation from the conscientious observance of the laws of the Soviet government. The landowners and capitalists are strong not only because of their knowledge and experience and the assistance they get from the richest countries in the world, but also because of the force of habit and the ignorance of the broad masses who want to live in the \u201cgood old way\u201d and do not realise how essential it is that Soviet laws be strictly and conscientiously observed.\n\nThe slightest lawlessness, the slightest infraction of Soviet law and order is a loophole the foes of the working people take immediate advantage of, it is a starting-point for Kolchak and Denikin victories. It would be criminal to forget that the Kolchak movement began through some slight lack of caution in respect of the Czechoslovaks, with insignificant insubordination on the part of certain regiments.\n\nFourth lesson. It is criminal to forget not only that the Kolchak movement began with trifles but also that the Mensheviks (\u201dSocial-Democrats\u201d) and S.R.s (\u201dSocialist Revolutionaries\u201d) assisted its birth and directly supported it. It is time we learned to judge political parties not by their words, but by their deeds.\n\nThe Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries call themselves socialists, but they are actually abettors of the counter-revolutionaries, abettors of the landowners and capitalists. This was proved in practice not only by isolated facts, but by two big periods in the history of the Russian revolution: () the Kerensky period, and () the Kolchak period. Both times the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, while professing to be \u201csocialists\u201d and \u201cdemocrats\u201d, actually played the role of abettors of the whiteguards. Are we then going to be so foolish as to believe them now they are suggesting we let them \u201ctry again\u201d, and call our permission a \u201cunited socialist (or democratic) front\u201d? Since the Kolchak experience, can there still be peasants other than few isolated individuals, who do not realise that a \u201cunited front\u201d with the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries means union with the abettors of Kolchak?\n\nIt may be objected that the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have realised their mistake and renounced all alliance with the bourgeoisie. But that is not true. In the first place, the Right Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have not renounced such an alliance, and there is no definite line of demarcation from these \u201cRights\u201d. There is no such line through the fault of the \u201cLeft\u201d Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries; for although they verbally \u201ccondemn\u201d their \u201cRights\u201d, even the best of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, in spite of all they say, are actually powerless compared with them. Secondly, what even the best of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries advocate are actually Kolchak ideas which assist the bourgeoisie and Kolchak and Denikin and help to mask their filthy and bloody capitalist deeds. These ideas are: A people\u2019s government, universal, equal, and direct suffrage, a constituent assembly, freedom of the press, and the like. All over the world we see capitalist republics which justify capitalist rule and wars for the enslavement of colonies precisely by this lie of \u201cdemocracy\u201d. In our own country we see that Kolchak, Denikin, Yudenich or any other general readily hands out such \u201cdemocratic\u201d promises. Can we trust a man who on the strength of verbal promises helps a known bandit? The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, all without exception, help known bandits, the world imperialists, using pseudo-democratic slogans to paint their state power, their campaign against Russia, their rule and their policy in bright colours. All the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries offer us an \u201calliance\u201d on condition that we make concessions to the capitalists and their leaders, Kolchak and Denikin; as, for example, that we \u201crenounce terror\u201d (when we are faced with the terror of the multi-millionaires of the whole Entente, of the whole alliance of the richest countries, that are engineering plots in Russia), or that we open the way for freedom to trade in grain, and so on. What these \u201cconditions\u201d of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries boil down to is this: we, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, are wavering towards the capitalists, and we want a \u201cunited front\u201d with the Bolsheviks, against whom the capitalists taking advantage of every concession are fighting! No, my Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary gentlemen, look no more in Russia for people capable of believing you. In Russia class-conscious workers and peasants now realise that the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries are abettors of the whiteguards\u2014some deliberate and malicious, others unwitting and because of their persistence in their old mistakes, but abettors of the whiteguards nevertheless.\n\nFifth lesson. If Kolchak and his rule are to be destroyed and not allowed to recur, all peasants must unhesitatingly make their choice in favour of the workers\u2019 state. Some people (especially the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries\u2014all of them, even the \u201cLefts\u201d among them) are trying to scare the peasants with the bogey of the \u201cdictatorship of one party\u201d, the Party of Bolsheviks, Communists.\n\nThe peasants have learned from the Kolchak regime not to be afraid of this bogey.\n\nEither the dictatorship (i.e., the iron rule) of the landowners and capitalists, or the dictatorship of the working class.\n\nThere is no middle course. The scions of the aristocracy, intellectualists and petty gentry, badly educated on bad books, dream of a middle course. There is no middle course anywhere in the world, nor can there be. Either the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (masked by ornate Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik phraseology about a people\u2019s government, a constituent assembly, liberties, and the like), or the dictatorship of the proletariat. He who has not learned this from the whole history of the nineteenth century is a hopeless idiot. And we in Russia have all seen how the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries dreamed of a middle course under Kerensky and under Kolchak.\n\nTo whom did these dreams do service? Whom did they assist? Kolchak and Denikin. Those who dream of a middle course are abettors of Kolchak.\n\nIn the Urals and Siberia the workers and peasants had an opportunity of comparing the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie with the dictatorship of the working class. The dictatorship of the working class is being implemented by the Bolshevik Party, the party which as far back as  and even earlier merged with the entire revolutionary proletariat.\n\nDictatorship of the working class means that the workers\u2019 state will unhesitatingly suppress the landowners and capitalists and the renegades and traitors who help these exploiters, and will defeat them.\n\nThe workers\u2019 state is an implacable enemy of the landowner and capitalist, of the profiteer and swindler, an enemy of the private ownership of land and capital, an enemy of the power of money.\n\nThe workers\u2019 state is the only loyal friend and helper the working people and the peasantry have. No leaning towards capital but an alliance of the working people to fight it, workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 power, Soviet power\u2014that is what the \u201cdictatorship of the working class\u201d means in practice.\n\nThe Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries want to scare the peasants with these words. They won\u2019t succeed. After Kolchak, the workers and peasants even in the most remote backwoods realise that these words mean precisely that without which there can be no salvation from Kolchak.\n\nDown with the waverers, with the spineless people who are erring in the direction of helping capital and have been captivated by the slogans and promises of capital! An implacable fight against capital, and an alliance of the working people, an alliance of the peasants and the working class\u2014that is the last and most important lesson of the Kolchak regime.\n\nN. Lenin\n\n\n \n \nComrades, I am very glad of the opportunity to greet this Congress of Communist comrades representing Moslem organisations of the East, and to say a few words about the situation now obtaining in Russia and throughout the world. The subject of my address is current affairs, and it seems to me that the most essential aspects of this question at present are the attitude of the peoples of the East to imperialism, and the revolutionary movement among those peoples. It is self-evident that this revolutionary movement of the peoples of the East can now develop effectively, can reach a successful issue, only in direct association with the revolutionary struggle of our Soviet Republic against international imperialism. Owing to a number of circumstances, among them the backwardness of Russia and her vast area, and the fact that she constitutes a frontier between Europe and Asia, between the West and the East, we had to bear the whole brunt-and we regard that as a great honour of being the pioneers of the world struggle against imperialism. Consequently, the whole course of development in the immediate future presages a still broader and more strenuous struggle against international imperialism, arid will inevitably be linked with the struggle of the Soviet Republic against the forces of united imperialism-of Germany, France, Britain and the U.S.A.\n\nAs regards the military aspect of the matter, you know how favourable our situation now is on all the fronts. I shall not dwell in detail on this question; I shall only say that the Civil War which was forced upon us by international imperialism has in two years inflicted incalculable hardship upon the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and imposed upon the peasants and workers a burden so intolerable that it often seemed they would not be able to endure it. But at the same time, because of its brute violence, because of the ruthlessly brutal onslaught of our so-called allies, turned wild beasts, who robbed us even before the socialist revolution, this war has performed a miracle and turned people weary of fighting and seemingly incapable of bearing another war into warriors who have not only withstood the war for two years but are bringing it to a victorious end. The victories we are now gaining over Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin signify the advent of a new phase in the history of the struggle of world imperialism against the countries and nations which have risen up to fight for their emancipation. In this respect, the two years of our Civil War have fully confirmed what has long been known to historythat the character of a war and its success depend chiefly upon the internal regime of the country that goes to war, that war is a reflection of the internal policy conducted by the given country before the war. All this is inevitably reflected in the prosecution of a war.\n\nWhich class waged the war, and is continuing to wage it, is a very important question. Only due to our Civil War being waged by workers and peasants who have emancipated themselves, and to its being a continuation of the political struggle for the emancipation of the working people from the capitalists of their own country and of the whole world-only thanks to this were people to be found in such a backward country as Russia, worn out as she was by four years of imperialist war, who were strong-willed enough to carry on that war during two years of incredible and unparalleled hardship and difficulty.\n\nThis was very strikingly illustrated in the history of the Civil War in the case of Kolchak. Kolchak was an enemy who had the assistance of all the world\u2019s strongest powers; he had a railway which was protected by some hundred thousand foreign troops, including the finest troops of the world imperialists, such as the Japanese, for example, who had been trained for the imperialist war, but took practically no part in it and therefore suffered little; Kolchak had the backing of the Siberian peasants, who were the most prosperous and had never known serfdom, and therefore, naturally, were farthest of all from communism. It seemed that Kolchak was an invincible force, because his troops were the advance guard of international imperialism. To this day, Japanese and Czechoslovak troops and the troops of a number of other imperialist nations are operating in Siberia. Nevertheless, the more than a year\u2019s experience of Kolchak\u2019s rule over Siberia and her vast natural resources, which was at first supported by the socialist parties of the Second International, by the Mensheviks and the SocialistRevolutionaries, who set up the Constituent Assembly Committee front, and which therefore, under these conditions, from the standpoint of the man in the street and of the ordinary course ofhistory, appeared to be firm and invincible that experience actually revealed the following. The farther Kolchak advanced into the heart of Russia, the more he wore himself out, and in the end we have witnessed Soviet Russia\u2019s complete triumph over Kolchak. Here we undoubtedly have practical proof that the united forces of workers and peasants who have been emancipated from the capitalist yoke can perform real miracles. Here we have practical proof that when a revolutionary war really does attract and interest the working and oppressed people, when it makes them conscious that they are fighting the exploiters-such a revolutionary war engenders the strength and ability to perform miracles.\n\nI think that what the Red Army has accomplished, its struggle, and the history of its victory, will be of colossal, epochal significance for all the peoples of the East. It will show them that, weak as they may be, and invincible as may seem the power of the European oppressors, who in the struggle employ all the marvels of technology and of the military art-nevertheless, a revolutionary war waged by oppressed peoples, if it really succeeds in arousing the millions of working and exploited people, harbours such potentialities, such miracles, that the emancipation of the peoples of the East is now quite practicable, from the standpoint not only of the prospects of the international revolution, but also of the direct military experience acquired in Asia, in Siberia, the experience of the Soviet Republic, which has suffered the armed invasion of all the powerful imperialist countries.\n\nFurthermore, the experience of the Civil War in Russia has shown us and the Communists of all countries that, in the crucible of civil war, the development of revolutionary enthusiasm is accompanied by a powerful inner cohesion. War tests all the economic and organisational forces of a nation. In the final analysis, infinitely hard as the war has been for the workers and peasants, who are suffering famine and cold, it may be said on the basis of these two years\u2019 experience that we are winning and will continue to win, because we have a hinterland, and a strong one, because, despite famine and cold, the peasants and workers stand together, have grown strong, and answer every heavy blow with a greater cohesion of their forces and increased economic might. And it is this alone that has made possible the victories over Kolchak, Yudenich and their allies, the strongest powers in the world. The past two years have shown, on the one hand, that a revolutionary war can be developed, and, on the other, that the Soviet system is growing stronger under the heavy blows of the foreign invasion, the aim of which is to destroy quickly the revolutionary centre, the republic of workers and peasants who have dared to declare war on international imperialism. But instead of destroying the workers and peasants of Russia, these heavy blows have served to harden them.\n\nThat is the chief lesson, the chief content of the present period. We are on the eve of decisive victories over Denikin, the last enemy left on our soil. We feel strong and may reiterate a thousand times over that we are not mistaken when we say that internally the Republic has become consolidated, and that we shall emerge from the war against Denikin very much stronger and better prepared for the task of erecting the socialist edifice-to which we have been able to devote all too little time and energy during the Civil War, but to which, now that we are setting foot on a free road, we shall undoubtedly be able to devote ourselves entirely.\n\nIn Western Europe we see the decay of imperialism. You know that a year ago it seemed even to the German socialists, and to the vast majority of socialists-who did not understand the state of affairs-that what was in progress was a struggle of two world imperialist groups, and they believed that this struggle constituted the whole of history, that there was no force capable of producing anything else. It seemed to them that even socialists had no alternative but to join sides with one of the groups of powerful world predators. That is how it seemed at the close of October . But we find that in the year that has since elapsed world history has witnessed unparalleled events, profound and far-reaching events, and these have opened the eyes of many socialists who during the imperialist war were patriots and justified their conduct on the plea that they were faced with an enemy; they justified their alliance with the British and French imperialists on the grounds that these were supposedly bringing delivery from German imperialism. See how many illusions were shattered by that war! We are witnessing the decay of German imperialism, a decay which has led not only to a republican, but even to a socialist revolution. You know that in Germany today the class struggle has become still more acute and that civil war is drawing nearer and nearer-a war of the German proletariat against the German imperialists, who have adopted republican colours, but who remain imperialists.\n\nEveryone knows that the social revolution is maturing in Western Europe by leaps and bounds, and that the same thing is happening in America and in Britain, the countries ostensibly representing culture and civilisation, victors over the Huns, the German imperialists. Yet when it came to the Treaty of Versailles, everyone saw that it was a hundred times more rapacious than the Treaty of B rest which the German robbers forced upon us, and that it was the heaviest blow the capitalists and imperialists of those luckless victor countries could possibly have struck at themselves. The Treaty of Versailles opened the eyes of the people of the victor nations, and showed that in the case of Britain and France, even though they are democratic states, we have before us not representatives of culture and civilisation, but countries ruled by imperialist predators The internal struggle among these predators is developing so swiftly that we may rejoice in the knowledge that the Treaty of Versailles is only a seeming victory for the jubilant imperialists, and that in reality it signifies the bankruptcy of the entire imperialist world and the resolute abandonment by the working people of those socialists who during the war allied themselves with the representatives of decaying imperialism and defended one of the groups of belligerent predators. The eyes of the working people have been opened because the Treaty of Versailles was a rapacious peace and showed that France and Britain had actually fought Germany in order to strengthen their rule over the colonies and to enhance their imperialist might. That internal struggle grows broader as time goes on. Today I saw a wireless message from London dated November , in which American journalists\u2014men who cannot be suspected of sympathising with revolutionaries\u2014say that in France an unprecedented outburst of hatred towards the Americans is to be observed, because the Americans refuse to ratify the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nBritain and France are victors, but they are up to their ears in debt to America, who has decided that the French and the British may consider themselves victors as much as they like, but that she is going to skim the cream and exact usurious interest for her assistance during the war; and the guarantee of this is to be the American Navy which is now being built and is overtaking the British Navy in size. And the crudeness of the Americans\u2019 rapacious imperialism may be seen from the fact that American agents are buying white slaves, women and girls, and shipping them to America for the development of prostitution. Just think, free, cultured America supplying white slaves for brothels! Conflicts with American agents are occurring in Poland and Belgium. That is a tiny illustration of what is taking place on a vast scale in every little country which received assistance from the Entente. Take Poland, for instance. You find American agents and profiteers going there and buying up all the wealth of Poland, who boasts that she is now an independent power. Poland is being bought up by American agents. There is not a factory or branch of industry which is not in the pockets of the Americans. The Americans have become so brazen that they are beginning to enslave that \u201cgreat and free victor\u201d, France, who was formerly a country of usurers, but is now deep in debt to America, because she has lost her economic strength, and has not enough grain or coal of her own and cannot develop her material resources on a large scale, while America insists that the tribute be paid unreservedly and in full. It is thus becoming increasingly apparent that France, Britain and other powerful countries are economically bankrupt. In the French elections the Clericats have gained the upper hand. The French people, who were deceived into devoting all their strength supposedly to the defence of freedom and democracy against Germany, have now been rewarded with an interminable debt, with the sneers of the rapacious American imperialists and, or, top of it, with a Clerical majority consisting of representatives of the most savage reaction.\n\nThe situation all over the world has become immeasurably more complicated. Our victory over Kolchak and Yudenich, those lackeys of international capital, is a big one; but far bigger, though not so evident, is the victory we are gaining on an international scale. That victory consists in the internal decay of imperialism, which is unable to send its troops against us. The Entente tried it, but to no purpose, because its troops become demoralised when they contact our troops and acquaint themselves with our Russian Soviet Constitution, translated into their languages. Despite the influence of the leaders of putrid socialism, our Constitution will always win the sympathy of the working people. The word \u201cSoviet\u201d is now understood by everybody, and the Soviet Constitution has been translated into all languages and is known to every worker. He knows that it is the constitution of working people, the political system of working people who are calling for victory over international capital, that it is a triumph we have achieved over the international imperialists. This victory of ours has had its repercussions in all imperialist countries, since we have deprived them of their own troops, won them over, deprived them of the possibility of using those troops against Soviet Russia.\n\nThey tried to wage war with the troops of other countries-Finland, Poland, and Latvia-but nothing came of it. British Minister Churchill, speaking in the House of Commons several weeks ago, boasted-and it was cabled all over the world-that a campaign of fourteen nations against Soviet Russia had been organised, and that this would result in victory over Russia by the New Year. And it is true that many nations participated in it-Finland, the Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, as well as the Czechoslovaks, the Japanese, the French, the British, and the Germans. But we know what came of it! We know that the Estonians left Yudenich\u2019s forces in the lurch; and now a fierce controversy is going on in the press because the Estonians do not want to help him, while Finland, much as her bourgeoisie wanted it, has not assisted Yudenich either. Thus the second attempt to attack us has likewise failed. The first stage was the dispatch by the Entente of its own troops, equipped according to all the rules of military technique, so that it seemed they would defeat the Soviet Republic. They have already withdrawn from the Caucasus, Archangel and the Crimea; they still remain in Murmansk, as the Czechoslovaks do in Siberia, but only as isolated groups. The first attempt of the Entente to defeat us with its own forces ended in victory for us. The second attempt consisted in launching against us nations which re our neighbours, and which are entirely dependent financially on the Entente, and in trying to force them to crush us, as a nest of socialism. But that attempt, too, ended in failure: it turned out that not one of these little countries is capable of waging such a war. What is more, hatred of the Entente has taken firm root in every little country. If Finland did not set out to capture Petrograd when Yudenich had already captured Krasnoye Solo, it was because she hesitated, realising that she could live independently side by side with Soviet Russia, but could not live in peace with the Entente. All little nations have felt that. It is felt in Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland, where chauvinism is rampant, but where there is hatred of the Entente, which is expanding its exploitation in those countries. And now, accurately assessing the course of developments, we may say without exaggeration that not only the first, but also the second stage of the international war against the Soviet Republic has failed. All that remains for us to do now is to defeat Denikin\u2019s forces, and they are already half-defeated,\n\nSuch is the present Russian and international situation, which I have summarised briefly in my address. Permit me, in conclusion, to say something about the situation that is developing in respect of the nationalities of the East. You are representatives of the communist organisations and Communist Parties of various Eastern peoples. I must say that the Russian Bolsheviks have succeeded in forcing a breach in the old imperialism, in undertaking the exceedingly difficult, but also exceedingly noble task of blazing new paths of revolution, whereas you, the representatives of the working people of the East, have before you a task that is still greater and newer. It is becoming quite clear that the socialist revolution which is impending for the whole world will not be merely the victory of the proletariat of each country over its own bourgeoisie. That would be possible if revolutions came easily and swiftly. We know that the imperialists will not allow this, that all countries are armed against their domestic Bolshevism and that their one thought is how to defeat Bolshevism at home. That is why in every country a civil war is brewing in which the old socialist compromisers are enlisted on the side of the bourgeoisie. Hence, the socialist revolution will not be solely, or chiefly, a struggle of the revolutionary proletarians in each country against their bourgeoisie-no, it will be a struggle of all the imperialist-oppressed colonies and countries, of all dependent countries, against international imperialism. Characterising the approach of the world social revolution in the Party Programme we adopted last March, we said that the civil war of the working people against the imperialists and exploiters in all the advanced countries is beginning to be combined with national wars against international imperialism. That is confirmed by the course of the revolution, and will be more and more confirmed as time goes on. It will be the same in the East.\n\nWe know that in the East the masses will rise as independent participants, as builders of a new life, because hundreds of millions of the people belong to dependent, underprivileged nations, which until now have been objects of international imperialist policy, and have only existed as material to fertilise capitalist culture and civilisation. And when they talk of handing out mandates for colonies, we know very well that it means handing out mandates for spoliation and plunder-handing out to an insignificant section of the world\u2019s population the right to exploit the majority of the population of the globe. That majority, which up till then had been completely outside the orbit of historical progress, because it could not constitute an independent revolutionary force, ceased, as we know, to play such a passive role at the beginning of the twentieth century. We know that  was followed by revolutions in Turkey, Persia and China, and that a revolutionary movement developed in India. The imperialist war likewise contributed to the growth of the revolutionary movement, because the European imperialists had to enlist whole colonial regiments in their struggle. The imperialist war aroused the East also and drew its peoples into international politics. Britain and France armed colonial peoples and helped them to familiarise themselves with military technique and up-todate machines. That knowledge they will use against the imperialist gentry. The period of the awakening of the East in the contemporary revolution is being succeeded by a period in which all the Eastern peoples will participate in deciding the destiny of the whole world, so as not to be simply objects of the enrichment of others. The peoples of the East are becoming alive to the need for practical action, the need for every nation to take part in shaping the destiny of all mankind.\n\nThat is why I think that in the history of the development of the world revolution-which, judging by its beginning, will continue for many years and will demand much effort-that in the revolutionary struggle, in the revolutionary movement you will be called upon to play a big part and to merge with our struggle against international imperialism. Your participation in the international revolution will confront you with a complicated and difficult task, the accomplishment of which will serve as the foundation for our common success, because here the majority of the people for the first time begin to act independently and will be an active factor in the fight to overthrow international imperialism.\n\nMost of the Eastern peoples are in a worse position than the most backward country in Europe-Russia. But in our struggle against feudal survivals and capitalism, we succeeded in uniting the peasants and workers of Russia; and it was because the peasants and workers united against capitalism and feudalism that our victory was so easy. Here contact with the peoples of the East is particularly important, because the majority of the Eastern peoples are typical representatives of the working people-not workers who have passed through the school of capitalist factories, but typical representatives of the working and exploited peasant masses who are victims of medieval oppression. The Russian revolution showed how the proletarians, after defeating capitalism and uniting with the vast diffuse mass of working peasants, rose up victoriously against medieval oppression. Our Soviet Republic must now muster all the awakening peoples of the East and, together with them, wage a struggle against international imperialism.\n\nIn this respect you are confronted with a task which has not previously confronted the Communists of the world: relying upon the general theory and practice of communism, you must adapt yourselves to specific conditions such as do not exist in the European countries; you must be able to apply that theory and practice to conditions in which the bulk of the population are peasants, and in which the task is to wage a struggle against medieval survivals and not against capitalism. That is a difficult and specific task, but a very thankful one, because masses that have taken no part in the struggle up to now are being drawn into it, and also because the organisation of communist cells in the East gives you an opportunity to maintain the closest contact with the Third International. You must find specific forms for this alliance of the foremost proletarians of the world with the labouring and exploited masses of the East whose conditions are in many cases medieval. We have accomplished on a small scale in our country what you will do on a big scale and in big countries. And that latter task you will, I hope, perform with success. Thanks to the communist organisations in the East, of which you here are the represelitatives, you have contact with the advanced revolutionary proletariat. Your task is to continue to ensure that communist propaganda is carried on in every country in a language the people understand.\n\nIt is self-evident that final victory can be won only by the proletariat of all the advanced countries of the world, and we, the Russians, are beginning the work which the British, French or German proletariat will consolidate. But we see that they will not be victorious without the aid of the working people of all the oppressed colonial nations, first and foremost, of Eastern nations. We must realise that the transition to communism cannot be accomplished by the vanguard alone. The task is to arouse the working masses to revolutionary activity, to independent action and to organisation, regardless of the level they have reached; to translate the true communist doctrine, which was intended for the Communists of the more advanced countries, into the language of every people; to carry out those practical tasks which must be carried out immediately, and to join the proletarians of other countries in a common struggle.\n\nSuch are the problems whose solution you will not find in any communist book, but will find in the common struggle begun by Russia. You will have to tackle that problem and solve it through your own independent experience. In that you will be assisted, on the one hand, by close alliance with the vanguard of the working people of other countries, and, on the other, by ability to find the right approach to the peoples of the East whom you here represent. You will have to base yourselves on the bourgeois nationalism which is awakening, and must awaken, among those peoples, and which has its historical justification. At the same time, you must find your way to the working and exploited masses of every country and tell them in a language they understand that their only hope of emancipation lies in the victory of the international revolution, and that the international proletariat is the only ally of all the hundreds of millions of the working and exploited peoples of the East.\n\nSuch is the immense task which confronts you, and which, thanks to the era of revolution and the growth of the revolutionary movement-of that there can be no doubt-will, by the joint efforts of the communist organisations of the East, be successfully accomplished and crowned by complete victory over international imperialism.\nEndnotes\n\n[] This Congress was held in Moscow from November  to December , , on the initiative of the Central Bureau of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East at the CC., B.C.P.(B.). On the eve of the Congress, November , a preliminary meeting of the Central Committee members with a group of delegates was held with Lenin presiding.The Congress was attended by  delegates with the right to vote and by  delegates with voice but no vote. On the opening day of the Congress, November , Lenin delivered a report on the current situation. The resolution adopted on his report was submitted to the presidium \u201cfor concretisation and drafting of the chief theses that should serve as a basis for work in the East\u201d. The Congress heard the report on the work of the Central Bureau of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East, reports from the localities, the reports of the Central Moslem War Collegium, Central Moslem Commissariat of the People\u2019s Commissariat of Nationalities; it discussed the national question of the Bashkirs and Tatars and heard reports of sections on state organisation and Party work, on work among women in the East and among the youth, etc. The Congress outlined the tasks of the Party and the government in the East, and elected a new Central Bureau of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East I read the above Theses to a small private meeting of Party functionaries on January , . The discussion on them showed three opinions in the Party on this question\u2014about a half those present spoke in favour of revolutionary war (this was sometimes called the \u00a7Moscow\u00a8 point of view because the Moscow Regional Bureau of our Party adopted it earlier than other organisations); then about a quarter were for Comrade Trotsky who proposed to declare the cessation of hostilities, demobilise the army, send the soldiers home but refrain from signing a treaty\u00a8, and, lastly, about a quarter supported me.\n\nThe state of affairs now obtaining in the Party reminds me very strongly of the situation in the summer of  when the overwhelming majority of the Bolslieviks favoured the boycott of tile Third Duma and I stood side by side with Dan in favour of participation and was subjected to furious attacks for my opportunism. Objectively, the present issue is a complete analogy; as then, the majority of the Party functionaries, proceeding from the very best revolutionary motives and the best Party traditions, allow themselves to be carried away by a \u00a7flash\u00a8 slogan and do not grasp the new socio-economic and political situation, do not take into consideration the change in the conditions that demands a speedy and abrupt change in tactics. The essence of my argument, today as then, is to make clear that Marxism demands the consideration of objective conditions and their changes, that the question must be presented concretely as applicable to those conditions, that the most significant change that has occurred is the foundation of the Russian Soviet Republic, and the preservation of the republic that has already begun the socialist revolution is most important to us and to the international socialist movement; that at the moment the slogan of revolutionary war proclaimed by Russia would either be an empty phrase and an unsupported demonstration, or would be tantamount, objectively, to falling into the trap set for us by the imperialists, who wish to inveigle us into continuing the imperialist war while we are still a weak unit, so that the young Soviet Republic might be crushed as cheaply as possible.\n\n\u00a7I stand by Lenin\u00a5s old position,\u00a8 exclaimed one young Muscovite (youth is one of the greatest virtues distinguishing that group of speakers). And that samespeaker reproached me for repeating the old arguments of the defencists about the improbability of a revolution in Germany.\n\nThe whole trouble is that the Muscovites want to stick to the old tactical position, and stubbornly refuse to see the change that has taken place, the new objective situation that has arisen.\n\nThe Muscovites, in their zealous repetition of old slogans, have not even taken into consideration the fact that we Bolsheviks have now all become defencists. Having overthrown the bourgeoisie, having denounced and exposed the secret treaties, having proposed peace to all peoples, actually... Here the manuscript breaks off .\u2014Editor.",
    "1910-1914": " The questions of the present-day working-class movement are in many respects vexed questions, particularly for representatives of that movement\u2019s recent past (i. e., of the stage which historically has just drawn to a close). This applies primarily to the questions of so-called factionalism, splits, and so forth. One often hears intellectuals in the working-class movement making nervous, feverish and almost hysterical appeals not to raise these vexed questions. Those who have experienced the long years of struggle between the various trends among Marxists since \u2014, for example, may naturally think it superfluous to repeat many of the arguments on the subject of these vexed questions.\n\nBut there are not many people left today who took part in the fourteen-year-old conflict among Marxists (not to speak of the eighteen- or nineteen-year-old conflict, counting from the moment the first symptoms of Economism appeared). The vast majority of the workers who now make up the ranks of the Marxists either do not remember the old conflict, or have never heard of it. To the overwhelming majority (as, incidentally, was shown by the opinion poll held by our journal[]), these vexed questions are a matter of exception ally great interest. We therefore intend to deal with these questions, which have been raised as it were anew (and for the younger generation of the workers they are really new) by Trotsky\u2019s \u201cnon-factional workers\u2019 journal\u201d, Borba.\n\nI. \u201cFACTIONALISM\u201d\nTrotsky calls his new journal \u201cnon-factional\u201d. He puts this word in the top line in his advertisements; this word is stressed by him in every key, in the editorial articles of Borba itself, as well as in the liquidationist Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta, which carried an article on Borba by Trotsky before the latter began publication.\n\nWhat is this \u201cnon-factionalism\u201d?\n\nTrotsky\u2019s \u201cworkers\u2019 journal\u201d is Trotsky\u2019s journal for workers, as there is not a trace in it of either workers\u2019 initiative, or any connection with working-class organisations. Desiring to write in a popular style, Trotsky, in his journal for workers, explains for the benefit of his readers the meaning of such foreign words as \u201cterritory\u201d, \u201cfactor\u201d, and so forth.\n\nVery good. But why not also explain to the workers the meaning of the word \u201cnon-factionalism\u201d? Is that word more intelligible than the words \u201cterritory\u201d and \u201cfactor\u201d?\n\nNo, that is not the reason. The reason is that the label \u201cnon-factionalism\u201d is used by the worst representatives of the worst remnants of factionalism to mislead the younger generation of workers. It is worth while devoting a little time to explaining this.\n\nGroup-division was the main distinguishing feature of the Social-Democratic Party during a definite historical period. Which period? From  to .\n\nTo explain the nature of this group-division more clearly we must recall the concrete conditions that existed in, say, \u2014. At that time the Party was united, there was no split, but group-division existed, i. e., in the united Party there were virtually two groups, two virtually separate organisations. The local workers\u2019 organisations were united, but on every important issue the two groups devised two sets of tactics. The advocates of the respective tactics disputed among themselves in the united workers\u2019 organisations (as was the case, for example, during the discussion of the slogan: a Duma, or Cadet, Ministry, in , or during the elections of delegates to the London Congress in ), and questions were decided by a majority vote. One group was defeated at the Stockholm Unity Congress (), the other was defeated at the London Unity Congress ().\n\nThese are commonly known facts in the history of organised Marxism in Russia.\n\nIt is sufficient to recall these commonly known facts to realise what glaring falsehoods Trotsky is spreading.\n\nFor over two years, since , there has been no factionalism among the organised Marxists in Russia, no disputes over tactics in united organisations, at united conferences and congresses. There is a complete break between the Party, which in January  formally announced that the liquidators do not belong to it, and the liquidators. Trotsky often calls this state of affairs a \u201csplit\u201d, and we shall deal with this appellation separately later on. But it remains an undoubted fact that the term \u201cfactionalism\u201d deviates from the truth.\n\nAs we have said, this term is a repetition, an uncritical, unreasonable, senseless repetition of what was true yesterday, i. e., in the period that has already passed. When Trotsky talks to us about the \u201cchaos of factional strife\u201d (see No. , pp. , , and many others) we realise at once which period of the past his words echo.\n\nConsider the present state of affairs from the viewpoint of the young Russian workers who now constitute nine-tenths of the organised Marxists in Russia. They see three mass expressions of the different views, or trends in the working-class movement: the Pravdists, gathered around a newspaper with a circulation of ,; the liquidators (, circulation) and the Left Narodniks (, circulation). The circulation figures tell the reader about the mass character of a given tenet.\n\nThe question arises; what has \u201cchaos\u201d got to do with it? Everybody knows that Trotsky is fond of high-sounding and empty phrases. But the catchword \u201cchaos\u201d is not only phrase-mongering; it signifies also the transplanting, or rather, a vain attempt to transplant, to Russian soil, in the present period, the relations that existed abroad in a bygone period. That is the whole point.\n\nThere is no \u201cchaos\u201d whatever in the struggle between the Marxists and the Narodniks. That, we hope, not even Trotsky will dare to deny. The struggle between the Marxists and the Narodniks has been going on for over thirty years, ever since Marxism came into being. The cause of this struggle is the radical divergence of interests and viewpoints of two different classes, the proletariat and the peasantry. If there is any \u201cchaos\u201d anywhere, it is only in the heads of cranks who fail to understand this.\n\nWhat, then, remains? \u201cChaos\u201d in the struggle between the Marxists and the liquidators? That, too, is wrong, for a struggle against a trend, which the entire Party recognised as a trend and condemned as far back as , cannot be called chaos. And everybody who has the least concern for the history of Marxism in Russia knows that liquidationism is most closely and inseverably connected, even as regards its leaders and supporters, with Menshevism (\u2014) and Economism (\u2014). Consequently, here, too, we have a history extending over nearly twenty years. To regard the history of one\u2019s own Party as \u201cchaos\u201d reveals an unpardonable empty-headedness.\n\nNow let us examine the present situation from the point of view of Paris or Vienna. At once the whole picture changes. Besides the Pravdists and liquidators, we see no less than five Russian groups claiming membership of one and the same Social-Democratic Party: Trotsky\u2019s group, two Vperyod groups, the \u201cpro-Party Bolsheviks\u201d and the \u201cpro-Party Mensheviks\u201d.[] All Marxists in Paris and in Vienna (for the purpose of illustration I take two of the largest centres) are perfectly well aware of this.\n\nHere Trotsky is right in a certain sense; this is indeed group-division, chaos indeed!\n\nGroups within the Party, i. e., nominal unity (all claim to belong to one Party) and actual disunity (for, in fact, all the groups are independent of one another and enter into negotiations and agreements with each other as sovereign powers).\n\n\u201cChaos\u201d, i. e., the absence of () objective and verifiable proof that these groups are linked with the working-class movement in Russia and () absence of any data to enable us to judge the actual ideological and political physiognomy of these groups. Take a period of two full years\u2014 and . As everybody knows, this was a period of the revival and upswing of the working-class movement, when every trend or tendency of a more or less mass character (and in politics this mass character alone counts) could not but exercise some influence on the Fourth Duma elections, the strike movement, the legal newspapers, the trade unions, the insurance election campaign, and so on. Throughout those two years, not one of these five groups abroad asserted itself in the slightest degree in any of the activities of the mass working-class movement in Russia just enumerated!\n\nThat is a fact that anybody can easily verify.\n\nAnd that fact proves that we were right in calling Trotsky a representative of the \u201cworst remnants of factionalism\u201d.\n\nAlthough he claims to be non-factional, Trotsky is known to everybody who is in the least familiar with the working-class movement in Russia as the representative of \u201cTrotsky\u2019s faction\u201d. Here we have group-division, for we see two essential symptoms of it: () nominal recognition of unity and () group segregation in fact. Here there are remnants of group-division, for there is no evidence whatever of any real connection with the mass working-class movement in Russia.\n\nAnd lastly, it is the worst form of group-division, for there is no ideological and political definiteness. It cannot be denied that this definiteness is characteristic of both the Pravdists (even our determined opponent L. Martov admits that we stand \u201csolid and disciplined\u201d around universally known formal decisions on all questions) and the liquidators (they, or at all events the most prominent of them, have very definite features, namely, liberal, not Marxist).\n\nIt cannot be denied that some of the groups which, like Trotsky\u2019s, really exist exclusively from the Vienna-Paris, but by no means from the Russian, point of view, possess a degree of definiteness. For example, the Machist theories of the Machist Vperyod group are definite; the emphatic repudiation of these theories and defence of Marxism, in addition to the theoretical condemnation of liquidationism, by the \u201cpro-Party Mensheviks\u201d, are definite.\n\nTrotsky, however, possesses no ideological and political definiteness, for his patent for \u201cnon-factionalism\u201d, as we shall soon see in greater detail, is merely a patent to flit freely to and fro, from one group to another.\n\nTo sum up:\n\n) Trotsky does not explain, nor does he understand, the historical significance of the ideological disagreements among the various Marxist trends and groups, although these disagreements run through the twenty years\u2019 history of Social Democracy and concern the fundamental questions of the present day (as we shall show later on);\n\n) Trotsky fails to understand that the main specific features of group-division are nominal recognition of unity and actual disunity;\n\n) Under cover of \u201cnon-factionalism\u201d Trotsky is championing the interests of a group abroad which particularly lacks definite principles, and has no basis in the working-class movement in Russia.\n\nAll that glitters is not gold. There is much glitter and sound in Trotsky\u2019s phrases, but they are meaningless.\n\nII. THE SPLIT\n\u201cAlthough there is no group-division, i. e., nominal recognition of unity, but actual disunity, among you, Pravdists, there is something worse, namely, splitting tactics,\u201d we are told. This is exactly what Trotsky says. Unable to think out his ideas or to get his arguments to hang together, he rants against group-division at one moment, and at the next shouts: \u201cSplitting tactics are winning one suicidal victory after another\u201d. (No. , p. .)\n\nThis statement can have only one mending: \u201cThe Pravdists are winning one victory after another\u201d (this is an objective, verifiable fact, established by a study of the mass working-class movement in Russia during, say,  and ), but I, Trotsky, denounce the Pravdists () as splitters, and () as suicidal politicians.\n\nLet us examine this.\n\nFirst of all we must express our thanks to Trotsky. Not long ago (from August  to February ) he was at one with F. Dan, who, as is well known, threatened to \u201ckill\u201d anti-liquidationism, and called upon others to do so. At present Trotsky does not threaten to \u201ckill\u201d our trend (and our Party\u2014don\u2019t be angry, Citizen Trotsky, this is true!), he only prophesies that it will kill itself!\n\nThis is much milder, isn\u2019t it? It is almost \u201cnon-factional\u201d, isn\u2019t it?\n\nBut joking apart (although joking is the only way of retorting mildly to Trotsky\u2019s insufferable phrase-mongering).\n\n\u201cSuicide\u201d is a mere empty phrase, mere \u201cTrotskyism\u201d.\n\nSplitting tactics are a grave political accusation. This accusation is repeated against us in a thousand different keys by the liquidators and by all the groups enumerated above, who, from the point of view of Paris and Vienna, actually exist.\n\nAnd all of them repeat this grave political accusation in an amazingly frivolous way. Look at Trotsky. He admitted that \u201csplitting tactics are winning [read: the Pravdists are winning] one suicidal victory after another\u201d. To this he adds:\n\n\u201cNumerouss advanced workers, in a state of utter political bewilderment, themselves often become active agents of a split.\u201d (No. , p. .)\n\nAre not these words a glaring example of irresponsibility on this question?\n\nYou accuse us of being splitters when all that we see in front of us in the arena of the working-class movement in Russia is liquidationism. So you think that our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong? Indeed, all the groups abroad that we enumerated above, no matter how much they may differ from each other, are agreed that our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong, that it is the attitude of \u201csplitters\u201d. This, too, reveals the similarity (and fairly close political kinship) between all these groups and the liquidators.\n\nIf our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong in theory, in principle, then Trotsky should say so straightforwardly, and state definitely, without equivocation, why he thinks it is wrong. But Trotsky has been evading this extremely important point for years.\n\nIf our attitude towards liquidationism has been proved wrong in practice, by the experience of the movement, then this experience should be analysed; but Trotsky fails to do this either. \u201cNumerous advanced workers,\u201d he admits, \u201cbecome active agents of a split\u201d (read: active agents of the Pravdist line, tactics, system and organisation).\n\nWhat is the cause of the deplorable fact, which, as Trotsky admits, is confirmed by experience, that the advanced workers, the numerous advanced workers at that, stand for Pravda?\n\nIt is the \u201cutter political bewilderment\u201d of these advanced workers, answers Trotsky.\n\nNeedless to say, this explanation is highly flattering to Trotsky, to all five groups abroad, and to the liquidators. Trotsky is very fond of using, with the learned air of the expert, pompous and high-sounding phrases to explain historical phenomena in a way that is flattering to Trotsky. Since \u201cnumerous advanced workers\u201d become \u201cactive agents\u201d of a political and Party line which does not conform to Trotsky\u2019s line, Trotsky settles the question unhesitatingly, out of hand: these advanced workers are \u201cin a state of utter political bewilderment\u201d, whereas he, Trotsky, is evidently \u201cin a state\u201d of political firmness and clarity, and keeps to the right line!... And this very same Trotsky, beating his breast, fulminates against factionalism, parochialism, and the efforts of intellectuals to impose their will on the workers!\n\nReading things like these, one cannot help asking oneself: is it from a lunatic asylum that such voices come?\n\nThe Party put the question of liquidationism, and of condemning it, before the \u201cadvanced workers\u201d as far back as , while the question of \u201csplitting\u201d away from a very definite group of liquidators (namely, the Nasha Zarya group), i. e., that the only way to build up the Party was without this group and in opposition to it\u2014this question was raised in January , over two years ago. The overwhelming majority of the advanced workers declared in favour of supporting the \u201cJanuary () line\u201d. Trotsky himself admits this fact when he talks about \u201cvictories\u201d and about \u201cnumerous advanced workers\u201d. But Trotsky wriggles out of this simply by hurling abuse at these advanced workers and calling them \u201csplitters\u201d and \u201cpolitically bewildered\u201d!\n\nFrom these facts sane people will draw a different conclusion. Where the majority of the class-conscious workers have rallied around precise and definite decisions, there we shall find unity of opinion and action, there we shall find the Party spirit, and the Party.\n\nWhere we see liquidators who have been \u201cremoved from office\u201d by the workers, or half a dozen groups outside Russia, who for two years have produced no proof that they are connected with the mass working-class movement in Russia, there, indeed, we shall find bewilderment and splits. In now trying to persuade the workers not to carry out the decisions of that \u201cunited whole\u201d, which the Marxist Pravdists recognise, Trotsky is trying to disrupt the movement and cause a split.\n\nThese efforts are futile, but we must expose the arrogantly conceited leaders of intellectualist groups, who, while causing splits themselves, are shouting about others causing splits; who, after sustaining utter defeat at the hands of the \u201cadvanced workers\u201d for the past two years or more, are with incredible insolence flouting the decisions and the will of these advanced workers and saying that they are \u201cpolitically bewildered\u201d. These are entirely the methods of Nozdrev,[] or of \u201cJudas\u201d Golovlyov.[]\n\nIn reply to these repeated outcries about a split and in fulfilment of my duty as a publicist, I will not tire of repeating precise, unrefuted and irrefutable figures. In the Second Duma,  per cent of the deputies elected by the worker curia were Bolsheviks, in the Third Duma  per cent were Bolsheviks, and in the Fourth Duma  per cent.\n\nThere you have the majority of the \u201cadvanced workers\u201d, there you have the Party; there you have unity of opinion and action of the majority of the class-conscious workers.\n\nTo this the liquidators say (see Bulkin, L. M., in Nasha Zarya No. ) that we base our arguments on the Stolypin curias. This is a foolish and unscrupulous argument. The Germans measure their successes by the results of elections conducted under the Bismarckian electoral law, which excludes women. Only people bereft of their senses would reproach the German Marxists for measuring their successes under the existing electoral law, without in the least justifying its reactionary restrictions.\n\nAnd we, too, without justifying curias, or the curia system, measured our successes under the existing electoral law. There were curias in all three (Second, Third and Fourth) Duma elections; and within the worker curia, within the ranks of Social-Democracy, there was a complete swing against the liquidators. Those who do not wish to deceive themselves and others must admit this objective fact, namely, the victory of working-class unity over the liquidators.\n\nThe other argument is just as \u201cclever\u201d: \u201cMensheviks and liquidators voted for (or took part in the election of) such and-such a Bolshevik.\u201d Splendid! But does not the same thing apply to the  per cent non-Bolshevik deputies re turned to the Second Duma, and to the  per cent returned to the Third Duma, and to the  per cent returned to the Fourth Duma?\n\nIf, instead of the figures on the deputies elected, we could obtain the figures on the electors, or workers\u2019 delegates, etc., we would gladly quote them. But these more detailed figures are not available, and consequently the \u201cdisputants\u201d are simply throwing dust in people\u2019s eyes.\n\nBut what about the figures of the workers\u2019 groups that assisted the newspapers of the different trends? During two years ( and ), , groups assisted Pravda, and  assisted Luch.[] These figures are verifiable and nobody has attempted to disprove them.\n\nWhere is the unity of action and will of the majority of the \u201cadvanced workers\u201d, and where is the flouting of the will of the majority?\n\nTrotsky\u2019s \u201cnon-factionalism\u201d is, actually, splitting tactics, in that it shamelessly flouts the will of the majority of the workers.\n\nIII. THE BREAK-UP OF THE AUGUST BLOC\nBut there is still another method, and a very important one, of verifying the correctness and truthfulness of Trotsky\u2019s accusations about splitting tactics.\n\nYou consider that it is the \u201cLeninists\u201d who are splitters? Very well, let us assume that you are right.\n\nBut if you are, why have not all the other sections and groups proved that unity is possible with the liquidators without the \u201cLeninists\u201d, and against the \u201csplitters\u201d?... If we are splitters, why have not you, uniters, united among yourselves, and with the liquidators? Had you done that you would have proved to the workers by deeds that unity is possible and beneficial!...\n\nLet us go over the chronology of events.\n\nIn January , the \u201cLeninist\u201d \u201csplitters\u201d declared that they were a Party without and against the liquidators.\n\nIn March , all the groups and \u201cfactions\u201d: liquidators, Trotskyists, Vperyodists, \u201cpro-Party Bolsheviks\u201d and \u201cpro-Party Mensheviks\u201d, in their Russian news sheets and in the columns of the German Social-Democratic newspaper Vorw\\\"arts, united against these \u201csplitters\u201d. All of them unanimously, in chorus, in unison and in one voice vilified us and called us \u201cusurpers\u201d, \u201cmystifiers\u201d, and other no less affectionate and tender names.\n\nVery well, gentlemen! But what could have been easier for you than to unite against the \u201cusurpers\u201d and to set the \u201cadvanced workers\u201d an example of unity? Do you mean to say that if the advanced workers had seen, on the one hand, the unity of all against the usurpers, the unity of liquidators and non-liquidators, and on the other, isolated \u201cusurpers\u201d, \u201csplitters\u201d, and so forth; they would not have supported the former?\n\nIf disagreements are only invented, or exaggerated, and so forth, by the \u201cLeninists\u201d, and if unity between the liquidators, Plekhanovites, Vperyodists, Trotskyists, and so forth, is really possible, why have you not proved this during the past two years by your own example?\n\nIn August , a conference of \u201cuniters\u201d was convened. Disunity started at once: the Plekhanovites refused to attend at all; the Vperyodists attended, but walked out after protesting and exposing the fictitious character of the whole business.\n\nThe liquidators, the Letts, the Trotskyists (Trotsky and Semkovsky), the Caucasians, and the Seven \u201cunited\u201d. But did they? We stated at the time that they did not, that this was merely a screen to cover up liquidationism. Have the events disproved our statement?\n\nExactly eighteen months later, in February , we found:\n\n. that the Seven was breaking up. Buryanov had left them.\n\n. that in the remaining new \u201cSix\u201d, Chkheidze and Tulyakov, or somebody else, could not see eye to eye on the reply to be made to Plekhanov. They stated in the press that they would reply to him, but they could not.\n\n. that Trotsky, who for many months had practically vanished from the columns of Luck, had broken away, and had started \u201chis own\u201d journal, Borba. By calling this journal \u201cnon-factional\u201d, Trotsky clearly (clearly to those who are at all familiar with the subject) intimates that in his, Trotsky\u2019s, opinion, Nasha Zarya and Luch had proved to be \u201cfactional\u201d, i. e., poor uniters.\n\nIf you are a uniter, my dear Trotsky, if you say that it is possible to unite with the liquidators, if you and they stand by the \u201cfundamental ideas formulated in August \u201d (Borba No. , p. , Editorial Note), why did not you yourself unite with the liquidators in Nasha Zarya and Luch?\n\nWhen, before Trotsky\u2019s journal appeared, Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta published some scathing comment stating that the physiognomy of this journal was \u201cunclear\u201d and that there had been \u201cquite a good deal of talk in Marxist circles\u201d about this journal, Put Pravdy (No. )[] was naturally obliged to expose this falsehood. It said: \u201cThere has been talk in Marxist circles\u201d about a secret memorandum written by Trotsky against the Luch group; Trotsky\u2019s physiognomy and his breakaway from the August bloc were perfectly \u201cclear\u201d.\n\n. An, the well-known leader of the Caucasian liquidators, who had attacked L. Sedov (for which he was given a public wigging by F. Dan and Co.), now appeared in Borba. It remains \u201cunclear\u201d whether the Caucasians now desire to go with Trotsky or with Dan.\n\n. The Lettish Marxists, who were the only real organisation in the \u201cAugust bloc\u201d, had formally withdrawn from it, stating (in ) in the resolution of their last Congress that:\n\n\u201cthe attempt on the part of the conciliators to unite at all costs with the liquidators (the August Conference of ) proved fruitless, and the uniters themselves became ideologically and politically dependent upon the liquidators.\u201d\n\nThis statement was made,after eighteen months\u2019 experience, by an organisation which had itself been neutral and had not desired to establish connection with either of the two centres. This decision of neutrals should carry all the more weight with Trotsky!\n\nEnough, is it not?\n\nThose who accused us of being splitters, of being unwilling or unable to get on with the liquidators, were themselves unable to get on with them. The August bloc proved to be a fiction and broke up.\n\nBy concealing this break-up from his readers, Trotsky is deceiving them.\n\nThe experience of our opponents has proved that we are right, has proved that the liquidators cannot be co-operated with.\n\nIV. A CONCILIATOR\u2019S ADVICE TO THE \u201cSEVEN\u201d\nThe editorial article in issue No.  of Borba entitled \u201cThe Split in the Duma Group\u201d contains advice from a conciliator to the seven pro-liquidator (or inclining towards liquidationism) members of the Duma. The gist of this advice is contained in the following words:\n\n\u201cfirst of all consult the Six whenever it is necessary to reach an agreement with other groups....\u201d (P. .)\n\nThis is the wise counsel which, among other things, is evidently the cause of Trotsky\u2019s disagreement with the liquidators of Luch. This is the opinion the Pravdists have held ever since the outbreak of the conflict between the two groups in the Duma, ever since the resolution of the Summer () Conference was adopted. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma has reiterated in the press, even after the split, that it continues to adhere to this position, in spite of the repeated refusals of the Seven.\n\nFrom the very outset, since the time the resolution of the Summer Conference was adopted, we have been, and still are, of the opinion that agreements on questions concerning activities in the Duma are desirable and possible; if such agreements have been repeatedly arrived at with the petty-bourgeois peasant democrats (Trudoviks), they are all the more possible and necessary with the petty-bourgeois, liberal-labour politicians.\n\nWe must not exaggerate disagreements, but we must face the facts: the Seven are men, leaning towards liquidationism, who yesterday entirely followed the lead of Dan, and whose eyes today are travelling longingly from Dan to Trotsky and back again. The liquidators are a group of legalists who have broken away from the Party and are pursuing a liberal- labour policy. Since they repudiate the \u201cunderground\u201d, there can be no question of unity with them in matters concerning Party organisation and the working-class movement. Who ever thinks differently is badly mistaken and fails to take into account the profound nature of the changes that have taken place since .\n\nBut agreements on certain questions with this group, which stands outside or on the fringe of the Party, are, of course, permissible: we must always compel this group, too, like the Trudoviks, to choose between the workers\u2019 (Pravdist) policy and the liberal policy. For example, on the question of fighting for freedom of the press the liquidators clearly revealed, vacillation between the liberal formulation of the question, which repudiated, or overlooked, the illegal press, and the opposite policy, that of the workers.\n\nWithin the scope of a Duma policy in which the most important extra-Duma issues are not directly raised, agreements with the seven liberal-labour deputies are possible and desirable. On this point Trotsky has shifted his ground from that of the liquidators to that of the Party Summer () Conference.\n\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that to a group standing outside the Party, agreement means something entirely different from what Party people usually understand by the term. By \u201cagreement\u201d in the Duma, non-Party people mean \u201cdrawing up a tactical resolution, or line\u201d. To Party people agreement is an attempt to enlist others in the work of carrying out the Party line.\n\nFor example, the Trudoviks have no party. By agreement they understand the \u201cvoluntary\u201d, so to speak, \u201cdrawing up\u201d of a line, today with the Cadets, tomorrow with the Social-Democrats. We, however, understand something entirely different by agreement with the Trudoviks. We have Party decisions on all the important questions of tactics, and we shall never depart from these decisions; by agreement with the Trudoviks we mean winning them over to our side, convincing them that we are right, and not rejecting joint action against the Black Hundreds and against the liberals.\n\nHow far Trotsky has forgotten (not for nothing has he associated with the liquidators) this elementary difference between the Party and non-Party point of view on agreements, is shown by the following argument of his:\n\n\u201cThe representatives of the International must bring together the two sections of our divided parliamentary group and jointly with them ascertain the points of agreement and points of disagreement.... A detailed tactical resolution formulating the principles of parliamentary tactics may he drawn up....\u201d (No. , pp. \u2014.)\n\nHere you have a characteristic and typical example of the liquidationist presentation of the question! Trotsky\u2019s journal forgets about the Party; such a trifle is hardly worth remembering!\n\nWhen different parties in Europe (Trotsky is fond of inappropriately talking about Europeanism) come to an agreement or unite, what they do is this: their respective representatives meet and first of all ascertain the points of disagreement (precisely what the International proposed in relation to Russia, without including in the resolution Kautsky\u2019s ill-considered statement that \u201cthe old Party no longer exists\u201d[]). Having ascertained the points of disagreement, the representatives decide what decisions (resolutions, conditions, etc.) on questions of tactics, organisation, etc., should be submitted to the congresses of the two parties. If they succeed in drafting unanimous decisions, the congresses decide whether to adopt them or not. If differing proposals are made, they too are submitted for final decision to the congresses of the two parties.\n\nWhat appeals to the liquidators and Trotsky is only the European models of opportunism, but certainly not the models of European partisanship.\n\n\u201cA detailed tactical resolution\u201d will be drawn up by the members of the Duma! This example should serve the Russian \u201cadvanced workers\u201d, with whom Trotsky has good reason to be so displeased, as a striking illustration of the lengths to which the groups in Vienna and Paris\u2014who persuaded even Kautsky that there was \u201cno Party\u201d in Russia\u2014go in their ludicrous project-mongering. But if it is some times possible to fool foreigners on this score, the Russian \u201cadvanced workers\u201d (at the risk of provoking the terrible Trotsky to another outburst of displeasure) will laugh in the faces of these project-mongers.\n\n\u201cDetailed tactical resolutions,\u201d they will tell them, \u201care drawn up among us (we do not know how it is done among you lion-Party people) by Party congresses and conferences, for example, those of , , ,  and . We shall gladly acquaint uninformed foreigners, as well as forgetful Russians, with our Party decisions, and still more gladly ask the representatives of the Seven, or the August bloc members, or Left-wingers or anybody else, to acquaint us with the resolutions of their congresses, or conferences, and to bring up at their next congress the definite question of the attitude they should adopt towards our resolutions, or towards the resolution of the neutral Lettish Congress of , etc.\u201d\n\nThis is what the \u201cadvanced workers\u201d of Russia will say to the various project-mongers, and this has already been said iii the Marxist press, for example, by the organised Marxists of St. Petersburg. Trotsky chooses to ignore these published terms for the liquidators? So much the worse for Trotsky. It is our duty to warn our readers how ridiculous that \u201cunity\u201d (the August type of \u201cunity\u201d?) project-mongering is which refuses to reckon with the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia.\n\nV. TROTSKY\u2019S LIQUIDATIONIST VIEWS\nAs to the substance of his own views, Trotsky contrived to say as little as possible in his new journal. Put Pravdy (No. ) has already commented on the fact that Trotsky has not said a word either on the question of the \u201cunderground\u201d or on the slogan of working for a legal party, etc.[] That, among other things, is why we say that when attempts are made to form a separate organisation which is to have no ideological and political physiognomy, it is the worst form of factionalism.\n\nAlthough Trotsky has refrained from openly expounding his views, quite a number of passages in his journal show what kind of ideas he has been trying to smuggle in.\n\nIn the very first editorial article in the first issue of his journal, we read the following:\n\n\u201cThe pre-revolutionary Social-Democratic Party in our country was a workers\u2019 party only in ideas and aims. Actually, it was an organisation of the Marxist intelligentsia, which led the awakening working class.\u201d (.)\n\nThis is the old liberal and liquidationist tune, which is really the prelude to the repudiation of the Party. It is based on a distortion of the historical facts. The strikes of \u2014 had already given rise to a mass working-class movement, which both in ideas and organisation was linked with the Social-Democratic movement. And in these strikes, in this economic and non-economic agitation, the \u201cintelligentsia led the working class\u201d!?\n\nOr take the following exact statistics of political offences in the period \u2014 compared with the preceding period.\n\nOccupations of participants in the emancipation movement prosecuted for political offences (per cent)\nPeriod\tAgriculture\tIndustry and\ncommerce\tLiberal\nprofessions\nand students\tNo definite\noccupation, and\nno occupation\n\u2014\t.\t.\t.\t.\n\u2014\t.\t.\t.\t.\nWe see that in the eighties, when there was as yet no Social-Democratic Party in Russia, and when the movement was \u201cNarodnik\u201d, the intelligentsia predominated, accounting for over half the participants.\n\nBut the picture underwent a complete change in \u2014, when a Social-Democratic Party already existed, and when the old Iskra was conducting its work. The intelligentsia were now a minority among the participants of the movement; the workers (\u201cindustry and commerce\u201d) were far more numerous than the intelligentsia, and the workers and peasants together constituted more than half the total.\n\nIt was precisely in the conflict of trends within the Marxist movement that the petty-bourgeois intellectualist wing of the Social-Democracy made itself felt, beginning with Economism (\u2014) and continuing with Menshevism (\u2014) and liquidationism (\u2014). Trotsky repeats the liquidationist slander against the Party and is afraid to mention the history of the twenty years\u2019 conflict of trends within the Party.\n\nHere is another example.\n\n\u201cIn its attitude towards parliamentarism, Russian Social-Democracy passed through the same three stages ... [as in other countries] ... first \u2018boycottism\u2019 ... then the acceptance in principle of parliamentary tactics, but ... [that magnificent \u201cbut\u201d, the \u201cbut\u201d which Shchedrin translated as: The ears never grow higher than the forehead, never![]]... for purely agitational purposes ... and lastly, the presentation from the Duma rostrum ... of current demands....\u201d (No. , p. .)\n\nThis, too, is a liquidationist distortion of history. The distinction between the second and third stages was invent ed in order to smuggle in a defence of reformism and opportunism. Boycottism as a stage in \u201cthe attitude of Social-Democracy towards parliamentarism\u201d never existed either in Europe (where anarchism has existed and continues to exist) or in Russia, where the boycott of the Bulygin Duma, for example, applied only to a definite institution, was never linked with \u201cparliamentarism\u201d, and was engendered by the peculiar nature of the struggle between liberalism and Marxism for the continuation of the onslaught. Trotsky does not breathe a word, about the way this struggle affected the conflict between the two trends in Marxism!\n\nWhen dealing with history, one must explain concrete questions and the class roots of the different trends; anybody who wants to make a Marxist study of the struggle of classes and trends over the question of participation in the Bulygin Duma, will see therein the roots of the liberal-labour policy. But Trotsky \u201cdeals with\u201d history only in order to evade concrete questions and to invent a justification, or a semblance of justification, for the present-day opportunists!\n\n\u201cActually, all trends,\u201d he writes, \u201cemploy the same methods of struggle and organisation.\u201d \u201cThe outcries about the liberal danger in our working-class movement are simply a crude and sectarian travesty of reality.\u201d (No. , pp.  and .)\n\nThis is a very clear and very vehement, defence of the liquidators. But we will take the liberty of quoting at least one small fact, one of the very latest. Trotsky merely slings words about; we should like the workers themselves to ponder over the facts.\n\nIt is a fact that Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta for March  wrote the following:\n\n\u201cInstead of emphasising the definite and concrete task that confronts the working class, viz., to compel the Duma to throw out the bill [on the press], a vague formula is proposed of fighting for the \u2018uncurtailed slogans\u2019, and at the same time the illegal press is widely advertised, which can only lead to the relaxation of the workers\u2019 struggle for their legal press.\u201d\n\nThis is a clear, precise and documentary defence of the liquidationist policy and a criticism of the Pravda policy. Well, will any literate person say that both trends employ \u201cthe same methods of struggle and organisation\u201d on this question? Will any literate person say that the liquidators are not pursuing a liberal-labour policy on this question, that the liberal menace to the working-class movement is purely imaginary?\n\nThe reason why Trotsky avoids facts and concrete references is because they relentlessly refute all his angry outcries and pompous phrases. It is very easy, of course, to strike an attitude and say: \u201ca crude and sectarian travesty\u201d. Or to add a still more stinging and pompous catch-phrase, such as \u201cemancipation from conservative factionalism\u201d.\n\nBut is this not very cheap? Is not this weapon borrowed from the arsenal of the period when Trotsky posed in all his splendour before audiences of high-school boys?\n\nNevertheless, the \u201cadvanced workers\u201d, with whom Trotsky is so angry, would like to be told plainly and clearly: Do you or do you not approve of the \u201cmethod of struggle and organisation\u201d that is definitely expressed in the above-quoted appraisal of a definite political campaign? If you do, then you are pursuing a liberal-labour policy, betraying Marxism and the Party; to talk of \u201cpeace\u201d or of \u201cunity\u201d with such a policy, with groups which pursue such a policy, means deceiving yourself and others.\n\nIf not, then say so plainly. Phrases will not astonish, satisfy or intimidate the present-day workers.\n\nIncidentally, the policy advocated by the liquidators in the above-quoted passage is a foolish one even from the liberal point of view, for the passage of a bill in the Duma depends on \u201cZemstvo-Octobrists\u201d of the type of Bennigsen, who has already shown his hand in the committee.\n\n*     *\n*\nThe old participants in the Marxist movement in Russia know Trotsky very well, and there is no need to discuss him for their benefit. But the younger generation of workers do not know him, and it is therefore necessary to discuss him, for he is typical of all the five groups abroad, which, in fact, are also vacillating between the liquidators and the Party.\n\nIn the days of the old Iskra (\u2014), these waverers, who flitted from the Economists to the Iskrists and back again, were dubbed \u201cTushino turncoats\u201d (the name given in the Troublous Times in Rus to fighting men who went over from one camp to another[]).\n\nWhen we speak of liquidationism we speak of a definite ideological trend, which grew up in the course of many years, stems from Menshevism and Economism in the twenty years\u2019 history of Marxism, and is connected with the policy and ideology of a definite class\u2014the liberal bourgeoisie.\n\nThe only ground the \u201cTushino turncoats\u201d have for claiming that they stand above groups is that they \u201cborrow\u201d their ideas from one group one day and from another the next day. Trotsky was an ardent Iskrist in \u2014, and Ryazanov described his role at the Congress of  as \u201cLenin\u2019s cudgel\u201d. At the end of , Trotsky was an ardent Menshevik, i. e., he deserted from the Iskrists to the Economists. He said that \u201cbetween the old Iskra and the new lies a gulf\u201d. In \u2014, he deserted the Mensheviks and occupied a vacillating position, now co-operating with Martynov (the Economist), now proclaiming his absurdly Left \u201cpermanent revolution\u201d theory. In \u2014, he approached the Bolsheviks, and in the spring of  he declared that he was in agreement with Rosa Luxemburg.\n\nIn the period of disintegration, after long \u201cnon-factional\u201d vacillation, he again went to the right, and in August , he entered into a bloc with the liquidators. He has now deserted them again, although in substance he reiterates their shoddy ideas.\n\nSuch types are characteristic of the flotsam of past historical formations, of the time when the mass, working-class movement in Russia was still dormant, and when every group had \u201cample room\u201d in which to pose as a trend, group or faction, in short, as a \u201cpower\u201d, negotiating amalgamation with others.\n\nThe younger generation of workers should know exactly whom they are dealing with, when individuals come before them with incredibly pretentious claims, unwilling absolutely to reckon with either the Party decisions, which since  have defined and established our attitude towards liquidationism, or with the experience of the present-day working-class movement in Russia, which has actually brought about the unity of the majority on the basis of full recognition of the aforesaid decisions. \nThe European war, which the governments and the bourgeois parties of all countries have been preparing for decades, has broken out. The growth of armaments, the extreme intensification of the struggle for markets in the latest\u2014the imperialist\u2014stage of capitalist development in the advanced countries, and the dynastic interests of the more backward East-European monarchies were inevitably bound to bring about this war, and have done so. Seizure of territory and subjugation of other nations, the ruining of competing nations and the plunder of their wealth, distracting the attention of the working masses from the internal political crises in Russia, Germany, Britain and other countries, disuniting and nationalist stultification of the workers, and the extermination of their vanguard so as to weaken the revolutionary movement of the proletariat\u2014these comprise the sole actual content, importance and significance of the present war.\n\nIt is primarily on Social-Democracy that the duty rests of revealing the true meaning of the war, and of ruthlessly exposing the falsehood, sophistry and \u201cpatriotic\u201d phrasemongering spread by the ruling classes, the landowners and the bourgeoisie, in defence of the war.\n\nOne group of belligerent nations is headed by the German bourgeoisie. It is hoodwinking the working class and the toiling masses by asserting that this is a war in defence of the fatherland, freedom and civilisation, for the liberation of the peoples oppressed by tsarism, and for the destruction of reactionary tsarism. In actual fact, however, this bourgeoisie, which servilely grovels to the Prussian Junkers, headed by Wilhelm II, has always been a most faithful ally of tsarism, and an enemy of the revolutionary movement of Russia\u2019s workers and peasants. In fact, whatever the outcome of the war, this bourgeoisie will together with the   Junkers, exert every effort to support the tsarist monarchy against a revolution in Russia.\n\nIn fact, the German bourgeoisie has launched a robber campaign against Serbia, with the object of subjugating her and throttling the national revolution of the Southern Slavs, at the same time sending the bulk of its military forces against the freer countries, Belgium and France, so as to plunder richer competitors. In fact, the German bourgeoisie, which has been spreading the fable that it is waging a war of defence, chose the moment it thought most favourable for war, making use of its latest improvements in military mat\u00e9riel and forestalling the rearmament already planned and decided upon by Russia and France.\n\nThe other group of belligerent nations is headed by the British and the French bourgeoisie, who are hoodwinking the working class and the toiling masses by asserting that they are waging a war for the defence of their countries, for freedom and civilisation and against German militarism and despotism. In actual fact, this bourgeoisie has long been spending thousands of millions to hire the troops of Russian tsarism, the most reactionary and barbarous monarchy in Europe, and prepare them for an attack on Germany.\n\nIn fact, the struggle of the British and the French bourgeoisie is aimed at the seizure of the German colonies, and the ruining of a rival nation, whose economic development has been more rapid. In pursuit of this noble aim, the \u201cadvanced\u201d \u201cdemocratic\u201d nations are helping the savage tsarist regime to still more throttle Poland, the Ukraine, etc., and more thoroughly crush the revolution in Russia.\n\nNeither group of belligerents is inferior to the other in spoiliation, atrocities and the boundless brutality of war; however, to hoodwink the proletariat and distract its attention from the only genuine war of liberation, namely, a civil war against the bourgeoisie both of its \u201cown\u201d and of \u201cforeign\u201d countries\u2014to achieve so lofty an aim\u2014the bourgeoisie of each country is trying, with the help of false phrases about patriotism, to extol the significance of its \u201cown\u201d national war, asserting that it is out to defeat the enemy, not for plunder and the seizure of territory, but for the \u201cliberation\u201d of all other peoples except its own.\n\nBut the harder the governments and the bourgeoisie of all countries try to disunite the workers and pit them against one another, and the more savagely they enforce, for this lofty aim, martial law and the military censorship (measures which even now, in wartime, are applied against the \u201cinternal\u201d foe more harshly than against the external), the more pressingly is it the duty of the class-conscious proletariat to defend its class solidarity, its internationalism, and its socialist convictions against the unbridled chauvinism of the \u201cpatriotic\u201d bourgeois cliques in all countries. If class-conscious workers were to give up this aim, this would mean renunciation of their aspirations for freedom and democracy, to say nothing of their socialist aspirations.\n\nIt is with a feeling of the most bitter disappointment that we have to record that the socialist parties of the leading European countries have failed to discharge this duty, the behaviour of these parties\u2019 leaders, particularly in Germany, bordering on downright betrayal of the cause of socialism. At this time of supreme and historic importance, most of the leaders of the present Socialist International, the Second (-), are trying to substitute nationalism for socialism. As a result of their behaviour, the workers\u2019 parties of these countries did not oppose the governments\u2019 criminal conduct, but called upon the working class to identify its position with that of the imperialist governments. The leaders of the International committed an act of treachery against socialism by voting for war credits, by reiterating the chauvinist (\u201cpatriotic\u201d) slogans of the bourgeoisie of their \u201cown\u201d countries, by justifying and defending the war, by joining the bourgeois governments of the belligerent countries, and so on and so forth. The most influential socialist leaders and the most influential organs of the socialist press of present-day Europe hold views that are chauvinist, bourgeois and liberal, and in no way socialist. The responsibility for thus disgracing socialism falls primarily on the German Social-Democrats, who were the strongest and most influential party in the Second International. But neither can one justify the French socialists, who have accepted ministerial posts in the government of that very bourgeoisie which betrayed its country and allied itself with Bismarck so as to crush the Commune.\n\nThe German and the Austrian Social-Democrats are attempting to justify their support for the war by arguing that they are thereby fighting against Russian tsarism. We Russian Social-Democrats declare that we consider such justification sheer sophistry. In our country the revolutionary movement against tsarism has again assumed tremendous proportions during the past few years. This movement has always been headed by the working class of Russia. The political strikes of the last few years, which have involved millions of workers, have had as their slogan the overthrow of tsarism and the establishment of a democratic republic. During his visit to Nicholas II on the very eve of the war, Poincar\u00e9, President of the French Republic, could see for himself, in the streets of St. Petersburg, barricades put up by Russian workers. The Russian proletariat has not flinched from any sacrifice to rid humanity of the disgrace of the tsarist monarchy. We must, however, say that if there is anything that, under certain conditions, can delay the downfall of tsarism, anything that can help tsarism in its struggle against the whole of Russia\u2019s democracy, then that is the present war, which has placed the purses of the British, the French and the Russian bourgeois at the disposal of tsarism, to further the latter\u2019s reactionary aims. If there is anything that can hinder the revolutionary struggle of the Russia\u2019s working class against tsarism, then that is the behaviour of the German and the Austrian Social-Democratic leaders, which the chauvinist press of Russia is continually holding up to us as an example.\n\nEven assuming that German Social-Democracy was so weak that it was compelled to refrain from all revolutionary action, it should not have joined the chauvinist camp, or taken steps which gave the Italian socialists reason to say that the German Social-Democratic leaders were dishonouring the banner of the proletarian International.\n\nOur Party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, has made, and will continue to make great sacrifices in connection with the war. The whole of our working-class legal press has been suppressed. Most working-class associations have been disbanded, and a large number of our comrades have been arrested and exiled. Yet our parliamentary representatives\u2014the Russian Social-Democratic Labour   group in the Duma\u2014considered it their imperative socialist duty not to vote for the war credits, and even to walk out of the Duma, so as to express their protest the more energetically; they considered it their duty to brand the European governments\u2019 policy as imperialist. Though the tsar\u2019s government has increased its tyranny tenfold, the Social-Democratic workers of Russia are already publishing their first illegal manifestos against the war, thus doing their duty to democracy and to the International.\n\nWhile the collapse of the Second International has given rise to a sense of burning shame in revolutionary Social-Democrats\u2014as represented by the minority of German Social-Democrats and the finest Social-Democrats in the neutral countries; while socialists in both Britain and France have been speaking up against the chauvinism of most Social-Democratic parties; while the opportunists, as represented, for instance, by the German Sozialistische Monatshefte, which have long held a national-liberal stand, are with good reason celebrating their victory over European socialism\u2014the worst possible service is being rendered to the proletariat by those who vacillate between opportunism and revolutionary Social-Democracy (like the \u201cCentre\u201d in the German Social-Democratic Party), by those who are trying to hush up the collapse of the Second International or to disguise it with diplomatic phrases.\n\nOn the contrary, this collapse must be frankly recognised and its causes understood, so as to make it possible to build up a new and more lasting socialist unity of the workers of all countries.\n\nThe opportunists have wrecked the decisions of the Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Basle congresses,[] which made it binding on socialists of all countries to combat chauvinism in all and any conditions, made it binding on socialists to reply to any war begun by the bourgeoisie and governments, with intensified propaganda of civil war and social revolution. The collapse of the Second International is the collapse of opportunism, which developed from the features of a now bygone (and so-called \u201cpeaceful\u201d) period of history, and in recent years has come practically to dominate the International. The opportunist have long been preparing the ground for this collapse by denying the socialist   revolution and substituting bourgeois reformism in its stead; by rejecting the class struggle with its inevitable conversion at certain moments into civil war, and by preaching class collaboration; by preaching bourgeois chauvinism under the guise of patriotism and the defence of the fatherland, and ignoring or rejecting the fundamental truth of socialism, long ago set forth in the Communist Manifesto, that the workingmen have no country; by confining themselves, in the struggle against militarism, to a sentimental, philistine point of view, instead of recognising the need for a revolutionary war by the proletarians of all countries, against the bourgeoisie of all countries; by making a fetish of the necessary utilisation of bourgeois parliamentarianism and bourgeois legality, and forgetting that illegal forms of organisation and propaganda are imperative at times of crises. The natural \u201cappendage\u201d to opportunism\u2014one that is just as bourgeois and hostile to the proletarian, i.e., the Marxist, point of view\u2014namely, the anarcho-syndicalist trend, has been marked by a no less shamefully smug reiteration of the slogans of chauvinism, during the present crisis.\n\nThe aims of socialism at the present time cannot be fulfilled, and real international unity of the workers cannot be achieved, without a decisive break with opportunism, and without explaining its inevitable fiasco to the masses.\n\nIt must be the primary task of Social-Democrats in every country to combat that country\u2019s chauvinism. In Russia this chauvinism has overcome the bourgeois liberals (the \u201cConstitutional-Democrats\u201d), and part of the Narodniks\u2014down to the Socialist-Revolutionaries[] and the \u201cRight\u201d Social-Democrats. (In particular, the chauvinist utterances of E. Smirnov, P. Maslov and G. Plekhanov, for example, should be branded; they have been taken up and widely used by the bourgeois \u201cpatriotic\u201d press.)\n\nIn the present situation, it is impossible to determine, from the standpoint of the international proletariat, the defeat of which of the two groups of belligerent nations would be the lesser evil for socialism. But to us Russian Social-Democrats there cannot be the slightest doubt that, from the standpoint of the working class and of the toiling masses of all the nations of Russia, the defeat of the tsarist   monarchy, the most reactionary and barbarous of governments, which is oppressing the largest number of nations and the greatest mass of the population of Europe and Asia, would be the lesser evil.\n\nThe formation of a republican United States of Europe should be the immediate political slogan of Europe\u2019s Social-Democrats. In contrast with the bourgeoisie, which is ready to \u201cpromise\u201d anything in order to draw the proletariat into the mainstream of chauvinism, the Social-Democrats will explain that this slogan is absolutely false and meaningless without the revolutionary overthrow of the German, the Austrian and the Russian monarchies.\n\nSince Russia is most backward and has not yet completed its bourgeois revolution, it still remains the task of Social-Democrats in that country to achieve the three fundamental conditions for consistent democratic reform, viz., a democratic republic (with complete equality and self-determination for all nations), confiscation of the landed estates, and an eight-hour working day. But in all the advanced countries the war has placed on the order of the day the slogan of socialist revolution, a slogan that is the more urgent, the more heavily the burden of war presses upon the shoulders of the proletariat, and the more active its future role must become in the re-creation of Europe, after the horrors of the present \u201cpatriotic\u201d barbarism in conditions of the tremendous technological progress of large-scale capitalism. The bourgeoisie\u2019s use of wartime laws to gag the proletariat makes it imperative for the latter to create illegal forms of agitation and organisation. Let the opportunists \u201cpreserve\u201d the legal organisations at the price of treachery to their convictions\u2014revolutionary Social-Democrats will utilise the organisational experience and links of the working class so as to create illegal forms of struggle for socialism, forms appropriate to a period of crisis, and to unite the workers, not with the chauvinist bourgeoisie of their respective countries, but with the workers of all countries. The proletarian International has not gone under and will not go under. Notwithstanding all obstacles, the masses of the workers will create a new International. Opportunism\u2019s present triumph will be short-lived. The greater the sacrifices imposed by the war the clearer will it become to the mass of the workers   that the opportunists have betrayed the workers\u2019 cause and that the weapons must be turned against the government and the bourgeoisie of each country.\n\nThe conversion of the present imperialist war into a civil war is the only correct proletarian slogan, one that follows from the experience of the Commune, and outlined in the Basle resolution (); it bas been dictated by all the conditions of an imperialist war between highly developed bourgeois countries. However difficult that transformation may seem at any given moment, socialists will never relinquish systematic, persistent and undeviating preparatory work in this direction now that war has become a fact.\n\nIt is only along this path that the proletariat will be able to shake off its dependence on the chauvinist bourgeoisie, and, in one form or another and more or less rapidly, take decisivo steps towards genuine freedom for the nations and towards socialism.\n\nLong live the international fraternity of the workers against the chauvinism and patriotism of the bourgeoisie of all countries!\n\nLong live a proletarian International, freed from opportunism!\n\nCentral Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party Judging by private conversations, there are two opinions on this question.\n\nComrades succumbing to the \u201cSoviet atmosphere\u201d often incline towards appearing in court.\n\nThose closer to the workers apparently incline towards not appearing.\n\nIn principle, the question chiefly boils down to an estimation of what is usually called constitutional illusions.\n\nAnyone who thinks that a regular government and a regular court exist or can exist in Russia, that a Constituent Assembly is likely to be called, may arrive at a conclusion in favour of appearing.\n\nThat idea is completely erroneous, however. It is the latest events, after July , that have most vividly shown that a Constituent Assembly is unlikely to be called (with out a new revolution), that neither a regular government nor a regular court exists or can exist in Russia (at present).\n\nThe court is an organ of power. The liberals sometimes forget this, but it is a sin for a Marxist to do so.\n\nWhere, then, is the power? Who constitutes the power?\n\nThere is no government. it changes daily. It is inactive.\n\nThe power that is active is the military dictatorship. Under these conditions, it is ridiculous even to speak of \u201cthe courts\u201d. It is not a question of \u201ccourts\u201d, but of an episode in the civil war. This is what those in favour of appearing in court unfortunately do not want to understand.\n\nPereverzev and Alexinsky as initiators of the \u201ccase\"!! Isn\u2019t it ridiculous to speak of courts in such circumstances?   Isn\u2019t it naive to think that, in such conditions, any court can examine, investigate and establish anything??\n\nPower is in the hands of a military dictatorship. Without a new revolution, this power can only become stronger for a certain time, primarily for the duration of the war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing against the law. The courts are just. They will sort things out. The trial will be public. The people will understand. I shall appear.\u201d\n\nThis reasoning is childishly na\u00efve. The authorities need not a trial but a persecution campaign against the internationalists. What Kerensky and Co. need is to put them in gaol and keep them there. So it was (in Britain and France), and so it will be (in Russia).\n\nLet the internationalists work illegally as much as they can, but let them not commit the folly of appearing in court of their own free will! The counter-revolution has become organised and consolidated, and has actually taken state power into its hands.\n\nThe complete organisation and consolidation of the counter-revolution consists in a combination of its three main forces, a combination excellently conceived and already put into practice: . The Constitutional-Democratic Party, i. e., the real leader of the organised bourgeoisie, has, by withdrawing from the Cabinet, confronted it with an ultimatum, thus clearing the way for the Cabinet\u2019s overthrow by the counter-revolution; . The General Staff and the military leaders, with the deliberate or semi-deliberate assistance of Kerensky, whom even the most prominent Socialist-Revolutionaries now call a Cavaignac, have seized actual state power and have proceeded to shoot down revolutionary units at the front, disarm the revolutionary troops and workers in Petrograd and Moscow, suppress unrest in Nizhni-Novgorod, arrest Bolsheviks and ban their papers, not only without trial, but even without a government order. At present, basic state power in Russia is virtually a military dictatorship. This fact is still obscured by a number of institutions that are revolutionary in words but powerless in deeds. Yet it is so obvious and fundamental a fact that without under standing it, one cannot understand anything about the political situation. . The Black Hundred-monarchist and bourgeois press, which has switched from hounding Bolsheviks to hounding the Soviets, the \u201cincendiary\u201d Chernov, etc., has indicated with the utmost clarity that the true meaning of the policy of military dictatorship, which now reigns supreme and is supported by the Cadets   and monarchists, is preparations for disbanding the Soviets. Many of the leaders of the S.R.s and Mensheviks, i. e., the present majority in the Soviets, have admitted and expressed this during the past few days, but, true to their petty-bourgeois nature, they shrug off this formidable reality with meaningless high-sounding phrases.\n\n. The leaders of the Soviets and of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties, headed by Tsereteli and Chernov, have completely betrayed the cause of the revolution by putting it in the hands of the counter-revolutionaries and by turning themselves, their parties and the Soviets into mere fig-leaves of the counter-revolution.\n\nProof of this is that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks have betrayed the Bolsheviks and have tacitly agreed to close down their papers without daring to tell the people plainly and openly that they are doing so and why. By sanctioning the disarming of the workers and the revolutionary regiments, they have deprived themselves of all real power. They have turned into the most loud-mouthed ranters who help the reaction to \u201cdivert\u201d the people\u2019s attention until it is finally ready to disband the Soviets. It is impossible to understand anything at all about the present political situation without realising this complete and final bankruptcy of the S.R.s and Mensheviks and the present majority in the Soviets and without realising that their \u201cDirectory\u201d and other masquerades are an absolute sham.\n\n. All hopes for a peaceful development of the Russian revolution have vanished for good. This is the objective situation: either complete victory for the military dictatorship, or victory for the workers\u2019 armed uprising; the latter victory is only possible when the insurrection coincides with a deep, mass upheaval against the government and the bourgeoisie caused by economic disruption and the prolongation of the war.\n\nThe slogan \u201cAll Power to the Soviets!\u201d was a slogan for peaceful development of the revolution which was possible in April, May, June, and up to July -, i. e., up to the time when actual power passed into the hands of the military dictatorship. This slogan is no longer correct, for it does not take into account that power has changed   hands and that the revolution has in fact been completely betrayed by the S.R.s and Mensheviks. Reckless actions, revolts, partial resistance, or hopeless hit-and-run attempts to oppose reaction will not help. What will help is a clear understanding of t.he situation, endurance and determination of the workers\u2019 vanguard, preparation of forces for the armed uprising, for the victory of which conditions at present are extremely difficult, but still possible if the facts and trends mentioned above coincide. Let us have no constitutional or republican illusions of any kind, no more illusions about a peaceful path, no sporadic actions, no yielding now to provocation from the Black Hundreds and Cossacks. Let us gather forces, reorganise them, and resolutely prepare for the armed uprising, if the course of the crisis permits it on a really mass, country-wide scale. The transfer of land to the peasants is impossible at present without armed uprising, since the counter-revolutionaries, having taken power, have completely united with the landowners as a class.\n\nThe aim of the insurrection can only be to transfer power to the proletariat, supported by the poor peasants, with a view to putting our Party programme into effect.\n\n. The party of the working class, without abandoning legal activity, but never for a moment overrating it, must combine legal with illegal work, as it did in -.\n\nDon\u2019t let slip a single hour of legal work. But don\u2019t cherish any constitutional or \u201cpeaceful\u201d illusions. Form illegal organisations or cells everywhere and at once for the publication of leaflets, etc. Reorganise immediately, consistently, resolutely, all along the line.\n\nAct as we did in \u2013, when we could speak about overthrowing tsarism by a revolution and an armed uprising, without at the same time losing our legal base in the Duma, the insurance societies, the trade unions, etc. I do not agree with the previous speaker.\n\nIn Borgbjerg\u2019s proposal we have a political fact of exceptional importance which imposes on us the duty of exposing the social-chauvinists and launching a political campaign. The British and French \u201csocialists\u201d have rejected Borgbjerg\u2019s proposal. The British and French Plekhanovs are not coming to this conference. Borgbjerg\u2019s proposals are a farce. Through Borgbjerg, the German social-chauvinists are offering their terms for peace. They are doing this through a socialist in order to cover up their social-chauvinist intrigue. This must be exposed, to discourage them from ever again applying to the socialist parties.\n\nThere can be no doubt at all that this is a proposal coming from the German Government, Which is acting through its own social-chauvinists. It is the one that is arranging this congress.... It cannot do so openly, and is therefore doing it through its own Plekhanovs. By this diplomatic step the German Government sheds all responsibility while propounding through them its secret hopes. Let me read you a report in a foreign paper about Borgbjerg: \u201cThrough a Danish social-chauvinist, the German Kaiser wants to call a peace conference in his own interests.\u201d Borgbjerg\u2019s proposal is clearly nothing but a fraud and a swindle. Then we have a report from Rabochaya Gazeta{} (Reads out the report from \u201cRabochaya Gazeta\u201d of April , .) It is beyond doubt, therefore, that this is a proposal from the German Government. That is how such things are done. It is our task to expose the inner workings of this to the   world, i.e., pass a detailed resolution, translate it into several languages and publish it in all the papers. I move a draft resolution.\n\nIt is a curious fact that the capitalist newspapers are maintaining a diplomatic silence. They know the rule, that speech is silvern and silence is golden. The bourgeois newspapers know what the whole thing is about. Newspapers like Rabochaya Gazeta are at a loss. Yedinstvo{} alone has said that Borgbjerg is an agent of the German Government. But by saying in the next breath that neither the British nor the French social-chauvinists, nor the Russian Plekhanovs will attend this conference under any circumstances; it exposes the British, French and Russian governments, who, being aware of the really difficult condition of Germany, hope to fill their appetites at her expense. We must expose this comedy of masques. We must tell how such things are done: Bethmann-Hollweg goes to Wilhelm, Wilhelm summons Scheidemann, Scheidemann goes to Denmark, and as a result, Borgbjerg goes to Russia with the peace terms. (Reads out the resolution.)\n\nTrier is a Danish Marxist. Denmark is a petty-bourgeois country. Her bourgeoisie has battened on the war and hates the workers. The leaders of the Danish Social-Democratic majority are among the most opportunist in Europe. They have clearly exposed themselves as real social-chauvinists. We, for our part, must be fair and say about Borgbjerg what we have said about Plekhanov. If we hear fine phrases shouted to us about Alsace-Lorraine, we must remember that the whole thing boils down to money. In fact, it is a question of unusually rich ores. It is a question of profit, a peaceful sharing out of the booty between the German and the French capitalists. The Danish internationalists have rejected this. I forgot to say that the Kautskyites have agreed to attend the conference, and this must be exposed. The proposal coming via Borgbjerg says that the German capitalists are bargaining, because they are incapable of holding on to what they have seized. Germany\u2019s position is desperate, she is on the brink of ruin. But the German capitalists still hope to retain a bit. The diplomatists have strong bonds with each other, they know everything, everything is clear to them. The people alone are not told   such things. The Anglo-French chauvinists have refused to attend the conference because they are very well aware of the real state of affairs. There was good reason for their taking ministerial office. It is now a matter of strangulating and plundering Germany, for she is no longer capable of conducting a policy of aggrandizement. Borgbjerg is an agent of German imperialism. If the soldiers receive this resolution they will understand that it is now a question of squeezing the last breath out of Germany. Congresses are farces attended by social-chauvinist diplomatists. There is the congress, and in the next room they will be sharing out Alsace-Lorraine. The truth about congresses must be told once and for all; to open the people\u2019s eyes. If we adopt this manifesto and have it printed, translated into foreign languages and circulated among the workers and soldiers, they will understand the real state of affairs. This will be a very genuine campaign, it will be a clarification of the proletarian line.\nIt is proposed that speakers concentrate on replies to specific questions for working out a general Party platform. Questions: ) militia, ) working hours, ) wages, ) increase and decrease of production, ) have there been any removals of management? how and from whom is it organised? ) single or dual power, ) elements reducing revolutionary Man, ) disarmament of the bourgeoisie, ) food supplies, ) = ....{}\n\nAdditional: ) are the Soviets being transformed into Soviets of Workers\u2019, Soldiers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Deputies? ) their role in connection with the state-wide Soviet.\nThe materials submitted by comrades on the activity of the Soviets, while being incomplete, are remarkably interesting. This may be the most important information material produced by the conference, material which makes it possible to verify our slogans against the actual course of life. The picture we now have disposes us to optimistic conclusions. The movement started out in the centres; initially all the energy of the proletariat there was concentrated on the struggle. A mass of energy was spent on the struggle against tsarism. This struggle in Petrograd has eliminated the central state power. A gigantic task has been done. But if that has led to the seizure of power by the bourgeoisie it does not warrant any pessimistic conclusions, it is not right to regard the workers\u2019 failure to take power as a mistake. It would be utopian to suppose that after a few days of struggle the masses could have taken power into their hands. That could not have been done in the presence of the bourgeoisie, which was very well prepared for taking over.\n\nFrom the centre, the revolution is moving into the localities. That is what happened in France\u2014the revolution is becoming a municipal one. The movement in the localities shows that there the majority is for the peasants, for the workers, that there has been the least leadership from the bourgeoisie, that there the masses did not lose their head. The more data we collect, the more they show us that the greater the proletarian section of the population and the fewer the intermediate elements, the better the revolution advances in the localities. The Kazan comrades have gone over directly to the tasks of the socialist revolution. We find that even where the proletariat\u2019s organisations are insignificant, the practical requirements have given the proletariat an absolutely correct definition of its tasks. Without such elements as, for instance, statistics, etc., the proletarian   revolution cannot be carried out. For the proletarian revolution to be carried out, it is necessary that the engineers, technicians, etc., should be under the practical control of the revolutionary proletariat. The revolution in the localities has gone forward easily. There is always the danger of anarchy in a revolution. Over here anarchy is not....{}\n\nThe bourgeois revolution is unmindful of production, but here the workers are giving it thought. The workers are interested in seeing that production does not dwindle. The revolution in the localities is going forward in gigantic strides. Reports from the localities have shown that the sharper the class contradictions, the more correctly the revolution advances, the surer the dictatorship of the proletariat is realised. While the dictatorship of the proletariat is being implemented in the small localities, the centres turn out to be the least suitable for the revolution\u2019s advance.\n\nThere is absolutely no ground for any pessimism. It is a fact that collaboration with the bourgeoisie is beginning in the centres. Through its better organisation, the bourgeoisie is trying to turn the proletariat into a servitor, to make the workers temporary participants in what the bourgeoisie is building. It is ridiculous to think that the Russian people are drawing their guiding principles from pamphlets. Not at all, it is from the immediate practice that the experience of the masses flows....{} The people can work it out by participating in a mass movement. The people themselves have started to accumulate mass experience....{} In Penza Gubernia, the power took shape under the dictatorship of the peasantry. The Penza representative showed the resolutions of the peasants who had taken over the implements of production and land. Marx\u2019s words are being confirmed....{} The programme of the revolution is being carried out in the localities\u2014in order to have grain ...{} to establish relations themselves. This revolution produces men of practice. The revolution can go forward only under the control of practical experience in the localities. And we are very greatly encouraged by the course of the revolution through out the whole of Russia, where the gigantic majority are peasants.\n\nAfter there proved to be insufficient strength to take over production in the centre, this is being done in the provinces, where it is easily done. In the provinces, the revolution is a municipal one, and it is giving impetus to the centre; the latter is picking up their experience.\n\nThe comrade coal-miner said that their first task when...{} was to go for grain.... It is wrong to think that this experience can go to waste. Without this experience, the centres have nowhere to get an impetus from for a fresh revolution. The new revolution is mounting. The course of events, the dislocation of life, the famine\u2014that is what is propelling the revolution. Hence the struggle against the elements supporting the bourgeoisie. Things are moving towards a collapse which the bourgeoisie will not cope with. We are preparing a new multimillion army which could show its mettle in the Soviets, in the Constituent Assembly\u2014just how, we do not as yet know. Over here in the centre we do not have enough strength. There is a tremendous preponderance in the provinces. On our side is the development of the revolution in the localities, which is going forward and overtaking us.\n\nThe people are not setting themselves any communist plans. The revolutionary class throughout Russia is mustering its forces, and it is our task to accumulate this experience and take a step as these forces are mustered. We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the fact that they (Narodniks, Mensheviks) are in such an overwhelming majority.\n\nOn the strength of the experience, we can now state in the resolution....{} In the localities, the production has to be taken over, otherwise the collapse is inevitable. The peasants will not give the grain. To obtain the grain, the measures must be revolutionary, which can be put through by the revolutionary class, relying on the masses in their millions.\n\nI asked comrades from the localities about the state of production there.\n\nThe \u2013hour day has been introduced in Nizhny Novgorod   Gubernia, and production has increased. That is the earnest. There is no other way of escaping the ruin. It will take a vast amount of work. We are separating ourselves from the petty-bourgeois line. Life is on our side. The crisis can not be resolved by petty-bourgeois-democratic methods, because they stop short of revolutionary measures (Shingaryov, Milyukov). The general course of the revolution shows that things are moving forward.\n\nWe do not differ from the petty bourgeoisie in that it says \u201ccaution\u201d, and we say \u201cspeed\u201d; we say \u201ceven more caution\u201d. There must be a relentless struggle against this state game....{} Better later than earlier\u2014and the centre will win out. (Applause.)\nComrade Lenin, speaking in substantiation of the first resolution, pointed out the need for dividing the resolution into three parts: first, giving a class analysis of the war; second, dealing with so-called \u201crevolutionary defencism\u201d, and third, answering the question of how to end the war. The first part of the resolution exposes the mainsprings of the imperialist war, establishes their connection with a definite period in the development of capitalism and brings out the annexationist strivings of the ruling classes of all countries. The second part gives a characteristic of the peculiar trend. The third part outlines the way to end the war\u2014the way of revolutionary class struggle for power\u2014refuting the absurd slander about a \u201cseparate\u201d peace.\nGelman motions that the words \u201cMenshevik opportunist Social-Democratic Party\u201d should be replaced by the words \u201cthe Party\u2019s opportunist wing\u201d, arguing that not all the Mensheviks belong to the defencist trend, and that the Left wing does not share the defencist standpoint.\n\nLenin opposes the amendment: we are speaking about the majority, about the Menshevik Party as a whole, which is why the characteristic should not be changed.\n\n\nVedernikov proposes that the names \u201cChkheidze, Tsereteli and others\u201d should be struck out.... If we delete them the resolution will not lose in any way.\n\nOvsyanikov ... proposes that the words \u201cChkheidze, Tsereteli, the O.C.\u201d should be deleted.\n\nLenin comes out against both amendments. One of two things\u2014either the names or the O.C.\u2014unless both are retained. The first comrade proposes to leave the O.C. in and throw out the names. But is the Organising Committee sufficiently well known to the masses, or must the well-known names of Tsereteli and Chkheidze be used to clarify the state of affairs for the masses?\n\n\nSokolnikov proposes the deletion of the word \u201ccompletely\u201d in the phrase: \u201cSteps designed to make them completely harmless politically\u201d, because only by undermining their economic domination can the capitalists be rendered politically harmless....\n\nLenin speaks out against the deletion of the word \u201ccompletely\u201d and proposes the wording: \u201cSteps undermining the economic domination of the capitalists, and steps designed to make them completely....\u201d\nAt the end of the preamble (after the words \u201cthe standpoint of the proletariat\u201d) insert:\n\nWorld capitalism has at the present time, i.e., since about the beginning of the twentieth century, reached the stage of imperialism. Imperialism, or the epoch of finance capital, is a high stage of development of the capitalist economic system, one in which monopolist associations of capitalists\u2014syndicates, cartels and trusts\u2014have assumed decisive importance: in which enormously concentrated banking capital has fused with industrial capital; in which the export of capital to foreign countries has assumed vast proportions: in which the whole world has been divided up   territorially among the richer countries, and the economic carve-up of the world among international trusts has begun.\n\nImperialist wars, i.e., wars for world domination, for markets for banking capital and for the subjugation of small and weaker nations, are inevitable under such a state of affairs. The first great imperialist war, the war of \u2013, is precisely such a war.\n\nThe extremely high level of development which world capitalism in general has attained, the replacement of free competition by monopoly capitalism, the fact that the banks and the capitalist associations have prepared the machinery for the social regulation of the process of production and distribution of products, the horrors, misery, ruin, and brutalisation caused by the imperialist war\u2014all these factors transform the present stage of capitalist development into an era of proletarian socialist revolution.\n\nThat era has dawned.\n\nOnly a proletarian socialist revolution can lead humanity out of the impasse which imperialism and imperialist wars have created. Whatever difficulties, the revolution may have to encounter, whatever possible temporary setbacks or waves of counter-revolution it may have to contend with, the final victory of the proletariat is inevitable.\n\nObjective conditions make it the urgent task of the day to prepare the proletariat in every way for the revolution and resolutely break with the bourgeois perversion of socialism, which has taken the upper hand in the official Social-Democratic parties in the form of a social-chauvinist trend (that is, socialism in words, chauvinism in fact, or the use of the \u201cdefend your country\u201d slogan to cover up defence of capitalist interests in imperialist wars), and also in the form of a Centre trend (i.e., unprincipled, helpless vacillation between social-chauvinism and revolutionary internationalist proletarian struggle) {} for the conquest of political power in order to carry out the economic and political measures which are the sum and substance of the socialist revolution.\n\n*     *\n*\nThe fulfilment of this task, which calls for the fullest trust, the closest fraternal ties, and direct unity of revolutionary action on the part of the working class in all the advanced countries, is impossible without an immediate break in principle with the bourgeois perversion of socialism, which has gained the upper hand among the leadership of the great majority of the official Social-Democratic parties. Such a perversion is, on the one hand, the social-chauvinist trend, socialism in word and chauvinism in deed, the defence of the predatory interests of \u201cone\u2019s own\u201d national bourgeoisie under the guise of \u201cdefence of one\u2019s country\u201d; and, on the other hand, the equally wide international trend of the so-called Centre, which stands for unity with the social-chauvinists and for the preservation or correction of the bankrupt Second International, and which vacillates between social-chauvinism and the internationalist revolutionary struggle of the proletariat for the achievement of a socialist system.\n\n*     *\n*\nThe experience of the Russian revolutions of  and , which created the Soviets of Workers\u2019 Deputies and a number of similar organisations, thereby confirmed the experience of the Paris Commune, which consisted in the fact that the proletariat must have a state for the period of transition to socialism, but this state{} must not be a conventional type of state, but the immediate, massive and wholesale organisation of the armed workers to substitute for the old instruments of administration: the standing army, the police and the civil service. Explanation to the proletariat of the tasks of such a state\u2014capable both of consolidating the gains of the revolution in general and of ensuring the most peaceful and balanced transition to socialism\u2014must   constitute one of the principal tasks of the proletarian party alongside its struggle against the representatives of the bankrupt Second (\u2013) International, who have distorted Marxism and betrayed socialism on the dictator ship of the proletariat question.\n\nMonopoly capitalism, which has been developing into state-monopoly capitalism in a number of advanced countries with especial rapidity during the war, means gigantic socialisation of production and, consequently, complete preparation of the objective conditions for the establishment of a socialist society.{}\n\n*     *\n*\nIn the minimum programme, the whole beginning (from the words \u201cOn the path\u201d down to \u00a7 ) should be crossed out, and replaced by the following:\n\nIn Russia at the present moment, when the Provisional Government, which is part and parcel of the landowner and capitalist class and enjoys the confidence\u2014necessarily unstable\u2014of the broad mass of the petty-bourgeois population, has undertaken to convene a Constituent Assembly, the immediate duty of the party of the proletariat is to fight for a political system which will best guarantee economic progress and the rights of the people in general, and make possible the least painful transition to socialism in particular.\n\nThe party is fighting and helping the masses to wage an immediate struggle for a democratic republic, starting the implementation of the freedoms by the masses\u2019 organisation on their own, from below, and working for the establishment not of a bourgeois parliamentary republic, with its special guarantees both for the domination of the capitalists and for the possibility of using force against the masses through the retention of the old organs of mass oppression: the police, the standing army and the civil service, but of a more democratic proletarian-peasant republic in which the retention of these organs of oppression is impossible and inadmissible, and where the state power belongs directly to the workers and peasants who are armed to a man.\n\n\u00a7 . Supreme power in the state must be vested entirely in the people\u2019s representatives, who shall be elected by the people and be subject to recall at any time, and who shall constitute a single popular assembly, a single chamber.\n\n\u00a7 . Add:\n\nProportional representation at all elections; all delegates and elected officials, without exception, to be subject to recall at any time upon the decision of a majority of their electors.\n\n\u00a7 . Add:\n\nNo supervision or control from above over the decisions and acts of regional and local self-governments.\n\n\u00a7  to read:\n\nThe right of all member nations of the state to freely secede and form independent states. The republic of the Russian nation must attract other nations or nationalities not by force, but exclusively by voluntary agreement on the question of forming a common state. The unity and fraternal alliance of the workers of all countries are incompatible with the use of force, direct or indirect, against other nationalities.\n\n\u00a7  to read:\n\nJudges and all other officials, both civil and military, to be elected by the people with the right to recall any of them at any time by decision of a majority of their electors. Salaries to all officials to be not above the wages of a skilled worker, \u2013 rubles, depending on the number of family members and their earnings; unconditional prohibition for officials to supplement their salaries with income from other sources.\n\n\u00a7  to read:\n\nThe police and standing army to be replaced by the universally armed people; workers and other employees to receive regular wages from the capitalists for the time devoted to public service in the people\u2019s militia.\n\n*     *\n*\n\u00a7  of the political section, \u00a7  and others of the economic section should be, like the whole of the economic section, specially re-examined by commissions consisting of trade union workers and teachers.\n\nAlter the fiscal clause of the programme (following the words \u201con incomes and inheritances\u201d) insert:\n\nThe high level of development of capitalism already achieved in banking and in the trustified branches of industry, on the one hand, and the economic disruption caused by the imperialist war, everywhere evoking a demand for state and public control of the production and distribution of all staple products, on the other, induce the party to demand the nationalisation of the banks, syndicates (trusts), etc.\n\n*     *\n*\nThe agrarian programme should be replaced by an agrarian resolution (see its text separately){} or rewritten in accordance with it.{}\n\n*     *\n*\nThe concluding part of the programme (the last two paragraphs from the words: \u201cIn the endeavour to achieve\u201d) to be entirely deleted.\nThe commission has proposed the adoption of a resolution on the direction in which the Party programme should be changed: ) evaluation of imperialism in connection with the approaching social revolution; ) amending the para graphs on the state\u2014the state without a standing army, a police, or a privileged bureaucracy; ) elimination of what is out of date in the political programme (about tsarism, etc.); ) altering the minimum programme; ) re writing the economic section of the programme, which is obviously out of date, and the school section of the programme; \u2013) inserting demands flowing from the changing structure of capitalist society (nationalisation of the syndicated branches of industry, etc.); ) adding an analysis of the trends in socialism.\n\nComrade Lenin pointed to the landed estates, and the incredible jumble of arable fields brought about by the haphazard administration on the peasant land, first of the   bailiffs, then of the  magistrates and finally of the Stolypin officials,{} as the principal cause of the enslaving feudal relations remaining in the countryside.\n\nHence, the natural desire on the part of the peasants to \u201cclear the land\u201d, to have all the land re-allotted, a desire which is expressed in the saying that \u201call the land is God\u2019s\u201d. The peasant-holder cannot be reconciled with the obstacles which, in the new conditions of capitalist trade, he finds intolerable. That is proved by the bill submitted by the  peasant deputies in the First and Second Dumas.{}\n\nThe Socialist-Revolutionaries have themselves admitted that in that Bill the \u201cpetty-economy ideology\u201d prevails over the \u201cprinciples of equalisation\u201d. The peasant wants to own his land, but wants it allotted in accordance with the new demands of the commodity economy. Even where some peasants appear to accept the principle of egalitarian land tenure, their view of it is different from that of the S.R. intellectuals. The statistical result of the distribution of the landowner and peasant holdings in Russia comes to the following figures:  peasant families hold , dessiatines, and one landowner holds as much. Their demand for \u201cequalisation\u201d clearly contains the idea of equalising the rights of the  and the one.\n\nThe necessity of land nationalisation, as a fully bourgeois and highly progressive measure, has been prepared by the preceding development of the land economy in Russia and the development of the world market. The war has sharpened every contradiction. Just now, the immediate transfer of the land to the peasants is a demand powerfully dictated by the needs of wartime. Shingaryov & Co. actually intensify the crisis by inviting the peasants to wait for a Constituent Assembly (whereas the sowing must be done right away), thereby threatening to turn the grain shortage into a real famine. They are trying to force on the peasants a bourgeois-bureaucratic solution of the agrarian question. Meanwhile, there is no time to wait for the legalisation of landownership, because the crisis is approaching in gigantic strides. The peasants have already displayed a revolutionary initiative\u2014in Penza Gubernia they have been taking over the landowners\u2019 live and dead stock for common use. It goes without saying that our   Party stands only for the organised take-over of lands and implements because that is necessary for increasing production, while any damage to implements inflicts harm above all on the peasants and workers themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, we stand for the separate organisation of agricultural workers.\nSolovyov believes that the most essential should be stated at the head of the resolution: that the Party demands the nationalisation of the land.\n\nThis amendment is not very essential. I put nationalisation in third place, because initiative and revolutionary action must come first, while nationalisation is a law ex pressing the people\u2019s will. I motion against.\nComrade Lenin recalled that the Polish Social-Democrats were against the right to national self-determination in , when the question was not raised in the prospect of a socialist revolution. The specific character of their stand on the national question is due to their peculiar position in Poland; the tsarist oppression fed the nationalistic passions of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sections of Poland. The Polish Social-Democrats had to go through a desperate struggle against the \u201csocialists\u201d (P.P.S) who were even prepared to have a European war for the sake of Poland\u2019s liberation, and only they, the Polish Social-Democrats,   spreading the feelings of international solidarity among the Polish workers, led them closer to the workers of Russia. However, their attempt to impose a rejection of the right to self-determination on the socialists of the oppressor nations is extremely erroneous and in the event of success could result in nothing more than the adoption of a chauvinistic stand by the Russian Social-Democrats. By rejecting the oppressed nations\u2019 right to self-determination, the socialists of the oppressor nations become chauvinists, giving support to their own bourgeoisie. Russian socialists must work to secure freedom to secede for the oppressed nations, while the socialists of the oppressed nations must maintain freedom to integrate, both taking formally different (essentially the same) ways towards the same goal: the international organisation of the proletariat. Those who say that the national question has been solved within the bourgeois system tend to forget that it has been solved (but not in every case) only in the west of Europe, where the purity of the population is sometimes as high as  per cent, but not in the east, where the purity of the population is limited to only  per cent. Finland\u2019s example shows that the national question is in practice on the order of the day and that the alternative is support for the imperialist bourgeoisie or the duty of international solidarity, which does not allow of any violation of the will of the oppressed nations. The Mensheviks, who invited the Finnish Social-Democrats to \u201cwait\u201d until the Constituent Assembly and settle the question of autonomy together with it, actually spoke out in the spirit of the Russian imperialists.\nComrade Lenin motioned the proposal for a declaration that the R.S.D.L.P. remained within the Zimmerwald bloc only for the purpose of information, and is, consequently,   withdrawing from it. Experience has shown, he said, that it is useless to remain in the bloc. In many countries, Zimmerwald has even become a drag on the forward movement. The social-chauvinists are using it as a cover.\n\nQuestion from the floor. Does control over the syndicates and banks imply measures recommended only on a state-wide scale or are such measures as control over private enterprises, etc., also included?\n\nNo, that is not here, because this living practice has been given expression in another resolution where it is in a better perspective.{} This particular resolution deals with another subject\u2014the steps to be taken towards socialism.\n\n\nSolovyov motions an amendment: a few words about the characteristic of the state in this transition period\u2014that is very essential, because it determines the overall direction of the activities of the Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies....\n\nLenin objects to Comrade Solovyov\u2019s amendment:\n\nIn some resolutions we keep coming up against concrete definitions. The Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies can operate without the police, because they have their armed soldiers. The Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies are institutions which can substitute for the old civil service.\n\nThe old agrarian programme ...{} has not been realised, but we should say: \u201cThe Party demands a peasant-proletarian   republic without a police, a standing army or a civil service.\u201d Consequently, the conference has predetermined this issue,{} so all we have to do now is to formulate. Workers, comrades!\n\nThe All-Russia Conference of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, united by its Central Committee and known simply as the Bolshevik Party, is over.\n\nThe Conference has adopted very important resolutions on all the fundamental issues of the revolution and the full text of them is published below.\n\nThe revolution is passing through a crisis. This could be seen in the streets of Petrograd and Moscow between April  and April . This has been admitted by the Provisional Government. It has been admitted by the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies. Still further confirmation of it has been given, as I pen these lines, by the resignation of Guchkov.\n\nThis crisis of state power, this crisis of the revolution, is no accident. The Provisional Government is a government of landowners and capitalists who are tied up with Russian and Anglo-French capital and compelled to continue the imperialist war. But the soldiers are worn out by the war, they are becoming more and more aware that the war is being fought in the interests of the capitalists; the soldiers do not want war. Furthermore, the grim spectre of an appalling debacle, of famine and complete economic ruin is advancing upon Russia and other countries.\n\nThe Petrograd Soviet has also got into a blind alley by entering into an agreement with the Provisional Government, by supporting it, by supporting the loan, and, consequently, supporting the war. The Soviet is responsible for the Provisional Government, and, seeing no way out of the situation, has also got itself into a muddle through this agreement with the capitalist government.\n\nAt this great historic moment, when the future of the revolution is at stake, when the capitalists are torn between despair and the thought of shooting down workers, our Party appeals to the people, saying in its Conference resolutions:\n\nWe must understand which classes are the motive force of the revolution. Their various aspirations must be soberly assessed. The capitalist cannot travel the same road as the worker. Petty proprietors can neither fully trust the capitalists nor all immediately agree on a close fraternal alliance with the workers. Only when we understand the difference between these classes shall we be able to find the correct road for the revolution.\n\nThe decisions of our Conference on all the basic issues of the people\u2019s life draw a clear line between the interests of the different classes and show that it is absolutely impossible to find a way out of the deadlock unless the policy of trust in and support of the capitalist government is abandoned.\n\nThe situation is one of unparalleled difficulty. There is one way out and only one\u2014the transfer of all state power to the Soviets of Workers\u2019, Soldiers\u2019, Peasants\u2019, and other Deputies throughout Russia, from the bottom up. Only if state power passes to the working class supported by most of the peasantry, will it be possible to count on speedily regaining the confidence of the workers of other countries, to count on a mighty European revolution that will throw off the yoke of Capital and put an end to the criminal blood shed in which the peoples are embroiled. Only if the power passes to the working class supported by most of the peasants shall we be able to cherish the firm hope that the working people will show complete confidence in that power and all, without exception, work selflessly to bring about a transformation of the entire way of life of the people in the   interests of those who labour and not in the interests of the capitalists and landowners. Without such selfless work, with out a gigantic effort on the part of each and every individual, without firmness and the determination to rebuild life in a new way, without the strict organisation and comradely discipline of all workers and all poor peasants\u2014without all this there is no way out.\n\nThe war has brought all mankind to the brink of destruction. The capitalists have become deeply involved in the war and are unable to extricate themselves. The whole world faces disaster.\n\nWorkers, comrades! The time is drawing near when events will demand new and still greater heroism\u2014the heroism of millions and tens of millions\u2014than you displayed in the glorious days of the revolution of February and March. Prepare yourselves.\n\nPrepare yourselves and remember that if, together with the capitalists, you were able to achieve victory in a few days by a simple outburst of popular wrath, you will need more than that for victory against the capitalists, for victory over the capitalists. To achieve such a victory, to have the workers and poor peasants take the power, keep that power and make proper use of it, you will need organisation, organisation, and organisation.\n\nOur Party is helping you as much as it can, primarily by bringing home to you the different positions of the different classes and their different strength. The decisions of our Conference are devoted to this, and unless you realise this clearly, organisation does not mean anything. And without organisation action by the millions is impossible, success is impossible.\n\nDon\u2019t put your trust in words. Don\u2019t be misled by promises. Don\u2019t overestimate your strength. Organise at every factory, in every regiment and every company, in every residential block. Work at your organising every day, every hour; do that work yourselves, for this is something you cannot entrust to anybody else. Work to steadily, soundly and indestructibly build up full confidence in the advanced workers on the part of the masses. Such is the main content of all the decisions of our Conference. Such is the main lesson taught by the entire   development of the revolution. Such is the one guarantee of success.\n\nWorkers, comrades! We call upon you to carry out the hard, serious, untiring work of consolidating the class-conscious, revolutionary proletariat of all countries. This is the one and only way out, the only way to save mankind from the horrors of war and the yoke of Capital.\n\n \nThe fourth anniversary of October  (November ) is approaching.\n\nThe farther that great day recedes from us, the more clearly we see the significance of the proletarian revolution in Russia, and the more deeply we reflect upon the practical experience of our work as a whole.\n\nVery briefly and, of course, in very incomplete and rough outline, this significance and experience may be summed up as follows.\n\nThe direct and immediate object of the revolution in Russia was a bourgeois-democratic one, namely, to destroy the survivals of medievalism and sweep them away completely, to purge Russia of this barbarism, of this shame, and to remove this immense obstacle to all culture and progress in our country.\n\nAnd we can justifiably pride ourselves on having carried out that purge with greater determination and much more rapidly, boldly and successfully, and, from the point of view of its effect on the masses, much more widely and deeply, than the great French Revolution over one hundred and twenty-five years ago.\n\nBoth the anarchists and the petty-bourgeois democrats (i.e., the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are the Russian counterparts of that international social type) have talked and are still talking an incredible lot of nonsense about the relation between the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the socialist (that is, proletarian) revolution. The last four years have proved to the hilt that our interpretation of Marxism on this point, and our estimate of the experience of former revolutions were correct. We have consummated the bourgeois-democratic revolution as nobody had done before. We are advancing towards the socialist revolution consciously, firmly and unswervingly, knowing that it is not separated from the bourgeois-democratic revolution by a Chinese Wall, and knowing too that (in the last analysis) struggle alone will determine how far we shall advance, what part of this immense and lofty task we shall accomplish, and to what extent we shall succeed in consolidating our victories. Time will show. But we see even now that a tremendous amount\u2014tremendous for this ruined, exhausted and backward country\u2014has already been done towards the socialist transformation of society.\n\nLet us, however, finish what we have to say about the bourgeois-democratic content of our revolution. Marxists must understand what that means. To explain, let us take a few striking examples.\n\nThe bourgeois-democratic content of the revolution means that the social relations (system, institutions) of the country are purged of medievalism, serfdom, feudalism.\n\nWhat were the chief manifestations, survivals, remnants of serfdom in Russia up to ? The monarchy, the system of social estates, landed proprietorship and land tenure, the status of women, religion, and national oppression. Take any one of these Augean stables, which, incidentally, were left largely uncleansed by all the more advanced states when they accomplished their bourgeois-democratic revolutions one hundred and twenty-five, two hundred and fifty and more years ago ( in England); take any of these Augean stables, and you will see that we have cleansed them thoroughly. In a matter of ten weeks, from October  (November ),  to January , , when the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, we accomplished a thousand times more in this respect than was accomplished by the bourgeois democrats and liberals (the Cadets) and by the petty-bourgeois democrats (the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries) during the eight months they were in power.\n\nThose poltroons, gas-bags, vainglorious Narcissuses and petty Hamlets brandished their wooden swords\u2014but did not even destroy the monarchy! We cleansed out all that monarchist muck as nobody had ever done before. We left not a stone, not a brick of that ancient edifice, the social-estate system even the most advanced countries, such as Britain, France and Germany, have not completely eliminated the survivals of that system to this day!), standing. We tore out the deep-seated roots of the social-estate system, namely, the remnants of feudalism and serfdom in the system of landownership, to the last. \u201cOne may argue\u201d (there are plenty of quill-drivers, Cadets, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries abroad to indulge in such arguments) as to what \u201cin the long run\u201d will be the outcome of the agrarian reform effected by the Great October Revolution. We have no desire at the moment to waste time on such controversies, for we are deciding this, as well as the mass of accompanying controversies, by struggle. But the fact cannot be denied that the petty-bourgeois democrats \u201ccompromised\u201d with the landowners, the custodians of the traditions of serfdom, for eight months, while we completely swept the landowners and all their traditions from Russian soil in a few weeks.\n\nTake religion, or the denial of rights to women, or the oppression and inequality of the non-Russian nationalities. These are all problems of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. The vulgar petty-bourgeois democrats talked about them for eight months. In not a single one of the most advanced countries in the world have these questions been completely settled on bourgeois-democratic lines. In our country they have been settled completely by the legislation of the October Revolution. We have fought and are fighting religion in earnest. We have granted all the non-Russian nationalities their own republics or autonomous regions. We in Russia no longer have the base, mean and infamous denial of rights to women or inequality of the sexes, that disgusting survival of feudalism and medievalism, which is being renovated by the avaricious bourgeoisie and the dull-witted and frightened petty bourgeoisie in every other country in the world without exception.\n\nAll this goes to make up the content of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. A hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty years ago the progressive leaders of that revolution (or of those revolutions, if we consider each national variety of the one general type) promised to rid mankind of medieval privileges, of sex inequality, of state privileges for one religion or another (or \u201creligious ideas \u201d, \u201cthe church\u201d in general), and of national inequality. They promised, but did not keep their promises. They could not keep them, for they were hindered by their \u201crespect\u201d\u2014 for the \u201csacred right of private property\u201d. Our proletarian revolution was not afflicted with this accursed \u201crespect\u201d for this thrice-accursed medievalism and for the \u201csacred right of private property\u201d.\n\nBut in order to consolidate the achievements of the bourgeois-democratic revolution for the peoples of Russia, we were obliged to go farther; and we did go farther. We solved the problems of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in passing, as a \u201cby-product\u201d of our main and genuinely proletarian -revolutionary, socialist activities. We have always said that reforms are a by-product of the revolutionary class struggle. We said\u2014and proved it by deeds\u2014that bourgeois-democratic reforms are a by-product of the proletarian, i.e., of the socialist revolution. Incidentally, the Kautskys, Hilferdings, Martovs, Chernovs, Hillquits, Longuets, MacDonalds, Turatis and other heroes of \u201cTwo and-a-Half\u201d Marxism were incapable of understanding this relation between the bourgeois-democratic and the proletarian-socialist revolutions. The first develops into the second. The second, in passing, solves the problems of the first. The second consolidates the work of the first. Struggle, and struggle alone, decides how far the second succeeds in outgrowing the first.\n\nThe Soviet system is one of the most vivid proofs, or manifestations, of how the one revolution develops into the other. The Soviet system provides the maximum of democracy for the workers and peasants; at the same time, it marks a break with bourgeois democracy and the rise of a new, epoch-making type of democracy, namely, proletarian democracy, or the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nLet the curs and swine of the moribund bourgeoisie and of the petty-bourgeois democrats who trail behind them heap imprecations, abuse and derision upon our heads for our reverses and mistakes in the work of building up our Soviet system. We do not forget for a moment that we have committed and are committing numerous mistakes and are suffering numerous reverses. How can reverses and mistakes be avoided in a matter so new in the history of the world as the building of an unprecedented type of state edifice! We shall work steadfastly to set our reverses and mistakes right and to improve our practical application of Soviet principles, which is still very, very far from being perfect. But we have a right to be and are proud that to us has fallen the good fortune to begin the building of a Soviet state, and thereby to usher in a new era in world history, the era of the rule of a new class, a class which is oppressed in every capitalist country, but which everywhere is marching forward towards a new life, towards victory over the bourgeoisie, towards the dictatorship of the proletariat, towards the emancipation of mankind from the yoke of capital and from imperialist wars.\n\nThe question of imperialist wars, of the international policy of finance capital which now dominates the whole world, a policy that must inevitably engender new imperialist wars, that must inevitably cause an extreme intensification of national oppression, pillage, brigandry and the strangulation of weak, backward and small nationalities by a handful of \u201cadvanced\u201d powers\u2014that question has been the keystone of all policy in all the countries of the globe since . It is a question of life and death for millions upon millions of people. It is a question of whether ,, people (as compared with the ,, who were killed in the war of - and in the supplementary \u201cminor\u201d wars that are still going on) are to be slaughtered in the next imperialist war, which the bourgeoisie are preparing, and which is growing out of capitalism before our very eyes. It is a question of whether in that future war, which is inevitable (if capitalism continues to exist), ,, people are to be maimed (compared with the ,, maimed in -). In this question, too, our October Revolution marked the beginning of a new era in world history. The lackeys of the bourgeoisie and its yes-men\u2014the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, and the petty-bourgeois, allegedly \u201csocialist\u201d, democrats all over the world\u2014derided our slogan \u201cconvert the imperialist war into a civil war\u201d. But that slogan proved to be the truth\u2014it was the only truth, unpleasant, blunt, naked and brutal, but nevertheless the truth, as against the host of most refined jingoist and pacifist lies. Those lies are being dispelled. The Brest peace has been exposed. And with every passing day the significance and consequences of a peace that is even worse than the Brest peace\u2014the peace of Versailles\u2014are being more relentlessly exposed. And the millions who are thinking about the causes of the recent war and of the approaching future war are more and more clearly realising the grim and inexorable truth that it is impossible to escape imperialist war, and imperialist peace (if the old orthography were still in use, I would have written the word mir in two ways, to give it both its meanings)[In Russian, the word mir has two meanings (world and peace) and had two different spellings in the old orthography.\u2014Translator] which inevitably engenders imperialist war, that it is impossible to escape that inferno, except by a Bolshevik struggle and a Bolshevik revolution.\n\nLet the bourgeoisie and the pacifists, the generals and the petty bourgeoisie, the capitalists and the philistines, the pious Christians and the knights of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals vent their fury against that revolution. No torrents of abuse, calumnies and lies can enable them to conceal the historic fact that for the first time in hundreds and thousands of years the slaves have replied to a war between slave-owners by openly proclaiming the slogan: \u201cConvert this war between slave-owners for the division of their loot into a war of the slaves of all nations against the slave-owners of all nations.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in hundreds and thousands of years that slogan has grown from a vague and helpless waiting into a clear and definite political programme, into an effective struggle waged by millions of oppressed people under the leadership of the proletariat; it has grown into the first victory of the proletariat, the first victory in the struggle to abolish war and to unite the workers of all countries against the united bourgeoisie of different nations, against the bourgeoisie that makes peace and war at the expense of the slaves of capital, the wage-workers, the peasants, the working people.\n\nThis first victory is not yet the final victory, and it was achieved by our October Revolution at the price of incredible difficulties and hardships, at the price of unprecedented suffering, accompanied by a series of serious reverses and mistakes on our part. How could a single backward people be expected to frustrate the imperialist wars of the most powerful and most developed countries of the world without sustaining reverses and without committing mistakes! We are not afraid to admit our mistakes and shall examine them dispassionately in order to learn how to correct them. But the fact remains that for the first time in hundreds and thousands of years the promise \u201cto reply\u201d to war between the slave-owners by a revolution of the slaves directed against all the slave-owners has been completely fulfilled\u2014and is being fulfilled despite all difficulties.\n\nWe have made the start. When, at what date and time, and the proletarians of which nation will complete this process is not important. The important thing is that the ice has been broken; the road is open, the way has been shown.\n\nGentlemen, capitalists of all countries, keep up your hypocritical pretence of \u201cdefending the fatherland\u201d\u2014the Japanese fatherland against the American, the American against the Japanese, the French against the British, and so forth! Gentlemen, knights of the Second and Two-and a-Half Internationals, pacifist petty bourgeoisie and philistines of the entire world, go on \u201cevading\u201d the question of how to combat imperialist wars by issuing new \u201cBasle Manifestos\u201d (on the model of the Basle Manifesto of []). The first Bolshevik revolution has wrested the first hundred million people of this earth from the clutches of imperialist war and the imperialist world. Subsequent revolutions will deliver the rest of mankind from such wars and from such a world.\n\nOur last, but most important and most difficult task, the one we have done least about, is economic development, the laying of economic foundations for the new, socialist edifice on the site of the demolished feudal edifice and the semi-demolished capitalist edifice. It is in this most important and most difficult task that we have sustained the greatest number of reverses and have made most mistakes. How could anyone expect that a task so new to the world could be begun without reverses and without mistakes! But we have begun it. We shall continue it. At this very moment we are, by our New Economic Policy, correcting a number of our mistakes. We are learning how to continue erecting the socialist edifice in a small-peasant country without committing such mistakes.\n\nThe difficulties are immense. But we are accustomed to grappling with immense difficulties. Not for nothing do our enemies call us \u201cstone-hard\u201d and exponents of a \u201cfirm line policy\u201d. But we have also learned, at least to some extent, another art that is essential in revolution, namely, flexibility, the ability to effect swift and sudden changes of tactics if changes in objective conditions demand them, and to choose another path for the achievement of our goal if the former path proves to be inexpedient or impossible at the given moment.\n\nBorne along on the crest of the wave of enthusiasm, rousing first the political enthusiasm and then the military enthusiasm of the people, we expected to accomplish economic tasks just as great as the political and military tasks we had accomplished by relying directly on this enthusiasm. We expected\u2014or perhaps it would be truer to say that we presumed without having given it adequate consideration\u2014to be able to organise the state production and the state distribution of products on communist lines in a small-peasant country directly as ordered by the proletarian state. Experience has proved that we were wrong. It appears that a number of transitional stages were necessary\u2014state capitalism and socialism\u2014in order to prepare\u2014to prepare by many years of effort\u2014for the transition to communism. Not directly relying on enthusiasm, but aided by the enthusiasm engendered by the great revolution, and on the basis of personal interest, personal incentive and business principles, we must first set to work in this small peasant country to build solid gangways to socialism by way of state capitalism. Otherwise we shall never get to communism, we shall never bring scores of millions of people to communism. That is what experience, the objective course of the development of the revolution, has taught us.\n\nAnd we, who during these three or four years have learned a little to make abrupt changes of front (when abrupt changes of front are needed), have begun zealously, attentively and sedulously (although still not zealously, attentively and sedulously enough) to learn to make a new change of front, namely, the New Economic Policy. The proletarian state must become a cautious, assiduous and shrewd \u201cbusinessman\u201d, a punctilious wholesale merchant\u2014otherwise it will never succeed in putting this small-peasant country economically on its feet. Under existing conditions, living as we are side by side with the capitalist (for the time being capitalist) West, there is no other way of progressing to communism. A wholesale merchant seems to be an economic type as remote from communism as heaven from earth. But that is one of the contradictions which, in actual life, lead from a small-peasant economy via state capitalism to socialism. Personal incentive will step up production; we must increase production first and foremost and at all costs. Wholesale trade economically unites millions of small peasants: it gives them a personal incentive, links them up and leads them to the next step, namely, to various forms of association and alliance in the process of production itself. We have already started the necessary changes in our economic policy and already have some successes to our credit; true, they are small and partial, but nonetheless they are successes. In this new field of \u201ctuition\u201d we are already finishing our preparatory class. By persistent and assiduous study, by making practical experience the test of every step we take, by not fearing to alter over and over again what we have already begun, by correcting our mistakes and most carefully analysing their significance, we shall pass to the higher classes. We shall go through the whole \u201ccourse\u201d, although the present state of world economics and world politics has made that course much longer and much more difficult than we would have liked. No matter at what cost, no matter how severe the hardships of the transition period may be\u2014despite disaster, famine and ruin\u2014we shall not flinch; we shall triumphantly carry our cause to its goal.\n\nOctober , \nEndnotes\n\n[] The Extraordinary International Socialist Congress that sat in Basle on November -, , adopted a manifesto on war, which warned the peoples that an imperialist world war was imminent, showed the predatory objectives of that war and called upon the workers of all countries to make a determined stand for peace.
