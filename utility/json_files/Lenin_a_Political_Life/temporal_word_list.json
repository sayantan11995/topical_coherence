    "1890-1894": "   Roads to Freedom \nKAZAN \nThe Russian government's dilemmas were abundantly evident in the \ncontortions of its educational policy. School and university curricula \nwere state-controlled. Officialdom held that several branches of the \nhumanities and the sciences induced modes of thought pernicious to a \npolitical system steeped in traditional privilege and ritual. Aleksandr \nIII re-introduced obstacles to the access of non-noble adolescents to \nhigher education. Sons of landowners were adjudged inherently more \nloyal to the regime. The emperor also empowered the Ministry of \nEducation to tighten up the student disciplinary code. It was not \nunusual for ex-army officers, with their robust approach to punishment \nof disobedience, to obtain posts in university administration. Yet this \nline could not be pursued too far. Economic and military reconstruc-\ntion was unrealisable without an expansion of educational facilities. \nAny industrialising state faces this fact of life. And the tsarist political \npolice was under-equipped to organise surveillance of all undergradu-\nate groups and gatherings. In any event, the government scarcely \nwished to provoke the hostility of literate young people gratuitously. \nThe sanctions against insubordination remained insufficient to deter. \nBut the rules and restrictions affecting undergraduates were still \noppressive; and students were acquiring a reputation for rebellious-\nness. l \nUnsurprisingly, the police opposed Vladimir Ulyanov's entrance to \nuniversity. Sasha's hanging was still recent news, and the authorities \nmight have continued to make life difficult for the Ulyanov children \nexcept for their headmaster F. M. Kerenski's intervention. He \ndescribed his pupil's academic excellence. His mother promised to \nmove house to be near to him. Objections were waived. Vladimir \nhandled the correspondence about his brother Dmitri's transfer to \nschool in Kazan.  He found rooms for himself in the city in August \n. He started to attend lectures. The family were to take up \nresidence in town in November. \nThe Volga region, where Vladimir had so far spent all his days, was \n \n Roads to Freedom \n \nof growing economic importance; it also witnessed political unrest. \nKazan was the most unruly city on the river's banks. The administra-\ntion was Russian, but Tartars constituted a substantial minority of the \ninhabitants and were unreconciled to tsarist dominion. His stay in \nKazan must have intensified Vladimir's awareness of the 'nationalities \nquestion' in the empire. Kazan was also a place chosen by the \ngovernment since the s to which to exile arrested revolutionaries. \nUnderground political groups were active. A young person in revolt \nagainst the regime could without difficulty contact kindred spirits \nthere. Students in Kazan, as elsewhere, were required to swear not to \nenrol 'even in legally permitted societies, without the explicit sanction \nof the nearest authority in each individual instance'. Vladimir took the \noath, but only as a tiresome formality. The government had banned all \nstudents associations based upon the criterion of geographical origins. \nSuch associations survived in Kazan. Vladimir joined the Sam-\nara-Simbirsk association, and made a quick impact. The other \nmembers elected him, though only a first-year student, as their \nrepresentative on the secret council uniting all such associations inside \nthe university. This council met in November to discuss ways to \nsupport the anti-tsarist disturbances organised by the students of \nMoscow university. A demonstration was arranged for  December. \nScarcely had he become an undergraduate than Vladimir Ulyanov was \nimmersed in potential trouble. He knew the risks. As brother to a \nwould-be regicide, he was a marked man. \nHis activities were not confined to academic matters; he also \ninvolved himself with a group of revolutionaries led by Lazar Bogoraz. \nThe plan was to reconstitute the People's Freedom organisation. \nBogoraz was no mere talker. His group was arranging to produce \npamphlets and proclamations; it communicated with activists in St. \nPetersburg. The beliefs of the group are known only sketchily. \nCircumstantial evidence suggests that its members wanted a terrorist \ncampaign; and that they doubted whether 'the people' was capable of \ncarrying out its own political revolution. Aleksandr Ulyanov would \nprobably have felt happy among them. This is not complete surmise. It \nhas come to light that a former associate of Aleksandr's was on close \nterms with an associate of Lazar Bogoraz's. The resemblance in ideas \nextends to a further matter. Bogoraz's group was like Aleksandr's in \nwishing to maintain contacts with local Marxist activists. Fraternal \nsolidarity among revolutionaries of all varieties was approved. \nBogoraz himself is a shadowy figure. Though being the group's leader, \nhe did not lead unopposed. Disagreements about policy divided the \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nmembership.ll It would be instructive to possess the details, but \napparently nothing has been recorded for posterity. \nVladimir Ulyanov's role in the group remains obscure. It cannot \nhave been very weighty. Shortly after joining Bogoraz, he had to \nconcentrate his attention upon the Samara-Simbirsk student associa-\ntion. The Kazan demonstration of  December caused an uproar. It \nwas met with the official suspension of lectures. A hundred students \nwere arrested, Ulyanov being among them. When asked why he had \nrisked such trouble, he reportedly replied: 'What is there to think \nabout? My road has been laid out by my elder brother.' Ulyanov \nbehaved recklessly. Along with others, he announced his withdrawal \nfrom the university in protest againt 'existing conditions' in academic \nlife. The rector already intended to expel him. The Ministry of \nInternal Affairs meted out a sentence typical for first offences of this \nkind: Ulyanov was exiled to Kokushkino, the estate recently inherited \nby his mother upon the death of Dr Blank. The police were instructed \nto keep him under surveillance. IS His mother wrote letters begging that \nhe be re-admitted to his studentship; but to no avail. He continued \nindependently with his reading in jurisprudence. At the same time he \nreturned to his brother's book collection and worked through tomes of \nRussian revolutionary literature. He read and re-read Chernyshevski's \nnovel What Is To Be Done? Its impact upon him was profound. As \nUlyanov was to confide to a friend, Chernyshevski 'ploughed him over \nand over' . We have seen that Vladimir Iich borrowed some political \nand philosophical attitudes from Chernyshevski. He also experienced \na powerful emotional influence. Chernyshevski's novel leant dignity \nand heroism to socialist ideals. Such was Ulyanov's admiration that he \ntook the dangerous step of writing to Chernyshevski (but he received \nno reply since the exiled oppositionist was already mortally iII). \nThe Ulyanov family was allowed to move back to Kazan in \nSeptember . Vladimir remained banned from the university and \ndenied permission to go abroad to complete his studies. He again \ncontacted local revolutionaries. Bogoraz had fled to Rostov; but \nUlyanov managed to track down M. P. Chetvergova, an ex-member of \nPeople's Freedom. He attended her political circle.s Chetvergova's \ngroup, like Bogoraz's, had contacts outside Kazan. It associated itself \nwith the terrorist leader M. V. Sabunaev, who was travelling the \ncountry making arrangements for a convocation of all the local \ngroupings. Both Chetvergova and Sabunaev are dimly-known per-\nsonages. But quite possibly their ideas were similar to those of \nAleksandr Ulyanov.o Again we cannot be sure about the nature of \n Roads to Freedom \n \nVladimir's contribution to the group. Obviously, however, this \neighteen-year-old former Kazan student was in serious jeopardy of \narrest. \nAnd, if caught, he would not have been punished as leniently as \nbefore. His mother in fact had a deterrent effect upon him for the last \ntime. Worried by his involvement with revolutionaries in Kazan, she \nsold up the family house and purchased a landed estate at Alakaevka in \nSamara province. They moved in May . The police broke up \nChetvergova's group mere months later; had it not been for his \nmother's action, Vladimir would probably have joined the others in \nprison. Ulyanov brought his legal textbooks and his political reading \nmaterial to Alakaevka. In the winter of - he reportedly began \nto study Karl Marx's Das Kapital.  The effect upon him was \nenormous. Marx was shortly to emerge as the focus of his political \nworld; there would be no other writer, not even Chernyshevski, who \nwould be so revered by Ulyanov. It is impossible to say whether \nintellectual appreciation was as yet accompanied by an attraction of \nthe emotions. But this was not long in coming. Ulyanov's collected \nwritings will be combed in vain for traces of adverse comment on Karl \nMarx. The tone is uniformly not just approving but adulatory. He did \nnot abandon non-Marxist authors. Darwin's books too seem to have \nappealed to him at this time.  But Marx was obviously becoming the \ntowering intellectual force in his thinking. Expulsion from Kazan \nUniversity gave him leisure for cultural exploration. Steadily his \npolitical viewpoint was clarifying itself. \nHis mother's transportation of the family to Samara province did not \nprevent him from striking up friendships with local revolutionaries; \nand many of these, like N. S. Dolgov and M. P. Golubeva, were \nveterans of the terrorist wing of the agrarian-socialist movement. But \nVladimir nursed doubts about the strategy of People's Freedom. He \njoined A. P. Sklyarenko's narodnik group in Samara. Sklyarenko was \nonly a little older than Ulyanov; he had once been influenced by the \nideas of People's Freedom but he too was entering a period of \nreconsideration which would lead him to Marxism. Ulyanov found \nhimself among congenial colleagues in his own period of intellectual \nferment.  \nMARX AND ENGELS \nMarx's ideas and Russian populism, while coinciding in several \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nimportant areas, diverged in others of equal significance. The young \nVladimir's debt to Marx is hard to define with precision. They did not \nknow each other personally. Marx died in . Such impression as he \nmade upon Ulyanov was achieved through his books. Our sources are \nexiguous. The winter of - is probably the correct date of \nUlyanov's first reading of Kapital, but we cannot be categorical: a few \naccounts suggest that it was in fact earlier.  Ulyanov was a bibliophile. \nHe read fast, he read voraciously. We do not possess the record of his \ninitial encounter with Marx. Das Kapital is unlikely to have been the \nonly book. Ulyanov's earliest extant writings offer some clues. \nCitations made by him in his articles of - suggest that, if Kapital \nwas the most closely scrutinised text, The Communist Manifesto \n(written by Marx together with Frederick Engels) and Engels's \nAnti-Duhring were also works of influence. It is quite likely that \nthese same books were familiar and important to Ulyanov in . If \nwe are uncertain about chronology and bibliography, moreover, we \nmust be still more cautious about thematic influences. Ulyanov the \nanti-autobiographer has left no account. In order to gauge how he \ninitially reacted to Marx it is necessary to make guesses based upon \nindirect comments made by Ulyanov in his own early writings. It was, \nfurthermore, an evolving relationship. From the end of the s until \nhis death in , Ulyanov was an assiduous Marxologist; he was \nengaged more intensively in the study of Marx and Engels than of any \nother theorist (including the populists). He continually returned to \nthe works of his great inspirers in order to receive inspiration afresh. \nWe must therefore tread tentatively in our assessment of Marx's \nimpact upon Ulyanov while he was yet a young man. \nThe economics of Karl Marx were an enduring interest of Ulyanov's. \nThe analysis of capitalism was especially attractive. Marx had \ndescribed in Das Kapital how industrialists, introducing new forms of \nmachinery and a new division of labour into their factories, had \ninaugurated transformations of epochal significance. Capitalism \nenormously expanded the production of goods. It spread educational \nfacilities more widely and raised the level of popular consciousness.o \nUnlike the narodniki, Ulyanov condoned capitalist development. He \nalso shared Marx's enthusiasm about capitalism's organisational \nprinciples (whereas the populists, though welcoming modern inven-\ntions in technology, did not accept the need for a hierarchical \ndistribution of duties inside factories). Ulyanov also approved of \nlarge-scale social units. The characteristic agrarian-socialist affection \nfor the small, self-contained community found little echo in Ulyanov's \n Roads to Freedom \n \nwritings. And perhaps Kapital, with its withering critique of proposals \nto preserve 'communalistic' social relationships once capitalist \ndevelopment had begun, leant further strength to his Russian fol-\nlower's standpoine \nUlyanov did not eulogise capitalism. His aim was to indicate that the \nmodernisation of the Russian economy would afford advantages \nexploitable by socialists in the future. For capitalism was not to be \nregarded as a cul-de-sac. It was the penultimate rather than final epoch \nin global social change. Das. Kapital exposed capitalism's internal \ncontradictions. Capitalism operated upon principles of competition: \nthe capitalist maintained his business by hiring labourers to work in his \nfactory, to maximise his competitiveness he was obliged not only to \nextract as much labour power as possible from his work-force but also \nto invest an increasing proportion of his revenue in the acquisition of \nthe latest types of equipment. Inexorably some capitalists would be \nmore successful than others. Economic power would fall into fewer \nand fewer hands. The general effect would be that the capitalist system \nwould periodically get the supply of goods out of balance with the \ndemand for them. Massive economic crises would recur. The \nsolution would be for the working class to establish a 'dictatorship of \nthe proletariat' . Both culturally and politically, the workers would be \nwell-suited to such a role. Of all social classes, they had least interest in \na private-enterprise economy; they should be encouraged to engage in \n'class struggle'. This would necessitate a lengthy political campaign. \nOn the whole, the narodniki had denied that a parliament, even if it \nwere to be set up in Russia, was a suitable forum of activity for \nrevolutionaries. Marx had no such self-denying ordinance. Nor had \nUlyanov. He also enthusiastically concurred (and here Tkachev was \nfully with them) that force was the midwife of radical political change. \nOnly when the working-class dictatorship had swept away all remnants \nof the capitalist system would a more relaxed regime be initiated. \nAnd the transition would then be made to communism itself. \nEventually a new society would be created which would take as its \nguiding rule: from each according to his ability, to each according to his \nneeds.s \nSuch a denouement is a common theme in Ulyanov's work. He did \nnot expect it to be realised immediately. Kapital and Anti-Diihring \npostulated that inherent laws governed the workings of a socio-\neconomic formation such as capitalism. Marx, in addition, sketched a \nmajestic sequence of stages in historical change. Feudalism gave way \nto capitalism. And capitalism would be supplanted, ultimately, by \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ncommunism. A social and cultural stage could not simply be 'leaped \nover'. Again this was an attractive pattern of thought to Ulyanov, who \naimed to counter the narodnik contention that Russia had an \nexceptional destiny in store if only the political will was shown by the \nrevolutionary movement. \nIn general, Ulyanov argued that Marxism offered a satisfactory basis \nfor the explanation of social relations. It was 'scientific'. Marx himself \nhad frequently contrasted himself with those other socialist theorists \nwho, founding their ideas upon moral inclination, produced only \n'utopian' programmes. Ulyanov propounded this view avidly. He \nmaintained that scientific analysis, not sentimentality, should direct \npolicy; and that the bedrock of such an analysis was provided in the \nwritings of Marx and Engels. Ulyanov spoke of Kapital as incontest-\nable truth. It was not, in his opinion, open to refutation. This did not \nmean that no questions about society remained to be answered. Marx \nand Engels had laid the foundations. It was up to their followers to \ndeploy and adapt their ideas in the light of different conditions. Each \ncountry was bound to be in some sense unique; and political \ncircumstances, too, could not help but change over the years. Thus no \nspecific recommendation of policy was automatically applicable to a \nuniversal pattern. Marxism had to be handled 'creatively'. On the \nother hand there were limits, in Ulyanov's presentation, to the \nexperimentation allowable. Even in his first published writings, he was \nquick to raise the cry of delinquence and even heresy whenever his \ninterpretations of the Marxist canon were challenged. 'Orthodoxy' \nwas to be his unfailing demand. \nThere were many Marxists who objected to his interpretations. This \nwas understandable. Marx was an exceptionally broad-ranging \nthinker; he never formulated his exuberant analysis into a single, final, \nuncontradictory synthesis. Engels's Anti-Duhring was an attempt at \nsuch a formulation. It probably made Marx's ideas appear more \nclear-cut than they really had been. The complexity and inchoateness \nof Marx's Marxism were recognised even in the years shortly after his \ndeath; and these qualities are even more obvious now that we possess \nseveral important tracts which lay unpublished until the s and \ns. \nIt has been pointed out that Marx allowed for a variety of routes of \nsocial development in the epochs prior to socialism; and that he used \nthe concept of 'Asiatic despotism' rather than 'feudalism' to designate \na number of societies in the East. It has been shown too that he did \nnot discount the practicability of a peaceful transition to socialism \n Roads to Freedom \n \nwhere political freedom existed. He speculated upon such an outcome \nin Britain and the USA. Doubts about Lenin's version of Marxism \nexist in further areas. It has been noted that Marx never treated Kapital \nas completely incontrovertible; and that, moreover, it is in the nature \nof scientific propositions that they are capable of being tested. For all \nthe divergences between Marx and Engels (and these are too often \nexaggerated, because Marx had the opportunity to criticise the \nAnti-Duhring before publication), there is nothing in Engels's literary \noutput which suggests belief in the possibility of attaining knowledge \nof eternal validity. Ulyanov, furthermore, played down the working \nclass's ability to develop its own socialist ideas. Marx was not so \npessimistic. In addition Ulyanov had a penchant for political \nviolence. He certainly repudiated individual repudiating terrorism as a \nprimary tactic of overthrowing the Russian autocracy; but he nonethe-\nless was to approve of mass terror, even before the events of -, \nas a positive means of eradicating all vestiges of the ancien regime once \na revolutionary government was esconced in power. It is doubtful that \nMarx always felt so unambivalently. Ulyanov's Marxism was, \naccordingly, a legitimate version in most respects. But not in all. This \nwas not unusual; indeed it was typical for Marxist thinkers to be \nselective and to modify, alter and inadvertently distort Marx's notions \nin order to produce an interpretation which seemed to them to be most \nsuitable for their time, their country and their own political \npreferences. \nRUSSIAN MARXISM AND RUSSIAN POPULISM \nThis meant that debate among Russian Marxists could not be confined \nto the generalities of Marxism. The discussion also had to come to grips \nwith details. Russia's particularities required consideration. Marx \nhimself caused problems. On certain issues of immediate political \nrelevance he gave a degree of succour to the narodniki. In  he \nwrote to the populist Mikhailovski denying that Das Kapital pre-\nscribed a model of historical development for all countries. Russia, he \nstated, might take a different path from Western Europe's. In  \nthe Russian Marxist Vera Zasulich approached him for clarification. \nThe reply was depressing, at least for her. He repeated that the Russian \npeasant commune might well be usable as a vehicle for making a direct \ntransition to socialism. He encouraged the sociologist M. M. \nKovalevski to pursue his researches on communal practices. In his \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nlater years, Marx himself collected notes on Russian village tradi-\ntions. This was not the only encouragement he gave to narodnik \nattitudes. He admired the terrorists of People's Freedom. Both he and \nEngels felt that the assassination of the emperor might so destabilise \nthe political situation as to detonate revolution in Russia. Engels after \nMarx's death continued to sanction terrorist activity. He was not \ninitially attracted, moreover, by the Russian Marxists emerging in \nthe s; he treated them as somewhat bookish specimens who \nlacked the revolutionary instincts of the courageous narodnik \nundergrounders. \nMikhailovski made play with his correspondence with Marx; and \nZasulich found her own response from Marx so embarrassing that she \nwithheld it from public knowledge. Yet Marx had not rejected her \nunconditionally. His remarks were qualified. He affirmed that once \nthe Russian economy had embarked upon the capitalist road of \ndevelopment there would be no means of preventing capitalism from \ntaking a hold; and he felt in any case that a commune-based revolution \nin Russia would fail without aid from revolutions in industrially-\nadvanced countries elsewhere. \nMarx's self-disentanglement from the populist embrace did not \nwholly dispel the admiration for him felt by many narodniki. N. \nDanielson was a persistent suitor. It was he who, in , had made the \nfirst translation of Marx's Kapital into any foreign language; and his \nensuing correspondence with Marx and Engels is replete with attempts \nto persuade them that the narodnik belief in the impracticability of \ncapitalist development in Russia by no means contradicted Marxian \neconomics. In addition Petr Tkachev, theorist of narodnik terrorism, \nwas also one of Europe's most distinguished Marxologists in the s. \nMarx's economics commended itself to the populists in general. \nTkachev's respect went further. He liked also what he took to be \nMarx's politics. He argued that Marxism, properly interpreted, did not \ndiscount the possibility of countries taking a direct path from feudalism \nto socialism without an intermediate capitalist stage; he claimed that \nGermany itself had had such an opportunity in the sixteenth century. \nThis was unacceptable to Engels. Tkachev seemed to him to place \naltogether too much emphasis upon the capacity of revolutionary \nleaders to change history's course. Engels and Tkachev engaged in \npublic dispute in . It was an intriguing spectacle, not least because \nit provided the first sight of Marxism's co-founder being castigated as \nhaving drawn incorrect conclusions from his own works. \nBut even this did not irretrievably damage the reputation of Marx \n Roads to Freedom \n \nand Engels among populists; Mikhailovski's anti-Marxist tirades were \nnot universally approved. A case of continuing sympathy is found in \nVladimir Ulyanov's narodnik brother Aleksandr. In writing a new \ndraft programme for People's Freedom in , he expressly \ndescribed the Marxists in Russia as comrades. His ideas too had a \nMarxist aspect. He regarded the eventual achievement of socialism as \n'inevitable'. He called for the nationalisation of the land and of \nindustrial enterprises. He conceded that the peasantry was not a \nuniform social class and that a petite bourgeoisie was already being \nformed in the countryside; he stated also that urban workers would \nhave to be the main conveyors of the idea of revolution to the people. \nHe did not idealise the peasant. Nor did he have a simplistic view on \nhow to organise political activity. He perceived a need for an alliance \nwith middle-class groupings such as the liberals in order to bring down \nthe autocracy. He supported terrorism. But he did so not because he \nthough it would destroy tsarism but rather with the ambition of \npressuring the government to grant political freedoms. Aleksandr \nUlyanov bestrode two periods in revolutionary endeavour, and he \nappealed for revolutionary unity on the grounds that the dis-\nagreements between Marxists and his own group of narodniki covered \nquestions that were not 'essential' ones.l \nSuch appeals, however, fell upon increasingly deaf ears among \nMarxists after the late s. Aleksandr Ulyanov was still too \npopulistic for them. For all his eclecticism, he believed in the direct \ntransition from feudalism to socialism; he also wanted to base the \nfuture society upon the unit of the village commune. And he did not \nabandon the narodnik view of capitalism as a retrogressive historical \nstage. \nThese were attitudes justifiably taken by Russian Marxists to be \nquintessentially opposed to the thrust of Das Kapital and The \nCommunist Manifesto (which had claimed a much greater portion of \nMarx's time and mental effort than his letter to Mikhailovski). \nNevertheless other populist ideas lived on in Russian Marxism. In \nsome aspects, their influence was stronger upon others than upon \nVladimir Ulyanov himself. Agrarian policy supplies an example. \nMikhailovski accused the Russian Marxists of callous disregard for the \nsufferings ofthe peasantry in the  famine; they were charged with \ncondoning any phenomenon, however oppressive to the mass of the \npopulation, so long as it helped capitalist development. The Marxist N. \nE. Fedoseev rejected this claim. He described his own programme as \ninvolving not the expropriation of most peasant households but rather \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe preservation of a large social class of independent small-holders. \nAn analogous rejection was made by P. P. Maslovin the s. Maslov \ncriticised governmental financial policy to allow agricultural prices to \nsoar; it was his view that cheap food was essential for society's \nwell-being and for capitalist development. Some Marxists went \nfurther than Maslov. Activists such as A. I. Rykov would argue that, \nwhen the autocracy was overthrown, all gentry-held land should be \nhanded over to the peasantry. This was a traditional populist \ndemand. Narodnik ideas were far from being moribund. In fact, by the \nturn of the century, there even appeared Russian Marxists (among \nwhom the most notable was L. Nadezhdin) who called for the \nrestoration of terrorism as a primary tactic of struggle against the \nmonarchy. \nUlyanov shrugged off such suggestions. He did not support calls for \nthe lowering of agricultural prices; he did not, at least in the s and \nindeed until , favour the proposal to transfer all agricultural land \nto the peasantry. Nor did he approve of the use of assassinations as a \nprimary revolutionary tactic. Populistic though he was in certain \nleanings, he was unpopulistic and antipopulistic in others. \nGEORGI PLEKHANOV'S MARXISM \nHe was not without assistance from other Marxists in elaborating his \nMarxism; and the Russian who most influenced him was Georgi \nValentinovich Plekhanov. In his younger days Plekhanov had been a \nleader of Black Repartition and been forced to flee to Switzerland in \n. He saw that the chances of preventing capitalist development \nwere receding fast; and he was shocked by the peasantry's abstention \nfrom wholesale revolt. He gradually accepted Marxist political posi-\ntions. Controversy ensued. Russian Marxism received its baptism of \nfire in a struggle with agrarian socialism. This made the early Russian \nMarxists keen to demonstrate the validity of their self-description as \nMarxists; and their edginess was exacerbated by the statements made \nin the s by Marx and Engels. Perhaps it was only in , when \nEngels at last declared that capitalism had decisively gripped the \nRussian economy, that the coolness towards the experiments in \nRussian Marxism fully vanished. Plekhanov in any case addressed \nhimself mainly to a Russian readership. Attacking People's Freedom, \nhe ridiculed the notion that a small band of conspirators could effect a \nrevolution. Premature attempts by socialists to seize power in Russia \n Roads to Freedom \n \nhad to be averted. According to Plekhanov, the next stage in the \ncountry's political transformation would be not an agrarian-socialist \ngovernment but a government representing the interests of the rising \nbourgeoisie. This would come about only through bloody revolution. \nParliamentary democracy was attainable in the empire only through \nthe forcible overthrow of the absolute monarchy. \nPlekhanov's Socialism And Political Struggle, written in , put \nthis case at length; he expanded his reasonings in  with Our \nDisagreements. Both books were acclaimed in most respects by all \nyoung Russian Marxists. Ulyanov reiterated its arguments. \nHe also sided with Plekhanov over those matters in his books that \nsparked off Russian Marxism's earliest internal dispute. Plekhanov \nsaw that it went against the grain, for most socialists, to propose the \nemplacement of the middle class in power; and he knew his policy to \nsanction the further immiseration of most, though not all, peasants. \nPlekhanov was unflinching. He argued that the economic trends were \nirreversible; and Ulyanov ranged himself with him against the \nFedoseevs and Maslovs who took a less indifferent attitude to the \npeasantry's plight. In addition, Ulyanov approved of Plekhanov's \ninsistence that capitalism was no longer a distant projection. It had \narrived in Russia. Das Kapital contained little about the peasantry; but \nPlekhanov endeavoured to show that Marxian categories of analysis \nwere applicable to the changing economic relationships in the depths \nof rural Russia. Plekhanov used data from V. E. Postnikov and other \nzemstvo statisticians. He was an aggressive, sarcastic debater (and this \nmust have been an element in his attractiveness to Ulyanov, who was \nto become notorious for his polemical zeal). He was especially skilled \nin drawing attention to the long-term economic effects of the Edict of \n; there was nobody who put the view more vividly that the \ngovernment's reforms were a watershed in capitalist development. His \ntwo early books were a crucial contribution to the Russian Marxist \ndoctrine that capitalism was on the verge of pervading all economic \nrelations in town and countryside. \nGeorgi Plekhanov was not alone in his thinking. Other ex-narodniki \njoined him in  to propose the adoption of a Marxist programme \nfor Russian socialists. Among them were Pavel Akselrod, Vera \nZasulich and Lev Deich. Plekhanov and his associates called them-\nselves the Emancipation Of Labour Group. \nThey saw urgent tasks to perform; they did not intend to wait upon \nevents. European history contained many examples of slow, steady \nprocesses of change interrupted by unexpected explosions of discon-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ntent. The Paris Commune had been precisely such a phenomenon. In \n the workers of the French capital threw up the barricades and \ninstalled their own administration. The Commune lasted only weeks, \nbeing suppressed by troops dispatched from Versailles. But it lived on \nin the memory of Europe's revolutionaries. The Emancipation Of \nLabour Group wished to be in a position to take full advantage of any \nsimilar situation which might arise in Russia. Plekhanov drew atten-\ntion to The Communist Manifesto; he pointed out that Germany, at the \ntime of its publication in , had been at a level of economic and \npolitical development comparable with Russia's in the s. What \nhad been sauce for the Prussian goose was sauce for the Russian \ngander. The Emanicipation Of Labour Group perceived no reason \nwhy they should not eventually be able to form a mass political party \nlike the German Social-Democratic Party. By the mid-s, the \nGerman social-democrats had won the loyalty of millions of their \nnation's workers; they were sending more and more representatives to \nthe Reichstag. The German Social-Democratic Party was Marxist in \nideology and was the main force inside the Second International \n(which united Europe's socialist movement). Plekhanov's perspective \nwas optimistic. Even Russian economic backwardness was to be \nregarded as an asset: it would mean that socialist ideas could be \ndisseminated among Russia's working class at an earlier stage in the \ncountry's economic transformation than had been possible in Britain, \nFrance or Germany. \nSuch ideas were endorsed by Ulyanov and the young generation of \nMarxists. They admired a further argument. This was that industrial \nworkers were the 'vanguard' of the social forces opposed to the \nRussian monarchy. They were to lead the 'democratic revolution'. \nThey would need allies, since the proletariat still constituted a minority \nof the population. They would have to tug the middle class, the \npeasantry, the non-Orthodox religious groups and the non-Russian \nnationalities into a coalition. Only the working class, however, had the \npotential to act as an unambiguously revolutionary body. All the other \nclasses and groups were likely to make compromises with tsarism. \nPlekhanov's colleague Akselrod therefore urged that industrial work-\ners should maintain 'hegemony' over the anti-monarchical movement \nin Russia. \nThe Group said little about the immediate steps to be taken. \nPlekhanov called upon the socialist elements of the intelligentsia to \nguide the workers towards Marxism; and, again, Ulyanov was to warm \nto Plekhanov's belief in the intellectual's capacity to attain exact \n Roads to Freedom \n \nknowledge of society - a belief that was not universally accepted by \nMarxists inside and outside Russia. But Plekhanov offered no \ncounsel about the organisational forms of the political party which \nwould eventually be founded. Nor did he describe the means to be \nemployed to overthrow the monarchy. He assumed generally that \nmass action would be needed; he criticised People's Freedom for \nsuggesting that assassination campaigns should be the primary tactic. \nThe Emancipation Of Labour Group thought that the workers, as the \nvanguard of the anti-monarchical forces, would be in a position to \ndemand comprehensive reforms from the succeeding middle-class \ngovernment. The Russian Marxist programme should call for a system \nof parliamentary elections based upon universal, secret-ballot suf-\nfrage. Freedoms of conscience, expression, organisation and assembly \nshould be declared. The professional army should be abolished; there \nshould be a 'general arming of the people'. Plekhanov wanted \nlegislation protecting the rights of factory workers at the place of \nemployment; he also desired to lift the restrictions upon the peasan-\ntry's right to leave the village commune at will. He sought the abolition \nof redemption payments. His Group felt that such a programme \nwould provide the political and economic framework necessary for the \nmaturation of Russian capitalism. It would also equip socialists with \nthe chance to propagate their ideas and construct a mass political \nparty. \nPlekhanov claimed to have sketched a programme in line with the \ncontours of European Marxism as it was widely interpreted in the years \nafter Marx's death. For the most part, his claim was just. But there \nremained elements that did not fit the pattern. \nThis was discernible in his refusal to make an absolute rejection of \nassassinations as a method of fighting the autocracy. He opposed \nterrorism as a primary means of bringing down the regime, yet still \nregarded it as an acceptable auxiliary tactic. Such a viewpoint was not \nin keeping with the outlook of Karl Kautsky and other theorists of the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party in the s (even though Marx \nhimself had approved of an assassination campaign in Russia). There \nwere further contrasts. Plekhanov certainly expected the overthrow of \nthe autocracy to be followed by a period of bourgeois government. \nThis was entirely unexceptionable doctrine. But his programme also \ndemanded a plenitude of rights for workers and peasants; he even \nexpected the bourgeois government to give financial aid to their \nself-organised co-operatives. His capitalism was not going to be of an \nuntrammelled variety. His un typicality does not end here. It is equally \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nvisible in his treatment of the subsequent measures for the eventual \ndismemberment of capitalism itself. Our Disagreements emphasised the \nneed for a 'working-class dictatorship' . This accorded with Marx's \ncall for 'the dictatorship of the proletariat'. Plekhanov was somewhat \nmore categorical than Marx; for Marx had not entirely discounted the \npossibility of a peaceful transition to socialism. In any case, phrases \nlike 'dictatorship' were already an embarrassment to the German \nSocial-Democratic Party in the s. Instead, Kautsky tended to \nemphasise the benefits of universal suffrage. Ulyanov was on \nPlekhanov's side. The version of Marxism produced by Plekhanov \nseemed to his young follower to be both entirely acceptable in doctrine \nand wonderfully suited to the political tasks facing Russian Marxists in \nthe years ahead. \nACTIVISM IN SAMARA \nIt took time for the Marxist circles in the Russian empire to acquire \ntheir organisational identity. Plekhanov arranged to have his pam-\nphlets smuggled back from Switzerland. In  he made contact with \nMarxist activists in St. Petersburg led by the Bulgarian D. I. Blagoev. \nBut Blagoev was quickly arrested, and Plekhanov's role as a practical \nleader became negligible for the rest of the decade.s Nevertheless his \nown intellectual odyssey towards Marxism was being repeated by \nmany revolutionaries. Poles and Jews were in the forefront. Their \ngroups, located in the empire's western regions, led the way in forming \ndisciplined, cohesive underground local organisations. Indeed the \nBund, as the Jewish Marxist party was called, shortly enrolled \nthousands of workers.s But revolutionaries of Russian origin also \nwere bestirring themselves in the same direction: towards Marxism. \nAmong them, in Samara, were Vladimir Ulyanov and A. P. \nSklyarenko. The Volga city of Samara was not as politically volatile as \nKazan; but, from the standpoint of the revolutionaries, it compensated \nfor its quiescence by its intellectually more bracing discussions. Local \njournals in the s contained articles by writers of national \nrenown. Evening debates were a feature of the city's clandestine \npolitical activity. Sklyarenko's group was invited to contribute to \nnarodnik meetings; and these invitations were accepted. They offered \nthe chance to win further recruits to Marxism. Nobody has pinpointed \nwhen Sklyarenko's organisation made its own crossing over to Russian \nMarxist doctrines. Vladimir Ulyanov was reportedly even more \n Roads to Freedom \n \nenthusiastic about the new ideas than Sklyarenko and to have been the \nforce behind the group's transformation. He proved his mettle in \ndebate with leading terrorists who visited Samara in search of \nsupporters. M. V. Sabunaev made such a trip in December . He \nwas persisting in his endeavour to re-establish a network of People's \nFreedom groups; and apparently he argued, like Aleksandr Ulyanov, \nthat revolutionaries of different persuasions should not exaggerate \ntheir differences. Accounts of the meeting in Samara suggest that \nUlyanov revealed himself as a devastating critic of Sabunaev's \nstrategy. He seems to have become his group's most trenchant \npolemicist. When P. I. Rossinevich repeated Sabunaev's attempt in \nMarch , it was again Ulyanov who took up the intellectual \ncudgels. \nYet it remains a matter of speculation whether he had opted \ndecisively for a Plekhanovite position in this period. Autobiographical \nfragments are again scarce. No activist with even the barest sense of \nself-preservation would jot down such details at the time; but later in \nlife Ulyanov was to date his revolutionary career as having started in \n-. It is possible that this signified the time of his conversion. \nCould it be that in  and  he detected the inadequacies in \nagrarian-socialist views without yet embracing a Russian Marxist \nperspective? Such a condition was not unusual in those years. It would \ncertainly have allowed him to take issue with the Sabunaevs and the \nRossineviches. But it would not have forced him to avoid contact with \nthe terrorists; indeed he was happy to have the chance to discuss \npolitics with veterans of People's Freedom exiled to Samara. He \nretained the agrarian-socialist interest in the mechanics of the 'seizure \nof power'. Yet Ulyanov, as M. P. Golubeva's memoirs indicate, \nrefused to put high hopes in the peasantry: 'He could in no way \nunderstand on what kind of \"people\" we expected to base ourselves, \nand he began to explain at length that the people was not some single \nand undifferentiated entity, that the people was constituted by classes \nwith differing interests.' These were formative years in Ulyanov's \ncareer. It is frustrating that the published sources are so sparse. \nNonetheless Ulyanov's life was not yet wholly absorbed in political \nactivism. Though modest in size, his mother's estate at Alakaevka \nrequired someone to run it; it was natural for her to turn to her oldest \nsurviving son. His encounter with economic management was brief. \nHe was reticent about the reasons, except for an opaque later remark \nthat 'relations with the peasantry became abnormal' . It would be \ninstructive to know more about the episode. Ulyanov was having his \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nfirst working contact with non-privileged sections of the rural popula-\ntion; and we may wonder whether the experience simply confirmed his \nconvictions about them or altered them in some way. Once more the \nsources fail us. \nUlyanov made no other attempt at the practical application of his \neconomics until becoming leader of the Soviet government; hencefor-\nward his knowledge of the world of toil was to come through books and \nfrom activists with first-hand acquaintance with economic affairs in the \nvillage and town. He had not abandoned hopes of a lawyer's career. \nHis mother's pleas to the authorities were rewarded on  May  \nwith official notification that he could register himself as an external \nstudent attached to the university of his choice. The fates were with \nhim. The police department in Samara, though aware of his friendship \nwith 'persons of doubtful reliability', were unable to supply concrete \nproofs of 'anti-state' behaviour. He selected Petersburg as his \nuniversity city. He spent three months there on a study-trip, leaving \nSamara in August . On his return, in October, he undertook the \nreading which would enable him to sit the final examinations in spring \nand autumn . He acquired digs in St. Petersburg in March. He had \nno involvement in political activity (although he used the chance to \nlook up his brother Aleksandr's friends and to enquire about the last \nmonths of his life). It was not a happy sojourn. Yet another tragedy \nafflicted the Ulyanov family. Vladimir's favourite sister Olga, herself a \nstudent in St. Petersburg, caught typhoid and died on  May l. \nHers was the third funeral that it fell to twenty-one years old Vladimir \nUlyanov to organise.s But he resumed his studies with his already \nproven powers of detachment and resilience; and, when the exam \nresults were published in November , he received the Russian \nequivalent of a first-class honours degree. \n. \nIn January  he started work as a temporary assistant barrister in \nthe offices of A. N. Khardin, a Samara lawyer who was also his chess \npartner. He seems to have been an effective defence counsel. In July he \nobtained papers for permanent employment; he showed outward signs \nof being a young man who, after a flirtation with revolutionism, had \nsettled down to mundane respectability. A discreet watch was kept on \nhim by the police, but nothing compromising could be ascertained. In \nfact his political commitment was as strong as ever. The descriptions of \ngovernmental abuses given in Anton Chekhov's short stories set off a \ncharge of emotion in him: 'I felt quite literally sick; I couldn't stay in \nmy own room, I got up and went outside.' \nThroughout  the Sklyarenko-Ulyanov group continued their \n Roads to Freedom \n \nmeetings. They began to expand their membership, welcoming \nnewcomers like I. K. Lalayants. Their common thirst for study was \nprodigious. They combed their way through Kapital and Anti-Duhring; \nthey were also attracted by Engels's Condition of the Working Class \nin England. They maintained an interest in works by non-Marxist \nwriters. It is likely that Ulyanov was familiar with the writings of \nRicardo, Guizot and Ashley. The group also kept abreast of events in \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. Kautsky's Die Neue Zeit \nsometimes arrived in Samara, and Ulyanov would pounce on copies \neagerly. Pamphlets by Plekhanov too would occasionally reach him. \nThe labour of self-instruction proceeded. And, as confidence \nincreased, the Samara activists sought to do something of their own to \nstrengthen the plausibility of Russian Marxism in general. Plekhanov's \neconomics were a sketch of trends. Ulyanov and Sklyarenko agreed on \nthe need to conduct more detailed work on agrarian statistics. They \ncommenced research on the contemporary peasant economy; and this \nled Ulyanov not only to investigate zemstvo statistical handbooks but \nalso to grasp every opportunity to talk directly with peasants. His \nbrother-in-law Mark Elizarov was a peasant's son with a clerical job in \nSamara. Elizarov introduced him to rural inhabitants. So too did A. A. \nPreobrazhenski. Ulyanov's own work as a lawyer, which not \ninfrequently involved the defence of individual peasants, gave him \nfurther insights into the operation of the village commune. lOO He began \nto write articles. Alakaevka provided an enclave of calm for his studies. \nDetermined to organise his work effectively, he marked out an area in \nthe garden to serve as his office; the family called it Volodya's \nCorner. lOl \nReportedly, by the end of , he had drafted three articles \nintended to expose weaknesses in Vorontsov's economic standpoint. \nThere is a story too that Ulyanov and Mikhailovski met face to face in \ndebate in the summer of that year, and that Mikhailovski came off \nworsted. The tale is probably fictitious. lo But there is no denying that \nUlyanov had by now emerged as a competent exponent of Marxism. \nHe was firm in conviction, savage in discussion. It remained for him to \nprove that he was not only a promising economist but also a practical \npolitical leader. \n",
    "1895-1899": "   Arrivals \nST. PETERSBURG \nIndustrialisation poses problems everywhere it is attempted; and not \nthe least of them is the question about the political place of the \nworkers. Public debate raged through the nineteenth century in \nBritain. It commenced later in Russia, but by the s it was in full \nspate. Official tsarist attitudes were authoritarian. But they possessed \nan admixture of paternalism; the government hoped that the working \nclass, like the peasantry, would continue to revere the emperor as 'the \nlittle father'. The revolutionaries were striving to reverse this subordi-\nnate status. The narodniki, though conceiving of the workers as \npeasants temporarily removed from the land, increasingly treated the \nworking class as the prime force to pull down the autocracy. Marxists \nput the working class even higher in their scheme of things; the \nproletariat was expected by them to refashion the whole of society in \nits own image. All cities in Russia witnessed the struggle for the \nworkers' loyalty. But naturally the competition was at its most \nferocious in Petersburg: not only was it the seat of government; it also \ncontained a large number of vast factory complexes. The profit motive \nhad triumphed over notions of town-planning, and the result was an \ninterspersing of gaunt industrial blocks with palaces and administra-\ntive buildings. There was little residential segregation on a class basis. \nThe discrepancy between the lifestyles of the upper orders and the \noppressed manual labourers was therefore superabundantly visible. It \nwas a matter that the authorities ignored at their peril. \nUlyanov decided to pull up his Volga roots and move there. His \nmother, now in her late fifties, was well capable of tending to her affairs \nindependently. He had yet to make acquaintance with his first factory \nworker. His theories were still untested by practical observation of \nindustrial urban life, and he desired to rectify the situation. He arrived \nin the capital on  August  and quickly started work in the \nlawyer's offices of M. F. Volkenshtein.  \nPolitical considerations held his thoughts. On his way from Samara \n \n Arrivals \n \nhe had stopped off in Nizhni Novgorod and contacted a Marxist circle \nled by P. N. Skvortsov and S. I. Mickiewicz. Skvortsov told him how \nand where to link up with Marxists in the metropolis. Ulyanov also \nmade a stop-over in the town of Vladimir in order to meet N. E. \nFedoseev; but Fedoseev was in prison and the meeting did not take \nplace. Ulyanov's initiative did not secure him an automatic welcome \nin st. Petersburg. He had been put in touch with the group founded in \n by S. I. Radchenko. Its members opposed the use of terror in any \nform as a means of bringing down the autocracy; and they apparently \nlearnt that Ulyanov, like Plekhanov, was not absolutely hostile to \nassassinations. They interviewed him carefully. No doubt he reas-\nsured them that he did not share the narodnik-terrorists' belief in \nterror as the primary immediate tactic. They allowed him to join. He \nmust have convinced them that he no longer supported People's \nFreedom; otherwise it is inexplicable why he did not try to enter the \norganisation of populist terrorists already in existence in the capital. \nUlyanov nonetheless took some months to make his influence felt \nupon the Petersburg Marxists. Radchenko's priority was to spread \npropaganda in the workers' educational circles. Propagandists were \nscarce. Yet it was not until autumn , fully a year after the move \nfrom Samara, that Ulyanov became exercised by pedagogical activity. \nNor did Ulyanov participate in the group's negotiations with other \nworkers' organisations in the winter -. The 'organisation man' \nof future years was not yet known for his administrative talents. \nUlyanov's initial pre-occupation, in fact, was with his books. He was \ncompleting his self-education as an economist. He analysed the latest \nagrarian statistics. He returned to the first two volumes of Das Kapital, \ncorrecting mistakes in the Russian translation as he went. \nHe also encouraged Radchenko's group to hold its own discussion \nsessions. This gave him the chance to shine. In October  G. B. \nKrasin delivered a paper on Russian economic trends; but it was \nUlyanov who showed himself to be the more cogent critic of agrarian \nsocialism. Pursuing his investigations, he completed an article entitled \nNew Economic Directions in Peasant Life. The general content \ndiffered little from Plekhanov's earlier material. A particular point was \nnonetheless noteworthy. Ulyanov re-organised zemstvo statistical \ndata so as to show that it was the peasant households with the greater \nacreages which were achieving the higher agricultural productivity. \nThis was a technical refinement beyond Plekhanov's aspirations. A \nsecond point of interest is discoverable in another article written by \nUlyanov in , Concerning the So-Called Question of Markets. In it \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe argued that narodnik writings were pre-occupied by discussions on \nconsumer goods and had ignored the goods used in further stages of \nproduction. This was in his view a crucial neglect. He maintained, \nagainst the narodniki, that the growth rate in output of producer's \ngoods was always greater than the rate for goods made for consumers; \nand that the market for capitalist development did not depend upon \nthe existence of a massive affluent peasantry. Ulyanov's contribution \nwas already a significant extension of Plekhanov's original claims. \nIt was not unusual for Marxists to take their intellectual self-\npreparation so seriously; and nobody in Radchenko's group said that \nUlyanov was neglecting his duty. Disputes about socialist theory \ngained in importance in the Petersburg labour movement in the \nmid-nineties. Agrarian socialists and Marxists clashed. Workers were \nasked to choose between the two rival views on the future. They did \nnot rush to choose. \nAmong the working class there lingered ambivalent feelings about \nintellectuals. In , three workers had established a Central \nWorkers' Circle to provide popular educational facilities. Student-\nintellectuals were invited as teachers under the workers' control. \nStrikes broke out in the Thornton textile factory in the winter of \n-. The Circle created a Central Workers' Fund to help strikers \nfinancially and to print leaflets. A trade union was in the making. Both \nagrarian socialists and Marxists contributed teachers for the Circle's \nactivities. Arrests in  and  failed to catch all the Circle's \nactivists, and Radchenko persisted with his attempt to make it a \nstronghold for Marxism.  Success was not easily obtained. Radchenko \nbelieved in the primary role to be played by intellectuals in the fight for \nsocialism; and his organisational code, with its heavy emphasis upon \nsecrecy, impeded even the operation of the education circles. On the \nother hand, the workers as students were un attracted by narodnik-ter-\nrorist talk of immediate insurrection. Their foremost demand was for \ncultural and political tuition. This gave the Marxists a distinct \nadvantage over People's Freedom; and the course of training offered \nby Radchenko's group gained dozens of recruits in  and . \nUlyanov too involved himself, offering himself as tutor to a workers' \ncircle in autumn . \nIt was around this time, however, that Marxists elsewhere in the \nempire began to reform their tactics. Courses tended to isolate the \nworker-students from the rest of their work-mates. The circles had \nlittle contact with factory life. Jewish and Polish activists pressed the \nneed to conduct 'agitation' among ordinary workers. This would \n Arrivals \n \ninvolve speeches and pamphlets on particular issues. Activists should \ncampaign against low pay, unsafe machinery and management abuses; \nthey should organise strikes. A handbook, On Agitation, was printed in \nVilno to summarise the tactics. The assumption was that strikes would \nattract an attempt at repression by the government and therefore \nwould steadily draw the working class into political opposition to the \nregime. On Agitation was carried to St. Petersburg in September  \nby Yuli Osipovich Martov (who was shortly to become a close \ncollaborator of Ulyanov's); and he brought news of the success of the \ntactics in western regions of the empire. Radchenko's group baulked \nat first, not wanting to be deflected from their instructional pro-\ngramme. But opinion had swung round in favour by the end of the \nyear. The group awaited its opportunity. And when strikes occurred in \na number of armaments works in January  it was Ulyanov who \ncomposed the proclamatory leaflets. \nHe combined this work with maintained interest in economics. In \nspring and summer , writing furiously, he finished a three-part \nmanuscript called What Are 'the Friends o/the People'? It filled out the \nanalysis offered in his previous work. It was also his first attempt to \nattack the interpretation of Marx's ideas by the narodnik \nMikhailovski; Ulyanov very reasonably stressed Marx's affirmation \nthat Russia's chance of experiencing a unique social transformation \nwould vanish once capitalism had started to develop.ls This develop-\nment, Ulyanov declared, had now commenced. He had his manuscript \nreproduced in a few dozen copies on a duplicating apparatus. In \nAugust he was informed of a more sophisticated machine available in \nVladimir province, and he took a trip out from St. Petersburg to \narrange for the production of a further hundred copies. This \ntime-consuming practicality galled him when he contemplated the ease \nwith which certain other exponents of Marxian economics in the \ncapital managed to publicise their views. Petr Bernardovich Struve, a \nyoung graduate, had already achieved fame through his contributions \nto open debates at the Free Economic Society. In September  \nStruve's book Critical Remarks sneaked past the censorship and was \npublished legally. Through their common friend Aleksandr Potresov, \nUlyanov met up with Struve around New Year . Ulyanov wanted \nhelp with publication of his economic studies. An agreement was \nstruck to produce a symposium of articles. At the last moment, in April \n, the censor intervened and nearly all the copies were burned \nbefore they could be sold. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nULYANOV, STRUVE AND PLEKHANOV \nVladimir Ulyanov's relations with Petr Struve were an alliance of \nconvenience. It catches the eye that Ulyanov, who in the s was \noften portrayed as the incarnation of implacable irreconcilability, did \nnot appear in this light to his early comrades in St. Petersburg. Many \nindeed thought him too ready to be reconciled. What business, they \nasked, had a Marxist revolutionary to talk with those self-proclaimed \nfollowers of Marx like Struve who seemed to have an aversion to the \nvery goal of socialist revolution? \nThe answer clarifies the singular stance in matters of theory assumed \nat the time by Ulyanov. His interest in Struve was not limited to \npublishing opportunities. It was also political. Struve was at the centre \nof a group of writers. His associates M. I. Tugan-Baranovski, S. N. \nBulgakov and N. A. Berdyaev were already emitting glimmerings of \nthe contributions they would each make to Russian public life. They \nwere very independent thinkers; they felt no compulsion, unlike many \nother Marxists like Ulyanov, to anchor all their statements to the \nwritings of Marx and Engels. They were a well-heeled bunch. With the \nsingle exception of Plekhanov, they were the best-known Marxists in \nthe Russian empire in the s. Word of their emergence reached the \nEmancipation Of Labour Group in Geneva. Initially Plekhanov hoped \nto combine with them in publishing ventures. Struve, Tugan-\nBaranovski and Bulgakov were sophisticated economists and had \ndeployed their learning against Vorontsov. Tugan's material was most \nremarkable. Working on developmental economic theory, he invented \na series of mathematical schemata to represent the interrelationship of \ncapital and labour in an industrialising society. Like Ulyanov, he \nargued that capitalism could grow largely through the production of \nindustrial machinery and other producer's goods and would not have \nto depend predominantly upon the creation of a mass consumerist \nmarket. Capitalism would not be inhibited by the pauperisation of the \nmajority of the peasantry. Neither Struve nor Tugan were at all \nworried that the country's material progress would be achieved at \nenormous social expense. \nThese arguments were an essential reason for Ulyanov's approaches \nto Struve's group; he liked their unflinching acceptance of what they \nbelieved to be the logical outcome of capitalist development. The issue \nwas the principal item of debate until the late s. Ulyanov \ndisagreed about details in their depiction of the pattern of capitalism's \ngrowth; but he evidently derived intellectual benefit and perhaps also \n Arrivals \n \na degree of psychological support from his discussions with Struve, \nTugan and Bulgakov. \nThe conditionality of Ulyanov's alliance, however, was manifest \nfrom the start. Struve agreed that the working class was the most \ndependable instrument for removing the monarchy; and he yielded to \nno one in his belief in Russia's need for political freedom. But he made \nno unambiguous recommendation of violent methods to that end. This \nreluctance pervaded his strategy. He refrained, too, from condoning \nthe use of force to advance socialism's cause in the more distant period \nwhen the autocracy had been dismantled. He preferred evolution to \nrevolution. He expected capitalism to give way to socialism not \nthrough bloody upheaval but as the result of peaceful, transitional \nmeasures. Struve believed in the virtues of reform. But how could a \n'bourgeois state' be made to inaugurate a programme for the death of \ncapitalism? Struve anticipated the question. In Critical Remarks he \ndenied that the state always needs must be the guardian of the interests \nof the propertied classes; he implied that its powers were autonom-\nous enough to allow it to carry through radical reforms regardless of \nopposition by industrialists. In general, moreover, Struve made no \ndirect criticism of capitalism itself. He noted Marx's suggestion that a \nsocialist transformation of society would begin to be politically feasible \nonly when the capitalist economy faced crisis and ruin. Struve opposed \nthis approach. For him it was intolerable that socialists should aim to \ncome to power at a time of economic disruption. He emphasised \ncapitalism's progressive role. Critical Remarks was a song of praise for \nits capacity to raise levels of production, create conditions of plenty, \nintroduce educational facilities and modernise the country's culture. \nPlekhanov was disconcerted. Critical Remarks was already moving \ntowards a repudiation of the Communist Manifesto. This movement \nwas to continue. In the late s Struve and Tugan-Baranovski would \nargue that many fundamental ideas of Marx and Engels were wrong. \nStruve would reject Marx's labour theory of value as being simplistic; \nTugan would assert that recent empirical data undermined the \ncredibility of Marx's predictions about the rate of return of investment \nunder capitalism. Plekhanov was to look on them as mere 'Legal \nMarxists'. He was to treat them as outriders for a pan-European \n'revisionist' movement threatening to disfigure Marxism by making it \nindistinguishable from liberalism. Indeed Struve was to become a \nleading inspiration for the Russian liberal party, the Constitutional \nDemocrats. \nYet Plekhanov desisted from waging war upon Struve and company \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nin . He even agreed, yielding to Potresov's persuasion, to \ncontribute articles to collections organised by Struve. His objections \nremained in force. He showed no displeasure when he heard of attacks \nupon Struve by other Marxists in Russia. Ulyanov was the most \nnotable aggressor. In mid- he already referred to Struve as \n'mister': a term of conscious literary abuse among Marxists. Ulyanov \nflailed out at Struve's sins of omission, most notably his failure to state \nthe need for 'class struggle' . He depicted Struve as a prophet of the \npolitics of civil peace. Ulyanov anticipated a faster and more violent \ntransition to socialism. Taking Struve to task, he stressed the revolu-\ntionary perspective of Marx's writings. Struve was also alleged to have \nunderestimated the extent of industrial growth already achieved in \nRussia. Ulyanov highlighted the 'bourgeois direction' of his country's \neconomy. 'Did it not,' he asked, 'express itself completely clearly even \nin the s? Did it not dominate too in the entire course of the \ns?, He knew, of course, that industrialisation still had a long way \nto go. Russia still lagged behind Britain, Germany and the USA. Yet \nUlyanov called attention to the fact that, at the time of the writing of \nthe Das Kapital, even England (which was the most industrially-\nadvanced nation in Europe) had a factory labour force which \nconstituted a mere twelfth of its population. Revolutionaries in \nRussia could take heart from this. Ulyanov refused to accept that \nMarxists should confine their political appeals to factory employees. \nHe looked further afield; his stirring contention was that industrial \nworkers were 'merely the upper layers of the immense mass of the \npeasantry which already lives through the selling of its labour power \nmore than by its own economy' . \nStruve found Ulyanov's description of Russian reality hopelessly \nhyperbolical. The two spent many evenings in conversations; it was \nStruve's hope that, if Ulyanov succeeded in obtaining an exit visa, \nSwitzerland would demonstrate to him what a true 'bourgeois order' \nlooked like. Arguments out of books were clearly incapable of \nachieving this. But Ulyanov's confidence was boosted not only by the \ndiscovery that he was Struve's equal in his knowledge of Marxian texts \nbut also by his feeling that he would be welcome as an ally by the \nRussian Marxist he most admired, Plekhanov. \nHis presentiments were correct. And yet it behoves us to note that \nthe views of Ulyanov and Plekhanov were not identical even in the \ns. Plekhanov did not assert that capitalism 'dominated' the \nRussian economy; he merely said that 'it can become and is becoming' \n Arrivals \n \nthe dominant force. Nor did he enthuse about talk of the revolu-\ntionary potentiality of the peasantry. Since leaving Black Repartition, \nPlekhanov had come to regard the peasants as being too easily drawn \ntowards support for the political status quo. He also disliked Ulyanov's \ninsulting remarks about middle-class liberals. It was Plekhanov's \ncontention that Marxists should exhibit all possible tact in order to \nattract the liberals into an all-out war against the autocracy. Already, \ntoo, Plekhanov objected to Ulyanov's depiction of Russian feudalism. \nUlyanov claimed that Russia's feudal traditions had been motivated by \nessentially the same conglomeration of social forces as in the West. For \nPlekhanov, this ignored the state's primary role in entrenching \nfeudalism in Russia in centuries past. He judged that Russian \nfeudalism held important features in common with Asiatic despot-\nisms. These differences of opinion would gather in significance in the \nyears ahead. But, for the moment, the two men happily put them aside \nand sought the fulfilment of their common immediate aims. Together, \nthey would confront agrarian socialism; and they would try to \nminimise the advances made by 'revisionist' Marxism. \nTHE EMERGING LEADER \nVladimir Ulyanov at the age of twenty five was recognised by his \ncomrades as 'a person of great calibre' . And he knew his own worth. \nBut he was not vain; and others noted that this gave him the \nself-assurance to listen to fellow activists ratherthan merely impose his \nopinions upon them.s He was mature beyond his years. The impres-\nsion was enhanced by his physical appearance: he was losing hair on \nthe dome of his cranium and bore a close resemblance to his deceased \nfather. He was nicknamed Old Man by workers in his education circle \n(who also informed him that his loss of hair came from reading too \ninany books). He retained a severe demeanour. He was a demanding \nteacher, expecting his charges to tackle Das Kapital almost as soon as \nthey could read and write. Study and writing had confirmed his \nintuition that he had found his vocation as a full-time revolutionary. It \nwas an intensely serious calling for him, and never in the years ahead \nwould he allow the slightest frivolity get in the way of his pursuit of \npolitical goals. But fun was not alien to him. Chess, hunting, walking \nand reading novels and philosophy were his pleasures (although \nPotresov claimed that Ulyanov was the only man in the world who \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nderived positive enjoyment from refusing a second beer). Neverthe-\nless everything took a subordinate place to politics. Revolution was \nUlyanov's career and his dream. \nHis mother's monthly allowances were crucial. The job with \nVolkenshtein's was a cover; Ulyanov hoped it would shrug off the \npolice's attentions. He limited himself to some minimal work as a \npart-time consultant and gave up court appearances as a barrister. \nLife was comfortable. Summer holidays in summer  were spent \nwith cousins in Moscow province. This was a further sign of the gap of \nprivilege separating him from the industrial workers (who, if they \nvisited the countryside at all, did so to help their families with the \nharvest). His only personal trouble was his health. In March  he \nwas stricken by pneumonia. Fortunately it was a mild bout and his \nmother, hurrying to Petersburg, nursed him over the worst of it. \nIt was in the capital that Ulyanov met Nadezhda Konstantinovna \nKrupskaya. She was a Marxist activist belonging to the political milieu \njoined by Ulyanov, and was present at those early sessions where he \nattracted respect as an economist. She never forgot her first impres-\nsion. It was aural: Ulyanov's sarcastic laughter. Krupskaya detected \nsomething 'wicked and dry' in it. She was attracted to him, and he to \nher. In  he was her usual escort home after political meetings. \nContrary to the jibes later made at her expense, Nadezhda Konstan-\ntinovna was not a bad-looking girl; but she suffered from a worsening \nthyroid complaint which, in middle age, was to bulge out her eyes. \nUlyanov himself was physically agreeable in the eyes of very many \nwomen. The relationship started slowly. It seems to have been \nconducted entirely within the ambit of contemporary proprieties. \nNeither he nor she spoke much about the days of their courtship. But \nUlyanov was obviously the dominant partner. He was clearly going to \nmake a reputation for himself in politics, and he confided to her that he \nwas incapable of becoming emotionally entangled with anyone not \nsharing his general beliefs. Nadezhda was not intimidated by him. \nShe is often presented to us as 'the constant, trusty friend' of Ulyanov, \nas if she were a canine companion rather than a spouse. But she did \nnot always do his bidding. And there were certain areas, such as \neducational theory (and perhaps educational practice too), where she \nprobably thought herself his better. Ulyanov was contented. His first \nsteady girlfriend was someone who could hold her own in political \ndebate and whose commitment to enduring the travails of a revolu-\ntionary's existence was no smaller than his own. \nUlyanov's liking for Nadya, as he called her, did not prevent him \n Arrivals \n \nfrom being away from her for several months. For years he had desired \nto see foreign countries. As early as , after his expulsion from \nKazan University, he had applied for permission to pursue his \nundergraduate studies abroad. In March , finally, his request was \ngranted. He remained under surveillance after his move from Samara \nbut, whether through an insufficiency of policing resources or because \nUlyanov's time had been taken up more by literary work than by \nunderground activism, he evaded detection. \nHis real aim was to contact Plekhanov's Emancipation Of Labour \nGroup in Geneva. He had a plausible alibi. It was conventional for \npersons of his social station to travel round the rest of Europe on trips \ndevoted to education or amusement. Paris, Berlin and Florence \nbustled with affluent Russian visitors. Ulyanov's appetite for tourism \ndid not diminish with the years. There was hardly a cathedral town of \nnorthern France or a Swiss mountain resort not explored by him on his \ntravels. On  April  he took a train from the Russian capital with \na ticket for Switzerland. Plekhanov, despite their differences over \nmany issues, was Ulyanov's idol; nobody alive, except Frederick \nEngels (who died that August), evoked commensurate respect from \nhim. He journeyed to pay homage. Awe mingled with affection; \nUlyanov would later recollect that he had had the feeling of 'being in \nlove' with Plekhanov. Such a metaphor is extreme, especially for a \nman of Ulyanov's reticence. It is therefore all the more suggestive of \nthe profound importance attached by Ulyanov to the world of ideas. It \nis interesting in a further sense as well. Throughout his career he \ndisplayed vigour, even daring, in his intellectual development; but he \nfelt insecure in his convictions unless he could corroborate them with \ncitations from the works of his heroes. In the s he made no \npretension to sit upon the high pedestal occupied in his imagination by \nGeorgi Plekhanov. Only Marx and Engels sat even higher. \nIndeed Ulyanov's intellectual style looked like an exaggeration of \nPlekhanov's own. True, he could still feel nervous in face-to-face \ndisputes. In Moscow, at a political gathering, he delivered a caustic \ndenunciation of Vorontsov's economics. At the end of the meeting he \nwas told that Vorontsov had been in the audience. Confusion \noverwhelmed him. He raced from the room. \nAnd yet he was unaffected by such sensitivities when it came to \ndebates in print; his literary mode sounded its characteristically \naggressive notes at the outset of his career. Indulgence to opponents \nappeared to him as mere quietism. As yet he identified popUlism as the \nmain polemical enemy; his comments on Struve though combative, \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nstill lacked the unbridled offensiveness of his ridiculing of the \nnarodniki. He was unashamed about his pugnaciousness. Why mollify \ncriticisms when you know you are right? Why not emasculate the \narguments of your antagonists if this can persuade others to accept \nyour own? Ulyanov was convinced, in every fibre of his body, that \nMarxism supplied the only mode of social investigation which could \nproduce 'correct' answers to analytical and practical problems; he \nspoke of it as if it were a faith and not open to re-examination and \npossible refutation. It was also part and parcel of his mental make-up \nto suggest that, however complicated a political situation might \nappear, there was always only a single policy adoptable by gicaIIy-\nthinking revolutionaries. Correctness, in his view, was the twin sibling \nof consistency; and no sharper charge did he level at his opponents \nthan that they wore their opinions lightly. In instincts, mannerisms and \ntechnique it is remarkable how closely Ulyanov the rising theorist and \nactivist resembles Lenin the experienced premier of the Soviet \ngovernment. \nTO SWITZERLAND AND BACK \nAnd so to Switzerland. The mission entrusted to him in St. Petersburg \nwas to put communications between Geneva and Russia on a more \nregular basis. He was to promise financial assistance, drawn from local \nmembership dues, to the emigres. It was hoped that a Russian Marxist \nnewspaper might be set up in Geneva. A Moscow activist, E. I. Sponti, \nwas in Switzerland at the same time and with similar intentions. At last \nthe disparate groups were coming together to lay the ground-work for \na political party. On  May  Ulyanov arrived in Lausanne and \nobtained Plekhanov's address. He spent the month in conversations \nwith Plekhanov and Akselrod. He stayed for a week with Akselrod's \nfamily in the mountainous countryside outside Zurich. Both his elders \nwere favourably impressed by Ulyanov. He seemed precisely the type \nof undergrounder needed by the movement: accomplished in socialist \ntheory and adept at administrative business. They compared him \nfavourably with Sponti, who appeared to retain an excess of narodnik \ninsurrectionary impatience (and who, unlike Ulyanov, had the temerity \nto carp at the Geneva group for not writing material accessible for \nordinary workers). Plekhanov, Akselrod and Ulyanov found it easy to \ncome to terms with each other. A plan was drawn up. Plekhanov and \n Arrivals \n \nAkselrod would act as newspaper editors in Western Europe while \nUlyanov headed a co-editorial committee in St. Petersburg. \nUlyanov spent the remainder of that summer in excursions around \ncontinental Europe. He was blithely unaware that the police in St. \nPetersburg had just broken his cover and reported that he stood 'at the \nhead of a circle involved with revolutionary propaganda among \nworkers'. The purpose of his trip abroad was ascertained. Ulyanov \ncontinued with his tour: in June  he moved to Paris and visited \nMarx's son-in-law Paul Lafargue; in July and August he transferred to \nBerlin, working daily in the Prussian State Library. Plekhanov secured \nhim an interview with German Social-Democratic Party leader \nWilhelm Liebknecht. \nHe returned to Russia on  September. Marxists in St. Petersburg \nwere by then optimistic about starting a mass working-class move-\nment. Factory strikes were in the offing. Yuli Martov campaigned for \nthe unification of all clandestine groups in the capital. Radchenko's \nand Martov's organisations combined activity. The Bureau selected to \ndirect the new grouping included V. . Ulyanov, Y. O. Martov and G. \nM. Krzhizhanovski. The priority was to produce a series of agitational \nleaflets and get them scattered around as many plants and works as \npossible. Despite a search at the border, Ulyanov had succeeded in \nsmuggling home half a suitcase of literature from Switzerland. This was \nstill far from enough. The Peters burgers negotiated with adherents of \nPeople's Freedom in hiding in Finland and in possession of typo-\ngraphical facilities. Apart from Martov, Ulyanov was the only fluent \nwriter in the group; and the switch of plans towards leaflet-printing \naugmented his importance. When textile-workers went on strike in \nNovember, he wrote a rousing leaflet addressed To the Working Men \nand Women of the Thornton Factory. He helped, too, to produce a \npamphlet entitled Russian Factory Legislation. This was not work he \ndid by shutting himself away in his rooms. The effectiveness of a leaflet \nor pamphlet depended upon the writer's acquaintance with specific \nconditions in the factories where copies were to be distributed. \nUlyanov compiled his information directly from the workers them-\nselves. He visited working-class streets to ascertain the progress of \nstrikes in the Thornton textile factory and the Laferme tobacco \nfactory. For the first time he was involved in day-to-day underground \nactivism. \nThis necessitated frequent changes of residence in order to keep one \nmove ahead of the police. Yet Ulyanov had not fogotten his agreement \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nwith Plekhanov and Akselrod. The Petersburg organisation still \nwanted to assist the foundation of an emigre newspaper, and Ulyanov \nwrote and sent material to Akselrod in November. But his organisa-\ntion also wished to set up its own news-sheet. It was to be called \nRabochee Delo (or Workers' Cause). Ulyanov was to be editor. \nWorkers were still wary of calls to rise against the autocracy. Ulyanov's \nleaflets were deliberately apolitical (though he assumed that economic \nstrife would draw workers into politics). Newspapers, on the other \nhand, would reach out to a more sophisticated readership, attracting \nboth intellectuals and labourers with political awareness. Therefore \nWorkers' Cause would propose the formation of a workers' political \nparty.so \nOn  December  the Department of Police acted. The proofs of \nWorkers' Cause were confiscated; forty Marxist activists, not far short \nof the entire St. Petersburg organisation, were arrested. Ulyanov was \namong those caught. So lucky in avoiding the police's clutches when in \nSamara, he now faced his first lengthy spell of incarceration. He was \nput in cell  by himself. Interrogation began on  December; \nphysical coercion was forbidden under prison rules (and least of all \nwould officers break them in the case of Ulyanov, who was not only of \nthe gentry estate but also a legal expert). He was to remain in prison for \nfourteen months. Anyone joining a revolutionary group had to \naccept risks; Ulyanov was philosophical. He took a detached, almost \n'economic' view of his fate. For he would worry, when hearing of a \ncomrade's imprisonment, not so much about the ensuing material and \nemotional hardships as about the 'waste' incurred by the loss of an \nactivist's contribution to the cause. Not that his own activism was \nextinguished in jail. No longer free to organise support for St. \nPetersburg strikers, Ulyanov concentrated upon expanding his eco-\nnomic writings into a full-length book with a view towards demolishing \nagrarian-socialist theories once and for all. He had monastic peace for \nhis studies. He took precautions against becoming physically unfit. The \ndaily exercise walk in the yard was obviously inadequate, and Ulyanov \nadopted a daily regimen of press-ups and trunk-rolls. For recreation he \nused the prisoners' wall-tapping code to play chess with other \ninmates. \nBut research was his pre-occupation. The regulations allowed \ntwice-weekly visits from relatives and friends; and Ulyanov got his \nsisters to borrow textbooks and journals from libraries. He was \ninterrogated again in early , but the interruption to his labours \nwas negligible. In prison he was a full-time writer. \n Arrivals \n \nHe also had plentiful time to reflect upon the fortunes of the labour \nmovement. A few leaders such as Martov and Radchenko had eluded \nthe police in December  and perpetuated the existence of their \norganisation (which they renamed the Union of Struggle for the \nEmancipation of the Working Class). Difficulties had increased. The \norganisation had greatly relied upon the Central Workers' Group, \nwhich was the successor of the Central Workers' Circle, for establish-\ning contact with factory workers; and the arrests had involved many \nleaders of this Group. The remaining middle-class activists could less \neasily stay in touch with workers. But the Union of Struggle pressed \non, undaunted by the arrest of Martov in January . Fedor Dan \ntook over the leadership. The Union's disparagers commented that the \nfew leaflets composed in - were the merest drop of water in the \nstream that turned the mill of labour discontent; it was pointed out that \nthe great textile strike of summer  took the Marxist activists by \nsurprise. Employers, moreover, would seldom make more than \nnugatory concessions. Count Witte as Minister of Finances instructed \nprovincial governors to stand firm against disobedient workers. Yet \npolice reports demonstrated that, although Marxist activists were not \nalways the instigators of unrest, they and their leaflets were welcomed \nby the work-force once industrial conflict had begun. \nPRISON THOUGHTS \nUlyanov heard of these events from his prison cell; he was kept \ninformed by legal newspapers and his permitted visitors. Plekhanov's \nvision was apparently being justified by the march of history. It was \nUlyanov's acute expectation of the autocracy's imminent demise that \nled him, in the winter of -, to review the party programme \nprojected by Plekhanov a decade previously. Ulyanov found nothing \nin it to reject. But he thought it failed to provide the comprehensive \nrange of policies vital for a political party aiming to be in the thick of \nthe final battles against the Romanov dynasty. The main goal of \nPlekhanov, in his project's agrarian section, had been to facilitate \ncapitalist development by abolishing both redemption payments and \ncompulsory commune membership. This had Ulyanov's assent. But in \norder to secure active peasant support he proposed an enticement: the \nparty should call for the restitution to the peasantry of the so-called \n'cut-off strips'. This was the term for the segments of peasant-\ncultivated land which had been lost to the gentry under the Emancipa-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion Edict of . Such a policy, according to Ulyanov, would arouse \nthe oppressed inhabitants of the countryside from political torpor . It \nwas not, by a long chalk, as comprehensive an appeal to the peasantry \nas the populists had made: Ulyanov was not promising the transfer of all \nagricultural land. But he hoped that the strips would be attraction \nenough. \nHe added little that was new to the section to be aimed at factory \nworkers. This did not signify neglect of urban issues. From the end of \n his mind was exercised by the many problems encountered by \nMarxists in disseminating socialist ideas in the towns. \nThe outbursts of working-class discontent posed a nagging question. \nThe Marxist activities had to decide how much control they should \nseek to obtain over the labour movement. The issue became acute in \nPetersburg in early . Factory strikes had led dozens of workers to \njoin the Union Of Struggle; and, because most intellectual organisers \nhad fallen prey to the police, the working-class recruits had come to \nconstitute the majority of the organisation. The newcomers wanted to \nalter the perspectives of the Union Of Struggle. In particular, they \ndisliked the idea of broadening the current fights over wages into an \nimmediate struggle against the autocracy; and they desired to put \nworkers in full charge of strike funds. Some talked of founding a \nnewspaper written and edited entirely by factory labourers. Workers \nwere to take over the leadership inside both the party and the trade \nunions; they were determined to keep the intellectuals under control. \nSuch demands exasperated Radchenko. He was reluctant to admit any \nworker to a leading position in the Union Of Struggle. He was an \nintellectual elitist. It was his assumption that working men and women \nlacked the skills and free time necessary for effective underground \nadministration. Radchenko and his colleagues from the early s \nwere dubbed the Veterans; the newcomers to the Union Of Struggle, \nwho attracted experienced activists like K. M. Takhtarev and A. A. \nYakubova to their side, became known as the Youngsters. \nUlyanov entered this discussion. As luck would have it, in February \n the authorities were winding up their investigations into the case \nof the Union Of Struggle. Ulyanov was sentenced to three years' exile \nin eastern Siberia. Permission was granted for prisoners to be released \nfor a few days in St. Petersburg to gather their belongings prior to \ndeparture. Apart from seeing his family, Ulyanov again contacted the \nUnion Of Struggle. He sided with the Veterans in most respects. \nNeither he nor Radchenko believed that socialism was a doctrine \nwhich would be acquired by the working class unless socialist \n Arrivals \n \nintellectuals provided ideological guidance. On the other hand, \nUlyanov did not expect this state of affairs to last forever; in fact he \nenthusiastically welcomed individual workers into the direction of the \nUnion Of Struggle so long as they possessed the requisite level of \neducation and training, and he assumed that such promotions would \nshortly increase as the result of the Union's pedagogical activities. But \nhe agreed with Radchenko that workers should not run the Union \nsimply because they were workers. The discussion between the \nVeterans and the Youngsters was ill-tempered, neither side being \nwilling to make a compromise. At stake stood the choice of the path for \nthe labour movement to follow in the hazardous conditions of \nnineteenth-century Russia. But no binding decision was taken by the \nUnion Of Struggle before the exiles left St. Petersburg for Eniseisk \nprovince in Siberia on  February . \nMiddle-class convicts making such a trip would seek to render it as \ncomfortable as possible firstly by undertaking to pay the rail-fare (and \nthereby securing an upholstered compartment) and secondly by \nrequesting to live out their Siberian term in the comparatively \nhospitable climate of the city of Krasnoyarsk rather than the frozen \nwastes of villages further to the north. The first but not the second \nrequest was satisfied in Ulyanov's case. His mother made a successful \nthird plea that, because of his recent pneumonia, he should be allowed \nto stop over with relatives in Moscow for a week en route to exile. He \neven managed to study for a day in the Rumyantsev Museum Library. \nOn  February he boarded the train for Siberia, accompanied as far as \nTula by his mother and sisters Mariya and Anna. \nIt was not until April that he was officially informed that his place of \nexile was to be Shushenskoe village near the small town of Minusinsk. \nHe was permitted to spend the previous weeks in freedom in \nKrasnoyarsk; and, pressing on with his economic treatise, he visited \nlocal libraries to arrange borrowing facilities. Shushenskoe was not a \ntotal disappointment. It was not very far north of Krasnoyarsk, and \npostal communications were reasonably frequent. His tireless mother \noffered to come to live near him. He would not countenance it, earning \na rebuke from his sister Mariya for his 'terrible inhospitality'; but he \npointed out that the trip to Shushenskoe was 'a pretty bothersome \naffair and not very pleasant'. Officialdom in Eniseisk province was \nnot inordinately oppressive. The political exiles were granted leave to \nvisit each other in their various villages. Occasional sojurns in \nMinusinsk were sanctioned. The government made Ulyanov a \nmonthly allowance of eight roubles; this was not a large sum but it \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nbought a sufficiency of food, and in any case his mother continued to \nsupplement his account. His period of exile was not laden with \ngloom. He set aside a portion of each day for leisure; unlike many \ncontemporary revolutionaries he recognised the importance of keep-\ning fit. His acquaintances disagreed about the identity of his favourite \nsport: was it country walking or skating or gamebird shooting? In \nessence they were all correct. For everything he did, at the time of \ndoing it, elicited from him the same passionate intensity. He overbrim-\nmed with primal enthusiasm, treating fellow exiles as a mass resource \nfor competitive 'relaxation'. If fortunate, they might get away with a \nquick game of chess. But friends learnt to beware of him on days when \nhe had more than his normal store of surplus energy to burn; they knew \nhe was quite likely to insist upon a wrestling contest or some other such \nhorseplay. \nPolitics, though, laid claim to most of his waking hours. Initially he \ndreaded exile; he made the quip that prison had provided an excellent \nenvironment for a writer. But his family in Russia kept him \nwell-stocked with books and journals as required. In  he \nresearched indefatigably. He was cut off from regular, detailed news \nabout Marxist groups in the empire as a whole. Nobody writing to him \ncould include politically sensitive remarks. For information about \nfresh developments he relied upon those activists falling into detention \nin Eniseisk province later than himself. Such arrivals were few in \nUlyanov's first twelve months of residence in Siberia (although it was \nin this fashion that he received the compliment from Plekhanov and \nAkselrod that 'he wrote better than anyone else in Russia for the \nworkers'). The frustrations were endless. Yet they were not over-\nwhelming, if only because he appreciated the usefulness of the time \nvouched to him to reflect upon his achievements and set-backs in St. \nPetersburg and to apply his conclusions to the needs of the Marxist \nmovement in the Russian empire. \n   \nCapitalism in One \nCountry \n'THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA' \nSocialist scholar-politicians had become notable figures in Russian \npublic life by the turn of the century. Mikhailovski and Plekhanov were \noutstanding in the older generation; and younger men like A. A. \nBogdanov, V. M. Chernov, P. P. Maslov and V. I. Ulyanov were \nalready set fair to emulate them. The combination of scholarly \naccomplishment and political eminence was not a uniquely Russian \nphenomenon. The German socialists had their Kautsky, and the \nItalians would later produce their Gramsci. The emergence of this \nspecies of political leader is not easily explicable. But it would appear \nto be no coincidence that the countries which bred such specimens \nwere embarking upon economic transformation. Their young intellec-\ntuals grew up in societies where the contrast between the old and the \nnew was sharply delineated. Opposition to the political establishment \nmight lead them to take up arms. Equally, they might be induced to \ntake to the pen. Activists sensed that radical alternative policies were \nunlikely to attract sufficient following unless they could be shown to be \nrooted in a 'scientific' understanding of the world. Books on history, \nphilosophy and economics were therefore popular with the Russian \nreading public. The day of the literary essay was drawing to a close. As \nthe expansion of higher-educational facilities took place after , so \nthe number of readers who would countenance tackling drier and more \nscholarly tomes on matters of immediate interest rose dramatically. \nThe learned journals of the s were full of such material. \nThe book to confirm Ulyanov's claims as a scholar was The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia. The manuscript was completed \nin October . Ulyanov's erudite footnotes referred to over six \nhundred books and articles. The argument was carefully constructed. \nThe text of the first edition ran to  pages.  copies were put on \nsale. It was published legally under the pseudonym of V. Hin. Each \n \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nchapter contains lengthy sections written in a style characteristic of \nacademic treatises; but his many derogatory remarks about \nMikhailovski and Vorontsov testified to lively political aims. He was \nlaunching an offensive on a limited front. Subsequent generations \nwould often regard The Development of Capitalism as a comprehen-\nsive textbook on the country's economic transformation in modern \ntimes. But in fact Ulyanov stated narrower intentions: he wished to \nexamine the process of formation of the Russian domestic market for \ncapitalism. The particularity of Ulyanov-IIin's theme is discernible in \nthe gaps, which he freely acknowledged, in his treatment. Peter the \nGreat, who launched Russia's first industrialising drive in the \neighteenth century, is mentioned only once. Count Witte attracts only \nfleeting references. No attention is given to Russia's balance of trade \nwith foreign countries, to governmental loans raised abroad, or to \nforeign industrial ownership in st. Petersburg and the Donbass. \nThese lacunae were intentionally provocative. It was a nostrum of \nPlekhanov, Struve, Tugan and Ulyanov that capitalist development \nwould not be impeded by the expropriation of the mass of the \npeasantry. They pointed to the boost to industrialisation given by the \ncountryside. Many poor peasants worked for low wages in urban \nfactories; and some richer peasants bought agricultural equipment \nfrom the towns. All these writers argued also that capitalist relations \nwere beginning to characterise the internal workings of the village \ncommune.s \nNonetheless Plekhanov, Struve and Tugan had ventured little \nfurther in sketching the agrarian sector's importance for capitalist \ngrowth; they descried connections between urban and rural \nphenomena but interpreted them as but one factor among many which \nexplained Russia's industrial drive. Ulyanov found this too tentative. \nRussian agriculture, in his view, was no second-level influence upon \nindustrialisation. Rather it was the provider of an essential and basic \ndomestic market for capitalist goods. His general presentation of \neconomic development resembles a picture of an ecological chain. The \nhabitat of huge mammals like the elephant is sustained by the existence \nof millions of microscopically small insects; and, in Ulyanov's opinion, \nthe growth of large-scale heavy industrial production depended upon \nthe rise of a minority of the peasantry to financial prosperity. He \nargued that their demand for agricultural machinery took up a vital \nshare of the market for industrial goods. Wealthy peasants were set \nupon emulating those gentry landowners who created capitalist farms \n(unlike most landords, who rented out land to peasants rather than \n Capitalism in One Country \n \nfarm it themselves). And these farms too gave impetus to manu-\nfacturing industries to produce machinery for a modernised agricul-\nture. The implication was plain. Russian industrialists could promote \nthe country's economic advance even without the props of govern-\nmental contracts and foreign loans. They had a domestic market of \ntheir own. And, if only the many semi-feudal restrictions upon \nindustrial competition were removed (which was as near as Ulyanov \ncould come to call for revolution without annoying the censorship \noffice), there would be no limits to the potential of Russian economic \ngrowth.s \nThe Development o/Capitalism offered a picture of steady, irrevers-\nible change. Ulyanov implied that social differentiation was a unilinear \nprocess; and that it brought ever-increasing gains in agricultural \nefficiency through the application of machine-powered equipment on \nlarger and larger tracts of soil. Big was not only beautiful: it was also \ncost-effective. The extension of territory owned by rich peasants \ninvolved them in the buying out of poor peasants. But the landless \nwould be able to better their situation. They would earn more money \nin wages than they had obained as inefficient peasant cultivators. \nThis vista was the most inspiriting of all those painted by Russian \nMarxists. Capitalism, according to Ulyanov, still confronted an epoch \nof maturation but Russia was already a capitalist country. The social \nstructure had been altered fundamentally. He conceded that factory \nworkers, miners and railwaymen had reached only one and a half \nmillion in number. But there were also a million workers in the \nconstruction trade; and a further couple of millions were employed in \ntimber-felling and other less skilled occupations. There were about \nthree and a half million hired labourers in the agricultural sector; there \nwere also around two million workers employed in 'putting-out' \nindustry in their own village homes. Hired labour was therefore the \ncondition of ten and a half million souls out of  millions. Even this \ncomputation did not exhaustively comprehend the 'proletariat and \nsemi-proletariat'. Poor peasants with land were in practice hardly \ndistinguishable from landless rural labourers: both groups had \nrecourse to employment by gentry landlords and rich peasants. From \nUlyanov's tabulations it therefore emerged that 'proletarians and \nsemi-proletarians' constituted over sixty-three million souls. This was \nover half of the entire imperial populace.B Censorship difficulties \nprevented him from spelling out his political conclusions; but the \nexperienced Marxist reader could detect that Ulyanov's analysis was \ndirected against Struve as much as against Mikhailovski. Russian \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustrialisation, according to Ulyanov, was at a more advanced stage \nthan was generally allowed.  \nUlyanov hoped to spark off a controversy; his friends relished the \npossibility of a literary furore ignited by his book's sarcastic asides.  Its \nreception, upon publication in , was in fact rather quiet. Russian \nMarxist theorists could appreciate that Ulyanov, in marked contrast \nwith Struve, did not praise non-socialist economists like List or \nSisrnondi. But no reviewer properly enthused about the work. \nPlekhanov refrained from comment, perhaps displeased that the \nyounger man had not modified his views on the nature of Russian \nfeudalism. Nor did Struve enter the debate. Indeed he had been acting \nas Ulyanov's literary agent: the united front of Russian Marxism in all \nits variants had still not been completely broken (although Struve did \npermit himself a brief sally, in late , against the Marxist \nmovement's increasingly hagiographic deployment of Marx's texts).l \nAt the time the only Marxist to write a lengthy review of the book was \nP. N. Skvortsov, who had himself written on the peasant commune \nand now spared Ulyanov no criticism. Ulyanov composed a suitably \naggressive retort.  The dispute faded away. Ulyanov's economic \nstudies had not caught the reading public's imagination like Struve's \nCritical Remarks. But the balance sheet was not at all depressing. For \nhis book, though not a best-seller, at least had solidly confirmed his \nstatus as a Marxist writer of seriousness and distinction. \nBut how cogent is its analysis? His definitions are problematical. He \nwas particularly vague about what he meant by capitalism; the nearest \nhe came towards a verbal formulation was his comment that 'the \ndegree of the domestic market's development is the degree of \ncapitalism's development in a country' . \nSkvortsov's main theoretical criticism had been that Ulyanov left no \nroom for the occurrence of economic crises.  This remark especially \nriled Ulyanov. The susceptibility of capitalism to periodic economic \ncrises was a cornerstone of Marxism, and Skvortsov expressly accused \nUlyanov of misrepresenting Das Kapital. The charge was that The \nDevelopment of Capitalism assumed the existence of an economy \nwhose various sectors and sub-sectors operated in harmony with each \nother.  Thus supply appeared always to equal demand. 'Proportional-\nity' seemed achieved. In truth, Ulyanov's book scarcely mentions \ndisproportionality; its main message is indeed devoted to the ease Qf \ncapitalist development in Russia. But Ulyanov, when taken to task by \nSkvortsov, convincingly disclaimed any intention of proving the \npracticability of proportional co-operation between branches of the \n Capitalism in One Country \n \neconomy.S Such a demonstration was in fact Tugan-Baranovski's \ngoaJ. And in  Ulyanov published articles not only in riposte \nto Skvortsov but also against Tugan. He argued that the instability of \ncapitalism resided not only in the difficulties of regulating supply and \ndemand as between economic sectors. It also derived from conflicts of \nsocial interest. The growth of capitalism, Ulyanov emphasised, \ninevitably caused unrest among the ever more numerous body of the \nworking class. Workers would always need to consume more than the \ncapitalist system could permit. \nBoth Tugan and Ulyanov claimed to have understood Marx better \nthan the other did. Their arguments continue to be debated (as do \nthose of the three volumes of Das Kapital itself). For our purposes, \nthough, it is perhaps most useful to note the differing political lines \nlurking behind the theoretical positions. Tugan was centring upon the \ntechnical perfectibility of capitalism, Lenin upon the revolutionising \neffects of capitalism's growth. \nSkvortsov made other points of a more practical import. Above all, \nhe called attention to mediaeval economic history. It was Skvortsov's \ncontention that a national market in grain had existed long before the \nadvent of capitalism; and that Ulyanov's account of nineteenth-\ncentury phenomena failed to show why they should be defined as \nspecifically capitalist. This criticism was later to be repeated by \nseveral writers ranging from liberals like N. N. Chernenkov to \nagrarian-socialist sympathisers such as A. V. Chayanov. The \nDevelopment of Capitalism, in their opinion, was excessively taken up \nwith macro-economics. It paid insufficient attention to the internal \nworkings of the peasant commune. Differences of wealth among the \npeasantry were a centuries-old phenomenon and were not exclusively \na sign of capitalist development. Ulyanov had assumed that kulak \nfamilies would accumulate riches from generation to generation. \nChernenkov and Chayanov, however, showed how accumulation was \nobstructed by those Russian peasant customs of inheritance which \nmade household elders divide their possessions among all their sons. \nDismemberment of agricultural units was the consequence. They also \ndemonstrated that, in many regions, it was not so much the entre-\npreneurial spirit that made a particular household rich as the relatively \nlarge number of its young male members. More sons meant greater \nlabour-power and greater entitlement to communalland. \nThese were criticisms that could not lightly be brushed aside; and \nUlyanov's later critics inside the Russian Marxist movement itself were \nto make much of them. In fact Ulyanov later admitted that his case was \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot entirely watertight; he blamed the absence of inter-generational \npeasant statistics (and he continued to make this argument even \nthough his own data on horse ownership between generations \nundermined his contention that a steady division of the peasantry into \nrural proletariat and rural bourgeoisie was under way). In any case, \nhe would also prove willing to concede in his post- writings that \nhis book had grossly over-stated the extent of Russian agrarian \ncapitalist development. This was damning self-criticism. But it was \nbalanced by a penetrating counter-thrust against his critics. His very \nreasonable argument was that the cyclical trends described by them \nmight impede but would not ultimately halt the maturation of rural \ncapitalism in Russia. Thus he stuck proudly by his book as an analysis \nof general trends. In addition, recent empirical research has tended to \ncorroborate his assertions about the huge importance of agriculture's \ncontribution to Russian industrialisation; and about the increasing \ncommercialisation of grain output in the years before the turn of the \ncentury. And peasants, it is now agreed, were already producing about \nfour fifths of the empire's grain marketings in the late tsarist period. \nAnd so The Development of Capitalism is a work of great weak-\nnesses and great strengths. Few writers in the field of general economic \ndevelopmental theory would nowadays be so inattentive either to state \nintervention (although, admittedly, he rectified this in his later \nwritings) or to foreign loans . Nor is it proven that agricultural \nefficiency always rises proportionately with size of landholding; or \neven that landless labourers are usually better off than poor peasants. \nUlyanov's vision of an ineluctable process of industrialisation appears \nsanguine in the light of the difficulties experienced today by Third \nWorld countries seeking economic modernisation. On the other hand, \nhis work has its merits too even on this theoretical plane. His thoughts \non capitalism's underlying susceptibility to crisis have an impressive \nsubtlety. His analysis of the process of industrialisation also has lasting \nvalue; he was especially effective in showing the significance of rural \nhandicraft production for the consolidation of capitalist relationships. \nHe was clearly no mean economist. \nTHE PARTY IN RUSSIA \nThe intrinsic qualities of Ulyanov's scholarship give the lie to \nsuppositions that his book's economic optimism originated exclusively \nfrom a populistic zeal, albeit transmuted into a Marxist form, to \n Capitalism in One Country \n \nforeshorten the schedule for revolutionary change (even though the \nforeshortening instinct was undoubtedly a deep-seated part of his \nmake-up ). But this does not mean that he was economist first, and \npolitical activist second. He was both at once. His unashamed \ndistortion of Vorontsov's views point to this. So, too, does the fact that \nhe was formulating ideas on political strategy years before the \ncompletion of his economic magnum opus.  \nThe precise path of his approach to the intellectual formulations of \nThe Development of Capitalism will, for want of the requisite personal \ndetails, always remain mysterious. His reticence continued after \npublication. It was accompanied by a certain nervousness; he was not \nyet the completely confident litterateur of later years. Fortunately for \nUlyanov,  was also the year when Karl Kautsky published The \nAgrarian Question; and Ulyanov delightedly noted that he had \nanalysed industrialisation in a manner not dissimilar from his own. \nThis was not the only cause of his feeling of well-being. Nadezhda \nKrupskaya was arrested by the police in . She was sentenced to \nexile. In January  Ulyanov wrote to the authorities requesting \nthat his 'fiancee' be permitted to join him in Shushenskoe. Such \nengagements between revolutionaries were often fictions enabling \nmembers of a group to congregate while serving sentence. Affection as \nwell was involved in this case. At any rate, the authorities took \nUlyanov at his word but insisted upon marriage. Nadezhda gave her \nconsent. Her mother accompanied her to Shushenskoe. There was a \nlast-minute hitch: no wedding rings were available. But a factory-\nworker in exile with them found a piece of copper and hammered out \ntwo home-made ones for the bride and groom; and on  July  \nVladimir Ilich Ulyanov and Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya \nwere joined in wedlock. It was a union which provided him with \nemotional support for the rest of his life. More immediately, Krups-\nkaya as a new exile conveyed information about the underground \nMarxist movement. She and Vladimir sat up for long nights discussing \nthe drafts of his treatise, helping with his translation assignments \n(which included a Russian-language edition of Sidney and Beatrice \nWebb's History of Trade Unionism), and talking about revolutionary \nstrategy in Russia. He did not bother to try to escape from Siberia. \nKnowing that his term of exile would be completed by , he waited \npatiently and concentrated on thinking, planning and writing. \nUlyanov and Krupskaya had been among those St. Petersburg \nMarxists who believed that the time had arrived to found a political \nparty. Stirrings towards unification occurred simultaneously else-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhere; and the Workers' Newspaper editors in Kiev summoned other \nclandestine groups to a congress in Minsk in March . Nine \ndelegates arrived. They claimed mandates to represent groups in St. \nPetersburg, Moscow, Ekaterinoslav and Kiev as well as the entire \nJewish Bund. Workers' Newspaper representatives also attended. This \neffort was not praised everywhere: the group in Ivanovo-Voznesensk \nsuspected that the Kievan comrades had omitted to invite it because of \nknown political disagreements. Groups in other places expressed \nunease. But the Workers' Newspaper leaders maintained that the call \nfor a congress would have been futile if they had not been able to \noperate with exceptional powers of discretion. Ulyanov was to \nbecome notorious for his heavy-handed manipulation of Congress \narrangement,.. Evidently he was reinforcing a pre-existing tradition. \nA sense of historic occasion, however, permeated the proceedings. \nA party was being born. A name had to be found for it, and the \ndelegates agreed on the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. \nThus they aligned themselves with the German Social-Democratic \nParty. The Minsk Congress sought an end to the Russian autocracy and \nthe creation of a democratic republic. Factory workers would lead the \nopposition to the regime. The delegates committed the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party to political perspectives hammered \nout by Plekhanov and Akselrod for more than a decade.  The \nCongress also approved a notional party structure and elected a \nCentral Committee to guide party affairs in periods between Con-\ngresses. The Central Committee's powers were defined broadly. It was \nto be allowed to co-opt further members for the contingency that the \npolice might succeed in arresting those already elected. But the rights \nof local groups (or committees, as they were thenceforward to be \nknown) were to be safeguarded. Activists in the provinces were \npermitted free choice of policy so long as they kept inside the ambit of \nthe party programme. The obvious drawback was that no official \nprogramme existed. Approaches had been made to Plekhanov but he \nhad not yet supplied a draft. Next best to a programme was a brief \nmanifesto of the party's intentions. Literary composition was \nentrusted to Struve; and he discharged it dutifully: it was his last act as \na Marxist; his political sympathies would shortly impel him to declare \nhimself a liberal. Finally, the Congress recognised Workers' News-\npaper as the party's official organ. \nRussian Marxists, whether at liberty or (like Ulyanov) in exile, \nbelieved they were beginning to have their government on the run. The \nemperor Nikolai II had succeeded to the throne of Aleksandr III upon \n Capitalism in One Country \n \nhis death in . He urged liberal constitutionalists to give up their \n'puerile dreams'. The only serious manifestation of social unrest \noccurred in working-class quarters of industrial cities. As yet the \ngovernment was not pushed to political reforms. But the crescendo of \nstrikes in - compelled ministers to acknowledge that some \nconcession to the grievances of workingmen had to be made. A factory \nlaw was promulgated in . Jubilant social-democrats, as the \nMarxists increasingly called themselves, noted that the maximum \nworking day was to be reduced to eleven-and-a-half hours. Stricter \nregulations about child labour were enacted. Safety standards were \nannounced. Factory inspectors were accorded functions in the super-\nvision of industrial relations. Lobbying by employers had led to a \ndilution of the law's clauses; and Russian labour legislation had some \ndistance to go before it gave the freedoms prevailing in Western \nEurope. But Russian workers had extracted their first instalment. \nThey had accentuated weaknesses in the autocracy's position, and the \noutbreaks of industrial conflict in  showed their determination to \nbe accorded both higher wages and greater dignity of treatment. There \nwere  strikes in that year. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty aimed to tug political advantage out of an economic strife that \nappeared to follow a path of inexorable embitterment. \nThe police had had no prior intelligence about the First Party \nCongress. When news reached the government, the order was given to \narrest all social-democratic supporters at large. Five hundred were \nincarcerated by January . The victims included eight out of the \nnine delegates to the Congress; and the three-man Central Committee \nwas destroyed before its members could co-opt others to take their \nplace. The practical constructions of the Party Congress lay in ruins. \nEven if Ulyanov had evaded capture in  and survived to make his \ninfluence felt in Minsk, he would almost certainly have still joined his \ncomrades in prison and exile. \nPROJECTS FOR THE PARTY \nNews of the Congress in fact reached Ulyanov in May . Before \nfinishing The Development of Capitalism ,he had resumed his delibera-\ntions about the party's programmatic and organisational require-\nments. Politics and economics co-existed in his thoughts. Ulyanov had \nwritten an entire pamphlet in late , and had it published in \nGeneva as The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats; and in  he \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nproduced a series of draft articles ending with his Project for Our \nParty's Programme. \nFrom the outset, he re-affirmed his admiration for the earlier \nattempts by Plekhanov and Akselrod; his own aim was only to offer \n'particular editorial changes, corrections and additions' . He again \nendorsed the view that the next stage in Russia's political development \nwould be not a socialist seizure of power. Capitalism had yet to mature \nin Russia. Ulyanov also approvingly cited Akselrod's contention that \nonly the working class could act as 'the advance-line fighter' against the \nautocracy. He refused to predict the precise mode of assault to be used: \nhe thought it futile to discuss whether it would be a general strike or an \narmed uprising. The point was to get on with preparations for the \nstruggle.s Mildly remonstrating with Plekhanov and Akselrod, he \nsought the inclusion of paragraphs describing the course of capitalist \ndevelopment in their country. He wanted, too, a more obvious \nemphasis upon the need for 'class struggle'. And, in order to combat \nthose like Peter Struve in Russia or Eduard Bernstein in Germany \nstriving to revise Marxism, Ulyanov wanted to insert a statement on \nthe inevitability of 'the growth of poverty, oppression, enslavement, \nhumiliation and exploitation' under the capitalist order. He stuck to \nthe Geneva Group's picture of the state structure to be set up upon the \nautocracy's dismantlement. He repeated the call for a general arming \nof the people. He added a stricture of his own. So as to reinforce the \ndemocratic nature of the civil administrative institutions it would be \nessential to introduce the elective principle to the tenure of public \noffice. Bureaucrats should no longer be appointed from above. \nPlainly, if ever such a revolution took place, it would produce a \ngovernment more nearly under popular control than any state in \nhistory. Ulyanov then added a list of social reforms. The maximum \nworking day should be lowered to eight hours; every worker should be \nguaranteed a break of at least thirty six hours per week. Child labour \nand night work should be banned altogether. Industrial courts should \nbe instituted, and these should allow for equal representation to \nemployers and employees. Officers of the factory inspectorate should \nbe elected to their jobs. Employers should be made responsible before \nthe law for accidents occurring at the place of work. Such limitations on \nthe rights of industrialists, Ulyanov maintained, were vital if workers \nwere to obtain the cultural environment necessary for them to take full \nadvantage of the political reforms envisaged by the party. \nIn his proposals for the countryside, Ulyanov cited Akselrod's \nrecommendation that social-democrats should adopt 'the revolu-\n Capitalism in One Country \n \ntionary side' of Russian agrarian socialism. Narodnik ideas, he \nrepeated, were not automatically unacceptable. At the same time \nUlyanov declared that his programme, despite outward resemblances, \ndid not seek the ultimate goals of agrarian-socialist 'utopianism'. His \nmeasures were designed to foster the consolidation of rural capitalism. \nThey were also meant to attract the peasantry into associating itself \nwith the worker-led revolution; but their net economic result would be \nto nurture the system of exploitation of peasant by peasant. \nNonetheless there lingered a nervousness among many Russian \nMarxists about appearing too 'populistic' on the agrarian question. \nDiscussions were becoming heated. It was in this period, around the \nturn of the century, that several activists like A. I. Rykov and theorists \nlike L. Nadezhdin amplified their demand for the expropriation of all \ngentry-held land; and that Nadezhdin proposed a policy of land \nnationalisation. Ulyanov still baulked at such ideas; he felt that they \nwould place excessive power in the hands of what, after all, he \npresumed would be a bourgeois-led government. Peasants might well \nend up worse oppressed than ever. Yet he ceased now to be quite as \ncautious as his elders in Geneva. He remained committed to the return \nof the cut-off strips; and he demanded not only the abolition of \nredemption payments but also the restitution to the peasants of all \nmonies paid to the state under this system since . The fiscal system \nshould also be changed. Tax collectors were to deal with individual \npeasant households, not whole communes. Ulyanov opposed the \ndismemberment of capitalist latifundia. But he was bent upon \ncurtailing the rights of those landlords who rented out land to the \npeasantry. He proposed the creation of special courts to allow \nhouseholds to secure reduction of 'excessive' rents. Absentee land-\nlordism would be attacked. He also called for the formation of 'peasant \ncommittees'. Ulyanov's intentions were two-sided. He did not want \nonly to facilitate a rise in agricultural output: he desired equally to \neffect the entrance of the peasantry into politicallife. \nThus he exhibited a concern for details in his draft party programme. \nHis practicality led him also to consider the party's organisational \ncondition; there was little point in speculating about the post-\nautocratic future if the party was in no fit shape to guide the working \nclass and the peasantry in the present. The police had broken up the \nPetersburg Union Of Struggle as well as the Central Committee. In \nUlyanov's opinion, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was \nan organisational mess. \nAs early as , in The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats, he \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nasserted that 'the struggle with the government is impossible without a \nstrengthening and development of revolutionary organisation and \nconspirativeness' . In The Essential Question, written in , he \nrefined his proposals. It was his belief that the party's overriding \npriority should be to introduce a 'division of labour' into its affairs. \nHe loved to use analogies from the economic field. Functional \nspecialisation would permit the party to train experts in agitation, \npamphleteering, fund-raising and spy-hunting. It also made for greater \nsafety from arrest. Specialisation would mean that information about \nthe names and whereabouts of other activists would be less freely \navailable. Such an 'economy of forces' should be welcomed. But in \norder to consolidate this transformation it would be necessary, too, to \nimplement the concept of centralisation. Democratic control from \nbelow was desirable in principle. But the enforced clandestinity of \noperations restricted the scope for 'heavily-attended revolutionary \nmeetings' . Hierarchical discipline was a priority. Ulyanov did not go \ncompletely overboard into organisational authoritarianism. Not quite; \nfor he recognised the validity of a further problem. It centred upon \ndemocratic control. He defined the difficulty as being 'how to collocate \nthe need for the full freedom of local social-democratic activity with \nthe need to form a single and therefore centralist party?' But, \nsignificantly, he left his cumbersomely-phrased question unanswered. \nHis preoccupation was to get the party to accept his arguments for \nspecialisation and centralisation; everything else was a secondary issue \nwhich could be tackled in the due course of time. \nSuch an approach was shared by many former comrades in the \nUnion Of Struggle. It also appealed to numerous activists currently \nassociated with Workers' Newspaper and Workers' Banner.  \nPlekhanov and Akselrod did not demur. And Vladimir Ulyanov \njustifiably represented his programmatic and organisational proposals \nas a valid development of the doctrines of Plekhanov. He contended \nunremittingly that assassinations should not be viewed as a primary \ntactic of assault on the autocracy. Again Nadezhdin was causing \nproblems. He suggested that narodnik terrorism had not been as \npolitically misguided as other Russian Marxists had been wont to \ndeclare. But Ulyanov stood by Plekhanov. Neither Ulyanov nor \nPlekhanov opposed terrorist acts in principle. Ulyanov clarified his \nposition. It was, he said, possible to envisage assassinations as a \n'defensive' tactic. He seems to have had in mind the killing of \npersons, such as police spies, capable of breaking up party organisa-\ntions. \n Capitalism in One Country \n \nAGAINST 'ECONOMISM' \nIn his Shushenskoe writings he had sketched a party programme and a \nplan of party organisation. He had barely mentioned a further issue: \nwhat was to be the relationship between this party and the urban \nworking class? His past career gave evidence of his beliefs. Like \nPlekhanov, he saw the party as the political guide of the industrial \nlabour force. The party should not necessarily tack to the wind of \npopular moods of the moment; it should seek to pull workers along in \nits wake. Ulyanov had not altered his mind in Siberia. If anything, he \nwas even more strongly convinced of the leading role to be played by \nthe party. It had to canalise the rising flood of discontent into \nrevolution. He urged social-democrats to set about 'the education, \ndisciplining and organisation of the proletariat' . The imagery is \ntrenchantly hierarchical; it bursts through all the qualifying language \nof the sentences around it. Discipline was always a key theme in his \nthought. \nIn summer  such views were suddenly subjected to a criticism \neven more severe than by the attack already made by the Youngsters in \nSt. Petersburg. The critics were E. D. Kuskova and S. N. Prokopovich. \nAs Russian social-democrats in emigration, they had studied the \nBelgian labour movement and been impressed by the material and \nsocial amelioration obtained through legal methods. Kuskova wrote a \nbrief article which became known as her Credo. Its suggestion was that \nworkers should forget about revolutionary politics and struggle \nexclusively for their own economic well-being. The fight against the \nabsolute monarchy could safely be left to the middle class. This was \nanathema even to those who had sided with the Petersburg Young-\nsters; for they, while acceding to workers' demands to influence party \npolicy, had never envisaged that this would result in a lengthy \nabstention from political conflict. The apoliticism of Kuskova's Credo \nhorrified Veterans and Youngsters alike from the old Union Of \nStruggle. Both Kuskova and Prokopovich were scholars rather than \norganisers; they had no following in Russia, and Prokopovich was \narrested in  when he attempted to return from emigration. The \ncampaign for their ideas, which were dubbed Economism by their \nadversaries, seemed defunct. But not to Plekhanov. Emigre political \ndevelopments worried him. His example in forming the Emancipation \nOf Labour Group in Geneva had been followed by dozens of Russian \nemigrants in other major cities of Europe such as Paris and Berlin. In \n they banded together into a European organisation proclaiming \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nitself as the League Of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad. The First \nParty Congress in Minsk had recognised the League as the party's \nofficial foreign branch. Plekhanov's authority was on the wane. His \ntetchiness towards the younger emigres was bad enough; but he also \nmaintained few lines of communication with social-democratic \norganisers in Russia itself. Irritation with Plekhanov and Akselrod \nhelped to push the Berlin section of the League temporarily towards \nEconomism in . \nA counterattack was mounted by Plekhanov; and his criticisms took \nlittle heed that the league's dalliance with 'Economism' did not last \ninto . The League's newspaper was called Workers' Cause. So far \nfrom advocating an apolitical strategy, every issue carried the slogan: \n'The social emancipation of the working class is impossible without its \npolitical liberation.'  It smuggled May Day leaflets back to Russia in \n, calling for the promulgation of political liberties. Workers' \nCause supported political demonstrations in Russia whenever they \noccurred. In other respects, however, it differed from Kremer's On \nAgitation. Editor B. I. Krichevski believed that the fight for higher \nwages would gradually transmute itself into political struggle against \nthe autocracy; he also highlighted what he saw as the cultural \nimmaturity of the broad strata of the Russian working class. On \nAgitation by contrast had not spoken of gradualism. It had urged \nMarxists to grasp opportunities to politicise the labour movement; and \nit was free from Krichevski's evident belief that peasant newcomers to \nthe factories were improbable material for the organisation of the \ngrowing opposition to the monarchy. \nPlekhanov was wrong to treat Kuskova and Krichevski as politically \nindistinguishable. Yet he had a point when he said that Workers' Cause \nhad rejected the early consensus that the workers should lead Russia's \ndemocratic revolution \nPlekhanov campaigned simultaneously \nagainst another social-democratic newspaper. Its name was Workers' \nThought; it had been founded in St. Petersburg itself and, though \nsubsequently printed abroad, had kept links with the metropolis. \nArrests of older leaders gave it a dominant position inside the Union \nOf Struggle. The first editor was a certain Kok. He made the \nnewspaper a forum of discussion of the viewpoints of the workers \nthemselves. Letters about management abuses filled its columns. Kok \nand his collaborator K. M. Takhtarev (who had been a Youngster in \nthe social-democratic dispute in ) castigated what they perceived \nas the malignant influence exerted by the middle-class intelligentsia \nupon the labour movement. This to Plekhanov appeared a betrayal \n Capitalism in One Country \n \nof Marxism. His suspicions were confirmed in  when Workers' \nThought produced a Supplement. It contained an article by the \nGerman revisionist social-democrat Eduard Bernstein arguing for an \n'evolutionary' rather than 'revolutionary' interpretation of Marxian \nideas. The accompanying editorial endorsed Bernstein's approach. \nWorkers should involve themselves in politics, but should pursue their \nends by exclusively peaceful means. \nUlyanov, hearing of the controversy in August , took \nPlekhanov's part. A copy of Kuskova's Credo had reached Eniseisk \nprovince; and a little was known about Kok too. Ulyanov was as \ninfuriated as Plekhanov. Among the exiles he was the pre-eminent \nintellectual; he was also their most inspiring organiser: it was he who \nwrote letters of cheer to comrades like Martov who had been placed in \nless comfortable villages much further to the north. He wrote a \ndeclaration of protest against Kuskova and Kok. Workers' Thought \nwas accused of Economistic ideas (even though its enthusiasm for \nBernstein signified a rejection of apoliticism). He was not trying to be \nfair; he was trying to crush Plekhanov's opponents. Sixteen social-\ndemocratic exiles in the locality appended their signatures to \nUlyanov's protest. \nThis dispute was the first truly open breach in Russian Marxist unity; \nand the question was instantly posed why Plekhanov and Ulyanov \nrisked such a rupture. Their whole strategy had been founded upon the \nassumption, correct as events were to show, that the autocracy's fall \nwas inevitable and would not long be postponed; they had also rightly \npredicted that workers, chafing against economic oppression, would \neventually turn to the politics of revolution. So why worry so much \nabout the Credo? Neither Plekhanov nor Ulyanov wrote down their \njustification for the benefit of posterity. But doubtless they felt \nstrongly about the need for preventive action; they observed Bern-\nstein's continuing influence in the German Social-Democratic Party \nand desired to pre-empt any such development in Russia (however \nunlikely it was to occur). If anything, Plekhanov at this moment was \neven less tolerant than Ulyanov. Both agreed on the offensive against \nthe 'Economists'; but Plekhanov also wished to terminate the state of \nsemi-truce with Struve. Ulyanov resisted a severing of organisational \nlinks. Struve in  still held that the workers were the major \npolitical force against the autocracy; and Plekhanov was asked to \nrefrain from precipitate action. But even Ulyanov's patience was \nwearing thin. He had never been known for his tolerance. It is difficult \nto imagine either Ulyanov or Plekhanov doing as Fedoseev had done \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nin writing respectful letters to Mikhailovski. Admittedly, they \nrejected 'dogmatism'. Both considered Marxism to be a creative \nscience.s They justifiably felt that their own adaptation of Marxian \npolicies to Russian circumstances showed that they were not vapid \nregurgitators of hackneyed German ideas. But their protestations of \nopen-mindedness were not universally valid. And Ulyanov in particu-\nlar, in the years ahead, would increasingly write and behave as if he \nalone among the exponents of Russian socialism understood Marxism \ncorrectly. \nRELEASE FROM EXILE \nUntil the First World War, however, Ulyanov's focus was upon \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party; he commented about \ndisputes racking the German Social-Democratic Party, but resisted the \ntemptation to intervene vigorously. Plekhanov proffered advice to \nKautsky. Ulyanov experienced inhibitions. For him, Kautsky and \nPlekhanov were now the world's two greatest living Marxists. \nUlyanov's deference had its instrumental side. He knew Kautsky to \nbe a supporter of Plekhanov's political strategy for Russia. He knew \ntoo that Kautsky, as a man of the pen, would be pleased by Ulyanov's \nproposed remedy for the Russian party's nagging ills. Ulyanov wanted \nto establish a central party newspaper. This ambition absorbed his \nattention as he left Shushenskoe and exile on  January . He \nhad pondered a great deal about journalism while in Siberia. A \nclandestine political newspaper would have immense possibilities. It \nwould allow the party to give a thorough airing to all its troublesome \nproblems. There was too much uncertainty about policy. Ulyanov had \nremarked in  that the existence of many contradictory opinions \nwas a sign of the social-democratic movement's strength. This was no \nlonger his claim. Now the purpose of debate, he said, was primarily to \nset a clear line for the party. Every member had to know where the \nparty stood. He presented the plan as if intending to act impartially as \neditor-in-chief. The impression was effaced by his other statements. \nHe saw his projected newspaper as an organiser of party life; its \nfunction would not be to preside over free discussion but to use all \nmeans at its disposal for the victory of Ulyanov's ideas. He had \nstarted the venture in Siberia, inviting Yuli Martov and Aleksandr \nPotresov to join him in an editorial 'troika'. Both accepted. As they \n Capitalism in One Country \n \nwere the first to admit, they had entered the ambit of Ulyanov's \nmagnetism of personality; he seemed to them to be a born leader. \nPractical details had yet to be settled. No decision had been taken \neven about the newspaper's geographical base, whether in Russia or \nabroad. The order for Ulyanov's release from exile forbade residence \nin metropolitan, industrial or university towns of the empire. He chose \nto live in Pskov, nearly two hundred miles from Petersburg. It was a \nprudent selection, since he could expect to meet dozens of former \npolitical prisoners there. \nBut it meant separation from Krupskaya. Her own term of exile was \nnot due to expire until  and, when Ulyanov left Shushenskoe, she \nwas permitted to take up residence in the Urals town of Ufa. All his \npleas for her to be transferred to Pskov came to nought. They travelled \ntogether by the Trans-Siberian line to Ufa. Staying with her a few \nnights, he contacted local social-democrats. He stopped over in \nMoscow, Nizhni Novgorod and Petersburg too; by the time of his \narrival in Pskov on  February he had greatly expanded the number \nof his acquaintances and assured himself of assistance from dozens of \nactivists. The next problem was funding. In St. Petersburg he had met \nVera Zasulich, in the course of her mission to Russia on behalf of the \nGeneva Emancipation Of Labour Group; she announced the Group's \napproval of the project but could not offer financial subsidy. Ulyanov \nand Potresov had made a start on getting the necessary monies. A. M. \nKalmykova, a wealthy sympathiser with the revolutionary cause, \ndonated two thousand roubles. Yet tens of thousands were needed to \npay for paper and printing. Negotiations were opened with Struve and \nTugan. Martov had always viewed Struve with distaste, and tried to \ndissuade Ulyanov from meeting him. Ulyanov, however, insisted. He \npursued a paradoxical aim: one hand beckoned Struve to supply \nmoney and literary material to a journalistic enterprise; the other \nwaved at him contemptuously, promising that editorial space would be \nreserved for criticism of his policies. To Martov's amazement, a \npreliminary deal was struck. Struve's initial reservations were over-\ncome by the concession that he would be allowed to contribute articles \nin his own right, albeit under the title of discussional articles and \nwithout official imprimatur. \nBy late spring  Ulyanov and Potresov were convinced that \npolice surveillance would make it difficult to set up the presses in \nRussia; and their fear increased when, on  May, Ulyanov was \narrested while making a trip to St. Petersburg. Upon release, Ulyanov \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nmade hurried last contacts with potential agents for the newspaper. He \npaid a quick visit to his wife in Ufa. And on  July he crossed the \nborder. As he alighted on the station platform in Zurich some days \nlater, he could hardly contain his elation; he looked forward to closer \ncollaboration with Georgi Plekhanov. Plekhanov lived in Geneva. \nAkselrod's house was near Zurich and Ulyanov spent a while there \nbefore moving on. The two got on splendidly, as if they had been \nlifelong friends. The only unpleasantness, which was to appear \nimportant to Ulyanov solely in the light of ensuing events, occurred in \nconnection with Plekhanov. Akselrod too adored Plekhanov. His \ndevotion, moreover, had undergone the trial of its object's vanity. \nPlekhanov would not be crossed even in trivial matters. Akselrod \ngroped towards the main point. Plekhanov liked the idea of the \nnewspaper; he approved of its proposed name, Iskra (or The Spark). \nBut he did not fancy the plan to base it in Germany: he preferred \nSwitzerland. Indeed he was holding out for Geneva. No reason was \noffered. Ulyanov was being braced to accept a dictatorial reluctance to \nlet slip a chance to dominate a major social-democratic publication. \nPlekhanov and Ulyanov came face to face in late July. If anything, \nAkselrod's warnings turned out to be too mild; both Ulyanov and \nPotresov were astounded by their elder's prickliness. 'I tried to observe \ncaution,' Ulyanov recalled, 'by avoiding the \"sore spots\"; but this \nconstant keeping oneself on one's guard could not help but reflect itself \nheavily upon one's mood.' \nThere were rows about the Jewish Bund, with Plekhanov indicating \nobjections to its inclusion in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty. Plekhanov was touchy about Kautsky (who, Ulyanov surmised, \nhad not opened the pages of Die Neue Zeit to him as often as he felt he \ndeserved). Worse than his tantrums were his acts of duplicity. \nPlekhanov was loathe to collaborate with Struve. Ulyanov conceded to \nPlekhanov the right to edit the terms of Struve's involvement with \nIskra; but the days passed by in Geneva, and still Ulyanov had not \nreceived Plekhanov's version. Ulyanov tried to do the final editing for \nhimself. Still Plekhanov quibbled, and only when harried by an \nexasperated Ulyanov at a formal meeting did Plekhanov divulge his \ntrue motives: he did not want Struve's participation under any \nconditions whatever. Outraged, Ulyanov retired to Steindl's Wiener \nGrand-Cafe and tried to get his anger off his chest by committing his \naccount to paper. The language is revealing. No other piece of prose by \nUlyanov carries us so directly to the heart of his emotions. He had, he \nstated, lost his 'feeling of being in love' with Plekhanov. He believed \n Capitalism in One Country \n \nthat he and Potresov had been treated 'like children', indeed like \n'slaves'. It was 'an unworthy thing'. His sense of humiliation was \noverpowering. The conclusion he drew, however, was hardheaded: 'It \nis necessary to behave to everybody \"without sentimentality\", it is \nnecessary to keep a stone in one's sling.' \nThere is little reason to challenge Ulyanov's estimation of the low \ncunning in Plekhanov's behaviour; but perhaps he himself was more \nboisterous and intimidating than he admitted. In any case, the dispute \nwas already prising Plekhanov away from his refusal to have dealings \nwith Struve. But other matters remained divisive. Ulyanov wanted to \nbase the newspaper in Munich with himself and Potresov as chief \neditors. Plekhanov threw one of his fits. And, when faced down by the \ntwo young 'careerists' (as Ulyanov felt sure he now thought of them), \nhe submitted his resignation from the project. Ulyanov and Potresov \nfell for the ploy and begged him to reconsider. Plekhanov laid down \nfresh conditions. He demanded double the voting power of any other \neditor. Ulyanov and Potresov instantly gave in. But hours later they \nsaw how they had been duped, and they took a leaf out of Plekhanov's \nbook: they resigned. Akselrod duly padded round to see them and duly \ntook Plekhanov's side. Zasulich was so distressed that friends worried \nthat she might kill herself. Another meeting was held with Plekhanov. \nAgain he attempted to get his way with the help of hysterics. Ulyanov \nand Potresov were unperturbed this time. Plekhanov announced his \nintention to withdraw entirely from public life. The young men left the \nroom. They refused to be fooled. \nAs yet, though, their victory was Pyrrhic: Iskra would not be \npublished. They therefore reverted to an honourable compromise; \nthey proposed to Plekhanov that they all jointly print a collection of \narticles. If this worked out well, they stated, they would retract their \nIskra resignation. Plekhanov conceded the necessary ground. Subtle \nmanoeuvrer that he was, Ulyanov had made the vital discovery that the \nway to defeat Plekhanov over Iskra was to avoid open pitched battles \nand to conduct a war of attrition. Plekhanov's bullying days were over. \nCompelled to make that first retreat, he was already too disorientated \nto stop further backward movement. A triumphant Ulyanov packed \nhis bags and departed for Munich on  August . The squabble \nover location fizzled out. Nor was Ulyanov troubled by worries about \nthe composition of the editorial board. Formally there would be six \neditors. The older emigres would be represented by Plekhanov, \nAkselrod and Zasulich; and the newcomers by Ulyanov, Potresov and \nMartov. In practice, however, geography would have an influence. The \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nthree hundred miles separating Geneva from Munich were bound to \nput Ulyanov into an authoritative position. There he would also be \nable to conduct negotiations with potential subsidisers like Struve \nwithout being badgered to distraction by Plekhanov. Ulyanov had \ncarried off the spoils. Though inexperienced in committee work, the \nnovice had picked up the necessary skills and techniques with \nconsummate ease; and Plekhanov, whose glacial manner had chilled \nall who had approached him as fellow Marxists, was having to treat his \nformer disciple as a leader of equal worthiness and power. \n",
    "1900-1904": "   From this Accursed \nDistance \npOST-CONGRESS IMBROGLIO \nOrganisational cohesion does not come easily to an oppositional \npolitical party in emigration. A governing party experiences a myriad \nof impulses conducive to minimising internal fractiousness; and this is \nof assistance to any cabinet wishing to adopt policies as circumstances \nseem to require. The political will for unity is not universally secure in \nsuch situations. But a party in government possesses a further asset in \nthe shape of its capacity to dispense patronage: it can move its \nfavoured members to posts associated with authority and material \ncomfort. Parties in opposition confront difficulties by comparison. \nOpportunities for the disbursement of office and affluence are \nrestricted (although the German Social- Democratic Party's record \nbefore  shows that they can still be substantial). Political \nfrustrations are enormous. Fissiparous debates about strategy con-\ntinually threaten to replace constructive practical operations. Collec-\ntive support for unification has to be cultivated. This task is beset by \nproblems all the more severe in organisations which are not only \noppositional but also illegal, clandestine and partly based abroad; the \ntechnical as well as the political strains are immense. Their need for \nconcerted action is in many ways more pressing than for legal, \ndomestic groupings. And yet every attempt to bring about organised \nunity runs the risk of raising even higher the temperature in the \npolitical greenhouse of emigration. \nIntemperate discourse and behaviour had made Russian expatriate \nrevolutionaries notorious in the rest of Europe long before the birth of \nRussian Marxism. The reputation was beginning to attach itself to \nRussian Marxists too by the turn of the century. Emigre disputatious-\nness contrasted with the more restrained modes of disagreement \ncharacteristic of debates among the Marxists in Russia in the s; \nand the susceptibility ofthe Swiss-centred groups to disruptiveness was \n \n From this Accursed Distance \n \nmade acute by the presence of theorists like Lenin and Plekhanov who \nhad become so averse to compromise in party discussions. \nLenin was after the total exploitation of his triumph in the elections \nto the central party apparatus. His group called itselftheBolsheviki (or \n'Majoritarians'), hoping to enhance its status as the legitimate \nleadership. Martov's group took the name of Mensheviki (or \n'Minoritarians'). Martov himself re-opened hostilities. He wanted to \nwin back Plekhanov. The opportunity arose at a gathering of the \nForeign League Of Revolutionary Russian Social-Democracy in \nGeneva in October . The Party Congress had established the \nLeague as the party's sole organisation abroad. Martov led the assault \nupon Lenin's position. Lenin learned that he had placed a gun in \nMartov's hands in early summer by making him privy to Iskra's \npre-Congress manoeuvres. Martov told of Lenin's plan to reduce the \nsize of the editorial board to three persons. The intended victims \nincluded not only Akselrod, Potresov and Zasulich but even \nPlekhanov himself. 'Don't you see,' Lenin had purred to Martov, 'that \nif we stick by each other, we'll keep Plekhanov constantly in a minority \nand he'll be able to do nothing about it?'  The revelation shattered \nLenin's composure. He made no defence. Having calculated the \nbalance of forces at the League's gathering, he knew that he would be \noutvoted. He stormed out, slamming the door. Martov's allegations \ndisturbed Plekhanov too. The 'state of siege' in the party had anyway \nbeen depressing him, to the point that he stated that 'suicide would be \npreferable to schism'. Factional reconciliation was now his professed \nobjective. To effect a truce he was ready to step down from Iskra. If \nPlekhanov resigned, many would take it as proof that Lenin truly was \nthe party's tyrant. Lenin suddenly seemed to be facing defeat. On  \nNovember he announced his resignation from Iskra and the Party \nCounci. \nLenin soon cursed himselffor having panicked. Plekhanov revealed \nhis alienation from Lenin; his scheme to reconcile the two warring \ngroups would not be undertaken evenhandedly. Privately he called \nLenin the party's Robespierre. And the removal of Lenin from Iskra \nby painless surgery induced the Mensheviks to think that their \nproblems had disappeared forever. Not so. In abandoning Iskra, Lenin \nhad not forgotten 'to keep a stone in his sling'. He asked to be co-opted \nto the Central Committee. The Central Committee consisted of \nBolsheviks. And when, in mid-November , Krzhizhanovski \narrived in Switzerland from Russia it was an easy formality for Lenin to \nobtain membership. Lenin and fellow Bolshevik L. E. Galperin were \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nappointed Central Committee representatives on the Party Council.s \nPlekhanov had to act with dispatch. Iskra presently had no Council \nrepresentative apart from Plekhanov himself. Lenin could seize back \ncontrol of the newspaper through his dominance inside the Central \nCommittee. Plekhanov's responded by co-opting Mensheviks to the \nIskra board. \nStalemate resulted, and the Mensheviks anticipated that Lenin \nwould be constrained to restore amicable working relations with them. \nLenin, however, felt cheated by Plekhanov, and fought on for \nunconditional victory. But he reckoned without Krzhizhanovski. On \n November  there was a session of the Party Council and \nKrzhizhanovski, fearful of a party split, guaranteed to have Galperin \nwithdrawn from Council membership; Krzhizhanovski also agreed to \npress the Central Committee to co-opt Mensheviks into its member-\nship. Few Bolsheviks craved the exclusion of all Mensheviks from \nleading positions; and Krzhizhanovski asked Lenin whether he really \ncould be right when so impressive a majority thought him wrong. \nKrzhizhanovski's concessions were expected to initiate a new era in \nparty relations. Lenin had other plans. He demanded the convocation \nof a Third Party Congress so that the party as a whole might adjudicate \nthe Bolshevik-Menshevik dispute. In December, he bombarded \ngroups and activists in Russia with letters of self-justification. In \nJanuary  he attended the Party Council, repeating his call for a \nCongress; he denounced the Mensheviks as opportunists and disor-\nganisers. Martov in retort castigated Lenin as a power-crazed \negomaniac; and he treated the idea of a Congress as financially \ninsupportable and organisationally productive only of schism. Lenin's \nhopes of prising Plekhanov away from Martov faded. The Council \nturned down Lenin's proposals. Plekhanov was so infuriated by \nLenin's belligerence that he denounced him in Iskra as a 'Bonapar-\ntist' . \nThe \nCentral \nCommittee \ntoo \nwas \nannoyed \nwith \nLenin. \nKrzhizhanovski, Noskov and the recently-co-opted L. B. Krasin were \nall Bolsheviks appalled by the possibility of an organisational rupture; \nthey spurned Lenin's request that his supporter P. A. Krasikov be \nseconded to the Central Committee. In February  they wrote: \n'We all implore the Old Man to give up his quarrel and start work. We \nawait leaflets, pamphlets and advice of all kinds - the best way of \nsoothing the nerves and answering slander.'  Lenin replied that he was \nnot a machine; and that he could not obliterate Martov's and \nPlekhanov's criticisms from his mind.lO Krzhizhanovski thought him to \n From this Accursed Distance \n \nhave lost touch with Russian reality. The Central Committee invited \nhim to leave Switzerland and join them in the underground. Lenin was \nunmoved and unmoving.ll \nIn spring  it became the conviction of other Bolsheviks in the \nCentral Committee that Lenin was the greatest obstacle to the \nre-unification of the central party apparatus. Lenin had overstretched \nhimself. In February, his friend R. S. Zemlyachka clashed with L. E. \nGalperin in the Central Committee. Galperin too had ceased to \nsupport Lenin. Zemlyachka in the heat of the moment announced her \nresignation from the Central Committee; and, to her horror, the other \nmembers were unwilling to allow her to retract. Lenin blustered on. \nHe endeavoured to browbeat the Central Committee firstly by \nresigning from the Party Council and then by threatening to withdraw \nfrom the Central Committee too. His bluff called, he resumed his \npositions before he lost them permanently.I Accordingly the all-\nBolshevik Central Committee now had eight members: V. A. Noskov \nand G. M. Krzhizhanovski (who had been elected by Congress) \ntogether with M. M. Essen, L. E. Galperin, N. V. Gusarov, L. B. \nKrasin, F. V. Lengnik and Lenin himself (all of whom had been \nco-opted). Of these, only Essen and Lengnik were firmly with Lenin; \nand they wrote to Russia in hope of winning over the rest. They still \nconsidered that, if only the Russia-based leaders could see how the \nMensheviks were behaving, the Central Committee would drop its \npeace-making proposals. Noskov, however, took the initiative. He \ngot the Central Committee members to issue him with a reprimand to \ndeliver to Lenin. In May  he reached Switzerland and, with the \nCentral Committee's authority, forbade Lenin to campaign for the \nconvocation of a Party Congress. Noskov objected to the savagery of \nLenin's writings. He sought to halt publication of the anti-Menshevik \ntract One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. Again Lenin threatened to \nresign. Noskov compromised, feeling strong enough in the Central \nCommittee in the contingency of further serious dispute. An agree-\nment was made. Thenceforward Noskov and Lenin were to be joint \nrepresentatives of the Central Committee abroad, and neither man \nwould take any important decisions without the other's consenes \n'ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK' \nThe same agreement permitted the continued distribution of One Step \nForward, Two Steps Back. It had first appeared on  May . \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nDrafted and redrafted since February, its empirical basis was an \nextensive psephological analysis of the Second Party Congress. It was \n'instant history'. The style was hectoring; What Is To Be Done?, in \ncomparison, seems like exemplary disinterested research. No self-\ndoubt, no self-criticism. \nThe work constituted the thrust of his counter-attack. It was an \nuncustomary operation for him. Always before, he had been the \naggressor, the initiator of conflict. His earliest attackers after the \nCongress had been Akselrod and Plekhanov. Trotski then declared his \nsupport for them; and, when One Step Forward came out, he published \nhis booklet Our Political Tasks in reply. Lenin's pronouncements had \nunexpectedly become an issue for European social-democracy as a \nwhole. Rosa Luxemburg, the Polish Jew who was prominent in the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party, arraigned him in her Organisational \nQuestions in Russian Social-Democracy. For a while, Kautsky thought \nof taking sides against Lenin; but he was deterred in the end by both \nfear of aggravating the dispute and recognition that his knowledge of \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was far from being \ncomprehensive. Akselrod, Plekhanov, Trotski and Luxemburg had \nbeen amazed and offended by Lenin's activity at the Second Party \nCongress; his polemical techniques struck them as mere abusiveness. \nThey also challenged his doctrinal positions. They were picking up and \nextending arguments aimed against Lenin's What Is To Be Done? by \nMartynov and Akimov. Plekhanov openly acknowledged this; and \nMartov publicly regretted that he had not taken writers like Akimov \nseriously in the first instance.s Lenin's enemies, though making their \nforays independently of each other, drew upon a similar arsenal of \nammunition. \nTheir assault upon Lenin's ideas was multi-directional. It was \nasserted that they were anti-worker; that they were the embodiment of \nbureaucratic centralism; and that they would, objectively, open the \ngates to precisely the political opportunism which they had been \ndesigned to disbar. \nAkselrod maintained that Lenin expected factory workers to act as \npolitical cannon-fodder under the generalship of the radical middle-\nclass intelligentsia. Plekhanov concurred with Akselrod, and added \nthat Russian socialism had been formed not by intellectuals in isolation \nbut through a process of interaction between middle-class activists and \ndiscontented urban labourers.o This may possibly have been the gist of \nhis original objection to What Is To Be Done? at the time of its \npublication. Be that as it may, Luxemburg expanded on Plekhanov's \n From this Accursed Distance \n \narguments. What Is To Be Done?, she maintained, eulogised the \nobedience and discipline instilled in the working class by the factory \nsystem. She, by contrast, saw rebelliousness against 'authority' as the \nprimary desirable attribute of the true socialist. Lenin seemed to her to \nbe crazed with regimentative pretensions and menace. Plekhanov \npredicted that Bolshevik organisational theory, if taken to its logically \nconsistent end, would establish not the dictatorship of the proletariat \nbut 'a dictatorship over the proletariat'. Lenin would realise 'the ideal \nof the Persian Shah' . Trotski agreed with Plekhanov and uttered the \nfollowing prophecy: 'The organisation of the party takes the place of \nthe party itself; the Central Committee takes the place of the party \norganisation; and finally \"the dictator\" takes the place of the Central \nCommittee.'  \nSuch an internal regime, according to Lenin's adversaries, would be \nbureaucratic centralism. Akselrod accused Lenin of 'organisational \nfetishism': the Bolsheviks were politically so introspective that they \nrisked overlooking opportunities for the advancement of the revolu-\ntionary cause in Russia. Trotski went further. For him, What Is To Be \nDone? proposed a party structure which could not long endure. \nLenin's followers would become disillusioned with so strict an \ninsistence upon their servility to him. The most talented activists would \ninevitably desert Bolshevism. It worried Trotski, though, that Lenin's \nprescriptions might become identified by Russian social-democrats as \nthe only possible variant of centralism. The goal of centralisation \nwould lose favour. And this would prepare the ground for 'socialist \nopportunists' . The discrediting of Lenin would lead to the discrediting \nof the entire programme of revolutionary social-democracy. \nTrotski's fears were shared by Luxemburg. She stressed the tendency \nof party leaderships to take an increasingly conservative view of their \nduties. Her solution, as explained in her pamphlet, was for rank-and-\nfile members to be encouraged to keep their committees on the path of \nrevolution. \nUnrepentant, Lenin charged his critics with hypocrisy. He was \nhelped in this by the fact that no social-democrat was yet fully \nconvinced that epoch-making questions of principle underlay the \nBolshevik-Menshevik dispute. Even Plekhanov took months to \ncomplete his doctrinal case. Lenin pounced on this. He claimed that \nthe verbal violence of the Second Party Congress had occurred mainly \nbecause a minority of delegates had refused to accept majority \ndecisions. The Bolsheviks had won by fair means. In order to justify \nthe struggle after the Congress, the Mensheviks had been compelled to \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nexaggerate the ideological importance of their differences with the \nBolsheviks. Originally, according to Lenin, Menshevism was more a \nploy than a doctrine. He despised its 'rhetoric'. When the Mensheviks \ncalled for guarantees of the right of freedom of speech for oppositions, \nhe claimed, they did so from selfish motives. Underneath them lay no \nterrain of principle. He was not alone in making this claim: Bogdanov \nand Lunacharski said equally forcefully that the Mensheviks were \nplaying at politics and not articulating a doctrinal alternative. Neither \nBogdanov nor Lunacharski had much time for emigres in general. \nThey considered that even Lenin was not entirely au fait with the \nRussian party's needs; but they treated the Menshevik leaders as the \nreal villains of the piece in the disputes in Geneva. \nYet the anti-Lenin phalanx had nevertheless made at least a few \nsubstantive theoretical points; and Lenin was obliged to offer his \ndefence. He omitted to reply in detail to the charge that What Is To Be \nDone? drastically down-graded the functions of the working class in \nrevolutionary struggle; he stuck to a curt, unelaborated denial that he \nregarded obedience as the greatest positive characteristic of factory \nlabourers. Bogdanov and Lunacharski were more forthcoming. They \nhighlighted the sections of Lenin's book which emphasised the \nworking class's 'vanguard' role; and themselves stressed the important \nstrides made in political self-organisation by Russian workers.  It was \nonly in later years that Bogdanov came to see Lenin's failure to provide \na similarly strong pro-worker case as something sinister. \nAt all events, Lenin in One Step Forward wished to focus on \nmiddle-class intellectuals rather than workers. His counter-charge \nagainst the Mensheviks was that they, with their abhorrence of \nBolshevik discipline, were leaning towards 'anarchic individualism'. \nMenshevik ideas, if implemented, would give succour to desk-bound \nprofessors who would not work for the party and yet would quibble \nover the minutest aspects of party policy. 'Opportunists' would enter \nthe party in an uncontrolled flood. Thus Lenin hoped to turn the tables \non his opponents in debate: it was allegedly the Mensheviks who \nwanted to raise the power of middle-class intellectuals, not Lenin.s \nYet his accusation does not entirely convince. The Menshevik criti-\ncisms had been directed at a different sort of intellectual: the full-time \nactivist. Akselrod's main argument had been aimed against the \nemergence of an uncontrollable elite of professionals. One Step \nForward, judged as political theory rather than political invective, was \nconsequently a disappointing work. In their own faltering way, his \nopponents had exposed the Achilles' heel of his organisational ideas. \n From this Accursed Distance \n \nWhat Is To Be Done? had indeed implied a certain condescension \ntowards workers; its concrete recommendations were also potentially \nmore injurious to the democratisation of party life in the years ahead \nthan he supposed; and it assuredly did get centralisation and discipline \na worse name than they would otherwise have attracted. \nALPINE HOLIDAY \nLenin's wife and friends saw the strain telling on him. Even before the \nSecond Party Congress he had been tired, and the ensuing winter of \n- brought no relief. His physical condition was poor. While \nbicycling through Geneva, he had run into the rear of a tramcar and \nsustained gashes to the head. For some weeks he appeared at \ngatherings becowled in a white bandage. He cut a somewhat \nterrifying figure. \nThe Bolshevik-Menshevik dispute, its rights and wrongs, pushed \neverything else to the back of his mind. Rarely has there been a more \nsingle-minded politician. At anyone time it was his custom to \nelaborate a supreme immediate goa\\. Once defined, it had to be \npursued at any expense. He doubted the efficaciousness of trying to \nfollow a cluster of goals at once. He liked to keep his short-term politics \nuncomplicated (while yet being cognisant of the complexity of the \ncontinuing struggle for socialism in the years to come). This was both \nasset and draw-back for him. In  it would be distinctly advantage-\nous; from February to October, whereas his enemies were pondering \nthe complications of policy, he had one main prodding thought: to \nseize power. But in  monocentrism was less fruitful. Since the late \ns he had believed that the party should cleanse its ranks of \nideological impurity, should centralise its operations, should cleave to \nthtt strictest disciplinary code. It did not matter to him that many \nMensheviks agreed with him about other aspects of revolutionary \nstrategy. He conceived of political activity as being best undertaken in \nstages. And the current stage, he reasoned, should be taken up with the \norganisational formation of the party. Hence this otherwise flexible \nleader (and indeed his flexibility would become more and more \nnotorious in many social-democratic milieux) saw no room for \ncompromise. \nBut the pressure increased. The rift with Plekhanov and Martov \naffected his health. P. N. Lepeshinski described the change: 'I \nwitnessed him in such a depressed condition of spirit as it was never my \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nlot to see him in either before or after that period.' Despite his \nprodigious capacity for rapid writing, he had toiled like a novice over \nOne Step Forward, Two Steps Back. 'It looks as though I shan't finish \nthe booklet,' he had complained, 'I'll throw up everything and go off to \nthe mountains!' \nThe remark is doubly interesting. Unusual as it was for Vladimir \nIich Ulyanov-Lenin to lose his panache, it was still more extraordinary \nfor him to communicate such a loss to his comrades. Among emigres, \nhis name was a by-word for optimism. His self-belief was crucial to the \nmaintenance of a trusting group of activists around him. He sensed \nthat a political party in autocratic Russia needed a leadership with \nmore than intellectual self-assurance and organisational cohesion. \nLeaders had to supply emotional strength. At the slightest expression \nof doubts by his followers, Lenin would state and re-state the articles of \nfaith: 'But look here: I myself, let me be allowed to inform you, am \nmost profoundly convinced that I shall survive until the socialist \nrevolution in Russia.' Lenin treated it as his duty to offer the \nmaximum of psychological support. If a Bolshevik fell into police \ncustody, he and Krupskaya would dispatch a comforting letter. Lenin \nalso tried to be the first to make personal contact with Russian \nsocial-democrats newly arriving in Switzerland. Martov, though \nwell-meaning, lacked the self-application to compete with Lenin as an \norganiser. Lenin was the good shepherd to his flock. Nikolai \nValentinov, later a prominent anti-Bolshevik, never forgot the down-\nto-earth assistance rendered him on one particular day in Geneva. \nLacking a private income, Valentinov had to work as a barrow-pusher. \nOn an occasion when he was given a particularly heavy consignment \nfor removal, he could find many comrades sympathetic with his plight; \nbut no one's sympathy, except Lenin's, stretched as far as an offer of \nactive help. Valentinov and Lenin pushed the load across the city to its \ndestination; and Valentinov received his vital wage. \nIn early , however, this attractive component of Lenin's \npersonality was slipping its gear. Lenin diagnosed the symptoms. He \nneeded a break from the routine of politics. Since coming to Western \nEurope, he had not had much time for the sportive sort of relaxation he \nenjoyed. His regular afternoon strolls were too undemanding. \nHe decided to take a couple of months' holiday in the Swiss Alps. \nSuch a project did not then require plutocratic funding. Lenin was \nanyway not stinted for finances. He received an allowance from the \nparty as Central Committee member; he was sent royalties on his \nlegally-published books. And his mother supplemented his account \n From this Accursed Distance \n \nwhen he felt hard-pressed. Lenin and Krupskaya set off in the first \nfortnight of June . They threw up their rented Geneva house; and \nLenin drafted a note devolving his authority as foreign representative \nof the Central Committee to close supporters. They limited the \nnumber of books in their baggage and, to their own astonishment, \nsucceeded in avoiding reading most of what they took. Baedeker's \nSwitzerland took pride of place in their knapsacks. They promised not \nto talk about political business, nor even, 'insofar as it was possible', to \nthink about it. They drew up no itinerary programme. By steamer \nthey travelled to Montreux and visited the castle of Chillon. \nMountain-walking was their principal recreation. They were not \nalways alone, being accompanied for some days by Mariya Essen. \nVladimir set them a fast pace. He chuckled at their discomfiture; in \nplayas in work, he believed that personal satisfaction rose in \nproportion to effort expended. Postcards depicting Mount Jungfrau \nwere sent by the self-styled 'vagabonds' . Lenin's health and mood \nsteadily improved. Towards late July they settled temporarily in a \npension overlooking Lac de Bre, near Lausanne. There they stayed \nuntil the start of September (when they returned to Geneva). They \nhad partaken of the pleasures of contemporary tourism with the same \nzeal which, in the test of , they devoted to the overthrow of the \nEuropean bourgois political order. Lenin's spirit was restored. \nTHE BUREAU OF COMMITTEES OF THE MAJORITY \nYet his game in the Central Committee in early summer had been \nplayed with weak cards. Noskov held trumps. Lenin knew Noskov \ncould mobilise a Central Committee majority in favour of reconcilia-\ntion with the Mensheviks. Before going off on vacation, Lenin had \nwarned sympathisers in Russia that a coup d'etat was possible; and \nprivately he took a more dismal view, reckoning that an offensive by \nNoskov was not just a possibility but a likelihood. Noskov asked for \ndiscussions with Lenin. Lenin refused. Noskov had already dragged \nhim to the limits of what he regarded as conscionable compromise. But \nNoskov was determined to re-unify the factions. He proposed to \nco-opt two Mensheviks into the Central Committee in return for the \nco-opting of Lenin on to the Iskra board. Neither Noskov nor his \nfriends withdrew their admiration for What Is To Be Done?; and they \nstill felt that the Second Party Congress had given the Bolsheviks the \nright to greater influence at the apex of the party than the Mensheviks. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut Lenin's policy, they feared, would split the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party needlessly and destructively into two \nseparate organisations. Lenin in fact was not yet calling for a schism. \nRather he demanded a reduction in Menshevik influence in the central \nparty apparatus, and he had left for his holiday in a mood of angry \nself -righ teousness. \nNoskov, meanwhile, visited Russia. He contacted Galerin and \nKrasin. The three of them considered themselves entitled to act as the \nCentral Committee. Zemlyachka had resigned. Lengnik had just been \narrested. Gusarov and Krzhizhanovski were so dispirited by the \nin-fighting that they too had resigned. Mariya Essen was incarcerated \nupon return to Russia in midsummer. Noskov, Galperin and Krasin \ncould easily now outvote Lenin. They co-opted three more like-\nminded Bolshevik 'Conciliators' to the Central Committee: I. F. \nDubrovinski, L. Y. Karpov and A.. Lyubimov. A statement of regret \nand reproof was made that Lenin had recently written so few \npamphlets; and Noskov was enjoined to communicate their so-called \nJuly Declaration to Lenin. They wanted a rapprochement between \nBolsheviks and Mensheviks in the central party apparatus, and they \nhoped that Lenin would bow before the fait accompli . \nAll along, Lenin had set his face against this. He had radiated the \ndetermination that his sterner version of Bolshevism would win the \nday in the party as a whole; and he had sworn to abandon the Central \nCommittee and conduct 'a desperate struggle' if Noskov went through \nwith a COUp. Receiving the Declaration in August, he was ready with \nhis counter-stroke. He summoned a meeting outside Geneva. Twenty \ntwo Bolsheviks signed a letter of protest, To The Party. The place of \nthe meeting was not mentioned; Lenin wanted to give the impression \nthat the protesting voices had originated in Russia rather than \nSwitzerland. To The Party demanded that a Congress be convoked \nimmediately. Among the signatories was M. S. Olminski. He had \npreviously been based in Paris; he and his confederates in France had \ntaken Lenin's side in the Bolshevik-Menshevik controversy. They \nwere talented writers and organisers and had contacts with party \ngroups in Russia. They had also welcomed Lenin's invitation to join \nhim by Lac de Bre. Their leading lights were Aleksandr Bogdanov and \nAnatoli Vasilevich Lunacharski. Lenin and Bogdanov got on well \npersonally; and, with appropriate interludes of mountain-walking and \nswimming, they formulated tactics to regroup the forces inside the \nparty supporting the pro-Lenin Bolshevik cause. The Central Com-\nmittee and Iskra were in the hands of the enemy. The two men \n From this Accursed Distance \n \nconcluded that the time had come to construct new organisational and \npublishing institutions. \nIn autumn , their emissaries hastened to Russia to arrange \nthree regional conferences of Bolsheviks. The regions were northern \nRussia, southern Russia and the Transcaucasus. Each conference \nselected representatives to serve on a body which, on Lenin's \nsuggestion, was dubbed the Bureau Of Committees Of The Majority. \nThe Bureau was to stimulate the convocation of a Party Congress. It \nhad no fewer than eight members, including Bogdanov. It also \ncontained several leading organisers such as P. P. Rumyantsev, A. I. \nRykov and R. S. Zemlyachka. The Bureau's creation was com-\nplemented by a Bolshevik literary venture which was initiated by \nLenin even before Bogdanov's arrival. This was the 'publishing house \nof social-democratic party literature of V. Bonch-Bruevich and N. \nLenin'. Pamphlets and leaflets were issued.so Noskov's Central \nCommittee obstructed progress by prohibiting access to the official \nparty printing facilities. Funds too were running short. But to the \nrescue came Bogdanov. He knew of potential providers of subsidy in \nRussia and sped off to trace them. Lenin raged at him for not writing \nback regularly. Cursed by Lenin for his 'swinish' behaviour, Bogdanov \nwent his own way. By  November  Lenin was changing his \nattitude. He wrote glowingly to M. M. Litvinov about Bogdanov's \nprospective success in attracting literary contributors and making \napproaches to a sympathetic millionaire. Lenin's further aim was to \nset up a newspaper to compete with Iskra, now under Menshevik \ncontrol. The name would be Vpered (or Forward). He expected to rely \nheavily upon the newcomers from Paris. Discussions led to agreement \non an editorial board of Lenin, Bogdanov, Lunacharski, Olminski \nand V. V. Vorovski. Arrangements went well and Vpered's publica-\ntion commenced on  December; and, in a short while, Lenin was \nproducing the newspaper on a weekly basis. \nLenin's position inside his faction was now seemingly impregnable. \nHe had worked for the creation of a factional Bureau and a factional \nnewspaper; and, far from being swept overboard by Noskov, he had \nsailed on to achieve both objectives. The Central Committee, headed \nby Bolshevik Conciliators, was shocked by his group's ease in \nconsolidating its network of agents in Russia. A. I. Lyubimov fell into \ndespondency. He urged Noskov to face up to the fact that nearly all \nsocial-democratic organisations in Russia proper, except those in the \nsouth, were held by supporters of the Bureau. This turnabout \nappeared to many as Lenin's personal victory. Yet his authority inside \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nhis faction was by no means dictatorial; and, within weeks, he was \ndestined to lose his leading position to Aleksandr Bogdanov. \nRUSSIAN TURMOIL AND THE CALL FOR A SPLIT \nThe urgent practical purpose of What Is To Be Done? had been to \nprepare Russian social-democrats to take advantage of a political \nsituation likely to explode into revolution at any moment. The year \n was the most disturbing yet in Nikolai II's reign. Bolshevik \nleaders in Russia were keen to treat the crisis of the autocracy as the \nprincipal focus of social-democratic activity. \nWar had started in January between Japan and Russia. V. K. von \nPleve, Minister of Internal Affairs, warned that military conflict might \ndetonate ungovernable turbulence at home. Nikolai II ignored his \ncounsel. For years there had been rivalry between the Russian empire \nand Japan over territory, trade and influence in the Far East. Russian \narmies were transported eastward by the Trans-Siberian railway, while \nthe Baltic fleet set out on its voyage of twenty six thousand miles to the \nPacific. But disasters occurred immediately. Japan's industrial growth \nmade her a redoubtable adversary in her own sphere of operations in \nthe Far East. In April, Japanese troops overwhelmed the Russians in \nthe land battIe of the Yalu river. Russia's Far-Eastern fleet was \nbeseiged in Port Arthur.  The war had never been welcomed by the \nRussian empire's national minorities. Poles and Finns hoped for a \nRussian defeat. Anti-tsarist demonstrations occurred in Warsaw. As \nthe set-backs in the Far East were reported, hostility to the govern-\nment spread to Russia proper. Pleve clamped down. Already in  \nhe had dismissed Zubatov from his police post and thus terminated the \nexperimental development of trade unions. The slightest weakening of \nstate power was anathema to him. In spring  he obstructed the \nactivity of liberal-dominated zemstva. Throughout the empire there \nwere reports of unrest among workers and peasants. Strikes increased \nin number. The socialist-revolutionaries initiated a terrorist campaign. \nIn July  they struck. Sazonov, leader of their Combat Organisa-\ntion, assassinated PI eve in St. Petersburg. \nThe emperor, convinced that appeasement of popular opinion was \nunavoidable, appointed P. D. Svyatopolk-Mirski as Pleve's successor. \nMirski sought to attract the liberal activists' support by affording \ngreater freedom to the zemstva; he even tried, unsuccessfully, to \npersuade the emperor to allow a handful of elected public representa-\n From this Accursed Distance \n \ntives to take office in the central state administration. He relaxed the \ncensorship somewhat. He withdrew the government's covert support \nfor the progroms against the Jews. The emperor, worried for the \nloyalty of the peasants, abolished the discriminatory legal provision \nwhereby they could be subjected to corporal punishment for misde-\nmeanours. Yet the concessions were correctly interpreted as evi-\ndence of weakness. In August, Russian warships were sunk in an \nengagement off Vladivostok. Public disorder intensified at home. \nDemonstrations were organised in Warsaw, Baku and Riga. The \nboldness of the liberals, who had formed their Union Of Liberation in \n, steadily increased. A conference of oppositionist groupings \nconvened in Paris in autumn. Alongside Milyukov from the Union Of \nLiberation sat Chernov from the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, \nand these were joined by delegates from clandestine parties operating \nin the ethnically non-Russian areas of the empire. A concordat was \nproduced to unite in an assault upon tsardom. It was commonly hoped \nthat a democratic structure of state would be introduced in very short \norder. \nThe liberals spread their ideas through speeches delivered in \nbanquets held to commemorate dates of historical significance (such as \nthe fortieth anniversary of the legal reforms of ). Execration \nshowered down upon the autocratic regime. News from the Far East \nincreased the monarchy'S unpopularity: the Japanese took Port \nArthur on  December . \nSocial-democratic activists, in Russia and in emigration, were \nsurprised at the government's failure to quell the liberals in thezemstva \nand in the Union Of Liberation. Absorbed for a year in internal \nwrangles, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was being \novertaken by events in the country. There were still only around \n  party members. Their committees and propaganda circles \nexisted in every major industrial town; and yet they recognised that \nthey were losing their hegemony over the movement of political \nopposition to the autocracy. Social-democratic committees had not \neverywhere managed to attract the sympathy of the urban working \nclass. There had been  strikes in . Even so, contact between \nthe factory workers and the party was not satisfactorily close. This was \ntrue even in Petersburg. At the Putilov Works, the largest armaments \nplant in the empire, the labour force struck for higher wages and better \nconditions in December . Social-democratic activists had no part \nin the strike's organisation. Leadership was in fact provided by the \nAssembly Of Russian Factory And Mill Workers Of The City Of St. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nPetersburg; and this Assembly was an off-shoot of the police-\ncontrolled unions formed by S. V. Zubatov. The Assembly's inspirer \nwas an Orthodox priest, Father Georgi Gapon. It was not guided by St. \nPetersburg social-democrats of either Menshevik or Bolshevik inclina-\ntion. Circumstances now compelled the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party to abandon its organisational distractions. \nOn the eve of , its leaders asked how they could exploit the \nsocial tumult in Russia; and, in particular, they pondered the policy to \nbe adopted towards the oppositional movement of middle-class \nliberals and striking workers. \nThe Mensheviks were first into the field with their answers. Martov \nperceived the situation's dangers. It was distinctly possible, he warned, \nthat liberal groupings might set up their own labour organisations. \nSocial-democrats could not afford to stand aside from the liberals' \ncampaign against the government; abstention would edge the working \nclass towards support for the Union Of Liberation. He was exaggerat-\ning; and he did so in order to press home the argument that \nsocial-democrats and liberals should form an anti-monarchical \nalliance. This would involve a combination of legal and illegal activity; \nand it would contradict Lenin's prescription for exclusively under-\nground party organisations. Iskra followed this up with a special \nleaflet. The purpose was to explain that, while fighting alongside the \nliberals, social-democrats should nonetheless make workers aware of \nthe half-heartedness of the Union Of Liberation's democratic inten-\ntions. An alliance would give a chance to put pressure upon the \nliberals. The Union Of Liberation had to be prevented from accepting \na constitutional settlement restricting the electoral rights of the \nworking class and peasantry. Such a policy required tact. Akselrod \naffirmed that social-democrats should discourage public disorders \nnecessitating the intervention of the police and army. Violent street \nclashes would scare the liberals back into political passivity. Many \nsocial-democratic committees in Russia, even some of those domi-\nnated by Bolsheviks, saw sense in Iskra's plan. \nLenin was outraged by it. Immediately, in November , he wrote \na piece castigating Iskra's proposed pact with the liberals. The party \ncould not rule out violence against the state authorities. In Lenin's \nview, social-democrats should therefore concentrate not on being \ntactful but on savagely criticising Russian liberalism. In essence this \nwas a call to snub any alliance with the Union Of Liberation: \nLenin's altercations with the Mensheviks had never been gentle, not \nleast on his side; he had intended to shove them out of leading \n From this Accursed Distance \n \npositions in the party. The new articles by Akselrod and Martov \nimpelled him further. Now, for the first time, Lenin demanded a total \nsplies The Bolsheviks should have their political party and the \nMensheviks theirs. It was a summons of epochal importance. He had \nbeen prepared to tolerate the Menshevik presence, however disconten-\ntedly, so long as their theorists did not act unequivocally against what \nhe regarded as 'orthodoxy'. Their present policies were fundamentally \nunacceptable to him. They implied that the middle class would lead the \nrevolution against the absolute monarchy. This robbed the working \nclass of its 'vanguard' role. Iskra replied that Lenin's fulminations \nexhibited a lack of acquaintance with developments in Russia; and that \nchances of political advance would be lost unless liberal groupings \nwere handled with care. S Both sides of the argument had cogent \naspects. The Mensheviks were indeed starting to defer to liberal \npolitical leadership; the Bolsheviks, however, were largely abandon-\ning the old social-democratic commitment to seeking out the liberals as \npolitical allies. Indubitably it was vital for Russian Marxists to decide \nwhat forms of political struggle were in the interests of industrial \nworkers in the winter of -. Yet the whole debate had a \nsurrealistic quality. Neither Iskra nor Vpered addressed itself in a \ntimely fashion to the burning question: what is the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party going to do about the Assembly Of Factory \nAnd Mill Workers Of The City of St. Petersburg? The year  was to \njolt social-democratic activists and theorists into taking such questions \nseriously. \n   \nStraightening Sticks \n'ISKRA' IS FOUNDED \nThe need to establish a political party was unquestioned among \nRussian Marxists at the turn of the century. Not even the so-called \nEconomists objected. Russian social-democracy was following Euro-\npean precedents; German and, to a lesser extent, British socialists had \nalready established influential parties. In France the situation had \nchanged somewhat. Parties had come into disfavour with large sections \nof the French working class, and many intellectuals too distrusted \nthem: the result was a campaign to base the workers' movement upon \nthesyndicats operating at the factory level. Syndicalism dispensed with \nparties. Such an attitude had little attraction for the majority of \nRussian Marxists, at least until after . It was generally recognised \nthat parties were essential for the overthrow of tsarism; even those \nearly narodniki who had been suspicious about the need for specifi-\ncally political activity had nonetheless concurred that the party was the \nmost appropriate vehicle for socialism's advance. This commitment \nwas still stronger among the Russian Marxists. And, although the \ndebate was as yet at an embryonic stage, there was widespread \nagreement about the practical shape to be taken by the party. The \nundemocratic system of power in Russia compelled certain responses. \nRussian Marxists would have to operate clandestinely. Their party \nwould have to be centralist. It would naturally emphasise discipline \nand hierarchy; and some of its leaders would have to live and work \nabroad. \nThere, however, consensus ended. No agreed guidelines existed as \nto how the initiative for forming the party should be undertaken. The \ndissolution of the Central Committee left the options open. Ulyanov, \njoining the emigres of Russian social-democracy in , was ready \nand willing to snatch whatever opportunities came his way (or could be \nmanipUlated so as to do so). \nHis first task was to get his newspaper into production. Iskra had a \nprint-run of a few hundred copies; and, compared with the legal \n \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nconservative dailies of Petersburg, it seemed a Lilliputian affair. But \nUlyanov was not so unrealistic as to expect Iskra to be read by every \nRussian factory worker. He had a narrower readership in mind. He \nwanted to reach the organisers of existing Marxist groups. The variety \nof Marxism's manifestations had never been greater. Not all the \nprecepts of Plekhanov had gained universal approval before the turn \nof the century; and now the opposition was becoming better organised. \nIskra was created to rally the groups still faithful to Plekhanovite \nstandpoints. The first issue was made on  December . The \nlay-out was clear and there were no misprints. Ulyanov's name did not \nappear. Anonymity was customary for most contributors (although the \nRussian political police already knew who was on the editorial board). \nUlyanov wrote a good deal of the copy: three lengthy articles flowed \nfrom his pen for the initial publication. Truly Iskra was Ulyanov's \nchild.  Reportage on the labour movement was blended with discus-\nsion of political strategy. Disquisitions on philosophy and sociology \nwere left to the sister journal Zarya (or Dawn), which appeared three \ntimes between  and . Ulyanov and his fellow writers \nexpected a lot of their readers; they assumed an acquaintance with the \ncurrent arguments and lexicon of European Marxism. Iskra had a \ncosmopolitan ambience. Ulyanov, while recognising the need to \ncommunicate with activists based in Russia, nevertheless lapsed \nfrequently into French quotations and Italian catch-phrases. This was \nnot exhibitionism (though doubtless it was authorially enjoyable). \nIskra wanted to demonstrate its intellectual weightiness. Its accent did \nnot fall only upon practical policies; questions of theory, too, were \nprominent. Slogans peppered every page. Ulyanov succeeded in \nproducing twenty nine issues of Iskra in its first two years and in \nmaintaining substantial uniformity of content. Repetitiousness was \ntreated as a virtue. Clarity was all-important. Iskra called again and \nagain for 'the overthrow of the autocracy' and the consolidation of 'the \ndemocratic revolution'. \nNeither Ulyanov nor Plekhanov would brook rival journalistic \nenterprises. K. M. Takhtarev, taking over the editorship of Workers' \nThought from Kok, proposed in  to put the newspaper under \nPlekhanov's direction. Plekhanov spurned the suggestion. Takhtarev \nwas given to understand that Plekhanov could not break a prior \ncommitment to Iskra. \nBut this alone would hardly have held Plekhanov back. Plekhanov's \nmind was probably also mulling over the likelihood of Takhtarev's \npolicies changing abruptly again in the future (as indeed they did very \n Straightening Sticks \n \nshortly). Ulyanov continued to point to the Economistic orientation \nof Workers' Thought and Workers' Cause. In fact no Russian \nsocial-democratic publication was preaching 'Economism' in : \npolitical struggle against the monarchy was a commonly recognised \npriority. Not a few activists in Russia already objected to Iskra's \ndefamatory methods. Southern Worker did so with particular anger. \nThis was a newspaper founded in Ekaterinoslav in ; it aimed to fill \nthe gap caused by the arrest of the editorial board of Kiev's Workers' \nNewspaper in . Southern Worker had initially held Ulyanov in \nesteem. It had even invited Ulyanov, Martov and Potresov to serve on \nits editorial board; but the 'troika' refused. Southern Worker's \nsubsequent effort to unite the warring sections of the party was \nregarded by Iskra as a futile attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable. \nNothing short of total victory would satisfy Ulyanov and Plekhanov. \nTheir natural abrasiveness was strengthened by their fear lest the party \nshould prove incapable of fulfilling its self-ascribed historic destiny. \nTheir minds were therefore transfixed by the dangers of 'tailism'. \nThey despised those, like Kuskova, who implied the need to stand at \nthe tail, not the forefront of the revolutionary movement. \nThey also knew that social disorder was increasing in Russia. The \nyears of economic boom had ceased in ; whole industries were hit \nby a world trade recession. The immediate effect was a decrease in the \nnumber of strikes. Yet discontent remained. The students in the \nuniversities organised demonstrations in . Gradually their ex-\nample began to be followed by workers. A May Day demonstration in \nKharkov in  halted production in the factories; troops were used \nto restore imperial order. Strikes picked up in number in , and \nMay Day demonstrations could not be prevented in St. Petersburg, \nTiflis, Simferopol and Kharkov. In November  the workers in \nRostov-on-Don conducted a week-long series of marches and public \nmeetings. The city was sealed off militarily and hundreds of demon-\nstrators were taken into custody. Not only the towns were turbulent. \nDisturbances were increasing in the countryside. Provincial governors \nwarned that peasant passivity could no longer be taken for granted. \nIskra reported on a political system in decay; its editorials trium-\nphantly described the manoeuvres forced upon the government. S. V. \nZubatov, in charge of the political police in Moscow, had argued that \nthe prohibition of trade unions undermined the regime'S stability by \ndelivering discontented workers into the hands of the revolutionaries. \nHis recommended solution was the creation of labour organisations \nunder covert police control. The new unions would be kept clear of \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitics, confining their activity to economic wrangles between work-\ners and employers. The Moscow scheme was copied elsewhere in \n. The government also cautiously began to reconsider agrarian \npolicy. Even Witte, the arch-industrialiser, urged change. The com-\nmune no longer appeared to guarantee conservative restraint. In  \nthe emperor abolished joint responsibility for taxes in those communes \nwhere land tenure had not been subject to repartitions. In  he \nappointed a commission to investigate all aspects of the peasant \nquestion in European Russia; and in  joint fiscal responsibility \nwas ended even in areas where the commune frequently repartitioned \nthe land among its households.ll The belief was taking hold in court \ncircles that prudence called for the fostering of a social class of \nindependent peasant smallholders. Another attempt was being con-\nsidered to prevent revolution by means of reform from above. \n'WHAT IS TO BE DONE?' \nUlyanov, writing for Iskra, poured his greatest effort into considera-\ntion of the party's condition. The Urgent Tasks of Our Movement \nappeared in the first issue; it resumed the organisational proposals of \nhis Siberian period. But he wanted to expand his argument in a full \nbook. The result was What Is To Be Done? It was printed in spring \n. He had meant to have it finished earlier but his newspaper \nresponsibilities slowed him down. The book contains over fifty \nthousand words; its central points are clearly made, even though the \nlanguage signals the haste of its composition. Its contents have \nfrequently been misunderstood. What Is To Be Done? has been \nviewed, by numbers of apologists and detractors alike, as a univeral \npractical blueprint. Ulyanov has been said to have tendered a schema \nof organisational mechanics fit for all socialist parties in all times and in \nall countries. In fact he announced restricted aims. His immediate \nrecommendations were addressed specifically to Russia and presented \nnot as an eternal panacea but as solutions to 'the painful questions of \nour movement' . \nAll the same, Ulyanov's analysis comes encased in general theoreti-\ncal propositions. Leadership is the dominant theme. The urban \nworking class is to lead the democratic revolution; but it will not \ndischarge its historic duties unless given direction by the social-\ndemocratic party. Left to themselves, workers cannot develop socialist \nideas. They will limit themselves to an apolitical quest for marginal \n Straightening Sticks \n \nimprovements in their material conditions. Socialist 'consciousness' \nhas to be introduced from without. The job of educating the working \nclass in the first instance falls inevitably to those middle-class \nintellectuals disaffected from the capitalist order . Only the intel-\nligentsia possesses 'scientific' knowledge. Armed with the 'correct' \ntheory, the party will be able to implement the 'correct' forms of \norganisation. 'Incorrect' strategies like 'Economism' inhibit unifica-\ntion. For the party should strive after centralisation and discipline; it \nshould operate with the techniques of clandestinity elaborated by \nRussian agrarian socialists in the s. Working-class members, \nbeing habituated to the regulations of factory life, will accept the need \nfor hierarchical subordination. Leadership, leadership, leadership. In \nproffering his prescription for the Russian party, he yet praised the \nlooser organisational arrangements possible for the German social-\ndemocrats. He attached, however, a remark of theoretical significance. \nHe declared that even in Germany, where a measure of political liberty \nprevailed, socialists were unable to ignore the necessity of maintaining \na stable core of talented, experienced leaders. 'Primitive' democracy \nsimply could not work. \nFloating buoyantly in the jerky course of his prose were sentences of \nrousing clarity. 'Give us an organisation of revolutionaries,' he \nexclaimed, 'and we shall turn all Russia upside down' . He extolled \nthe revolutionary fire and administrative competence of the early \nnarodniki. His earnestness was unmistakable. 'Without a revolu-\ntionary theory', he asserted, 'a revolutionary movement can not even \nexist' . Science was a weapon of political struggle. Disciplined \ncohesion and strict recruitment stipulations were others. Ulyanov \ndeclared that the party organisation should 'consist mainly of persons \nengaged full-time in revolutionary activity'.  Electivity to party offices \nwas fine in principle. But in Russian political conditions it was 'an \nempty and dangerous plaything' . This conclusion was not intended to \ndiscourage or depress. It was offered as a realistic assessment which \nwould advance Russian social-democrats nearer to their ultimate \ngoals. Ulyanov wanted to inspire. Indeed he announced it as his \nslogan: 'It is necessary to dream.' \nThe book possessed a high emotional charge. It was also a polemical \nextravaganza; Ulyanov virtually boasted of his 'uncomradely \nmethods', and confessed that his work included 'exaggerations'. But \nthe Iskra board supported him. Its public posture of unanimity was \nbelied by reservations expressed privately. Plekhanov and Akselrod \nhad criticisms to make in . Their substance is unknown; yet it was \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nserious enough for Plekhanov to feel annoyed that Akselrod would not \nhelp him to take the matter further.  Akselrod's refusal is mysterious. \nPossibly he wanted to avoid the fragmentation of the newspaper \nboard; and he may also have been loathe to castigate a work which at \nany rate attacked revisionism in Marxism. Potresov was less inhibited. \nHe told Ulyanov that the book gravely underestimated the 'spontane-\nous' development of socialism among working-class people.  Such \ncomments, however, were kept within the family of the Iskra board. \nAnd Ulyanov in any case did not lack admirers elsewhere. N. \nValentinov testified to the book's electrifying effect. He instantly felt \nthat Ulyanov had supplied Russian social-democrats with something \nthat had been unavailable: an up-to-date comprehensive rationale for \nthe party's existence. Ulyanov delineated the immediate tasks ahead \ngave and a justification for immediate optimism. A. A. Bogdanov \nand A. V. Lunacharski too were attracted. They liked the book's stress \nupon what could shortly be achieved in Russia; they approved of its \ncontempt for bookish theorising (which they associated with the \nSwiss-based emigres). What Is To Be Done?, for them, was a highly \nestimable account of the modes of activity appropriate to circum-\nstances in contemporary Russia. No practical advice since On \nAgitation had won such praise. Ulyanov's sympathisers ignored the \nbook's darker side. Some, such as L. B. Kamenev, apparently found his \narguments on 'socialist consciousness' entirely acceptable.  Others, \nlike Bogdanov, in fact firmly believed in the workers' capacity for \npolitical self-development; but, for the moment, they were caught up \nby the sheer enthusiasm and apparent practicality of What Is To Be \nDoner \nYet the book also had many critics. Its controversial approach was \nquickly perceived; and the main reason why it did not straightaway \nevoke enormous controversy was that the dispute about the party \nprogramme held greater attention in -. \nAmong the early adversaries was B. I. Krichevski. He assailed \nUlyanov's views on consciousness. He believed that the book accorded \nimportance to the party at the working class's expense; and that, \nmoreover, it envisaged the central party apparatus as the military high \ncommand of the revolution. Krichevski's writings in  initiated a \ntradition. Years passed before all the possible implications ofthe book \nwere teased out; probably not even Ulyanov had fully appreciated \nthem at the time of composition. The conflict steadily sharpened in \n. It already touched upon a matter which profoundly annoyed \nUlyanov. The principal opponents were A. S. Martynov and V. P. \n Straightening Sticks \n \nAkimov. Ulyanov's attitude to organisation, they asserted, was not \nMarxist at all. They described it as narodnik. In their view, Ulyanov \nhad not merely utilised secondary elements of populism but had \nrestored the nucleus of Tkachevian organisational doctrine. These \nwere grievous charges. The critics claimed that the book's recommen-\ndations would effectively exclude workers entirely from the party. \nUlyanov was arraigned for proposing to create a conspiratorial \norganisation, isolated from the mass of the people and constituted by \nthe middle-class intelligentsia. Such a party of 'professionals' would try \nto seize power through the bomb-throwing plots beloved of narodnik \nterrorists; it would ignore the Marxist tenet that social revolutions \noccur only when whole classes of the population become involved in \nthe struggle. \nIn fact, Ulyanov maintained his hostility to narodnik social theory. \nHe could note also that his works had for years involved a conventional \ncontemporary Marxist perspective of the stages of political changes: \nbourgeois democracy followed by the dictatorship of the proletariat. \nAngered by his critics, he wrote his Letter to a Comrade About Our \nOrganisational Tasks. He disowned any desire for a party of middle-\nclass activists. He wanted workers to be recruited toO. But he \nreiterated that every member should give a commitment to active \nparticipation in party life. Membership would cover a large scale of \ndegrees of activity. Ulyanov expected the full-time revolutionaries in \neach local committee to be privy to more secrets and to exercise \ngreater authority than their colleagues. The more full-timers in the \ncommittees, the better it would be for the party as a whole. But the \nrank-and-file members also had their duties; and unless the party could \nattract thousands of such entrants it would remain an ineffective force \nagainst the autocracy. Ulyanov envisaged the local party structure as a \nseries of concentric circles. The core would be provided by full-timers; \nthe middle circles by part-time activists; the outer circles by rank-and-\nfilers. The onus of commitment and authority would increase in \nproportion to the member's nearness to the innermost circle. Local \ncommittees had to be allowed some autonomy. The Central Com-\nmittee should not arbitrarily appoint officials from above, even though \nthe need for clandestinity ruled out the full application of the elective \nprinciple. The central party apparatus would not be all-powerful and \nunchecked; and, by the same token, it was unjust to accuse him of \naspiring to be party despot. He objected to personalised arguments. \nHe also re-affirmed that he accepted individual terrorism as a \n'defensive' tactic only. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Letter showed that he did not want a middle-class clique of \nmilitarily-disciplined conspirators. Yet Akimov still had telling points \nto make. He emphasised the prominent contribution made by the \nworkers themselves in the Russian empire to the formulation of \nsocialist ideas. Akimov, had he so desired, could also have adduced \nEnglish data. Brandishing the Webbs' researches, Ulyanov had \ndeclared that socialism could never have existed without direction by \nmiddle-class intellectuals (and that Karl Kautsky had said something \nsimilar in ). But neither the Webbs' data nor later scholarship \nproved any such thing. English artisans and labourers in the early \nnineteenth century had elaborated varieties of socialism without the \nimposition of ideas by an intelligentsia. Certainly, socialism has \nsubsequently failed to attract the British working class as a whole; but \nthe reasons for this lie in the country's pattern of socio-economic \ndevelopment, not in the irresolution of intellectuals. \nUlyanov's critics continued to contrast him with Marx and Engels. \nMartynov quoted extensively in order to show that Marx had assumed \nthat workers of themselves moved towards socialism because of the \nnature of the capitalist system which oppressed and exploited them. \nIn , Marx had stated: 'Trade unions are the schools of socialism. It \nis in the trade unions that workers educate themselves and become \nsocialists, because under their eyes and every day the struggle with \ncapital is taking place.' These predictions of Marx's remain unful-\nfilled, as the English case shows. Nevertheless the point at issue here is \ndifferent. It is that Marx emphasised the spontaneous growth of \nsocialist consciousness whereas Ulyanov's book asserted a require-\nment for rigorous guidance by the intelligentsia. Martynov's case was \npowerful, but not completely invulnerable. Marx had also spoken \nabout the virtues of communists who 'have over the great mass of the \nproletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, \nthe conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian \nmovement.' Evidently his concepts were not as clear-cut on spon-\ntaneity as Martynov supposed and, for that matter, Marx had not tried \nto produce a 'theory of the party'. Even so, Ulyanov had undoubtedly \ndispensed with an inconvenient but basic portion of the Marxian \nheritage. He was more pessimistic than Marx about workers. Undeni-\nably, he had highlighted the 'elemental' force of the massed working \nclass; he had said too that the party could not impose an insurrection-\nary time-schedule upon the urban crowds. Nonetheless he empha-\nsised a 'negative' side. Workers who were not party members, in his \nportrayal, were good at destroying regimes through direct action on \n Straightening Sticks \n \nthe streets; but this seemed to exhaust'their virtues, save only that they \ntook easily to discipline because of their factory training. Justifiably, \nhis critics complained of his underestimation of the organisational \nachievements of ordinary workers. They objected to his assertion that \ntrade unions built up without assistance from the intelligentsia were \nbound to be amateurish, fragmented, localist affairs. Again the Webbs \ncould be cited against him. \nWhat Is To Be Done? and Letter to a Comrade, moreover, were \nmost evasive on a final matter raised by critics: how can it be ensured \nthat the central party apparatus does not run out of control by the \nparty? Ulyanov was concerned predominantly with the implementa-\ntion of hierarchical command. He had no scheme for formal demo-\ncratic accountability beyond the regular convocation of party con-\ngresses; this left the central apparatus with enormous latitude for \norganisational manipulation. It would be many years, not until the \ntime of his last illness, before he would consider such commentary as \nanything other than the mental meanderings of those who had fallen \nunder the spell of 'bourgeois' sociologists' . \nTHE RUSSIAN POLITICAL ARENA \nIskra's editors aimed to rally support among Russian social-democrats \nand convoke a Second Party Congress; their intention was to get their \nstrategy accepted as that of the party as a whole. Thus they would \nentrench themselves as party leaders. Thus, too, they expected to head \nthe Russian revolutionary movement in its entirety. For Marxism had \nheld sway over oppositionist thinking and activity in the s. The \nnarodnik terrorists were disunited and ineffective; their agrarian \nsocialist rivals who concentrated upon mass propaganda made little \nheadway among peasants and workers. Meanwhile the liberals \nappeared as endless talkers. Social-democratic activists formed the \nmost effective clandestine groups; even the catastrophe of , when \nthe police rounded up five hundred undergrounders, was a sign of the \nMarxist movement's gathering strength. No other political trend \npossessed so large a network of leaders. Marxist theory had also made \na mark on the legal press. Books on Russian historical development \nwere available in the shops of major cities. And the clandestine \nprinting-presses made increasing quantities of political material \navailable to activists and sympathisers. Their pre-eminence in the \ncamp of the forces of opposition to the monarchy seemed unchallenge-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nable; and it corroborated their belief that the 'vanguard' class in the \ndemocratic revolution was bound to be neither the middle class nor the \npeasantry but the factory workers. \nThis complacency was shattered at the turn of the century. The \nliberals moved towards forming a party. Their spokesman was Struve. \nBy  he was talking wholly negatively about Marxism. Ulyanov \nwas surprised by his truculence. They met in Munich. The purpose of \ntheir discussions, which continued until mid-February , was to \ncement their earlier agreement over joint publishing activity. A \nlate-night session in December  finally convinced Ulyanov that he \nwould have to trim his demands; but, even so, he wanted to avoid loss \nofface: he made sure that Struve saw him laughing dismissively as they \nparted. Neither Ulyanov nor Struve divulged whether they made a \nfinancial settlement. Nonetheless Struve now regarded liberalism as an \nindependent movement in clandestine Russian politics. In  he \nfounded his journal Liberation. Its campaign for constitutional change \nwas to do much to swing sections of the industrial bourgeoisie and the \nprofessions into a posture hostile to the autocracy. \nThe Iskra editors were still more worried by the emergence of \nanother political grouping. Agrarian socialism was again attracting \nsupport; its intellectual troubles in the late s and early s, \nwhen all its vivacity seemed to have been bequeathed to Russian \nMarxism, had not really been death-throes. In  the new leaders \nestablished the Party Of Socialist-Revolutionaries. The outstanding \ntheorist and organiser was Viktor Mikhailovich Chernov. His ideas \nhearkened back to the narodniki. He refused to accept the argument of \nRussian social-democrats that the peasantry and the factory workers in \nRussia could be categorised as distinct classes of the population. \nSocialist-revolutionaries treated them together as 'the toiling people'. \nUnlike the narodniki of the s, Chernov recognised that capitalist \neconomic development was practicable in Russia. In fact he accepted \nthat capitalism would and should exist for several more years; and he \nrefrained from calling for the immediate introduction of socialism after \nthe fall of the autocracy. The next stage in the country's political \ndevelopment would be a democratic republic. Even so, the socialist-\nrevolutionaries intended to press for the 'socialisation of the land' \nwithout delay. Landed property would thereby be abolished. Agricul-\ntural soil would not be nationalised but transferred into 'the possession \nof the entire people'. This would not be socialism; the land would be \ndivided up among those working on it but they would continue to \nproduce for private profit. Chernov anticipated a lengthy epoch of \n Straightening Sticks \n \npropaganda before Russia would move from the 'bourgeois' to the \n'socialist' phase. \nNot all his comrades agreed with him. A grouping which became \nknown as the Maximalists wanted to instal a socialist government as \nthe immediate successor to the Romanovs. They were less sceptical \nthan Chernov about the rapid acceptability of socialist ideas to the \nRussian peasantry. They also re-introduced political terrorism. Both \nfactions looked to the workers as well as the peasants for potential \nrecruits. \nIskra rejected Chernov's projects as being unscientific. All that \nUlyanov would say in favour of the socialist-revolutionaries was that \nthey did at least recognise that social differentiation was presently \noccurring in the village commune; he scorned their notion that \ngovernmental action could halt the process. Agrarian capitalism was \ninevitable. So that, although Chernov's populism moved even closer to \nRussian Marxism than Aleksandr Ulyanov's had done, a gap still \nremained. Iskra, however, worried about the attractiveness that \nslogans like 'land and freedom' might have for urban workers. The \nParty of Socialist-Revolutionaries might snatch hegemony of the \nrevolutionary forces. Young intellectuals in the Volga region were \nbeginning to rally to Chernov's ideas, impressed as they were by the \nrecrudescence of peasant turbulence after the quiescence of the \ns. In the Economist controversy, Iskra had been fighting \nheretics. The socialist-revolutionaries could be a more potent enemy: \nthey were infidels. They inserted a dangerous element of sUbjectivism \nand diffuseness into debates among revolutionaries. Indeed the \ninternal life of the Russian Marxist movement itself already gave cause \nfor concern. L. Nadezhdin, after emigrating to Switzerland, had \nformed a group called Freedom; he made his call for an immediate \nterrorist campaign ever more forcefully. Iskra had begun life fighting a \n'right-wing' foe, which it dubbed Economism. From mid- it was \nstruggling on two fronts inside the party. The vehemence and \nfrequency of its articles against Freedom show just how seriously the \n'left-wing' threat was regarded. \nUlyanov came to the fore as the implacable harrier of heretic and \ninfidel. In March  the security of Iskra's typesetting facilities in \nMunich could no longer be guaranteed, and the editorial board by a \nmajority vote (with Plekhanov and Akselrod constituting the minor-\nity) decided to move premises to London. Ulyanov's influence was \nincreasing. This was partly the result of the low level of literary \nproductivity of three of the six editors: Akselrod, Potresov and \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nZasulich. It also derived from his own superabundance of hard work \nand verve. His colleagues found him fastidious in life-style; Martov, \nPotresov and Zasulich set up their commune in the English capital, but \nnothing would induce him to become enveloped by what he saw as \ntheir bohemian muddle. Krupskaya emigrated in . She kept \nhouse for him, freeing him to study daily in the British Museum. He \nwas turning into an excellent administrator. He was industrious in \nkeeping tabs on the Russian underground; he and Krupskaya main-\ntained a voluminous correspondence by means of invisible inks and \nlaboriously-translated codes. He welcomed newcomers into emigra-\ntion, especially those like Lev Davydovich Trotski who could be asked \nto write for Iskra.  Ulyanov revelled in his position of primus inter \npares. \nAnd with such a team, Ulyanov was in a fine position to campaign to \nwin supporters in Russia; he saturated Iskra with the strategical and \norganisational concepts developed in What Is To Be Done? In a literal \nsense the book made his name. He had signed it with the pseudonym of \n'N. Lenin' (which he had first used in  in a letter to Plekhanov). \nThe book won him a fame among underground activists rivalled only \nby Plekhanov. Although he was to employ at least noms de guerre \nin his career, it was as Lenin that he ascended to general prestige \ninside the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party; his Iskra writings \nconsolidated a reputation already acquired as Marxist economic \ntheorist and Petersburg activist. Ulyanov-Lenin moved to establish a \ntightly cohesive party. His old underground friends served him well. \nMen like B. I. Gorev, P. A. Krasikov and V. P. Nogin were sent into \nRussia to campaign for Iskra.  They made extensive tours, outdoing \nrival newspapers in energy and resources. Police at the border became \nefficient at intercepting packages of Iskra; but more devious routes of \ntransport were found to expedite their arrival. The pugnacity of \nUlyanov-Lenin in Western Europe was emulated by his followers back \nin Russia. A Congress was to be called with all speed, and Iskra's \nsupporters were to ensure that provincial committees selected pro-\nIskra representatives. Ulyanov-Lenin was unrestrainedly militant: 'A \nfight perhaps causes irritation to a few persons, but thereby it clears the \nair; it defines relations directly and precisely; it defines which \ndisagreements are basic and which secondary, defines where there are \npeople taking a completely different road and where there are true \nparty comrades dissenting only about particularities.' \n Straightening Sticks \n \nTHE PARTY PROGRAMME \nIt worried Ulyanov-Lenin that the Iskra board had not yet drafted a \nparty programme; in  he pestered Plekhanov to undertake the \njob. Plekhanov was respected as the party's primary theoretician. \nUlyanov-Lenin was reluctant to make the first draft. Plekhanov, \nhowever, saw his own priority of the moment as being to crush Struve \nin philosophical debate. Only late in the year did he succumb to \nUlyanov-Lenin's badgerings. \nPlekhanov offered up his manuscript around New Year , and \nthe six editors of Iskra met on  January to discuss it.s Ulyanov-Lenin \nturned up with an armful of proposed corrections. The other four \nwatched in bemused horror as combat commenced. Plekhanov had \nalways played the schoolmaster in disparaging Vladimir Ilich's prose \nstyle. Revenge was now exacted. The master was corrected magisteri-\nally. Plekhanov was taken to task for implying that the proletariat \nconstituted a majority ofthe Russian population. Ulyanov-Lenin was \na harsh examiner. He laughed at Plekhanov's assumption that no \nconsumer goods were available to factory workers. Plekhanov's draft \nlacked punch. Why say 'discontent', asked Lenin, when you can say \n'indignation'? Months of contention followed, with Akselrod vainly \ncalling upon the protagonists to mitigate their comments about each \nother. Plekhanov was asked to compose a second draft, which he \ncompleted by March. Lenin was no less displeased. Plekhanov's \nproject was still repetitious and abstract; it was 'not the programme of \na practically fighting party but a Prinzipienerkliirung, it's more a \nprogramme for students'. Zasulich lost patience. She could not see \nwhy Lenin was so aggressive when Plekhanov, for once, was obviously \nnot averse to compromise. Lenin backed down. Even so, he continued \nto snipe at Plekhanov with remarks such as the following: 'I bow and \ngive thanks for this little step towards me' . No wonder that it was not \nuntil  June  that the agreed programme oftheIskra board could \nbe published. \nThe final version was close to Lenin's draft of ; the sections on \nfactory legislation were largely his creation, and the agrarian sections \ntoo bore his imprint.' Akselrod was content with the final product. \nEven Plekhanov was pleased. He teased Lenin over his inelegant use \nof brackets and punctuation marks, but the tensions eased between the \ntwo men in late ; both were willing to profess contentment with \nthe Iskra programme. The party was to struggle for the greatest \npossible extension of civic freedoms in the post-autocratic state. It \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould call for the universal suffrage, for an elective administration, for \na people's militia, for the secularisation of the state, and for the right of \nnational self-determination. Its social goals would include compulsory \nuniversal education and a state pension scheme. The party would press \nfor workers to obtain an eight-hour working day, more effective safety \nregulations, representation on arbitration tribunals, and the general \nopportunity to organise themselves in defence against employers; and \nfor peasants to be allowed to form their own local committees as well as \nto possess the 'cut-off strips'. Lenin and Plekhanov presented a \ncommon front. They anticipated the maturation of the Russian \ncapitalist economy under a bourgeois government constrained to \nconcede political and social reforms which would facilitate the \neventual coming to power of the social-democratic party. \nThe front was a triumph over personal jealousies. It also was \nachieved despite disagreements over questions of substance. \nPlekhanov's preamble stated that 'capitalism is becoming more and \nmore the dominant mode of production' in Russia. Lenin pressed that \ncapitalism was 'already the dominant' mode.  Plekhanov accepted the \namendment. As yet, in , no differences in practical policy were \nhinged upon the contrasting phrasings; it was only in , when Lenin \nbegan to call for the inception of the transition to socialism, that his \nhigher estimation of the level of Russian economic development came \nto obtain direct political significance. \nNo serious dissension was easily detectable in the discussion about \nthe methods to be employed when socialism was introduced. Broad \nconsensus existed. Both men expected that the social-democrats would \ntake power only after a period of 'bourgeois rule' (which would follow \nthe autocracy's overthrow). Both also characterised the transition to \nsocialism under the term of 'the dictatorship of the proletariat'. \nPlekhanov mentioned this in his first drafe When Lenin attacked his \noffering as being generally too 'noisy', Plekhanov substituted 'the \npolitical power' ofthe proletariat for 'dictatorship of the proletariat' . \nBut Lenin had in fact liked the original phrase, and encouraged its \nrestoration. He noted that this was in line with their common \ninterpretation of Marx's thinking. Initially Plekhanov resisted the \nrestoration; in his opinion there was no distinction between the two \nformulations under discussion since, as he proceeded to argue, 'in \npolitics he who holds power is the dictator' . But he saw no sense in \nfurther dispute and soon accepted Lenin's view. Plekhanov would \nnot foreswear the necessity of the working class to resort to force 'for \nthe defence of its own interests and for the suppression of all social \n Straightening Sticks \n \nmovements directly or indirectly threatening such interests'. Other \nclasses in the population would have no guarantees of democratic civic \nrights. Accordingly dictatorship, for both Lenin and Plekhanov, \nwould be a stern business; neither leader committed himself to the \nprinciple of universal suffrage. \nAgain, however, the Iskra board's visible accord was not devoid of \nhints of fundamental disharmonies in later years. These nuances were \npartly a matter of tactical differences. But they also impinged upon \nbasic political problems. Perhaps in  they were too obscure for the \npotential significance to be discerned. \nFirstly, Lenin was keener than Plekhanov to mention the party's \nsuspicions about the peasantry. Rural attitudes were a mixture of \nprogressive and reactionary qualities. The future socialist government, \ndeclared Lenin, should certainly attempt to persuade the peasants to \naccede to the abolition of private-enterprise practices. But it would be \nnecessary to 'use power' if persuasion failed; and therefore Lenin \ndeplored Plekhanov's lack of reference to the peasantry's 'conserva-\ntiveness' . Plekhanov made no objection. He had in any case, ever \nsince turning to Marxism, taken a dimmer view of the peasants than \nothers like Lenin. Only Zasulich on the Iskra board objected to the \nproposed deployment of power: 'On millions of people! Just try \nthen! .. .' A further problem indicated a more serious implicit divi-\nsion between Lenin and Plekhanov. It concerned mass terror. What is \nTo Be Done? contained a passage lauding the narodnik Tkachev's \nstandpoint on the subject as 'magnificent' . Plekhanov approved the \ndictatorship's right to turn to violence in the case of political resistance; \nbut he was not an enthusiast for terror: he never commended the \nexecution of persons, regardless of their actions or opinions, just \nbecause they happened to belong to a particular social class. Lenin's \napproach was far cruder. He did not specifically threaten to organise a \npost-revolutionary terror. But, to put it mildly, his position was hardly \ntypified by vehement opposition to such a policy; and his approval of \nthis kind of terror was to re-surface from time to time well before the \ngrim days of . \nIskra's leaders were anyway pre-occupied by the defence of their \nproposed programme from attack by other social-democrats. Dispute \nensued between Iskra and its rivals. There was agreement that Iskra's \nlegislative schema for the post-autocratic republic was mostly accept-\nable; everyone in the party welcomed the extensive political and social \nrights to be demanded for the workers. \nBut controversy attended other matters. Martynov was a prominent \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ncritic. For him, the social-democratic party should be a workers' party \naiming to represent the interests of the working class alone; its \nprogramme had no need for a section directed towards peasants. In \nany case, the party's general premise was that the overthrow of the \nabsolute monarchy should lead to the removal of all remnants of feudal \npractice inhibiting capitalist economic development. Martynov asked \nhow this would be assisted by the mere grant of the 'cut-off strips' to \nthe peasantry. The assistance would be trivia. P. P. Maslov, Lenin's \nold adversary in agrarian questions, pursued the point. He asked what \nwas to stop Iskra's peasant committees from seizing not only the \n'cut-off strips' but the entire land. Maslov, unlike Martynov, recog-\nnised the party's need for an agrarian policy. His own proposals went \nfurther than Lenin's. He wanted the large gentry-owned latifundia to \nbe transferred to local governmental agencies after the monarchy's \noverthrow. Lenin's replies were caustic. He re-stated, answering \nMartynov, that the peasantry was doomed as a social class; and that it \nwas 'tailism' to sit back and let the bourgeoisie dominate agrarian \nreform. He was less persuasive in retort to Maslov. He re-affirmed, \nbluntly and without further argumentation, that the implementation of \nhis own ideas would deliver a deathblow to feudalism in Russian \nagriculture. He also repeated his attitude to governmental ownership \nof land after the forthcoming revolution. His position was exactly as it \nhad been when he had opposed L. Nadezhdin's demand for national-\nisation as dangerously premature. He announced his abhorrence of \n'idiotic experiments in state socialism' . \nPractical policies were not the only source of dissension from Iskra's \nprogramme. General theory was involved. Neither Martynov nor \nAkimov accepted the down-playing of the workers' capacity for \npolitical self-development, and they harrassed Plekhanov as fiercely as \nthey had Lenin over What Is To Be Done? Martynov let the matter \nrest at that. Not so Akimov: he was disturbed by other breaks with \nthe conventional European understanding of Marxism which were \nmade by Iskra; he especially objected to the demand for a proletarian \ndictatorship. \nTHE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS \nRussian social-democracy was riven by divisions over nearly every \nbasic problem of revolution in . Terrorism, peasants, organisa-\n Straightening Sticks \n \ntion, workers, historical stages: all these vexed questions coiled around \neach other to produce an entanglement of programmatic uncertainty. \nThe Iskra leaders strove, by means of the forthcoming Party \nCongress, to shape and fix official social-democratic opinion in their \nmould. The organisational controls were to be in their hands. The \nCongress's outcome would be affected by the composition of the \ndelegations. Iskra's plans were nearly frustrated in March . \nSocial-democratic leaders back in Russia, notably those belonging to \nSouthern Worker's editorial board and to the Bund, joined with the \nLeague Of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad to convoke a meeting in \nBialystok. Iskra dispatched Fedor Dan. The meeting elected a \nthree-person Organisational Committee to arrange a Congress. Dan \nwas one of the three; his presence would ensure that Iskra was not left \nuninvolved. Most attenders, however, were quickly arrested. Dan was \namong the victims. The sole member of the Organisational Committee \nremaining at liberty was K. Portnoi, a Bundist and Iskra's enemy. \nLenin had to resume the initiative quickly. He encouraged measures to \ncall a further meeting in Pskov in November. Portnoi was persuaded to \nattend; and thus the Pskov sessions had some form of descent from the \nearlier meeting in Bialystok. An Organisational Committee was again \nchosen, this time with Iskra's supporters in command. A further series \nof arrests weakened Iskra's position in the winter of -; but \nthe determination of the agents on tour in Russia bore fruit. Party \ncommittees in Nizhni Novgorod, Saratov and Rostov announced \nloyalty to the theoretical and organisational principles of Iskra. Such \nvictories were not always permanent; opponents were able in places \nlike Ekaterinoslav to stir up worker members against the Iskra agents' \ncontempt for elective practices. But the campaign was going Iskra's \nway in spring . And the Organisational Committee used its \nauthority, in cases of dispute among local social-democrats, to validate \nthe mandate of the faction siding with Iskra.  \nThe Second Congress itself began on  July . The first venue \nwas Brussels; but the attention of the Belgian police was aroused, and \nthe Congress adjourned to London. Two days were consumed by \nexchanges about the Organisational Committee. The Bundists com-\nplained that their groups, which united tens of thousands of party \nmembers, were granted only five voting places at the Congress while \ntiny groups in central Russia had received a place apiece!OO The critics' \ntarget was Lenin. But Plekhanov exonerated his colleague: 'Napoleon \nhad a passion for making his marshals divorce their wives: some gave in \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nto him in the matter even though they loved their wives. Comrade \nAkimov is like Napoleon in this respect - he desires at any cost to \ndivorce me from Lenin.'lol And the Congress, with its built-in Iskra \nmajority, sanctioned the Organisational Committee's actions.  \nThe question of the Bund came next on the agenda. Bundist leader \nM. I. Liber put the case that the Jewish population of the empire \nconfronted special problems, not least the pogroms; and that the \nBund should therefore be granted broad organisational autonomy \ninside the party. Martov and Trotski, Jews themselves, opposed. \nPassions ran high. Yet the resultant voting had never been in doubt: \nthe Bund's proposal was rejected by forty six delegates against five. l \nThe Congress turned to decide the party programme. Lenin, already \npleased by the Bund discussion, took as prominent a role in debate as \nPlekhanov. Iskra's project was taken as the basis for discussion.l \nMartynov headed the critics, assailing Iskra's editors for implying that \nworkers could not come to socialism without the guidance of middle-\nclass intellectuals. Lenin admitted to exaggerations: 'We all know now \nthat the Economists bent the stick in one direction. In order to \nstraighten the stick it was necessary to bend it over in the other \ndirection, and that is what I did.' Plekhanov backed Lenin. He \ndefended, too, the reference to the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'. \nAfter the socialist takeover of power in the distant future, Plekhanov \nargued, a social-democratic government might well not immediately \nfeel safe to submit itselfto electoral competition at regular intervals. lOG \nThe Congress accepted the general analysis afforded by the Iskra \nboard. \nThe delegates then considered the programme's specific policies. \nThe section on factory legislation was greeted with acclaim. The \nagrarian section was less warmly received. Seven speakers criticised it, \nand only Trotski spoke in Lenin's favour. l Most critics harried Lenin \nfor offering too little to the peasantry: an interesting occurrence in \nview of attacks on him for being a crypto-populist. But Lenin's \nsuggestions were accepted by a thumping majority. The Iskra project, \nwith few amendments, became the official party programme. lOB \nThe travails of Congress were just beginning. Its commission \ndrafting the party rules was at odds; the Iskra team itself was divided. \nMartov disliked Lenin's proposal on the conditions of party member-\nship. He took Potresov and Trotski with him. Lenin wanted to define a \nparty member as someone 'who recognises the party programme and \nsupports it by material means and by personal participation in one of \nthe party's organisations' . Martov's formulation ran slightly dif-\n Straightening Sticks \n \nferently. His member would be someone 'who recognises the party \nprogramme and supports it by material means and by regular personal \nassistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations';llo \nand Martov recommended his own definition as being less \nauthoritarian and exclusive than Lenin's. The precise literal contrast is \nelusive. So much so that many would attribute the disputes to \nvapourisings induced by the over-heated expatriate political atmo-\nsphere. But there was also a fundamental issue at stake; Lenin and \nMartov each knew what the other meant in broad terms. Martov \nwanted a slightly more 'open' party than Lenin. His current priority \nwas to maximise the recruitment of factory workers to the party, \nwhereas Lenin's was to take precautions against infiltration by persons \nwith no intention of active participation in party life. The Congress \ndecided in Martov's favour. Twenty eight 'softs' took his line while \nLenin could muster only twenty two 'hards'. \nThe split in Iskra's ranks lasted the rest of the Congress. Lenin \nproposed a tripartite structure for the supreme party apparatus. The \ncentral newspaper, Iskra, would be based abroad and produced by \nthree editors. The Central Committee, which was to supply organisa-\ntional guidance to local committees, would be a three-person team \nlocated in Russia. Co-ordination between Iskra and the Central \nCommittee would be ensured by a Party Council with five members -\ntwo to come from Iskra, two from the Central Committee and one to \nbe elected directly by Congress. l \nMartov found the proposal anything but innocuous. A three-person \neditorial board could only mean the removal of Akselrod, Potresov \nand Zasulich. Plekhanov and Lenin would lord it over Iskra. Martov's \nspeech caused a surprise, since he had assented to Lenin's proposal \nbefore the opening of the Congress.ll Angry exchanges occurred. \nOutside the hall there was trouble when A. V. Shotman threatened to \nbeat up an Iskra 'hard' who had gone over to the 'softs'. Lenin raced \nout to tug back Shot man with the admonition that 'only fools use their \nfists in polemics' . Non-violent dirty tricks, however, were not ruled \nout. Lenin's supporter S. I. Gusev circulated a forged list purporting to \ncontain Martov's nominees for the central party apparatus; it included, \nas a ploy to discredit Martov, several advocates of the 'Economistic' \nideas already condemned by the entire Iskra faction.us Lenin strove to \nweld the 'hards' together. He made the rounds of the delegates, \nascertaining their political stance and jotting them down as either \n'hards' or 'softs' in his notebook. A meeting of 'hards' was held on  \nAugust. Still Martov did not despair of restoring harmony. There were \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany issues which saw both groupings inside Iskra united. In particular \nit was their common wish that the party should be centralised, \ndisciplined and clandestine; the 'softs' felt no less strongly than the \n'hards' that Russian political conditions disallowed the formation of an \nopen mass party on the model of German social-democrats. But \nPlekhanov and Lenin would not compromise. In order to keep their \nsupporters' loyalty in quarantine they denied the floor to Martov at \ntheir grouping's session.llS \nThe Congress sanctioned Lenin's tripartite central structure. \nPlekhanov and Lenin thereupon had a stroke of luck. The Bundists \nwalked out on  August, affronted by their treatment by the Congress. \nThese would certainly have sided with Martov. In the event, the Iskra \nballot gave places to Plekhanov, Lenin and Martov.  Martov declined \nto serve as the solitary 'soft'. His supporters knew that the battle was \nlost for the Central Committee, and they refused to cast votes. The \n'hards' coasted home. The Central Committee was to consist of G. M. \nKrzhizhanovski, F. V. Lengnik and V. A. Noskov. Plekhanov's own \nposition was reinforced by his simultaneous election as the Congress's \nrepresentative on the Party Council.l \nEven now the marathon was not ended. On  August the delegates \ndiscussed the party's attitude to other anti-autocratic political groups. \nThis was the Cinderella debate of the Congress. The earlier disputes \ncould not quickly be erased from the memory. Even Lenin was \nexhausted. Yet this last question required some answers: how close \ncould social-democrats draw to the political parties of the middle class? \nPotresov's proposal allowed for temporary alliances, so long as they \ndid not harm 'the interests of the working class'. The Plekhanov-Lenin \naxis found this phrasing too bland. Plekhanov's counter-proposal, \nwhile permitting 'support' for other anti-autocratic groups, required \nthe party nevertheless to 'unmask before the proletariat the limited \nand inadequate nature of the bourgeois liberation movement'. \nPlekhanov desired a campaign against Struve. Martov, Akselrod and \nTrotski stood by Potresov. Lenin stood by Plekhanov. The Congress \nhad already lasted over three weeks, and time and funds and patience \nwere running out. Discussion was terminated. The Congress opted to \napprove both projects and to turn a blind eye to the discrepancies \nbetween them. It was the peace-making of fatigue. Disagreements \nabout attitudes to the liberals would soon in fact acquire even greater \nimportance than those about organisation. Potresov and his fellow \n'softs' were developing a sturdier belief in the possibilities of co-\n Straightening Sticks \n \noperation with Struve's adherents; the 'hards' offered an ever more \ndismal judgement upon the liberals as allied. The embryonic growth of \ntwo separate Marxist parties for Russia had begun. \n",
    "1905-1909": "   Sturm und Drang \nBLOODY SUNDAY \nYet it was not only expatriate social-democrats like Lenin who were \ncaught unprepared by the political storms of . All parties in \nRussia and in the emigration were astounded. Nor did the government \nitself, despite its hundreds of police informants, show any greater \nprescience. The events in Paris in  prove that unanticipated \ngeneral conturbations may shake even countries enjoying universal \nadult suffrage. But the problem of unpredictability is greater in \nundemocratic states. The suppression of civil liberties makes popular \nopinion difficult to gauge; and the absence of other outlets of political \nactivity renders it likely that opposition, when it eventually reaches the \nstreets, will take the most violent forms. \nSo it was in Russia on  January . Georgi Gapon had arranged \nfor an unarmed procession of workers to make its way to the Winter \nPalace in St. Petersburg. The marchers carried a petition calling for the \ntransfer of agricultural land to the people, for the instant cancellation \nof redemption payments and for the legalisation of independent trade \nunions. They wanted the emperor to grant popular representation in \ngovernment. Nikolai II disdained to receive the petition. Despite fears \nabout a forcible dispersal of the march, Gapon refused to alter his \nplans. l The Putilov strike had not been settled and, by early January, \nthe work-force of other factories also were engaging in industrial \nconflict.   employees were striking. The demonstration itself \nattracted a crowd of   men and women. Cossack troops were \nordered to charge into them. Still Gapon urged his followers onward. \nDisorder ensued. Upon arrival at the Winter Palace, the demon-\nstrators were fired upon. Hundreds of unarmed civilians, gathered \nunder the banners of Tsar and Church, fell killed or grievously \nwounded.  Thus ended Bloody Sunday. The brutality of the authorities \nwas notorious in the Russian empire; and yet until  January  the \npopulation had generally absolved the monarchy of direct responsi-\nbility. The killings dispelled illusion. Emperor Nikolai II had rejected \nhis people's loyal petition. \n \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \nMilitary violence neither broke the Putilov strike nor restored calm \nto the capital. Nikolai II met a delegation of St. Petersburg workers; \nand on  January he appointed a commission under N. V. Shidlovski \nto determine the causes of unrest. A concession was made to workers. \nThey were permitted to elect representatives to contribute to the \ncommission's investigation. Social-democrats competed in the elec-\ntions with reluctance: they felt that the commission would steer the \nworkers away from making political demands. Nonetheless compete \nthey did. And, though securing only a fifth of the votes, they were \nbeginning to make up the lost ground of . Throughout the empire \nthere were strikes in sympathy with the victims of Bloody Sunday. \nMoscow and other cities in central Russia witnessed demonstrations; \nand clashes between urban crowds and the authorities took place in \nPoland and Latvia.s The growing turbulence stiffened the resolve of \nthe Petersburg workers to elicit wage rises and the freedom to organise \nunions. More strikes broke out. This intransigence made Shidlovski's \nstrictly-circumscribed job impossible; the commission was aborted. \nOn  February, the emperor instructed his new Minister of Internal \nAffairs, A. D. Bulygin, to announce the intention of calling 'worthy \nrepresentatives of the people to participate in the preliminary con-\nsideration and elaboration of proposed laws'. Simultaneously the \nemperor asked for support for the autocracy. \nEvents in Russia had their own momentum; the situation changed so \nfast that no emigre leader, not even an epistolary zealot such as Lenin, \ncould provide detailed advice to committees at home. The strikes \ntailed off in March. But the Russian army had suffered another defeat \nin late February at Mukden; and it was the navy's turn three months \nlater: the Baltic fleet was annihilated in the Tsushima Straits. As \nbefore, military reverses increased the government's unpopularity. \nIn May ,   industrial workers were involved in strikes. \nLabour unrest was severe in Ivanovo-Voznesensk.   textile \nworkers downed tools on  May and formed their own Assembly of \nPlenipotentiaries. Their expressed grievances were mainly economic. \nThey wanted an eight-hour working day and a guaranteed minimum \nwage. The Assembly demanded the right to negotiate on behalf of all \nworkers in Ivanovo's factories; it called upon the authorities to legalise \nstrikes. But the Assembly was not only a strike committee. It assumed \nresponsibility for keeping civil order on the streets. Thus it marked a \nstage on the road towards the elective, administrative bodies created \nby St. Petersburg workers in autumn  and given the name of \n'soviets' (or 'councils'). Social-democrats, mostly Bolsheviks, led the \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nIvanovo Assembly. Elsewhere they were often unenthusiastic about \nleading strikes, on the grounds that workers should be dissuaded from \n'economistic' ambitions. But industrial conflict was pulling an increas-\ning number of social-democrats, both Mensheviks and Bolsheviks, into \nthe fray despite such inhibitions. The summer of  witnessed \nfurther strikes and demonstrations in Tver, Lodz and Nizhni Nov-\ngorod. Cossacks re-imposed control; the employers made only slight \nconcessions. Yet the government was deeply worried by the persistent \nchallenges to the status quo. \nLenin had for years been preaching a fire sermon against tsarism; \nand his cursing of the government had been equalled in ferocity only by \nhis blackguarding of those revolutionaries who seemed to him to lack \nthe fullness of his own resolve to pull down the entire autocratic order. \nIt surprised no one in the first half of  that his pronouncements in \nthese months were shot through with Sturm und Drang. \nThe rebellious mood of the industrial worker was shared by the \npeasant. Seventeen rural disturbances were reported in January ; \nthe number rose to  by June.lO Illegal felling of timber and illegal \nuse of pastures occurred widely. Rent strikes were frequent; and \npeasants working as wage labourers on the latifundia struck for better \npay and conditions. The socialist-revolutionaries struggled to consoli-\ndate their network of party groups in the rural areas; but, as in the \ntowns, the population required little goading from political parties \nbefore taking action in each locality. Liberals and socialist-\nrevolutionaries vied to put the peasant movement on a national basis. \nThe result was the founding Congress of the All-Russian Peasant \nUnion, held in July and attended by elected delegates from most \nprovinces in European Russia. The Congress called for the transfer of \nall agricultural land to the peasantry.l The liberals were also active in \nthe formation of unions inside the middle-class professions; and in \nMay  they combined them in a Union Of Unions. Whatever \nproposals came out of Bulygin's constitutional enquiries, the liberals \nintended to exert continued pressure upon the government. Even in \nthe armed forces, discontent grew; ministers distrusted the loyalty of \nRussian soldiers in the Far East. Trouble erupted in the Black Sea \nFleet. The crew of the battleship Prince Potemkin went to the full \nlength of a mutiny. \nThe autocracy was in crisis. Those sections of the population which \ncalled for the overthrow of the monarchy still constituted a minority; \nyet the emperor perceived that this phenomenon might not be \nlong-lasting. Revolution seemed imminent. \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \nLENIN IS THWARTED \nThe salient facts of Russia's tumult were quickly transmitted to \nrevolutionaries in Switzerland. Lunacharski learnt of the Winter \nPalace massacre on  January. He and his wife hurried off to inform \nLenin and Krupskaya. All then hastened to the centre of social-\ndemocratic life in the city, Lepeshinski's eating-house. \nThe tables were crowded, the mood exultant. To many in that \nrestaurant it appeared that the party's bickerings were a bizarre \nepisode now best forgotten. But not to Lenin. From the last fortnight \nof  he had been calling for a complete organisational split between \nsupporters and opponents of the Bureau Of The Committees Of the \nMajority; and, to widespread consternation, Bloody Sunday induced \nno change in his position. Krupskaya, writing on his behalf to \nBogdanov on  December, had mentioned 'the total split' as if it were \na fait accompli.  This reflected Lenin's wishes, not organisational \nactuality. His Vpered first-issue editorial on  December demanded a \nseverance of 'all relations' with the Mensheviks; and, in case his \nmessage might not have been clear enough, six days later he dispatched \na staccatoed summons to Bogdanov: 'Now a complete split, for we \nhave exhausted all means. A Third Congress against the will of the \nCentral Committee and the Council and without them. A complete \nbreak with the Central Committee. A direct declaration that we have \nour own Bureau. The complete removal of Mensheviks and supporters \nof the new Iskra from all places.' The Central Committee and Iskra, \nhe announced to Bolshevik comrades in Zurich on  January , \nhad forfeited their claim to legitimate authority; by their own actions \nthey had 'placed themselves outside the party'. The recurrent images \nhad a medical quality. 'We also felt ourselves far better,' he affirmed, \n'when we broke with the Minority.' \nThe recipients of his correspondence found no detailed explanation \nof his switching of tactics; he apparently assumed that Iskra's recent \narticles left the Bolsheviks no choice. It was a reckless assumption. \nEven before December , when he first demanded scission, he \nhad encountered resistance inside the Bureau Of Committees Of The \nMajority to his tactical proposals. He had pushed for the breaking of \nthe regulations governing the calling of a Party Congress. He simply \nwanted a Congress called, and did not care how it was done.s \nZemlyachka opposed him. She had always contended that such an \ninfringement would bring the Bolsheviks into unnecessarily bad \nodour; and the Bureau agreed with her. The Bureau would not \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nconvoke the Congress until the Central Committee had definitely \nrefused to do so. Lenin pooh-poohed such feelings as formalism. \nZemlyachka accused Lenin of having lost touch with Bolshevik \nopinion in Russia. Lenin was enraged. His mood was not improved in \nNovember  when he heard rumours that the Central Committee \nmight indeed agree to a Congress. The thought of Noskov was quite \nodious to him. Convinced that he had been improperly treated in \nsummer , Lenin had broken off personal relations with Noskov. \nIt would be difficult for Lenin to dominate the central party apparatus if \nNoskov returned to the scene. Noskov's Bolshevik Conciliators would \ninsist that Mensheviks be allowed to be elected as Congress delegates.In \nlate  the Mensheviks were increasing their strength in many \ncommittees in Russ!a. To Lenin's way of thinking, Menshevism was a \ncancer in the body pf the party: it had to be cut out immediately. \nLenin's one-mad proclamation of the parting of the ways was saluted \nby a number of Bolsheviks in Geneva and Zurich. It obtained paltry \nfavour in Russia. Zemlyachka stuck to the tactic of presenting an \nultimatum to the Central Committee; and Bogdanov pointed to the \never firmer evidence that the Central Committee would indeed \nconvoke a Congress. Even Gusev, who until then had mirrored Lenin's \nideas, thought it wise to make an agreement with the Central \nCommittee about joint actions in St. Petersburg in December . \nThe Winter Palace massacre reinforced this mood. The Bureau \ninstructed Gusev to explain to Lenin that the policy of following the \nconstitutional procedures for calling a Congress must stand.  Lenin \nreplied on  January . It horrified him that the Iskra group would \nbe invited to the Party Congress. He now despised his own associates. \nNine tenths of them, he raged, were 'pitiful formalists'; and he added: \n'I'd hand the lot of them over to Martov.' Second thoughts prevailed. \nHe cut out the more offensive phrases before Krupskaya encoded the \nletter. Yet his essential position was unchanged: 'Either by truly iron \ndiscipline, we bind together all who want to wage war, and through this \nsmall but strong party we will smash the crumbling monster of the \nill-assorted elements of the new Iskra; or else we will prove by our \nbehaviour that we deserve to perish as contemptible formalists.' This \nwas wartime, Lenin declared. Half-heartedness and pessimism were \ndangerous to the party's interest; Lenin urged that social-democrats \nspreading despondency should be 'shot on the spot'.  The war \nreferred to by Lenin was not the military conflict in the Far East but \nrather the struggle among social-democrats; and the Bureau members \nrepudiated his metaphors as counter-productive rhetoric. \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \nOn  February, furthermore, the Central Committee finally met to \ndiscuss the proposal for a Third Party Congress. The police had been \nalerted. They burst indoors to arrest the seven members of the Central \nCommittee who were present. Among them was Noskov. But two \nmembers evaded capture: L. B. Krasin and A. I. Lyubimov. These by \nnow eagerly desired a Congress. Negotiations between the Bureau \nand themselves produced an agreement, on  March, to form a joint \nOrganisational Committee. The request for a Congress was to be \nrelayed to the Party Council. If the Party Council rejected it, the \nOrganisational Committee was to proceed independently. Lenin \nwould at last get his Congress. And yet he scarcely derived satisfaction \nfrom these events: he resented the Bureau's rejection of his tactics; \nand he can hardly have been pleased not to be asked to join the \nOrganisational Committee. His editorials continued to be less than \nconciliatory to the Central Committee. \nBut he accepted the agreement; the alternative was political suicide. \nNot for the last time, his colleagues wrongly inferred that they had put \nan end to Lenin's disruptions. No good word was offered for his \norganisational divisiveness. And yet we cannot leave the matter at \nthat. It must also be noted that he did not regard his machinations as an \nend in themselves. He genuinely believed, in so far as his inner \ncalculations may be assessed, that Menshevik strategy as it was \nevolving in the winter of -- constituted a menace to the prospects \nof successful revolution; he was therefore equally intent upon breaking \nwith any Bolsheviks like Noskov who refused to engage in uncondi-\ntional struggle with the Menshevik leaders. The point to be made is not \nthat Lenin was being fundamentally insincere. Rather it is that his \njudgement, affected as it was by the prickles and jabs of a year's \npolemics, had played him false. He failed to perceive the harm he \nmight be doing to the chances of amicable co-operation among \nBolsheviks of all shades; and this was all the more regrettable a failure \nsince he himself recognised that revolution was impossible without a \nlarge corps of experienced, militant activists. He also made it harder \nfor Mensheviks to come over to the Bolshevik side. Factional \nadherences were always fluid. Lenin's intemperate mode of behaviour \nharmed his own cause. His activity had made him a less effective \npursuer of his faction's strategic goals than he could have been. Only \nmuch later in the year, towards autumn, would he show that he \neventually made a similar assessment. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \n'TWO TACTICS OF SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY IN THE \nDEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION' \nEvidence for the authenticity of his belief in the imminence of \nrevolutionary upheaval is found in his theoretical writings. He \ncomposed a series of articles for Vpered from February to May , \nand by June he was ready to sum up his considerations in a treatise. \nTwo months' further work led to the completion of Two Tactics of \nSocial-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution. It was his most \nimportant book since What Is To Be Done? He had it quickly published \nand transported clandestinely to Russia; and the rapid approval of its \nstrategical outline by virtually every Bolshevik demonstrates his \ncontinuing popularity as a theorist even at a time when his prestige as a \npractical leader was entering a partial eclipse. \nIn his Vpered editorials and in Two Tactics, he announced it as the \nparty's supreme, urgent task to organise armed insurrection. Since \n he had called for the preparation of measures to bring about the \nautocracy's demise. Bloody Sunday, he argued, marked the finish of \nthe preparatory stage. The moment for revolt was approaching. He \nacknowledged that Martov, Plekhanov and Akselrod accepted the \nneed for violence after Bloody Sunday; but he objected to the \nassumption, which surfaced from time to time in Iskra, that the \nrevolution could simply be 'unleashed' . No, said Lenin: the uprising \nhad to be planned and co-ordinated from above by the social-\ndemocratic party central leadership. Revolutions required organisa-\ntion. Naturally too, he maintained, success could not be achieved \nunless the insurrection had the support and participation of industrial \nworkers. In addition, agitators should be sent into the army and the \ncountryside. Soldiers and peasants should be dissuaded from allowing \nthemselves to be used as counterrevolutionary forces; the party should \naim to create a ubiquitous condition of insurgency. Tsardom should be \nconfronted by 'the people in arms' . No matter what concessions \nmight be introduced by Nikolai II's government, popular uprising \nshould remain the objective. Social-democrats should co-operate with \nall political parties seeking a democratic revolution; but it had to be \nanticipated that the liberals, as untrustworthy as ever, would grasp at \nany chance to cobble together a settlement with the monarchy. \nNothing short of revolt would therefore suffice. \nAs soon as published, Lenin's words attracted a familiar accusation: \npopulism! His scenario appeared to Mensheviks as further indication \nof his fondness for a conspiratorial elite acting in the name of the \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \npeople and yet not caring about the people's own aspirations.s Lenin's \nreply was caustic. He enquired whether the Iskra editors thought that a \nrevolution could happen by spontaneous self-generation. \nThe Vpered and Iskra standpoints on the organisation of insurrec-\ntion came closer together in the rest of . As this gap narrowed, \nanother widened. Social-democrats, feeling that the regime's last days \nmight be at hand, started to deliberate about their policies towards the \npost-autocratic government. Lev Trotski quickly formulated his \nproposal. We should lead the uprising, he said, and we ourselves \nshould constitute the new central administration. The party should \nestablish a 'workers' government' . The idea had been suggested to \nTrotski by Alexander Parvus. It was Parvus who composed the preface \nto Trotski's pamphlet on Bloody Sunday (which was published in \nFebruary). Parvus contended that Russia's socio-political history \ndiverged from the route already taken by 'Western' countries such as \nBritain and Germany. He regarded Russian industrialisation as \nprimarily the product of the state's military exigencies; and, like the \nnineteenth-century narodniki, Parvus viewed Russian capitalism as \nalmost completely a governmentally-directed development. This con-\nsideration led Parvus and Trotski to a striking conclusion. The Russian \nbourgeoisie lacked not only the political will to destroy the autocracy \nbut also the social and economic power necessary for the governance \nof Russian society once the popular insurrection had occurred. It \nwould therefore fall to the Russian working class to carry out the \ndemocratic reforms vital to the reconstruction of state and society: \nworkers would carry through the democratic revolution. \nParvus and Trotski touched a raw nerve. Did not their plans \ncontradict the Russian Marxist prognostication that a socialist revolu-\ntion could occur in any country only after a lengthy epoch of \ngovernment by the bourgeoisie? Had not Engels warned against \npremature seizure of power? Was it not true that Russia's cultural and \neconomic level of development was too primitive to permit the \nimmediate transition to socialism? Parvus's answer was ready. He did \nnot expect his 'workers' government' to rule forever. Its task would be \nto lay the fundaments of a democratic state structure in Russia; and it \nwould eventually be pushed aside, through the ballot box, by the \npolitical parties of the bourgeoisie. Thus Parvus attempted to avoid the \ncharge of populism. Trotski's ideas veered away from his friend's at \nthis point. Instead he called for 'permanent revolution' . He scrapped \nthe timetable which prescribed separate epochs for the democratic and \nsocialist revolutions. Immediately he was accused of offering a \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ndisguised version of populism. His retort was twofold. Firstly, his \ngovernment would not try to introduce socialism overnight. It would \npreside over a period of capitalist economic development. Secondly, \nhe predicted that social-democrats would swiftly be ejected from \npower unless fraternal socialist revolutions occurred in the more \nmature industrial societies of Europe. His revolution would need \npolitical and economic support from abroad, or else it would perish. \nThe webs spun by Parvus and Trotski momentarily encoiled Lenin. \nAdmittedly, he made occasional criticisms. Yet he mounted no \nsustained barrage; he fired many more salvoes in  at Iskra than at \nTrotski. Sometimes he seemed to borrow Trotski's lexicon, using \nphrases such as 'uninterrupted revolution' . Lenin assured his follow-\ners: 'We shall not stop halfway.' But such comments occurred only \nfitfully in his Vpered output. He drafted two articles, entitled The \nPicture of the Provisional Revolutionary Government and Conditions, \nDirection and Prospects of Revolution, which offered his own version \nof Trotski's perspective. Both lay unpublished. Intellectual scruples \nconquered intuitive inclination. \nIn fact, Marx himself in  had used terminology remarkably like \nTrotski's; and he too had spoken against treating the bourgeois and \nsocialist revolutions as distinct phases.o Lenin exhibited no knowledge \nof this. Yet it is inconceivable that he could not have found some \nsupport in Marx's writings if he had really planned to draw still nearer \nto Trotski's position. Two Tactics remained his doctrinal summary in \nmid-. This fact alone shows how simplistic it is to represent him as \na mere maximalistic opportunist. The Russian Marxist notion of the \ntwo-stage transition to socialism was not yet jettisoned. Lenin \nnonetheless argued that socialists should constitute the first temporary \ngovernment after the absolute monarchy's removal. But he rebutted \nthe call for a 'workers' government'. Russia's population was still \noverwhelmingly rural. Lenin maintained that, if the revolutionary \npotentiality of the peasants was to be realised, their political \nrepresentatives had to obtain a share in power. Social-democrats might \nnot necessarily gain a monopoly of authority. Allying with the Party Of \nSocialist-Revolutionaries, they should aim to form a 'provisional \nrevolutionary government'. Such a coalition, even with social-\ndemocrats in the minority, would reconstruct the Russian state. It \nwould achieve the reforms demanded by the Russian Social Demo-\ncratic Labour Party. Opposition by the former ruling groups would be \nruthlessly smashed. Initially the middle and upper classes would be \nsubjected to a 'revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \nand the peasantry'; they would be deprived of political rights until such \ntime as the provisional government's democratic reforms seemed \ndurable enough to permit it to proceed with elections based on \nprinciples of universal adult suffrage. \nLenin emphasised that his provisional revolutionary government \nwould not be introducing socialism. In his opinion, indeed, the reforms \nwould foster the maturation of a capitalist economy. Russia was not yet \nripe for socialist revolution; and the socialist coalition presumably \nwould eventually lose power to other political parties as economic \nmodernisation was realised. The monarchy's destruction could not be \nimmediately followed by 'the dominion of the proletariat' . \nLenin's disclaimers, like Parvus's and Trotski's before him, did not \nconvince the Iskra group. Martynov was now his principal adversary. \nHe and the Mensheviks referred Lenin to the decision of the Second \nInternational, taken in , forbidding socialist parties to enter \ncoalition governments. Lenin had his reply to hand. The Second \nInternational's intention had been to prohibit socialists from forming \ncoalitions which would prop up a capitalist order in advanced \nindustrial countries. The Russian provisional revolutionary govern-\nment's task would be entirely different. It would involve the destruc-\ntion of feudalism. Lenin's enterprise had nothing in common with the \nentry of the French socialist leader Alexandre Millerand into a \ncoalitional ministry with 'bourgeois' politicians. Less easy to brush \naside was Martynov's further point. To the Mensheviks it mattered \nlittle that Lenin did not intend to decree instant socialism: Lenin's \nsubjective aims did not greatly bother them. They were concerned \nrather by the practical consequences likely to arise. Lenin's revolu-\ntionary dictatorship, unbridled by legal constraints, would quickly \nbecome oppressive. It would simply amplify the authoritarian charac-\nteristics of tsarism. According to Martynov, massive violence would \nhave to be meted out not only to the bourgeoisie but to the peasantry \ntoo. The rural population would not voluntarily accept Bolshevik \nagrarian policy; and immense discontent would occur if the socialist \ncoalition was determined to carry out its policies. Civil war would \nresult. \nLenin had hoped to pre-empt such criticisms by enlarging the \nenticements to the peasantry in the party programme. In , the \nSecond Party Congress had called for the return of the 'cut-off strips' to \npeasant households. In , Lenin observed the countryside'S \nferment. He recognised that his party's policy was unlikely to gather \nrural support when that of the socialist-revolutionaries demanded so \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nmuch more: the socialisation of the land. He urged his party to raise its \nbid. \nHe demanded that all agricultural soil owned by the gentry, the \naristocracy, the church and the royal family be expropriated. Property \nin land should be nationalised. And yet, far from reassuring the \nMensheviks, Lenin's proposals alarmed them. P. P. Maslov argued \nthat land nationalisation, even if undertaken originally by a socialist \ncoalition, would provide the upper classes with limitless latitude to \naugment even tsarist dimensions of oppression and exploitation if a \ncounterrevolution should take place. Lenin argued that he had been \nmisunderstood. Although he wanted the state to have rights of \nownership, he explained, it would be left to elected committees of the \npeasantry to distribute the land among those wishing to work on it and \nmake private profit from it. His further reasoning was not yet stated in \ndetail. But the broad intention was evident by implication: the rent \npayable to the state would be fixed at a low level; and sub-letting of \nland would be forbidden so as to prevent rent-racketeering. The \npeasant farmer would flourish as never before. No longer would he pay \ncripplingly high rents to the local landlord. The profitability of peasant \nagriculture would soar. Under such a regime, asked Lenin, where \nwould counterrevolutionaries get the necessary backing to form an \narmy to destroy the democratic institutions created by the provisional \nrevolutionary government? \nAs with so many other discussions inside the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party, the argument ultimately returned to the \nagrarian question. It is difficult to judge who was more right, Lenin or \nMaslov. The problem is beset by hypothetical considerations. The \npolitical framework envisaged by Lenin in  was destined never to \ncome into existence in precisely the shape described by him. The \nOctober Revolution of  gave rise to policies which differed \nimportantly from Lenin's earlier projections. But Soviet rural history \nstill offers clues for the adjudication of the Lenin-Maslov controversy. \nThe Bolshevik government encountered stiff resistance when it \nintervened directly and heavily in the operations of the peasant \neconomy: the New Economic Policy of  was a recognition by the \ngovernment that the peasants were intent upon ordering their \neconomic life as they saw fit. Lenin's writings in  overestimated \nthe Russian peasantry's predisposition to welcome policies designed to \neffect rapid modernisation of agriculture. Maslov, moreover, was \ncorrect in saying that a government insistent on steeply increasing the \npace would have to resort to force. On the other hand, Lenin's \n 'Sturm und Drang' \nl \nperformance as Soviet premier demonstrated his acumen in adjusting \npolicy to circumstances. Probably his proposals of , if modified so \nas to avoid peasant revolts, provided greater chance of success in \nstimulating change than Maslov's. Central governmental interven-\ntion, as the experience of countries in Africa and Asia as well as the \nEuropean Economic Community shows, lends important assistance to \nagricultural development. \nTHE THIRD PARTY CONGRESS \nThe disputes of  covered vast canvasses, and the projects of the \ntheorists were still rudimentary sketches. The war against the monar-\nchy was yet to be won. Obviously the Third Party Congress would lack \nthe time to give a ruling on every single question in the air; but it would \nat least be able to adumbrate plans of immediate practical moment. \nThe arrangements for the Congress were out of Lenin's hands. As \nthings turned out, the composition of the delegations was closer to his \nwishes than he had expected. Suitably unobtrusive premises were \nrented in London. Apart from a scare when customs officers showed \ninterest in the trunk holding Central Committee material, there was \nlittle bother. The Central Committee's participation encouraged \nseveral pro-Menshevik organisations to send representatives from \nRussia; but these, on arrival, found that little effort at reconciliation \nwith Iskra had been made. They departed to a Menshevik Conference \nhurriedly organised in Geneva. Krasin was disappointed. He had \nmade the Central Committee's participation conditional upon three-\nquarters of the local committees sending delegates. He used his \ndisappointment as a bargaining counter. He steered the Congress away \nfrom allowing representation to Bolshevik splinter groups in cities \nwhere the legitimately-constituted committees favoured the Men-\nsheviks. Bogdanov gave ground, worried lest the proceedings should \nlose all approximation to status as the Third Party Congress. 'It is not \nour business,' he affirmed, 'to form another party.' \nProceedings started on  April . Disagreements proliferated. \nKrasin's conciliationism attracted many delegates; and Bogdanov won \nfavour from others on questions which found him at odds with Lenin. \nSuch set-backs were predictable. So that perhaps the most intriguing \nfact made manifest by the Congress was that he could not safely rely \neven upon those 'Leninists' who had supported him staunchly in the \npast. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's mood, however, was buoyed up by the early broadly-based \nsupport he obtained for his call for a strategic offensive. Insurrection \nwas his vital concern. Lunacharski and Bogdanov took his side, \narguing that uprisings could not be 'unleashed' but had to be \n'organised'. This was universally approved.s Yet Krasin was not the \nonly delegate to express doubt that Russian workers acknowledged the \nnecessity of political revolution. D. S. Postolovski warned pointedly \nagainst the menace of 'revolutionary adventurism' . Preparatory \npropaganda was needed. Lenin found this acceptable: he and his \nassociates agreed to modify the motion. The finally-agreed clauses \nobliged the party not only to prepare for insurrection but also to \nconduct a vigorous, preliminary campaign for the idea among the \nworking class.s Lenin was content. Concurrence on the need for revolt \nhad been his towering goal, and he had achieved it. His speeches were \nalmost light-hearted, quite different (as he delighted to remark) from \nhis reputation as 'an irreconcilable' . Ensuing debates reinforced his \nclaim to have been the victim of political caricaturists. P. P. Rumyant-\nsev, an associate of Bogdanov's, proposed a motion deploring the \nmaintenance of purely clandestine modes of party activity. Bloody \nSunday had caught the party unawares. The lesson to be learned was \nthat, at a time of street demonstrations, social-democrats had to offer \nleadership of a more overt kind. Lenin sided with Rumyantsev. \nOn the connected issue of participation in trade unions, Lenin went \neven further than Rumyantsev. Lenin wanted the party to start \nforming trade unions. Rumyantsev was unpersuaded; he retained that \nwidespread Bolshevik distaste for activity that appeared directed \ntowards non-political ends. He wished party activists to work inside \ntrade unions but not to dedicate their energies to forming them. The \nCongress's drafting commission overruled Lenin. And, when the \ncommission's motion came before the Congress itself, many delegates \nstill regarded even Rumyantsev's formulations as an unpardonable \ndeparture from Bolshevism. M. Tskhakaya, in particular, contended \nthat the Russia of mid- differed little from the Russia of . \nEventually only minor amendments were passed, and the resolution \noffered by Rumyantsev became official policy.s At all events the \ndiscussion had shown how far removed was Lenin from seeking the \neternal application of What Is To Be Done? 's organisational prescrip-\ntions. \nLenin's first report to the Congress dealt with entrance into a \n'provisional revolutionary government'. Plekhanov was the butt of his \nremarks. Marx, according to Plekhanov, would never have espoused \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \nLenin's proposals; and the corroborative evidence was supposedly to \nbe found in articles inveighing against those socialist 'opportunists' \nwho were ready to do a deal with the middle class.s Lenin rehearsed \nthe case already mounted in reply to Martynov. Bolshevik policy was \ndesigned to prevent, not to engineer a Millerandist sell-out. In addition \nLenin urged the Congress not to be browbeaten by Iskra's taunts about \nlacobinism. The founders of Marxism, he maintained, had despised \nthose who despised the Jacobins. Lenin went further. He claimed that \nMarx had generally enthused about mass terror as a means of \nconsolidating revolutions; his evidence was a remark in  that \nRobespierre's guillotine in - had been 'the plebeian method' of \neradicating the old order.  This particular citation was accurate. But it \nwas also selective; for Marx, while sometimes condoning the French \nterror unequivocally, on other occasions condemned it severely. In \nThe Holy Family in  he had stated that Robespierre had \ninadvertently and against his own designs created the conditions for his \nregime's overthrow. Lenin drew a veil, presumably consciously, over \nMarx's changeability. And indeed there was something akin to \nanticipatory relish in Lenin's further statement that the revolutionary \ndictatorship of the workers and the peasantry in Russia should \norganise its own terror.  The narodnik element in his thought was \nstrong in . He recommended populists like Petr Tkachev as \nessential reading matter for his close associates.o His advocacy of \nterror did not reach the pages of Vpered. Lenin must have sensed the \nneed not to supply the Mensheviks with additional literary gunpowder \nto fire against him. But Congress speeches were never so carefully \nplanned as newspaper articles. It may well be that Lenin was carried \naway in the heat of the moment, and that he revealed a policy which he \notherwise preferred to cosset with euphemisms. \nBolsheviks of all complexions anyway warmed to his speech; not a \nsingle delegate rose to oppose him. Krasin was euphoric. He put \nforward an amendment to Lenin's motion, but it was an amendment \nreadily accepted by Lenin. Krasin argued that the revolutionary \ngovernment should be installed in the process of the insurrection. This \nwould guarantee the social-democrats a toe-hold in the new admini-\nstration. The Lenin-Krasin resolution won a massive majority. A few \ndelegates were confused by the debate. P. A. Krasikov confessed to \nbeing unable to see how such a government, with all its power and with \nall its radical reforms, could be said to be initiating 'the dominion of the \nbourgeoisie' . But his objections were rejected. Thus encouraged, \nLenin opened the discussion on the agrarian question. He omitted \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention of land nationalisation. The drafting commission had appar-\nently insisted upon a vaguer formulation invoking the party to support \nall revolutionary measures to improve the peasantry's lot; and these \nmeasures were not to stop short of 'the expropriation of gentry land'. \nLenin defended the formulation loyally at the Congress.S It at least \ngave him a huge extension of peasant-oriented concessions, and he \npostponed consideration of his specific arguments for nationalisation. \nAgain a delegate asked the question about historical stages. M. K. \nVladimirov enquired where the party should in fact stop with its \nagrarian reforms. 'Never stop!' was Lenin's response. Not for the \nonly time in  the urge to move towards Trotski's 'permanent \nrevolution' showed itself in Lenin's reflex reactions. \nNext on the agenda came Bogdanov's motion to induce more \nworkers to join the party. Postolovski recounted how easier it was for a \nstudent than for a worker to obtain the acquaintance with Marxism \noften demanded as an entrance qualification. To many delegates \n(such as V. S. Desnitski, L. B. Kamenev and A. I. Rykov) this \nappeared demagogical. Lenin, however, sided with Bogdanov. He \nalso backed Bogdanov's suggestion that a greater 'dose of demo-\ncratism' would facilitate the entrance of workers to the party. He was \ndismayed by the narrow focus of the Bolshevism of the Kamenevs and \nthe Rykovs. True, Lenin and Bogdanov obtained the scrapping of \nMartov's definition of the terms of party membership in favour of \nLenin's; but their other recommendations encouraged a relaxation of \nhierarchical arrangements. Lenin also voted to accord greater freedom \nto local committees to run their own newspapers. And this reflected \nthe opinion of most delegates. \nLenin and Bogdanov, however, disagreed about the structure of the \ncentral party apparatus. Both wished to abolish the unwieldy Party \nCouncil. But Lenin wanted to retain a bipartite arrangement whereby \nthe Central Committee was situated in Russia and the party newspaper \nin Switzerland; Bogdanov held that both should be based on Russian \nsoil. Delegates from Russia sided with Bogdanov. They had had their \nfill of the emigre disputes of -; many hinted that Lenin had been \namong the most offenders. M. G. Tskhakaya went the nearest to \noutright attack. He objected to the growth of a cult around Lenin, \ndeclaring: 'I am not a Leninist, I'm a party activist, a revolutionary \nsocial-democrat, a Marxist.' Engels had not talked of Engelsism. And \nLenin's admirers, insisted Tskhakaya, should desist from elevating \nLenin to a higher pedestal than that of Marxism's co-founder. \nNobody rose to repudiate Tskhakaya. In addition, the vote on the \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \ncentral party apparatus was a triumph for Bogdanov. Only V. V. \nVorovski, himself an emigre, supported Lenin's proposal to keep the \nparty newspaper abroad. So as to prevent Lenin's total humiliation, \nDesnitski proposed a vote of thanks for V pered' s services to the party. \nA substantial minority of delegates abstained.  Lenin's contribution \nto party life was highly esteemed, but not regarded as being indispens-\nable. His behaviour at the Congress itself was perfectly proper. But this \nwas an all-Bolshevik affair. Lenin still exhibited fractiousness towards \nthose social-democrats not espousing Bolshevism. Before the Con-\ngress he had proposed a motion denouncing Plekhanov. The \nCongress drafting commission rejected it. Equal impatience was \nshown to Lenin's motion to excoriate the Mensheviks as 'disorganis-\ners' who should be treated as 'standing outside the party' . A more \nschismatic suggestion was hardly conceivable. Bogdanov sought the \nre-unification of the party, albeit a party united under Bolshevik \nleadership. He forced compromise upon Lenin. They agreed upon a \nmotion criticising the Mensheviks for their 'partial deviation from the \nprinciples of revolutionary social-democracy' .~ The Mensheviks \nwere not to be expelled. They need not even recant their general \nopinions so long as they were willing to obey party policies in \npractice . \nLenin had the sense to retreat with composure. He defended the \ncompromise in debate. And he secured himself a position in the new \nCentral Committee. There were four other members of this all-\nBolshevik body: Bogdanov, Krasin, Postolovski and Rykov. Each \nwas independently-minded and had a record of standing up to Lenin. \nThere was little possibility of Lenin's railroading his policies through \nthe new central party apparatus in the months to come. \nAUTOCRACY IN RETREAT \nThird Congress delegates, when proceedings ended on  April , \nfelt sure that political unrest in Russia was about to increase in \nseverity; the debates had put Lenin in closer touch with his native land, \nif only through the medium of activists who had journeyed thence to \nLondon. The Bolsheviks wanted insurrection. Until midsummer they \nhad reason to feel that their optimism was justified, and their leaflets \nunderlined the autocracy's growing incapacity to govern autocrati-\ncally. \nReturning to Geneva, Lenin still shared this optimistic ebullience. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut gradually the news began to make him reconsider. Russian factory \nworkers found it difficult to sustain the strike movement. It is true that \ncertain cities such as Odessa witnessed fierce street confrontations in \nmidsummer; but there were many more places where order was \nmaintained with ease.  Industrialists were facing down wage \ndemands. The government was cheered by the entrance of organised \ngroupings of landowners into politics. The most influential was the \nUnion Of The United Gentry. The war with Japan was coming to a \nclose. The Japanese government refrained from imposing humiliating \nterms. A treaty was signed on  August. A rise in confidence in \nRussian stocks and shares was registered abroad. In February  the \ngovernment had undertaken to convoke a representative assembly; \nbut the gathering lull of midsummer induced Nikolai II to make the \nbarest political concessions. A manifesto was issued on  August. The \nassembly was to be called the State Duma and its powers would be \nexclusively consultative. The method of election would be socially-\ndiscriminatory. Voters were to be divided into their respective social \nestates and to choose representatives to serve in electoral curiae. \nThese representatives would meet to elect the Duma's members. The \nunfairness of the system consisted in the allocation of  per cent of \nDuma places to the landowning gentry. Property qualifications were \nmandatory for urban inhabitants. The effect was to deny the franchise \nto factory workers and to many low-ranking members of the profes-\nsions and the civil service. \nBut the public mood was still hostile. Printing workers struck in \nSeptember, their demands being political as well as economic. \nIndustrial disputes occurred across central Russia. In October, a strike \nof railwaymen began. lOS Liberals, moreover, felt cheated by the \nAugust Manifesto. Inside the Union Of Unions, P. N. Milyukov led a \nmoderate group inclined to participate in the forthcoming Duma \nelections. The government ill-advisedly arrested him. All liberals \nbecame hell-bent upon extracting more substantial concessions; and \nthey lent expression to their resolve by holding the founding congress \nof the Constitutional-Democratic Party on  October.lo \nAs Lenin and the other emigres pondered the struggle from afar, \ntheir doubts began to be balanced again by more sanguine feelings. \nThe cause for their joy was the activity of the workers of St. Petersburg. \nOn  October they formed a Soviet. The Russian word means \nCouncil; and the Petersburg Soviet's original purpose was to provide \nleadership of the current wave of strikes in the capital. There were \nabout forty delegates at the Soviet's opening meeting. By  October, \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n \nthe number had risen to ; and these delegates represented the \nworkforce of  factories and five trade unions. lOS The original \nchairman was G. S. Khrustalev-Nosar, a left-wing liberal. But Lev \nTrotski with his tactical and oratorical skills quickly came to the fore. \nThe Mensheviks, the Bolsheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries \nwere invited to send activists to work in an advisory capacity inside the \nExecutive Committee. The Soviet declined to advocate the pro-\ngramme of any single political party or group; it aimed, as a 'non-party \norganisation', to unite the capital's workers. On the other hand it still \npursued political goals. The strikes were intended to achieve civic \nfreedoms as well as higher wages; the Petersburg Soviet's slogans \ncalled for the formation of a democratic republic. lo The Soviet \nintroduced its own administration, including a workers' militia. Trotski \nregretted that the Soviet could not manage to re-unite the social-\ndemocratic factions in the capital. The Mensheviks collaborated with \nhim willingly, but the Bolsheviks baulked for a time at the Soviet's \ninsistence upon its 'non-party' status. Nevertheless the government \nwas deep in trouble. Nikolai II made concessions. On  October  \nhe issued a further Manifesto. It guaranteed the freedoms of opinion, \nassembly and association. It abolished the censorship. It promised to \nextend the franchise for the State Duma. It granted not only \nconsultative but also legislative authority to the Duma.llo On  \nOctober, an amnesty for political offences was granted.lll \nLenin had to read all about this in the Swiss press. It was not yet \nobvious how he would react to such events; he had rampaged inside his \nparty for the past year, and few were aware that he was at that very \nmoment having second thoughts about policy. The last months of  \nwere to reveal how drastically he had altered his mind. \n   Predicting the Tide \nST. PETERSBURG \nVoices were raised at court, as well as in monarchist organisations in \nthe country, urging Nikolai II to retract his Manifesto. They recom-\nmended a harsher regime. By this they did not simply mean that \nundisguised revolutionaries like Lenin should be caught and hanged. \nThey demanded a yet more pervasive repression; and they suggested \nthat the political tumult had occurred precisely because the autocracy \nhad conceded too much to its liberal and socialist critics. Yet such \nrecommendations overestimated the power available to the tsarist \ngovernment. Nikolai II never in fact envisaged introducing the \nmethods which were later to characterise the rule of Stalin in the USSR \nand Hitler in Germany; but, even if he had so inclined, the results \nwould not have brought him advantage. Tsarism lacked a mass \nmovement of support; there was no social class, save for the gentry, \nwhich it could reliably mobilise. Its ideology, such as it was, was \nassociated with a past held in contempt by the population at large. Its \nrituals no longer secured social cohesion. Its police lacked the \nlarge-scale technology of control developed in subsequent years. Its \narmy's ranks were filled with peasants who were a dubious instrument \nof the monarchical will in times of crisis. Consequently the semi-\nconstitutional manoeuvres of - were probably the nearest that \nthe imperial government could prudently move towards the main-\ntenance of its centuries-old prerogatives. Any more aggressive posture \nwould have invited further revolutionary upheavals. \nIn any case, the Constitutional Democrats (or Kadets, as they were \nabbreviated) agreed to participate in the elections. November and \nDecember were testing months for the regime. Soviets were springing \nup in towns and cities; as many as fifty had established themselves by \nthe end of . Strikes dislocated industrial production. Mutinies \nbroke out in regiments in the Far East. The countryside seethed with \ndiscontent.  rural disturbances were recorded for the month of \nNovember alone.  \n \n Predicting the Tide \n \nUntil \nthe \nManifesto's \npromulgation, \nfew \nleading \nemigre \nrevolutionaries would countenance returning to Russia. Safety still \nmattered. Plekhanov, Lenin, Martov and Akselrod were career \npoliticians; they viewed the possibility of arrest as an unacceptable \nrisk: the party's loss would be irredeemable. Not all the 'lords' of the \nparty, as they were dubbed, felt this way. Bogdanov hastened back \ninto Russia in . Trotski followed in . Lenin refused all \ninvitations to emulate their action.  Nonetheless the frustrations of \nSwitzerland mounted; he bemoaned 'the accursed distance' separating \nhim from St. Petersburg. After the Third Party Congress, the Central \nCommittee had appointed him as its representative abroad and as \neditor of Proletari (or Proletarian). Proletari was the new mast-head \nfor Vpered , claiming status as the entire party's central newspaper. The \neditorial routine was onerous. And Lenin felt that the Central \nCommittee, with its anti-emigre animus, deliberately kept him short of \nassistants and financial support. This was painful enough. But in July \n he also learned that Central Committee members were taking \nimportant decisions without consulting him. A meeting had taken \nplace between the Central Committee and the Menshevik Organisa-\ntional Commission. It appears that agreement was reached to reconsti-\ntute the Central Committee with representatives from both factions.lO \nLenin was irate that no one had even asked his opinion. His plea for a \nCentral Committee meeting to be held abroad was greeted with the \nsuggestion of Finland as the venue.l This too displeased him. The \nFinnish border was only a few miles from St. Petersburg; the \npossibility of his imprisonment could not be discounted. He wrote back \nproposing Stockholm. Thus the Manifesto came to his rescue in \nOctober: he would return, he would tackle his colleagues face to face at \nlast. \nThey had plans, well before the Manifesto, to start a legal Bolshevik \nnewspaper based in Russia (and perhaps its creation would have \ncompelled Lenin to go back to St. Petersburg even if no Manifesto had \nbeen issued). The newspaper's name was to be Novaya Zhizn (or New \nLife). He looked forward to joining the editorial board.  He also \naimed to introduce practicality to the Central Committee's affairs. \nValuable time was being lost on trivia. In Lenin's opinion, the Central \nCommittee should concentrate upon the regular production of \nbulletins; it should sketch general plans, leaving it to lower party \ncommittees to flesh out the details. \nThose acquainted only with the Lenin of Two Tactics knew solely a \nprophet of all-out strategical offensive. But there was another Lenin \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \n(and many more besides). Right from his alliance with Struve's coterie \nin the mid-s he had been adept at tactical manoeuvres and \nadjustments in policy. In the second half of  it was this Lenin who \ncame to the fore. He now claimed, to Bogdanov's bemusement, to be \nquite unbothered by the prospect of joining up again with the \nMensheviks; he even chided those Bolsheviks who 'exaggerated' the \npoints of dispute between the two factions. Bogdanov too wanted to \nsecure Bolshevik dominance inside a re-unified social-democratic \nparty; but many local groups of Bolsheviks were destroying his \nbargaining position by recombining with Menshevik groups without \nthe Central Committee's permission. He continuingly made acerbic \nanti-Menshevik remarks. He was to warn, too, against a 'unificatory \norgy'.S Lenin by contrast was almost benign. He conceded that the \nBolshevik Central Committee (as if he himself had played no role in \nthe matter) had in the past unfairly cashiered social-democratic \ncommittees led by Mensheviks. His magnanimity was a prudential \ncalculation. He sensed, along with the Mensheviks, that Bogdanov and \nKrasin might be contemplating a hasty attempt at insurrection. Lenin \nwanted to delay it until spring ; but he again noted ruefully that \nthe Central Committee had not invited his advice.s He worried even \nmore about the attitude of many Bolsheviks to non-party working-\nclass organisations. The reluctance to participate in trade unions \npersisted. The Mensheviks took part with zest. Lenin did not endorse \ntheir general viewpoint any more than previously; but he shared the \npriority given by Martov and Akselrod to ensuring that social-\ndemocrats did not let other political parties dominate the organisations \nof the Russian labour movement. Lenin now welcomed the Men-\nsheviks in the party as a means of putting pressure on his own \nBolsheviks to bend more readily in his own direction of policy. \nWinding up Proletari's affairs, he packed his case for St. Petersburg. \nHe travelled across Germany, stopping over in Stockholm (to pick up a \nfalse passport) and arriving in Russia around  November . He \nalready knew of the Petersburg Soviet. He brought with him a draft \narticle advocating Bolshevik participation, expecting to get it pub-\nlished in Novaya Zhizn. \nHe had read the newspaper's early issues and was shocked by the \neditorials expressing suspicion and even antipathy towards the \nSoviet. He steeled himselffor a struggle. He was allotted rooms in P. \nP. Rumyantsev's apartment. Lenin now learnt, for the first time, the \ndetails of the Central Committee's recent activity. Bogdanov's policy \nhad been that the Central Committee should involve itself in the \n Predicting the Tide \n \nPetersburg Soviet only on condition that the Soviet accepted the \nsocial-democratic programme. The Soviet had predictably repudiated \nthis demand. The Central Committee had thereupon urged all \nBolsheviks to withdraw from the Soviet. It took weeks for Lenin to \nsoften this intransigence. Indeed his article remained unpublished. \nThe day-to-day grind of the Novaya Zhizn editorship lay claim to his \nenergies. The Central Committee's posture gradually changed. It \ncould hardly have been otherwise; the Bolsheviks, if ever they were \ngoing to organise an insurrection, were bound to have to enter mass \nworking-class organisations. Nevertheless the diffidence remained. \nLenin himself, possibly under Central Committee pressure, attended \nthe Soviet only infrequently. He seldom spoke. For so eloquent a \nleader, it must have been intensely irritating to attend mainly as a \nspectator. But, according to his colleague B. Gorev, he 'sat and kept \nsilent' . There was still no answer to the question whether he could \nadjust himself to an era of 'mass politics'. Trotski's name, not Lenin's, \nwas on Petersburg workers' lips. \nON PHILOSOPHY AND ON THE SOVIETS \nLenin and Bogdanov announced their differences over soviets and \ntrade unions as being of secondary importance in the winter of -; \nthe overriding task was to prepare an uprising to instal a provisional \nrevolutionary government. This consensus fortified Lenin's factional \nloyalty. But outward allegiance was accompanied by the conviction \nthat he was right about the soviets and Bogdanov wrong; and he \nattempted to put his thoughts into coherent order. His determination \nwas reinforced by chagrin. He, the founder of Bolshevism, knew \nscarcely any Bolshevik leader in st. Petersburg not claiming to \ninterpret Bolshevism better than he. \nLenin objected to Bogdanov's essential conception of Marxism. \nPhilosophy divided them. In epistemology, Lenin sided with \nPlekhanov. In the s he had rejected the suggestions of Struve and \nothers that Marx's philosophical standpoint was unsatisfactory. And, \nwhile in exile in Shushenskoe, he had warned fellow social-democrats \nagainst adopting the neo-Kantian notions then becoming popular \namong \nAustrian \nMarxists. \nKant's \n'categorical imperative', \ntogether with its political moralism, was unattractive to Lenin. So far, \nBogdanov and Lenin were in agreement. But Bogdanov, unlike \nLenin, felt that writings by contemporary non-Marxists could \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nnevertheless be useful in refining Marxist philosophy. He had in mind \nnot Immanuel Kant but Ernst Mach and Richard Avenarius. He liked \ntheir work on human perception; they seemed to him to have \ndemonstrated the fallacy of the psychological model which drew a \nsharp distinction between subject and object, between the observer \nand the thing that is observed. Bogdanov linked their outlook with \nMarxism. For him, Mach had inadvertently supplied an epistemologi-\ncal basis for Marxist social theory. The interfusion of subject and \nobject meant that absolute truth was unattainable; and this, in \nBogdanov's opinion, entirely accorded with Marx's arguments that \nevery society'S ideas are historically-conditioned and amenable to \nchange in response to changing circumstances. Bogdanov made \nparticular study of Marx's Theses on Feuerbach. He was very far from \nbeing a slavish admirer of Mach, Avenarius and the other 'Empiriocri-\ntics'; indeed he tried to show that they treated problems of perception \nin too individualist a mode and neglected the effects of collective social \nexperience. He referred to his own doctrine as Empiriomonism. \nLenin dismissed all this as mumbo jumbo. He, in contrast with \nBogdanov, believed in the independent objective reality of the \nexternal world; in the ontological primacy of matter over mind; and in \nthe attainability of incontrovertible truth. He felt that Marx and \nEngels could be shown to have supported Plekhanov's basic position. \nAs early as  he communicated his criticisms to Bogdanov. \nNevertheless Lenin and Bogdanov concurred that philosophical \ndisagreements need not affect their political alliance. They made \nepistemology a truce zone.S Lenin expressed outrage when Plekhanov \ndeclared that a causal link existed between Bogdanov's 'subjectivist' \nphilosophy and his 'voluntarist' pursuit of a revolutionary dictator-\nship. \nLenin was of the opinion, all the same, that Bogdanov lacked the \nintellectual flexibility appropriate to the politician. The charge was not \nwithout foundation. Free-ranging in philosophy, Bogdanov in  \nwas dogmatic about the concept of the 'vanguard party'. If the soviets \nwould not accept leadership from the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party, he implied, then too bad for the soviets. And too bad \nalso for the workers who elected delegates to those same soviets. He \nwas as doctrinaire about this as any Bolshevik hardliner (even though \nsuch an attitude was not in fact a logically unavoidable conclusion to be \ndrawn from What Is To Be Done?). Lenin's view, as sketched in \nNovember  and elaborated in his  pamphlet Victory of the \n Predicting the Tide \n \nKadets, was different: he wanted the soviets to act as 'the embryos of \nthe new revolutionary power' . He warned against fussing about the \nprocedural niceties. The Petersburg Soviet should initiate the process \nby selecting representatives to announce themselves as 'the pro-\nvisional revolutionary government of all Russia' . His views were not \nyet phrased definitively. He was not entirely clear about the task to be \nfulfilled by the soviets. Nevertheless he did not envisage them as an \nenduring institutional network for the country's governance. The \nsoviet, he declared, was a 'fighting organisation for the attainment of \nspecific goals'. And seemingly the principal goal in his mind was armed \nuprising to overthrow the monarchy and construct a democratic \nstructure of state. \nBut how could there be certainty that the soviets would be adequate \nto their task? Lenin's reactions tugged him in opposing directions. At \ntimes he wrote exultantly about popular creativity; he attacked those \nwho doubted that the people could perform 'miracles' . He even \ncharacterised workers as being 'instinctively social-democratic' . It \nwas almost as if his pronouncements of , with their denial that the \nworking class could spontaneously evolve socialist ideas, had never \nbeen made. He scourged the party's 'committee-men'. In his view they \nwere obsessed by hierarchy and insufficiently attuned to the need to \nencourage popular initiative. The party required renovation. Lenin, \nwho had once sung the praises of the 'professional revolutionary', \nwanted to fling open the gates of the party to ordinary, inexperienced \nworkers without a smattering of Marxist doctrine: all to prod the \ncommittees out of their 'inertia' . Workers should be given leading \npositions in local organisations; they should be promoted to committee \nmembership to put intellectuals in a minority in places of authority. \nThus revitalised, the party should encourage workers outside the party \non to further stages of self-liberation. Bomb-making instructions \nshould be distributed and workers be allowed to get on with the \nbusiness. Let them blow up a police station. Let them organise raids \nto steal money for funds, let them conduct military training for \nstreet-fighting. \nYet Lenin simultaneously repeated that the party alone was the re-\npository of revolutionary wisdom. Ideological education, he averred, \nremained indispensable. The party was needed to transmute the \nsocial-democratic instincts of workers into true 'social-democratic \nconsciousness' . The party's tutelary duties were not to be forsaken. \nOrganisational discipline too had to be preserved; and party com-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nmittees should ensure that their activists in the soviets toed the party \nline. Lenin occasionally spoke as if it was a pity that Bolsheviks had to \njoin the soviets at all. But circumstances, he noted, 'can compel US'. \nConsequently Lenin, however far he swam out towards the notion \nthat the working class was Marxist by instinct, did not toss away his \nlifebelt of traditional Bolshevism; and, though he had pragmatic \nreasons for continuing with his overtures to the Mensheviks, he still \nalso conceived of Menshevism itself as an impractical strategy. He \ncensured Akselrod, Dan and Martov even though they were the party's \nonly theorists who produced articles which prefigured the emergence \nof the soviets in late . Akselrod's dream of a 'workers' congress' \nnow seems a not uneffective work of prophecy. Even before the \ngovernment's announcement of the highly restrictive franchise for the \nState Duma in August, he had proposed that workers should take \npolitics into their own hands by electing their own delegates and \ndemanding the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. The delegates \nto each workers' congress would automatically arrange local 'revolu-\ntionary self-government'. Social-democrats should work to ensure \ntheir own election to the congress-cum-soviet. Whenever he read of \nsuch plans, Lenin returned to his centralist premises. Revolutionaries \nshould not aim merely to prevent the government from ruling the \nlocalities. They should also, as a first measure indeed, establish their \nown central state authority. Like Trotski, Lenin thought that the \n'democratic dictatorship' could be installed only by simultaneous \nprocesses of central direction and local self-organisation. \nFAILURE OF INSURRECTION \nIf Lenin's thinking in  was more tension-laden than was custom-\nary even for him, it must be appreciated that Russian politics changed \nwith bewildering rapidity inside a few months. But there is a further \ndifficulty. Lenin was an active politician, not an armchair commen-\ntator. He wrote to achieve impact over his party and through his party. \nRhetorical flourish and exaggeration were fair play. Since Lenin was \nconcerned lest the Bolsheviks might float adrift of working-class \nopinion, it was natural for him to make a strong case for the instinctive \nvirtues of the factory labourer. No statement of theory made by him \nwas unaffected by his immediate political goals. His 'political thought' \nis therefore mishandled when, as was done in his day and is still done \ntoday, it is treated as a thing unto itself. The parts lack ultimate \n Predicting the Tide \n \ndefinition; they are constantly in motion. The system of his ideas is an \ninterplay of tendencies: it is not a static, particularised code. \nBefore  he had experienced small difficulty in communicating \npolicies to his Bolsheviks; but his editorial job in Novaya Zhizn, upon \nhis return to Russia, was in the gift of a Central Committee suspicious \nof his pro-soviet enthusiasms. His articles were often therefore \ncautious in their phrasing. His departure from Switzerland had a \nsecond untoward result from his angle of view. He no longer presided \nover correspondence with committees throughout Russia; by coming \nback to Petersburg he had placed a greater distance, organisationally \nspeaking, between himself and the rest of the country. Semen Shvarts \nwas then a Bolshevik agitator in the capital. He read and contributed to \nNovaya Zhizn. Yet he knew nothing of Lenin's idiosyncratic stance in \nthe Central Committee (even though Shvarts himself much approved \nof participation in the soviets). Many Bolshevik committee-men at \nlower levels shared the Central Committee's distrust of non-party \norganisations. On  November  there began a conference of \nparty committees in the Moscow region. The delegates accepted the \nsoviets' right to existence, but only where the party 'cannot direct the \nproletariat's mass action in any other way'. Soviets should be treated \nmerely as 'the technical apparatus' for carrying the party's leadership \nto the working class. Yet circumstances indeed obliged. The months \nfrom October to December witnessed the entrance of Bolsheviks into \nmore mass organisations such as the trade unions and the soviets. Their \npurpose was always the same. They sought to use the soviets as a base \nfor propaganda in favour of armed insurrection. They helped in \nstrengthening the Moscow Soviet in December (which contrasted with \ntheir behaviour in St. Petersburg, where they were half-hearted \nparticipan ts).  \nEvents spurred them on. In November  a sailor's mutiny broke \nout on the island of Kronstadt, a few miles from the capital. The \nPetersburg Soviet called upon the people to withhold tax payments. \nWorkers in Nizhni Novgorod and Ekaterinoslav took to the streets. In \nthe Transcaucasus, Georgia was already under a revolutionary admini-\nstration of Mensheviks. But the Ministry of Internal Affairs under its \nnew head P. N. Durnovo went on the offensive. On  December, \nDurnovo ordered the arrest of the Soviet. No resistance was offered. \nThe Petersburg Soviet's life was ended as suddenly as it had begun. \nLenin's influence over events in St. Petersburg was slight. It was no \ngreater elsewhere. The Moscow Bolsheviks, who held the party's city \ncommittee, decided to mount an insurrection before the authorities \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nrepeated their attempt at suppressing revolutionary activity. The \nMoscow Committee consulted with representatives from the Central \nCommittee, but the armed initiative seems to have been local. The \nMoscow Soviet sanctioned the uprising. The insurgents lacked \nsophistication; they had no plan to seize the telegraph offices or cut the \nrail link with the capital. The Soviet possessed only a poorly-armed \nmilitia. Efforts were made to secure sympathy from garrison soldiers, \nbut the main hope was reposed in the workers in Moscow's industrial \nquarters. The violence lasted several days. Neither party nor soviet \nexerted great impact over operational details. Troops were hurried by \nthe government from St. Petersburg and, by  December, the fighting \nwas over. At least a thousand persons perished, most of them \ncivilians. The workers had not risen in the manner necessary to give \nany chance of success. Social-democrats tried to assess the reasons for \nfailure; and it was agreed that the venture had been undertaken \nwithout the necessary consultation and preparation of opinion outside \nthe party. Lenin's doubts, expressed in early autumn, had proved \nwell-founded. Paradoxically it was the incautious policy which he and \nothers had urged on the party in spring  that led to the disaster. \nTAMPERE AND THE DUMA \nWhile insurrection took place in Moscow, a Conference of Bolsheviks \nwas being held to the north. The venue was Tampere (or Tammerfors). \nThis was a Finnish town, just over the border from St. Petersburg. The \noriginal intention was to hold the Fourth Party Congress there; but the \ndetainment of the Moscow Committee by the street-fighting induced \nthe other delegates to declare their meeting, less weightily, a Confer-\nence. Forty-one representatives were present. Sessions were held in \nthe house of an indulgent police chief. A musical concert was arranged \nto celebrate the Conference's commencement. A Red Guard patrolled \noutside. Lenin was elected as Conference chairman; his deputies were \nB. I. Gorev and M. M. Borodin. The crisis in Moscow led to a \nbreakdown of communications between Russia and Finland. Krasin, \ntravelling back and forth to Petersburg to keep abreast of events, \nbrought unexpected news: on the  December the government had \npublished its electoral law for the State Duma. Representatives were \nto be elected by each social estate separately. The government wished \nto keep working-class representation to a low level. The gentry would \nreceive a deputy for every two thousand voters whereas the workers \n Predicting the Tide \n \nwould for every ninety thousand. Nikolai II, expecting the peasants to \nshow faith in the monarchy, approved regulations designed to provide \nthem with a majority of the seats in the Duma. \nThe Tampere Conference's reaction was almost monolithic: the \nelectoral law was a travesty of parliamentarism, it was a 'police Duma'. \nThe elections should be boycotted. The urgent task was to dissuade the \npeople from casting votes. Insurrection remained the Bolshevik \npriority. Initially there were two dissenters: Gorev and Lenin. They \nviewed a policy of boycott as yet another sign of the Bolsheviks' naive \ninflexibility. Lenin had dreaded this since summer. In a note to \nLunacharski, he had stated that social-democrats might have to ally \nwith liberals in order to constrain the emperor to grant democratic \nmethods of election. Evidently his anti-liberal vehemence was \ntemporarily in suspension; he refused to hold to unvarying tactics. By \ncontrast, nothing would have induced Bogdanov to proffer a hand to \nMilyukov. Bogdanov was equally hostile to the law of  December. \nLenin's attitude was less rigid. Like all Bolsheviks, he denounced the \nlaw's provisions as a mockery of constitutionalism. But he believed \nthat the electoral rules could be cleverly exploited. The law called for \nworkers from each factory employing over  persons to send a \nrepresentative to a town assembly. The representatives were then to \nchoose a number of electors; and the electors from all towns in each \nprovince would come together to select their Duma deputy. Under the \ncover of this process, Lenin argued, it would be possible for workers to \nre-establish the soviets. Gorev, agreeing with Lenin, offered to \npresent the case to the Conference. Lenin continued to discuss the \nmatter with other delegates. Intense hostility to his plan caused him \nabruptly to abandon it, and he fell back into line with the call for \ninsurrection. But Gorev knew nothing of this. His speech on the \nDuma met extreme disfavour. He turned to Lenin for backing. Lenin \nsaid he had changed his mind. His 'confession' earned stormy \napplause, and he evoked the Conference's sympathy with the quip that \nhe was 'retreating in full military order'. \nThe debate sheds light on politics inside the Bolshevik faction. \nMensheviks often remarked that Lenin could not abide to work \nalongside leaders of intellectmll prowess equal to his own. The secret \nof his alleged domination over all things Bolshevik, it was asserted, lay \npartly with his ability to beguile committee-men of inadequate formal \neducation. Undoubtedly Lenin deployed his erudition to advantage. \nBut he was not always successful. Among the boycottist leaders at the \nConference was Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin, whose lack of a university \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ndegree in no way inhibited him from expressing himself forcefully. \nMen of humble social origin were legion in the Bolshevik faction. Their \nspeeches exuded confident judgement; the Stalins and Nogins felt that \ntheir own experiences in life gave them a proper and full understanding \nof the socialist movement's needs. Throughout his career as a party \nboss, Lenin had to take their feelings into account. \nIn its other debates, between  and  December, the Conference \nagreed on the need to re-unite the Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty. A Fourth Party Congress should be arranged. Preliminary \nmeasures could be taken forthwith: the central bodies of the two \nfactions should coalesce on terms of parity. Local committees should \nalso recombine activity. The principle of democratic centralism should \nbe established. Committees should everywhere be elected from below \nand should be accountable before the party's lower echelons. Central-\nism was not to be abandoned. Once elected, committees should be \naccorded 'the entire fullness of power in the matter of ideological and \npractical leadership'.  The Conference also discussed the agrarian \nquestion. The reporter was Lenin. The record of his speech is not \navailable; it is not known whether he tried to present the case for land \nnationalisation. In any event, the Conference avoided so precise a \ndeclaration of policy. The Tampere delegates, following the line of the \nThird Party Congress, called simply for the expropriation of territory \nheld by the crown, the church and the gentry; they left open the \nproblem as to who would hold the property rights, the peasantry or the \nstate. Negotiations between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks followed \nhard on the Conference. Lenin and Martov were present. Organisa-\ntional re-unification was agreed. Lenin also loyally pressed the \nBolshevik argument for boycotting the Duma. Martov demurred. \nIronically, he made a case not dissimilar from Lenin's earlier one: that \nthe Duma elections should be exploited as an instrument for revolu-\ntionary self-organisation by the working class. Bolshevik opposition, \nhowever, was strong; and the Mensheviks, being themselves suspicious \nabout the Duma, bowed to their arguments. \nOver the winter of -, however, the political situation in the \ncountry became clearer. Tsarism was not on the verge of collapse. And \nthe Mensheviks warmed further towards the elections. Akselrod urged \nunconditional participation. It became the Menshevik position that the \nchances of a insurrection were waning; and the priority, according to \nAkselrod, was the acquisition of seats in the Duma. But the \nconversion of policy came too late for the mounting of a full-scale \nelectoral campaign. Furthermore, Menshevik enthusiasm was checked \n Predicting the Tide \n \nby the government's announcements in early  restricting the \nDuma's authority. The tsar aimed to counterweight the Duma with an \nImperial Council, whose members would be chosen by himself and \nvarious public institutions. The emperor retained control over the \narmy and foreign policy. He could veto any legislation passed by the \nDuma. He could disperse the Duma at will; and, under article , he \ncould promulgate laws without hindrance until the next Duma was \nelected. Important aspects of the state budget were to remain \n'iron-clad': no parliamentary pressure was to hold Nikolai II to \nransom. \nTHE FOURTH PARTY CONGRESS \nThe elections to the First Duma were not yet completed when the \nFourth Party Congress began on  April . The United Central \nCommittee, formed from an equal number of Bolsheviks and Men-\nsheviks, chose Stockholm as the location. Fifty seven party organisa-\ntions were represented by  delegates with voting rights. A bureau \nwas elected to manage Congress business. The successful candidates, \nin order of popularity, were Plekhanov, Dan and Lenin. This order \nrevealed the balance of forces at the Congress. The Mensheviks were \ngoing to have a majority. Lenin accepted imminent defeat calmly, and \nto Stalin he confided his motto in such situations: 'Don't whine!' \nParty Congresses nearly always revealed dissensions which would \notherwise been barely visible. Initially the Fourth Congress seemed to \nbe an exception. Agrarian policy was its first agenda item. The \ndiscussion occupied nearly a third of the time of the entire proceedings. \nLenin's report proposed land nationalisation. Apparently he expati-\nated on his pamphlet Review of the Workers' Party's Agrarian \nProgramme, which had been written specially for the Congress.S He \ndenied that he aimed at immediate socialist revolution. He described \nhis scheme as essentially 'a bourgeois measure'; he underlined and \nrepeated that the peasant who rented his land from the state would be \nproducing for an economy dominated by capitalist relations. The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia had suggested that the peasantry, \nif left to itself, would shortly develop an agricultural system as modern \nas any known in the world at that time. Without fully abandoning this \nposition, Lenin now also contended that intervention and control by \ngovernment would powerfully increase the rate of economic change. \nHe knew to expect criticism from the Mensheviks, and was quite happy \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nto be provocative. He attacked Plekhanov, who supported Maslov on \nthe peasant question, for inconsistency; he noted that the Emancipa-\ntion Of Labour Group, back in the s, had called for a 'radical \nrevision of agrarian relations' . Lenin's remark implied that \nPlekhanov had originally not opposed nationalisation. This was both \ndevious and incorrect. In any case Lenin himself could hardly claim \ncomplete consistency in policy. Even he admitted that his 'cut-off \nstrips' scheme of  had been too small a concession to peasant \naspirations. \nThe Menshevik project, drafted by Petr Maslov, remained just as \ninsistent that the land should be taken away from the monarchy, the \nchurch and the gentry. But Maslov, in accord with his ideas of , \nwanted ownership to pass to local urban authorities. In this fashion he \nhoped to curtail central bureaucratic interference.o \nThe disagreement between Maslov and Lenin over agrarian policy \nreflected differing expectations about the post-tsarist Russian state. As \na Menshevik, Maslov anticipated the immediate installation of a \n'bourgeois' government'. Nor did he discount the possibility of a \nmonarchical counterrevolution. Lenin, as a Bolshevik, envisaged a \ndifferent scenario. The Romanov dynasty's overthrow was to be \nfollowed by a temporary dictatorship which would initiate socio-\neconomic reforms that might render the chances of counterrevolution \ninfinitely remote. The cut-and-thrust of Congress debate compelled \nthe protagonists to broaden their arguments still further. Discussion \ncovered the entirety of Russian history. Feudalism became the \nprincipal issue. Maslov, Plekhanov and Martynov maintained that, \nwhereas in western Europe it had been social conflicts and technologi-\ncal discoveries which had caused the emergence of the feudal state, in \nRussia it had been the state itself which transformed society. Russian \nfeudalism was a bastard variant. Martynov called it 'state feudalism' . \nPlekhanov maintained that the country's agrarian history had affinities \nto oriental despotism as well as to the feudalism of France and \nEngland. Lenin had challenged this view in the s. Suddenly, a \ndecade later, his historiographical differences with Plekhanov were \nseen to underpin a question of enormous immediate relevance: what \nwas the nature of this tsarist state and how best could social-democrats \ndismantle it? \nThe dispute continued for years. But it was already obvious from the \nCongress's composition that Maslov would carry the majority with him \non this occasion. Another fact had been less self-evident. This was that \n Predicting the Tide \n \nLenin, for all his agro-economic expertise, was unable to keep most \nBolsheviks with him. \nS. A. Suvorov, a Bolshevik who was politically and philosophically \nclose to Bogdanov, baulked at land nationalisation; instead he \nproposed a scheme which would designate all agricuituralland as the \nproperty of the peasantry. Peasant committees could distribute it as \nthey saw fit. Suvorov made a single exception in his planning: the \nlarge-scale capitalist farms were not to be broken up but to be turned \nover to 'organs of local self-government' . Suvorov obtained backing \nfrom delegates like Stalin who, while unruffled by Menshevik warnings \nabout oriental despotism, predicted that nationalisation would be \nunattractive to peasants. Such Bolsheviks considered it impossible to \nprevent the peasantry from appropriating whatever they wanted in the \ncountryside once the revolutionary conflagration had begun. Lenin \ncame some way to accommodating Suvorov's objection. Abandoning \nreference to nationalisation, he called for the land to become 'the \ncommon property of the entire people' . But most Bolsheviks stayed \nwith Suvorov. And Lenin, thinking Suvorov's ideas to be incorrect but \nnot fundamentally damaging to Bolshevik strategy, voted in his \nsupport and against Maslov. lOo It is an illuminating episode. Not only \ndoes it show us Lenin the practical politician under pressure to back \npolicies which were not entirely to his liking. It also reveals how, even \non a major question of policy such as land tenure, Lenin was not the \nmaster of the Bolshevik faction. And it also demonstrates, if we look \nforward a few years from , that the Bolshevik disavowal of land \nnationalisation as governmental policy in October  by no means \nrepresented an abrupt reversal of Bolshevik traditions. \nThe Congress accepted Maslov's motion by fifty two votes to forty \nfour.lOl Bolshevik attitudes remained under fire. Already in the \nCongress, Lenin had been accused by Plekhanov of talking like a \nsocialist -revol utionary . The charge was repeated by Martynov in the \ndebate on 'the contemporary moment and the class tasks of the \nproletariat'. Lenin's insurrectionism was said to have blinded him to \nother political opportunities.  This made painful listening for Lenin; \nit had been the Central Committee, not he, which had been reluctant to \nparticipate in the soviets in . But Martynov's mistake also brought \nadvantages to Lenin. The Mensheviks, by publicly over-estimating his \ninfluence, helped to increase it in reality. \nAs the debate was descending into a desultory slanging-match, the \nMensheviks moved to proceed to next business. This was Akselrod's \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nreport on the Duma. Akselrod recalled that most Menshevik activists \nin Russia had originally opposed the entrance of social-democrats into \nthe Duma; and that the tardiness of their change of position had left a \nclear field for rival parties.l Lenin led off for the Bolsheviks in reply. \nHe spoke to a draft resolution, written by himself in collaboration with \nLunacharski and I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov, which defended the boycot-\ntist line of the December  Conference. He ridiculed Akselrod's \nexpectations about the Duma's role. Yet he himself did not expressly \nmention the boycott. He retained reservations about Bolshevik policy; \nbut factional ties prevented him from stating them openly. lOS It fell to \nKrasin to put the boycottist case. He impugned Akselrod for implying \nthat pro-boycott workers were guilty of 'political indifferentism'. \nAkselrod jabbed back: 'I was talking not about the proletariat but \nabout you, the leaders.'  Then Rykov took another swing at \nAkselrod, claiming that there was 'a scent of Alpine air' about his \nspeech. lOB Momentarily the Fourth Party Congress looked like turning \ninto a repetition of the Second. This was the last thing Akselrod \nwanted. He stated that he did not hold comrade Lenin exclusively to \nblame for the party's past troubles.l Conflict faded. The Mensheviks \nwent on to ratify their proposal to sanction the party's participation in \nthe State Duma.llo \nLenin accepted the result with equanimity. At times he had \ndisplayed considerable graciousness, even agreeing to Akselrod's \nbeing given greater time for his Duma report than himself.lll He also \nannounced that he did not believe that Bolsheviks and Mensheviks \ncould not work together in the same party.ll The Mensheviks, for \ntheir part, refrained from stirring up controversy about the party \nrules.ll But they were not uniformly placatory. They spoke against the \narmed robberies that the Bolsheviks had undertaken to increase their \nfaction's treasury.ll Lenin's support for such 'expropriations' was \nwell-known. And the resolution passed by the Fourth Congress, at \nMenshevik instigation, was an embarrassment for him.lls Yet Lenin's \ngenerally low-key performance does not demonstrate that he was \nintimidated. It was surely politically-motivated. He knew very well \nthat the Mensheviks wanted to enter the Duma and to avoid further \npremature attempts at insurgency; he needed them still to countervail \nagainst Bogdanov's insurrectionary impatience. Only once at the \nCongress did Lenin break cover about such calculations. This hap-\npened when the Mensheviks made a previously-un tabled proposal to \nparticipate in the Duma electoral campaign still in progress in the \n Predicting the Tide \n \nCaucasus. Unlike the majority of Bolsheviks present, Lenin sided with \nthe Mensheviks. s \nThe Party Congress then chose officials for the central party \napparatus. Negotiations evinced an accord to include seven Men-\nsheviks and three Bolsheviks in the Central Committee. Lenin was not \namong them. The Bolsheviks chosen were Desnitski, Krasin and \nRykov (who was to be replaced by Bogdanov upon his release from \nprison). Lenin's non-inclusion cannot have been a random occur-\nrence. It was possibly a signal from his factional associates that he and \nhis close supporters had moved too far away from their line of policy; \nbut they cannot have felt extremely strongly about this since he \ncontinued for the rest of  to assume a leading position, alongside \nBogdanov and Krasin, in Bolshevik discussions.s Conceivably the \nmain intention was to keep administrative decision-making out of his \ngrasp. His energies were to be reserved for his widely-acknowledged \nspecialism: editing Bolshevik newspapers and other publications. \nAt any rate, the entire Bolshevik leadership was at least agreed on the \nneed to maintain an autonomous factional central apparatus inside the \nformally re-united party. A Bolshevik Centre was secretly established. \nPlekhanov closed the Congress with a speech of thanks for the ending \nof the organisational schism. He knew of course that the wrangles \nwere unresolved; but he had at least some grounds for thankfulness. \nLenin found the Congress less gratifying. He had lost a faction and not \nyet gained a party. \n   For the Good of the Cause \nON THE RETREAT \nIf political reactionaries in Russia exaggerated the efficaciousness of \nrepression, it is equally true that the country's liberals (as well as many \nsocialists) underestimated the difficulties that would be posed by the \ninception of a fully democratic order. Their aspirations were under-\nstandable and worthy of emulation. But the events of  were to \nshow how many, how potent and how mutually antagonistic were the \nsocial forces held down by the autocracy. Parliamentary compromises \nwould have been extremely hard to achieve in any event. The later \nexperiences of other countries offers further food for thought. It is by \nno means self-evident that India's political democracy has aided \neconomic modernisation; or that the absence of such a democracy in \nChina in the post-war years retarded the advance from a backward, \nfeudal economy. \nBe that as it may, the clamour of Russian oppositional groups for \nelective, representative government had never been stronger than in \n. The Duma duly convened on  April. No single political party \nheld a majority, and the emperor's expectation of a right-wing victory \nwas not fulfilled. Out of  deputies, over a hundred were of the \npeasant estate; but few of these supported the government. Most \npeasants in the Duma affiliated themselves to a quickly-improvised \ngrouping which called itself the Trudoviki. The largest Duma fraction \nwas constituted by  Kadets! The government offered no full-scale \nlegislative programme, and not surprisingly attracted vehement criti-\ncism from Kadet and other deputies.  There were only seventeen \nrepresentatives from the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, \nand only two from the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. The \nsocial-democratic fraction, consisting entirely of Mensheviks, sought \nto co-operate with the Kadets. The tactic was approved by the Central \nCommittee. It was disliked by Bolsheviks, including those like Lenin \nwho had been unhappy about boycotting the Duma elections in the \nfirst instance. For a while, in May , the emperor altered his \n \n For the Good of the Cause \n \nstance. Confronted by a Kadet-led alliance inside the Duma, he \nempowered his new premier Petr Stolypin to parley with the Kadets \nwith a view towards their entry into ministerial office. But Milyukov \nrefused to attenuate the demands of the Kadet programme. Nikolai II, \nresuming his earlier posture, dissolved the First Duma on  July. \nThe Kadets appealed to the population to withhold taxes and \nconscripts. Milyukov endorsed peaceful methods of resistance. But it \nappeared that his bargaining position with the government was only \nstrengthened when many socialist activists took to the streets again. \nMutinies broke out in the naval garrisons of Sveaborg and Kronstadt. \nAs Lenin had feared, Stolypin's reaction was fierce and effective. \nThe mutineers were swiftly crushed. The government had been \ndispatching punitive expeditions into the countryside throughout the \nyear; rebel peasants had been arrested in their thousands. Police and \narmy were active in the towns. In the months after the October \nManifesto, tens of thousands of persons were sent into prison or exile \ninside the country. Stolypin now strengthened the attack. In August \n he invoked article  of the Fundamental Laws to create field \ncourts-martial to mete out summary punishments. He also continued \nto harass the legally operating political parties. But Stolypin perceived \nthat courts-martial would not intimidate the peasantry forever. He \nintroduced a series of agrarian reforms. He had extensive royal \ndomains handed over for sale by the Peasant Land Bank. He issued \nordinances to undermine the peasant commune, believing that the \ncollective ties of contemporary village life fostered mass pauperisation \nand thereby encouraged anti-governmental discontent. Stolypin \nwanted to put an end to strip-field methods and repartitional practices. \nHis legislation was meant to facilitate voluntary exodus from the \ncommune and to supply each household elder with ownership rights to \nthe land he cultivated; he wanted also to help those leaving the \ncommune to receive their land in the form of a single, consolidated \nholding. \nMeanwhile the Bolshevik Centre's activity was focused on the \ntowns. It set up a factional newspaper, Proletari. The Centre's leading \nfigures were Bogdanov, Krasin and Lenin.lO The Fourth Congress, \nwith its Menshevik majority, had enjoined committees to desist from \nraising funds through bank raids. The Congress had been equally keen \nto discourage the formation of armed 'partisan' squads.ll The Bol-\nshevik Centre flouted both injunctions. But Lenin, unlike Bogdanov \nand Krasin, was unhappy that the Centre should remain involved in the \norganisation of military training;  he knew too that his two colleagues \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nretained objections to official party policy on participation in the \nSecond State Duma.  Even so, a spirit of compromise pervaded the \nCentre's internal relationships. It was strengthened by an external \nfactor. So long as the three leaders concurred that the Menshevism \nconstituted the most pernicious trend inside the party it would remain \ntheir common goal to main tain the offensive against Martov, Dan and \ntheir associates.  \nOn the other hand it was not in his interest to drive the Mensheviks \nto break with the Bolsheviks. The electoral campaign to the Second \nState Duma was set to occur in the coming winter; the Duma itself \nwould convene in February . Bogdanov and Krasin demanded an \nelectoral boycott. Lenin called for participation. The Party Central \nCommittee called a Conference, in Tampere again, from  to  \nNovember . The Mensheviks did Lenin's job for him. Leading a \nmajority of delegates, they flatly rejected any reconsideration of the \nprinciple of electoral participation. The question for debate was \ndifferent. Martov wanted party committees to be permitted to form \nelectoral alliances with the Kadets. Lenin's reaction was the same as \nthat of Bogdanov and Krasin. His momentary thoughts of agreements \nwith representatives of liberalism were a thing of the past; he joined all \nthe other Bolsheviks in an anti-Menshevik front. But the Menshevik \nproposal won by eighteen votes to fourteen. s Bolsheviks, though by \nno means all of them, then campaigned to get social-democrats elected \nto the Duma. Police intensified harassment of oppositional parties. \nSocial-democratic rank-and-file membership remained numerically \nbuoyant; there was a rise from  to nearly  between \nBloody Sunday and early . Party work was conducted cauti-\nously; and the environment of repression began to tip the balance of \nsocial-democratic opinion in the Bolsheviks' favour, however margi-\nnally, after the closure of the First State Duma. Bolshevik doubts \nabout the Central Committee's higher hopes about parliamentarism \nseemed justified. Nevertheless the electoral battle for the Second \nDuma had yet to be fought. In the event the party fared not too badly. \nIt obtained sixty five seats. And Bolsheviks were among them for the \nfirst time; eighteen of the faction's candidates secured election.s \nThe Second State Duma, meeting in February , was somewhat \ndissimilar from its predecessor. The Kadets lost ground, having won \nonly ninety eight seats. They also lost nerve. Afraid lest the emperor \nshould again dissolve the proceedings, they avoided assault upon \ngovernmental policy. They hoped by persuasion to bring an end to the \npolicy of field courts-martial; and to persuade Stolypin to extend his \n For the Good of the Cause \n \nagrarian reform with a scheme for the compulsory expropriation, with \ncompensation, of the gentry's agricultural land. Their trepidation \nwas despised by the Duma's social-democratic and socialist-\nrevolutionary fractions. The Trudoviks too found the Kadets too \ndeferential to the throne, and their peasant deputies called for the \nexpropriation of gentry-held land without compensation. Adminis-\ntrative repression was another vexed issue (and even the Kadets \ndemanded the realisation of the civic freedoms promised in the \nOctober Manifesto). The Second Duma, while witnessing a strength-\nened influx of socialist deputies, was a very divided assembly. The \nmonarchist political parties had increased their representation. \nRight-wing deputies pointed out that terrorist activity, undertaken \nmainly by socialist-revolutionaries, had led to the deaths of over three \nthousand government officials in . And monarchist organisations \nin the country urged the emperor to dismiss the Duma forthwith. \nPARLIAMENTARISM, THE STATE AND AGRICULTURE \nThe articles produced by Lenin to interpret the developing trends in \nthe Russian empire in - make a mixed impression. None attains \nhis usual level of confident, comprehensive generalisation. His analyti-\ncal framework has to be carpentered together from scattered \nmaterials; his ideas were more probative than definitive. The result is \na structure forever threatening to collapse through internal strains and \nincompletenesses. And yet this relative looseness of thought yields \npenetrating insights. The range of his considerations is remarkable. In \naddition, his writings immediately after  are pervaded by modes \nof discussion closely identifiable with Marx and Engels. So much so \nthat both friends and enemies in the party were to accuse him of an \nuncritical willingness to perceive the Russian historical experience as \nthe mere repetition of a German model. The charge that he was a \ncrypto-populist faded somewhat, if not completely; and it is difficult to \naccept many later scholars' judgement that the entirety of his work was \nessentially traditional Russian revolutionism without connection with \nMarxism. \nHis themes were the current concerns of Russian social-democratic \ndebate. He wrote about pariiamentarism as a revolutionary tactic, \nabout the nature of the Russian imperial state and about the \nStolypinian agrarian reform. His standpoint was idiosyncratic. He was \nunmoved by Trotski's Results and Prospects, which was published in \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \n; he objected equally to the multi-volume studies on con-\ntemporary Russia produced by the Menshevik leadership from  \nonwards. He also rejected the general political scenario painted in \nBogdanov's various works (although it was not until the latter half of \n that Lenin engaged his rival in open disagreement at a Party \nConference). His views were at their most direct on the parlia-\nmentary question. For him it was axiomatic that Marxists should not \nignore opportunities to have their deputies in Houses of Commons, \nReichstags and Dumas. Such neglect would constitute a drift into \nanarchism. Marxism held that tactics and methods had to be adjusted \nto circumstances. It offered no invariable operational schema; it \nadjured its proponents to accept 'compromises' as the necessary \naccompaniment to the onward march ofhistory. At times a boycott of \nparliamentary elections would be appropriate. Lenin still defended the \nBolshevik refusal to participate in the First State Duma. That boycott, \nhe argued, had been of the 'active' kind. It had been conducted in a \nperiod of 'revolutionary upsurge'. The chance had existed to over-\nthrow the monarchy. At such a moment there was no sense in entering \na parliamentary institution whose powers had already been so tightly \nrestricted by the monarch himself. \nAs the old regime re-asserted itself, however, the prospect of \nsuccessful insurrection faded. Consequently Lenin now found a \nboycott quite unjustifiable. It would only rob the party of a means, \nhowever limited, of undertaking nationwide agitation and prop-\naganda. The Duma should be used as an instrument for 'enlighten-\nment, education and organisation' . Lenin's position was 'centrist' \ninside Russian social-democracy on the parliamentary question; he \ndisagreed with both Bogdanov to his 'left' and Martov to his 'right'. \nBogdanov was accused of unconditional anti-parliamentarism. Lenin \ncorrectly noted that the German Reichstag was elected on principles \nwhich were far from wholly democratic, and that the German \nSocial-Democratic Party nevertheless did not boycott it. \nIn fact Bogdanov's views were distorted in Lenin's presentation.! \nBogdanov fully expected Bolsheviks to enter a Constituent Assembly \nin Russia once a democratic republic has been established; but he \nargued that the Duma was an utterly paltry constitutional body when \ncompared with such a future Assembly or even with the existing \nReichstag. The Russian political situation, moreover, was inherently \nunstable. The explosion of  might recur at any moment. By \nparticipating in the Duma, Russian social-democrats would help to \n For the Good of the Cause \n \nlegitimate the existing political order and fail to concentrate upon \nmobilising the workers and the peasantry into armed action against the \nmonarchy. In reply, Lenin agreed that politics in Russia were \nsusceptible of sudden transformation; he, no less than Bogdanov, \nexpected violent political 'breaks' and 'leaps' to take place. The \ncurrent task, as Lenin saw it, was to design tactics which would permit \nthe party to consolidate itself nationally in advance of the recrudes-\ncence of a revolutionary situation. Bogdanov, in his turn, declared that \nLenin's tactical shimmyings amounted to a sell-out of Bolshevik \nprogrammatic goals to Menshevism. Lenin retorted that he was no \nMenshevik. He stressed repeatedly that he was urging the Duma \nfraction never to trim the demands of the party programme or collude \nwith the Kadets in parliamentary dealings.s \nThe discussion on parliamentarism was tied to considerations on the \nnature of the Russian state. Along with other social-democratic \ntheorists, Lenin had written little specifically about the autocracy. \nSociety, rather than the state, had attracted their attention. Until  \ntheir main aim had been to demonstrate that, however unmodern its \ngeneral appearance, the Russian economy had decisively embarked \nupon a course of capitalist development. \nOn the whole, they had assumed that the Romanov monarchy was a \nrelic from Russia's past which inhibited further economic modernisa-\ntion.s Lenin's own Development of Capitalism in Russia implied \nagreement with this. Feudal 'vestiges' had to be destroyed if capitalism \nwas to mature. Yet the party's theorists, including Plekhanov, had also \npointed out that the state's role was not uniformly retardatory in the \neconomic sphere. They recognised the powerful impetus imparted to \nRussian industrial growth by Peter the Great at the beginning of the \neighteenth century and by the government's ministers at the end of the \nnineteenth.  Such references to the ambivalent impact of the govern-\nment had not yet been proposed in book-length form. Trotski'sResults \nand Prospects filled the gap. Its central supposition was that Russia had \nfollowed an idiosyncratic course of historical development, combining \nfeatures characteristic of 'backward' and 'Asiatic' countries with \nfeatures associated with the 'modern' industrial countries such as \nBritain or Germany. Russia was a hybrid. Economically speaking, her \ncondition expressed itself in technologically up to date, vast factory \ncomplexes existing cheek by jowl with small-scale, out-moded peasant \nagricultural communities. Trotski, like most other social-democratic \nwriters (ranging from Bogdanov on one side through to Martynov and \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nMaslov on the other), emphasised how little the position of the \nmonarchy had been changed by the post- 'constitutional' \nreforms; the political edifice was basically unaltered.s \nLenin had often in the past referred to the' Asiatism' of Russian \npolitical life, nor did he cease to do so; but he also maintained that the \nRussian state had been greatly altered by . It was now directed, he \nproposed, by a 'bourgeois monarchy' . This phrase was unacceptable \nto his opponents, Bolshevik and Menshevik. Was he not thereby \nclaiming an excessively 'progressive' function for tsarism? In terms of \nthe long-standing consensus in Russian Marxism, was his standpoint \nnot heresy? Lenin's response drew attention to two matters: German \nhistory and 'Bonapartism'. The German state under Bismarck's \nleadership rested upon support by the traditional Junker landlords and \nthe rising industrial bourgeoisie. Bismarck, according to Lenin, had \nmanoeuvred between these two groups. He had played them off \nagainst each other. At the same time he had ensured that the balance of \nstate policy felI increasingly in favour of industrial capitalism. The \nGerman monarchy's mediaeval trappings were therefore a superficial \nphenomenon. Lenin added that Bismarckian politics were not a \nnovelty. He noted that Marx himself had described how Napoleon III, \nin mid-nineteenth century France, had established his power by \nattracting support from influential social groups (including above alI, \nin this instance, the peasantry) which yet had clashing economic \ninterests. Thus both Germany and France had effected economic \nmodernisation through a 'Bonapartist' programme. Premier Stoly-\npin, in Lenin's judgement, was introducing such Bonapartism to \nRussia. His government promoted the interests of the landed gentry \nand industrial bourgeoisie; it also alI owed both groups, with their \nmutualIy antagonistic claims, to influence policy informalIy while it \nreduced the Duma to the status of a talking-shop. \nLenin's approach shows him not to have been strait-jacketed by the \nprejudices of his colleagues. His thought here has a freshness about it. \nHe understood that capitalist development was achievable through a \nvariety of class coalitions; and his perception of the possibilities open \nto the autocracy continues to offer valuable guidance to historians \n(even though that guidance has been largely overlooked outside the \nUSSR). \nBut Lenin did not trumpet his conclusions as early as was usual for \nhim; occasionally he undermined his own 'Bonapartist' interpretation \nby suggesting that the gentry alone did indeed still govern Russia. \nThis uncustomary tentativeness may well have stemmed from prob-\n For the Good of the Cause \n \nlems of reconciling his view of the post- Russian state with his \nobservations on trends in the peasant economy. Like all social-\ndemocrats, Lenin regarded Stolypin's agrarian reforms as a project to \nfeather-bed the landed gentry. Russian agriculture was thus being \npushed down 'the Prussian road'. Social-democrats noted that land \nreform in Germany in the nineteenth century had not curtailed the \ngentry's political and economic power in the countryside. Stolypin too, \nin their estimation, had set his face against such curtailment. While \nfostering the emergence of a group of small-holding farmers from the \nranks of the peasantry, he simultaneously protected the landed gentry \nby refusing to expropriate their land and by consequently ensuring that \nmany peasant households still had to buy or rent land to subsist. All the \nsocial-democratic alternatives involved expropriation. Virtually all \nMensheviks wanted to do this through the 'municipalisation' of \nproperty in land, most Bolsheviks through letting the peasants seize it \nfor themselves; and Lenin had his own policy of 'nationalisation'. \nExpropriation would terminate the government's attempt at a Prus-\nsian solution to the agrarian question. Lenin made a striking contrast \nbetween the 'Prussian' and' American' roads of development; he was \nin agreement with his entire party that capitalism would fully flourish \nin the rural areas of Russia only when the retarding influence of the \naverage landed nobleman had been removed, and he suggested that \nthe peasants would then be able to compete among themselves just as \nsmall-holders had done in the USA when the prairies had been thrown \nopen to agricultural exploitation. \nDisagreement, however, remained about the impact of the Stolypin \nland reform. Maslov still felt that The Development of Capitalism in \nRussia had massively over-stated the possibilities for capital accumula-\ntion inside the contemporary peasant economy. He himself empha-\nsised the adverse effects of the rural population explosion. Above all, \nhe tried to show that tsarist taxation and absentee landlordism were \nbound to keep even the better-off sections of the peasantry at a \npermanently low economic leveJ.\u00b0 Few Marxists after  were \ninclined to challenge Maslov's argumentation, especially as it accorded \nwith notions of the regime's reactionary, feudalistic aspirations; and \nhis studies gained increasing popularity in the party in the years before \nthe First World War. \nIf there was going to be such a challenge, Lenin was the likeliest \nperson to make it. He had indeed always underlined the Russian \npeasant economy's inherent dynamism; and now he lost no opportun-\nity to castigate Maslov's stress upon popUlation statistics as being \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nnon-Marxist. Starting from his own usual premises, Lenin would \nhardly want to affirm that the Stolypin reform did other than facilitate \nthe further embourgeoisement of the richer households in the village. \nOnce he did in fact ascribe 'progressive' characteristics to it as an \neconomic policy. But his remarks were patchy. Moreover, he did not \nbelieve that Stolypin's gambit would work out satisfactorily for the \ngovernment. At the very best it would require 'decades and decades'; \nand Lenin remained convinced that a revolutionary political crisis \ncould re-emerge at any time. Beyond that, he ventured the thought \nthat the amount of economic progress achieved under Stolypin was \n'negligible' . But he made no fresh attempt to tackle the Menshevik \nassertion that the better-off peasants were not really turning into rural \ncapitalists. Indeed it was in  that he at last conceded that his early \nwritings had exaggerated the level of Russian capitalist development; \nand that feudalistic practices were stronger than he had once \nimagined. Little attention was adverted to this statement at the time. \nPerhaps his opponents were more interested in the fact that he still \nmaintained that the general direction of change as described in The \nDevelopment of Capitalism was correct.  So there was no total \nrecantation.  But there was no characteristically militant self-defence \neither. This was not without irony. On the whole, later research has \nshown that the years immediately before the First World War, like the \nlast two decades of the nineteenth century, were a period when both \ncapital accumulation and agricultural output by the Russian peasantry \nincreased substantially. \nBut if Lenin could have protected his empirical case more vigorously \nthan he did, he was completely uninhibited in attacking Maslov on the \nlevel of general economic theory. Maslov contended that the analysis \nof capitalist development offered by writers like Tugan-Baranovski \nwas fundamentally flawed. He acknowledged virtues in narodnik \neconomic thought. In particular, he held that a mass consumer-\noriented market was essential for capitalism's maturation. He claimed \nthat textiles and other consumer products had been the springboard \nfor the USA's economic modernisation; and he criticised those \nMarxists who saw producer's goods as more important.! Lenin held \nfast to his original position. And his logic was not unimpressive. In the \nfirst place he, unlike Tugan, had never prescribed that industrialisation \nwas achievable exclusively through the producer'S goods sector. He \nhad constantly recognised the need for products of mass con sump-\ntion. Of course, he had nevertheless argued that producer's goods \nwould inevitably require by far the greater share of investment. And \n For the Good a/the Cause \n \nhere we come upon a controversy as unresolved today as it was in the \nlifetime of Lenin and Maslov. Some economists would perceive \nLenin's accent upon heavy industrial production as realistic; others \nwould attribute practicality rather to Maslov's insistence upon mass \nsocial welfare. \nTHE FIFfH PARTY CONGRESS \nThe Fifth Party Congress opened in London on  April . Over \nthree hundred delegates with voting rights were present. It was \nannounced that the Party had increased the number of its members to \n. The Bund, the Social-Democracy Of Poland And Lithuania \nand the Social-Democracy Of The Latvian Region had made formal \narrangements about entrance to the party, and a delegation of \nArmenian social-democrats did the same at the Congress. All \norganised Marxists in the Russian empire were, for the first time, \nrepresented at a Party Congress. Speakers from Britain appeared. \nHarry Quelch and Ramsay MacDonald greeted the Congress. This \nwarm reception was not offered by everyone in East Ham. Several \ndelegates were beaten up by hooligans. Finances too were a problem. \nDozens of delegates were workers whose money ran out when the \nCongress moved into its third week. Appeals for donations were made \nto wealthy supporters of the party. Monetary stringency, however, \nimpeded discussions less than political division. Factionalism was rife. \nFedor Dan's first sally was directed against Lenin. He wanted him \nexcluded from the Congress's presidium for having written that the \nMensheviks had prostituted their Marxism. It took three whole days \nfor the Congress to finalise its agenda. The Mensheviks objected to the \ndelay. The Bolsheviks detected questions of principle in every item \nproposed by their opponents; and they charged them with disregard \nfor the importance of 'theory' . This Congress would patently be more \ndisputatious than its predecessor. \nAll but three days of the remainder of the proceedings were given \nover to discussions which in one way or another centred upon the State \nDuma; and Lenin's speeches and behind-the-scenes activity showed \nhow deft he was at extracting the maximum political advantage \navailable. Bargaining was necessary. No faction or group could obtain \neverything it wanted. Lenin, through tactical astuteness, got as much as \nhe could reasonably have hoped for. \nMartov reported on the Central Committee. Bogdanov too \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nvolunteered a report, prompting Martov to surmise that his adver-\nsary's task would be to comment on the work of 'another secret \ninstitution'. This was a reference to the Bolshevik Centre. As \nevidence of Bolshevik duplicity, Martov noted that Bogdanov, Krasin \nand Lenin had refused to hand over to the Central Committee the sum \nof   roubles left to the party in the will of the industrialist Savva \nMorozov. On they argued, each side claiming that the other had a \nDuma policy which damaged the prospects of revolution. The \nMenshevik Martynov jibed that, while he stood for 'permanent \nrevolution', the Bolsheviks preferred 'permanent chatter'. But the \nMensheviks were no less chattersome. The Polish, Latvian and \nBundist delegations found the Bolshevik-Menshevik altercations \ntiresome. Their impatience could not be neglected. The Bolsheviks, \nhaving won only a handful of places at the Congress more than the \nMensheviks, did not command an absolute majority. Consequently \nBogdanov (who had kicked up yet another furore by denouncing \nMartynov as 'a desperate opportunist') was unable to resist the \nmotion to pass on to the next item of business. This was the Menshevik \nTsereteli's report on the Duma fraction  G. A. Aleksinski, a deputy in \nthe Duma and also a Bolshevik, delivered a hostile co-report; and \nLenin dismissed Tsereteli's words as 'the purest revisionism' . Trotski \nstepped between the two factions. But his pleas had no effect. \nPlekhanov stirred up further wrangling when he suggested that the \nphilosophical standpoint of Mach and Avenarius, so beloved of many \nBolsheviks, was irreconcilable with Marxism; he also asserted that \nsyndicalist ideas might soon take hold inside the Bolshevik faction. \nAgain the Poles and other non-Russian delegates intervened and the \nCongress was hauled forward to its third item: Lenin's report on the \nparty's 'relation to the bourgois parties' . He argued that social-\ndemocrats in the Duma should ally themselves with the Trudoviki and \nthe Socialist-Revolutionaries and not with the Kadets. He based this \nupon his optimism about the peasantry's democratic leanings. \nMensheviks opposed him. They agreed with him that the owners of the \nlarger industrial and commercial enterprises had turned their face \nagainst revolution; but they claimed that the 'middle bourgeoisie', \nespecially the members of the various professions, constituted a \npowerful anti-monarchical force. Martynov tried to ridicule Lenin's \nDevelopment of Capitalism, comparing it unfavourably with Maslov's \neconomic studies. Lenin was accused of using the slogans of the \nnarodniki. \nBut the Bolsheviks obtained strong support from the Congress floor. \n For the Good a/the Cause \n \nTrotski and Luxemburg spoke out against the Menshevik view on the \nmiddle class.s So too did Leo Jogiches, of the Polish delegation.s \nTrotski, Luxemburg and Jogiches thought Lenin over-optimistic about \nthe scale of potential assistance from the peasantry; but the Bolsheviks \nthis time stood their ground and, after some vacillation, most Poles \nvoted for the Bolshevik motion. Thus the Bolsheviks recorded their \nfirst unqualified victory at the Congress. They continued their \noffensive in the following debate on Akselrod's proposal that the party \napprove the organisation of a 'workers' congress'. Akselrod stated that \nthe party was dominated by 'petit-bourgeois' intellectuals; he also \ndeclared that ways should urgently be found to promote the direct \ninvolvement of workers outside the party in the revolutionary cause. A \n'workers' congress' remained his recommendation.ss Speaking for the \nBolsheviks, G. D. Leitezen branded Akselrod's policy as syndicalist.s \nThe Mensheviks knew that the Bolsheviks would win the resultant \nvote. Nevertheless they made some rebarbarative criticisms. Why was \nit, they asked, that the Bolsheviks looked upon workers' soviets as \nnothing better than a 'necessary evil'? Should not socialists welcome \nindependent activity by the mass of the working class? Neither \nBogdanov nor Lenin responded. Bolshevik opposition to Akselrod's \nscheme earned the Congress's approval. Lenin also won the day on the \nDuma question. Because of Polish pressure, the Congress had so far \ndesisted from framing a resolution lest factional bitterness be aggra-\nvated. Yet some policy declaration was plainly a necessity. On  May \nthe Bolsheviks finally won most of the Latvians and the Poles to their \nside. They paid a price. The Latvians insisted that the Bolsheviks make \nexcisions from their motion, especially the clause justifying the boycott \nof the First Duma. Thus modified, the Bolshevik motion was passed by \nCongress. \nDan assailed the Bolshevik leaders as wheeler-dealers: 'And it is \nimpossible by your words to paint over the fact that you were against \nparticipation in the State Duma, and now you're sitting in it' . On all \nsides he saw signs of Bolshevik trickery. He opposed Lenin's effort to \nput off the Congress's discussion on armed robberies. The Bolsheviks \nhad ignored the Fourth Congress's prohibition on bank-raids; and the \nFifth Congress reprimanded them for it. Robberies were repudiated as \nsymptoms of 'anarchist tendencies'. They were said to discredit the \nparty in society'S eyes and to invite the government to become even \nmore repressive.s \nThe sessions came to their end on  May . It had been in \nnear-panic that the delegates attended to three final crucial items of \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness before returning to Russia. They were presented with a joint \nmotion on the trade unions by the Bolsheviks, the Poles and the \nLatvians. Its chief point was a call to get unions to acknowledge the \n'ideological leadership of the party'; it also demanded closer links \nbetween the party and the unions. The motion was passed. The \nCongress then, very quickly, debated the Party Rules. Membership \nqualifications remained unchanged. The Congress also re-asserted \nthe authority of the Central Committee. It had already specified that \nthe Duma fraction should operate 'under the Central Committee's \nleadership'; it now affirmed also that the Central Committee should \nhave full control over the central party newspaper. Finally the \nCongress turned to elect the Central Committee. There were to be \nfifteen members. Five were Bolsheviks: I. P. Goldenberg, N. A. \nRozhkov, I. F. Dubrovinski, I. A. Teodorovich and V. P. Nogin. \nThere were four Mensheviks. The six other places were divided \nequally among the Poles, the Latvians and the Bund.Oo The Poles \nwould be useful allies for the Bolsheviks on many issues. But the Bund \nwould be hostile. It was already crystal-clear that the Bolshevik faction \nwould not be able to do just as it liked in the Central Committee, no \nmore than it had in the stormy proceedings of the Congress. \nSTOL YPIN'S COUP \nNo Fifth Congress delegate, not even highly circumspect ones like \nLenin, had elaborated a policy for the contingency that the emperor \nmight again dissolve the Duma. On  June  this possibility became \nreality. Stolypin had been complaining about Marxist propaganda in \nthe armed forces, and his police had been working to establish that \nsocial-democratic deputies to the Duma were implicated. The flat of \ndeputy I. P. Ozol was raided. Stolypin asked the Duma to waive Ozol's \nimmunity from arrest. The Duma's non-compliance led Stolypin to \ndisperse it.  He also announced that the government, would convoke \na Third State Duma only after altering the electoral rules. He wished to \nincrease the representation of the landed gentry at the expense of the \npeasantry. His new regulations cut back still further the electoral force \nof the urban workers. And the ethnically Russian sections of the \npopulation were to be accorded a disproportionately large number of \nDuma seats; the rebellious non-Russian nationalities were to be \nunder-represented.  Stolypin aimed to acquire a Duma more to his \npolitical liking, even if this required measures which amounted to a \n For the Good of the Cause \n \ncoup d' etat. The Third State Duma convened on  November . By \nand large, Stolypin had got his way: by far the largest fraction in the \nDuma were the conservative Octobrists, with  members and with a \nleader in A. I. Guchko who was ready to work in harness with the \ngovernment. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party mustered \nonly nineteen places. l \nMost Bolshevik leaders had called for a boycott, pressing their case \nat an emergency Party Conference in the Finnish town of Kotka on  \nJuly. Bogdanov believed that participation in the Duma amounted to \ncollaboration with class enemies.l The Mensheviks still felt other-\nwise; and they were able, with Lenin and his associates, to block the \npassage of Bogdanov's motion. They themselves, however, had \ninsufficient backing for their scheme for a parliamentary alliance with \nthe Kadets. Lenin therefore held the ring between Bogdanov and Dan. \nHe announced that he considered boycottist plans to be against the \nparty's interest.lOs He spoke openly against Bogdanov for the first \ntime. He trimmed his own motion a little. He agreed to include a \nsentence which stated that many factory workers were indifferent to \nthe results of the Third Duma elections; and he incorporated a call for \nanti-government meetings and demonstrations. lOS This made his \nproposal somewhat more attractive to Bogdanov's group. Bogdanov \nhad his reservations about Lenin's motion recorded for dissemination \nto the party at large, but in the end he voted for it as a lesser evil than \nthe project of the Mensheviks. l \nLenin's 'centrist' resolution was victorious at the Party Conference. \nNonetheless the time had passed since the Ministry of Internal Affairs \nworried about the party's official decisions. Repression increased after \nJune . The entire labour movement, with its trade unions and its \nwelfare-scheme organisations, was affected. The prison population \nmore than doubled in the four years after Bloody Sunday. lOS About \nfive hundred trade unions were closed down from  to ; and \nthe number of union members declined from   in  to \n  in . The police hunted down revolutionary parties. \nAccording to Trotski's estimate, the Russian Social Democratic \nLabour Party's membership dropped from   in  to   \nin . A harassed labour movement was unable to maintain its \nprevious level of opposition to the state and to the employers. Millions \nof workers had gone on strike in . By  the situation had so \nchanged that only  cases of industrial stoppage, involving merely \n  workers, were reported; and, of those , only  were linked \nto political demands. lll State coercion was not the only reason. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nUnemployment increased. Under Stolypin's premiership, the indus-\ntrial sectors of the economy were gripped by a recession caused by \nworld trade problems as well as by the disruptions of  at home. \nAverage real wages did not rise. In addition the government, laden by \nits immense foreign debt and deprived of peasant redemption pay-\nments as a source of revenue, felt itself in no position to lower indirect \ntaxes. Workers were paying more for their food and other consumer \nproducts.  \nBut Stolypin's legislative energies were directed towards agrarian \nreform. By late , repression had pacified the countryside and he \nanticipated years when the 'sober and strong' among the peasants \nwould quit the commune and become solid, prosperous supporters of \nthe social order. \nThe results were disappointing. Between November  and May \n only fourteen per cent of allotment land in European Russia was \ndecommunalised.l There was a further difficulty. Stolypin desired \nthat peasants abandoning the commune should consolidate their \nallotments into a single, enclosed holding. Such enclosures were \nthought important for agricultural progress. In fact only    \nhouseholds achieved this by , and they constituted a mere tenth of \nall the households in European Russia.  Stolypin's aims were not \napproved by the mass of the peasantry. After  the spate of \napplications to leave the commune subsided. Stolypin introduced laws \nrestricting the rights of commune members to refuse to allow others to \nleave; it also loffered free land in Siberia for cultivation. s But social \nrelationships in the first half-decade after  remained remarkably \nunaffected. On the other hand, the government could also report \nsuccesses. There was a sharp rise in the empire's grain production. \nOutput increased by thirty seven per cent in the period - as \ncompared with . The gentry-owned latifundia were not alone in \ncontributing to this. The richer peasants too, whether or not they had \nleft the commune, were marketing steadily larger quantities of grain; \nand it is calculated that four fifths of the modern equipment in use in \nRussian agriculture in  belonged to the peasantry.l \nWhile fostering this economic improvement (as Lenin, almost alone \namong Russian social-democrats, had predicted to be possible),  \nStolypin endeavoured to keep the majority of the Third State Duma \nwith him. At times his own respect for the monarch was cast into doubt. \nThe Octobrists in  prevailed upon Stolypin to concede power to \nthe Duma to vet affairs in the imperial navy. Nikolai II overruled \nhim.ll The Octobrists too found cause to distrust Stolyp:n. They went \n For the Good of the Cause \n \ninto outright opposition to him when, in March , he temporarily \nsuspended the Duma in order to introduce legislation on the empire's \nwestern provinces.o Isolated from tsar and Duma, Stolypin was in \ntrouble. Even among industrialists he had enemies.ll By , the \ndifficulties facing him were enormous: he had not built up the \npeasantry as a bastion of the imperial state; he was losing the affections \nof the middle class. The working class was cowed, but its quiescence \nwas unlikely to be permanent. Stolypin did not live to tackle these \nproblems. On  September  he was assassinated. \nTHE FINNISH BASE \nStolypin's government had constrained all Russian revolutionaries to \nre-polish all their underground skills. Throughout , Lenin had \navoided exposing himself to the danger of arrest; and his caution was \nstrengthened when the Second Duma was suspended in June . \nPolice agents infiltrated the party's ranks. Lenin knew that among the \nvarious caches of literature frequently confiscated by the authorities \nwere copies of his own pamphlets. He was high on the government's \nlist of politicians to be apprehended. \nYet he could cope with the situation. Rejecting thoughts of \nemigration, he accused Plekhanov of presuming to pontificate on the \nRussian revolution from the safety of the Alps. The Bolshevik \nCentre recognised, even in , the importance of acquiring a safe, \nsecret base. Proximity to St. Petersburg was desirable. And the \ndecision had been taken to move headquarters to G. D. Leitezen's \ndacha, outside the Finnish town of Kuokkala. There Lenin lived \nwith Bogdanov and Krasin, and the troika had Krupskaya as their \nsecretary. The working atmosphere grew stickier in the aftermath of \nStolypin's coup. The fact that Bogdanov and Krasin fought all the way \nagainst the party's taking part in the Third Duma elections steadily \nsoured relations. Nevertheless joint activity continued. Contact with \nthe Central Committee was maintained. Both Bogdanov and Lenin \nhad been elected as its candidate members at the Fifth Party Congress, \nand they encouraged their colleagues to come out to their hideaway on \nfrequent visits. The Petersburg party organisation too held meetings \nnearby in Terioki. Lenin and Bogdanov also managed to find time to \nwrite lengthy theoretical pieces. While in Finland, Lenin lived under \nthe pseudonym of Ervin Veikov. He also revived his ambition to get his \nbooks published legally in Russia through his old pen-name of V. Bin. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nA contract was signed for a multi-volume edition of his works, to be \nentitled Over the Past Twelve Years . And on one of his trips to St. \nPetersburg, back in , he addressed a covertly-organised gathering \nof over two thousand persons. He was nervous in advance about his \noratorical abilities, never having spoken to so large an audience \nbefore. But on the night he was well received. ll There is even a story \nthat he contemplated standing as social-democratic candidate for the \nState Duma. \nThe tale cannot be corroborated in its own terms. But it is suggestive \nin another sense. It strengthens the impression that Lenin now thought \nof himself as a permanent body in the Russian political firmament. At \ntimes he delivered statements of 'statesmanlike' soronity and pat-\nriarchal serenity. He called grandly upon activists to work together \n'more amicably',  and once even asserted that social-democracy was \nof a single mind about political policy. \nSuch pronouncements, however, were not evidence of a change of \nheart or even style. He was still the bilious commentator, the spiky and \ncantankerous in-fighter. Useful as the Mensheviks were to him, he \ndisapproved of their ideas and did not refrain from inveighing against \nthem. He wondered, provocatively, whether Maslov could continue to \nbe regarded as a 'comrade' . He fostered divisiveness in the \nPetersburg party organisation, so much so that in spring  the \nCentral Committee established a 'trial' to investigate his behaviour.B \nHe was impenitent. Indeed he advised his co-factionalists to intensify \n'military operations against the opportunists' . His intransigence was \nnot unique among Bolsheviks. Mensheviks frequently complained \nabout the rival faction's breaches of etiquette. But this only encour-\naged the Bolshevik Centre to persist in its kind of behaviour. Martov, \nMaslov, Martynov and their like were not cowards; they knew how to \ntrade punch for punch. But they did not like to hit below the belt. The \nBolshevik leaders by contrast revelled in a machismo of personal \ninsensitivity in debate. Several followers enjoyed the spectacle. 'I \nheard Lenin', wrote a girl about a conference of St. Petersburg activists \nheld in Terioki, 'and I was enraptured.'  But her adoring attitude was \nnot universal. Party Congresses always witnessed speeches by Russia-\nbased delegates who resented the disputatiousness of party chiefs. \nWhat sustained Lenin was his total conviction that his policies were \ntotally right. He seemed to have inexhaustible energy. He kept up this \nappearance right through  and until the end of the Fifth Party \nCongress in May . The Congress was an emotional turning-point. \nThe chance of an alliance with the Poles in order to defeat the \n For the Good a/the Cause \n \nMensheviks was a chance not to be missed; but it required the long, \ntedious back-room sessions of cajolement and concession. Such \nmanoeuvring wore him down. He fretted about the Central Com-\nmittee and the Bolshevik Centre's far from secure grasp on it. Even \nsharper was his concern about Bogdanov's influence in the Bolshevik \nCentre. Bogdanov's ally Krasin held the Centre's purse strings; and \nLenin, without Krasin, would lack the finances to run a newspaper. \nIn  Lenin minimised personal reference to Bogdanov both in his \nwritings and, apparently, in his speeches; he attacked policies, not \npersonalities. But his patience was becoming wafer-thin. A Party \nConference, attended by twenty seven delegates, was held between  \nand  November in Helsinki to discuss how the social-democratic \ndeputies should operate in the Third State Duma. Lenin's anti-Kadet \nmotion won the day. Yet it did not reflect the attitude of all \nBolsheviks; and many boycottists, having failed to prevent the party's \nelectoral participation, soon began to think of ways to stop the \nBolshevik Duma deputies from attending the Duma. A split between \nLenin and Bogdanov was in the making. \nThat Lenin should contemplate such a break is used by his critics as \nproof of his schismatomania. The Bolsheviks were a mere faction. \nHow could Lenin justify cleaving them into two mini-factions? It \nwould be fruitless to deny that Lenin had a factitious trait in his \ncharacter; or that he was not un attracted by the notion of being \nking-pin in the organisations to which he belonged. But it also must be \nappreciated that the State Duma, for him, posed the central immediate \nquestion for Russian social-democracy. In addition, there was an \nunderlying intellectual rationale for his behaviour. He believed that a \npolitical group's numerical weakness in a period of political repression \nhad only limited significance for the future. A revolutionary explosion \nwas to be expected. And political parties would be made great not by \nvirtue of having built up a large organisation before the revolution. \nGreatness would accrue rather to those which, in the course of the \nrevolution itself, had programmes and policies which corresponded \nwith the interests of particular social classes. Lenin declared: 'Indi-\nvidual parties can hide in the underground, give no sign of themselves, \ndisappear from the political centre-stage; but, at the slightest revivifi-\ncation, the basic political forces will again reveal themselves, perhaps \nin altered form but with the same character and direction of activity, \nuntil the objective problems of a revolution which has suffered this or \nthat defeat have been resolved.'  \nSuch thoughts yielded the conclusion that revolutionary leadership \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nin times of unfreedom was better undertaken by a few men with correct \ntheory than by many who united around a hotchpotch of incorrect \nideas. In  Lenin was not ready to break with Bogdanov. He must \nhave been tempted. For he had before him the prospect of gaining \nfinancial independence from Krasin when V. K. Taratuta, Lenin's \nsupporter in the Central Committee, inherited a vast sum of money. \nIn any case, other practical considerations interposed themselves in \nthe second half of . Stolypin's coup led to increased anti-\nrevolutionary vigilance. The St. Petersburg authorities were given \nclues about Lenin's whereabouts by police agents in Paris. But \nnothing untoward followed. Lenin may unconsciously have thrown his \npursuers off the scent by departing for Stuttgart in Germany on  \nAugust as his party's representative on the International Socialist \nBureau and at the ensuing congress of the Socialist International. He \nalso gave up the Kuokkala house in favour of another deeper in the \nFinnish countryside. But the police continued to close in. A watch \nwas placed on Lenin's movements on  November. Official orders \nwere given to suspend publication of his collected works, and it looked \nmost unlikely that the Bolsheviks would succeed in putting out a party \nnewspaper legally. Reluctantly the Central Committee decided to \nsend most of its members abroad. Lenin became a fugitive. His daily \nphysical exercises stood him in good stead. With the help of Finnish \nsocial-democrats he eluded chase by moving, under cover of darkness, \nfrom island to island in the archipelago of the Gulf of Bothnia. His plan \nwas to catch the Finland-Sweden passenger steamer which started \nfrom Abo. But police officers were scanning the Abo boarding area. \nHe therefore had to make a dash, this time by walking and climbing \nover the icefloes, to the steamer's next port of call in the bay of Nagu \nisland. The ice gave way. Lenin was nearly cast down into the Gulf's \nbitterly cold waters. But he had both the agility and the luck to jump on \nto a solid icefloe and to reach Nagu. On  December  Lenin \njoined the steamer bound for Stockholm; on  December, joined at \nlast by Krupskaya, he left Sweden for his second period of emigration \nin Western Europe. \n   \nDoubts and Certainties \nTOWARDS THE BREAK \nThe desire of Russia's political intelligentsia for an integral view on the \nuniverse grew strongly in the nineteenth century. The country's \nMarxists inherited a commitment to science and rationalism. The same \nmay be said about their counterparts in Germany; but in Russia the \nintensity of the search for comprehensiveness was greater. It is striking \nhow eagerly Russian Marxists read the latest research in physics, \npsychology and philosophy. And practical tactics, they assumed, were \nundecidable without reference to general premises. Lenin stoutly \ndefended this tradition. The failure of the  revolution did not \ndepress him: victory could be delayed but not postponed forever. His \nhigh morale was unusual. The defeats of - had a widely \ndemoralising effect upon revolutionaries. Political disarray was \naccompanied by a mushrooming interest in religion and metaphysics, \nand poets and artists sought solace in outlandish imagery and \ntechniques. The intellectual's usefulness to Russian society came \nunder question. The Pole Jan Machaisky declared that the intelligent-\nsia, though proclaiming its democratic motivations, would contrive to \ndominate the mass of the population after a revolution no less heavily \nthan the tsarist regime had done. This attack from the left was followed \nby another from the right. A group of liberal conservatives, former \nMarxists and religious mystics combined in  to produce Land-\nmarks, a book which urged intellectuals to abstain from politics and \nconcentrate upon their individual moral self-perfection. \nLenin reinforced his emphasis upon organisational control and \nideological 'purity'; he discerned no other antidote to the dissolute and \ndissolving conditions he diagnosed. The autocracy's counterrevolution-\nary offensive, he guessed, might be effective for a further three or \nfour years. His tactical aggressiveness to opponents inside the party \nincreased in . The Mensheviks, now that the Third Duma \nelections were over and Bolshevik deputies were taking their seats, \nwere less use to him than before. Lenin's campaign against them in the \nCentral Committee was relentless. \n \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe involuntary emigration of leaders like himself called for some \ninstitutional re-organisation. The Central Committee left some mem-\nbers behind to handle party affairs in Russia. Four Bolsheviks were \nparticularly active: Dubrovinski, Goldenberg, Nogin and Rozhkov. \nMeanwhile, the Menshevik presence in the Central Committee was \ndepleted by arrests. Bolsheviks exploited their advantage. They \nensured that their factional newspaper Proletari appeared frequently \nfrom autumn . By contrast Social-Democrat, which was intended \nto serve the party as a whole, was reduced by the Bolshevik-Menshevik \nstrife to only fitful publication both then and in the following year.  \nThe Menshevik N. V. Ramishvili demonstratively resigned from the \nCentral Committee in February ; and Polish members like A. \nWarski expressed growing distaste for the virulence of Bolshevik \nassaults upon adversaries.s The Central Committee met abroad on  \nAugust. A bipartite sub-structure was created. A five-man team would \ndirect the party in Russia while a new troika would handle affairs in \nWestern Europe. The Bolsheviks' influence was diminished. Golden-\nberg was to be their single representative in the team for Russia. He \nwas to be balanced by the Menshevik M. I. Broido. The other three \nmembers were to be a Pole, a Latvian and a Bundist; it was expected \nthat their influence would keep the factional rivalries to a minimum. \nThis was not to Lenin's liking. But it should not be assumed that \nBolshevik opinion in general took his attitude. There was much, in any \nevent, for the Bolsheviks to be pleased about. By late  they were \ndoing well in local party committees in Russia proper (even though \ntheir record against the Mensheviks in the Ukraine and the Caucasus \nremained less satisfactory). \nBut such committees often had little contact with rank-and-file \nmembers; Dan and Martov challenged the Bolsheviks to put their \nposition to the test of a Party Congress. The Bolshevik Centre ignored \nthem, and instructed its representatives in the Central Committee to \nrepudiate the Menshevik request. \nYet the Russian social-democrats incurring Lenin's fiercest wrath \nwere found among his own Bolsheviks. To his consternation, he heard \nin spring  that the idea of 'recalling' social-democratic deputies \nfrom the Duma was gathering a strong following in Russia. The Duma \nsocial-democratic fractions behaviour exacerbated the problem. A \nnumber of instances were reported showing that the party's deputies \nhad disregarded the Central Committee's instructions. lO The strong-\nhold of 'Recallism' was the Moscow region. u But the hostility to \nhaving party members in the Duma also found favour with committees \n Doubts and Certainties \n \nelsewhere in the empire. l Maksim Gorki strove to effect a reconcilia-\ntion between Lenin and Bogdanov. He invited them to stay with him in \nhis house on the island of Capri off the Italian mainland. Unlike \nBogdanov, Lenin for some time refused. But a minimal level of \nco-operation was unavoidable. Lenin and Bogdanov, with Dubrov-\ninski, were Proletari's editors. The newspaper had to be attended \nto. Lenin persuaded Dubrovinski to remain in the anti-Bogdanov \ncamp. Proletari must not go Recallist. Ignoring Gorki's peace-making \ngestures, Lenin made clear that he would shortly engage in an attack \nupon Bogdanov's philosophical writings. The intra-Bolshevik truce \nabout philosophy was to be terminated. Coaxed out to Capri in April \n, Lenin rejected any compromise with his former partner; he was \nalso worried lest all Bolsheviks should become branded by Plekhanov \nas renegades from Marxist philosphical 'orthodoxy' by virtue of being \nin the same faction as Bogdanov. Lenin's political views might be seen \nas 'heretical' by the guilt of association with Bogdanov. \nLenin spent several weeks in the British Museum beginning the \npreparation of his onslaught. In May , he equipped Dubrovinski \nwith criticisms of Bogdanov's epistemology to be delivered by \nDubrovinski when Bogdanov lectured in Paris. Bogdanov objected \nto Dubrovinski's vituperative comments. When Lenin rallied to \nDubrovinski's side, Bogdanov resigned from Proletari (though not \nfrom the Bolshevik Centre) rather than submit to further editorial \nhumiliation. First blood to Lenin. \nYet the Bolshevik Centre declined to appoint any of Lenin's \nconfederates in Bogdanov's stead. Its nominee was V. L. Shantser. \nHe and G. A. Aleksinski from August  were initiators of a \nmodified version of Recallism which became known as Ultimatum-\nism.s lt was simply not in the party's power, they pointed out, to recall \ndeputies from the Duma, Shantser and Aleksinski also argued that the \neighteen social-democrats, after a poor start, had done much to \ndiscomfit governmental ministers and to help in the Duma's prepara-\ntion of useful legislative projects on labour reforms. Rather than make \na futile attempt to prise them out of their Duma seats, the party should \n'allow' them to remain on condition that they obeyed the Central \nCommittee's instructions. The Ultimatumists wanted to give a formal \nwarning to the Duma fraction: either you do as you are bid, or you will \nbe expelled from the party. This was too strong for Lenin's taste, but \nnot to the extent that he could not work with Shantser. Recallism was \nanother matter. He resolved to quit the Bolshevik faction altogether \nshould Recallism win a majority in the Centre. Meanwhile he plotted \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrategy for the Fifth Party Conference, due to meet in Paris on  \nDecember . RecaIlists and Ultimatumists could muster only a \nhandful of votes; and again it was Lenin's 'centrist' motion that \nwilly-nilly won their support as being at least better than that of the \nMensheviks. But Lenin was by no means contented. Ultimatumism \ninvolved a down-grading of the significance of legal political activity. \nBogdanov himself endorsed a policy similar to Ultimatumism; and it \nseems that he combined this, even in late , with a belief in the need \nfor immediate steps to be taken to organise armed insurrection.  \nLenin would move heaven and earth to get Bogdanov removed from \nthe Bolshevik Centre. \n'MATERIALISM AND EMPIRIOCRITICISM' \nThe product of Lenin's philosophical studies was Materialism and \nEmpiriocriticism. Its subject was epistemology. Bogdanov had refined \nhis ideas between  and  in his trilogy Empiriomonism. \nLenin's assault took a year to prepare. It appeared in April . He \nhad always thought that his socio-economic analyses were fragile \nunless supported by sound philosophical struts. But he had shown only \nsporadic interest in theories of cognition. Now he made a virtue of his \nlimited expertise. His purpose, he declared, was merely to re-state the \n'orthodox' precepts of Marx and Engels; he described himself as a \n'rank-and-file Marxist' in epistemology. He re-read Marx. But it was \nEngels, Plekhanov and Chernyshevski who seem to have claimed the \nlion's share of his attention.  He foresaw that he would be accused of \nbeing 'uncritical' towards his favoured authors; he defiantly pro-\nclaimed at the outset: 'And don't cry, Machist gentlemen, that I rely \nupon \"authorities\"!' He asserted that it was better to rely upon Marx \nand Engels than upon 'bourgeois' scholarship. Stridency pervades \nthe book. No stylistic means of deriding Bogdanov was neglected. \nLenin's sister Anna, who handled the book's legal publication in \nRussia (under his old nom de plume ofV. Iin), urged him not to 'spoil' \nthe contents by an excess of denigration; she liked his poking fun at \npeople, but drew the line at his questioning of Bogdanov's honour. \nBrother Volodya was stubborn. He agreed to withdraw only such \npassages as might offend the censor. \nMany of the main positive propositions of Materialism repeat \nPlekhanov's work. Dispute already raged between Plekhanov and \nBogdanov. In  Plekhanov had gathered some early philosophical \n Doubts and Certainties \n \npieces into a book called Critique of Our Critics; in  he issued the \nfirst instalments of Materialismus Militans with Bogdanov as his target. \nPlekhanov's old themes were reiterated. He made affirmations about \nthe independent reality of the external world, about the primacy of \nmatter over mind and about man's ability to have exact knowledge of \nthe world. \nBogdanov was accused of repudiating the independent reality of the \nexternal world. In fact this was not quite what he said. He made no such \nexpress repudiation; for him, such a proposition about reality was \nsimply unamenable to verification. He began from different premises. \nCognition in his estimation was not a process whereby an external \nentity, 'matter', imposed itself upon 'mind' . The mind-matter \ndichotomy was untenable. Rather the universe was 'an endless web of \ncomplexes consisting of elements identical to elements of sensation' . \nAnd all these elements, according to Bogdanov, existed in a perma-\nnent state of interaction and mutual alteration. Cognition was not a \n'pure' act of contemplation. It was conditioned by sense-organ \nchemistry and by historically changing circumstances. 'Absolute' truth \nwas therefore a chimera. That which is true, he asserted, is that \nideology or those ideas which 'most harmoniously and elegantly' \norganise society in the existing social environment. Thus Catholicism \nhad a truthful function in mediaeval Europe inasmuch as it consoli-\ndated the contemporary socio-economic order. Das Kapital was \nanalogously describable. Marx's treatise in Bogdanov's view was not of \neternal validity but, rather, 'an objective truth' for the pre-socialist, \nindustrial societies of the epoch. For Bogdanov, ideas were a \npowerful organising 'force'. He, more than any other leading Marxist \ntheorist after Marx, emphasised the impact of 'culture' (as distinct \nfrom 'economics') upon the course of history. \nPlekhanov and Lenin regarded this as anti-Marxist. Bogdanov's \nphrasing gave them temporary advantage; he had stated, in , that \n'social being' and 'social consciousness' were the same. Marx by \ncontrast had said that social being gives rise to such consciousness. \nCharged with confounding cause and effect, Bogdanov justifiably \nreplied that his original intention had been to indicate that conscious-\nness, though conditioned by 'being', also has an interactive relation-\nship with it. But Plekhanov and Lenin had other criticisms too (and in \nany case Lenin the polemicist refused to take any notice of Bogdanov's \nrejoinders). Lenin adduced Engels's remark that materialists, among \nwhom Engels classified himself, believed in the ontological primacy of \nmatter. This led to a further assertion. Marxism, according to \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nPlekhanov and Lenin, held that the universe exists independently of \nhuman perception.s Engels's materialism lacked a definition of matter \nitself. Plekhanov, with Lenin's approval, obliged. He defined matter as \n'nothing other than the totality of things in themselves inasmuch as \nthese things are the origin of our sensations' . \nBogdanov retorted that Plekhanov's definition, far from amplifying \nEngels's materialism, had reduced it to tautology. Plekhanov's \ninterpretation of Engels was equally unacceptable to Bogdanov. \n'Things in themselves', according to Bogdanov, were used by Engels as \na convenient terminological short-hand and were not part of his \nconsidered epistemological standpoint. This does not entirely con-\nvince. Nor, for that matter, did Bogdanov address himself to Lenin's \nquotation of Engels on the subject of materialists. Yet Engels was not \nlost to Bogdanov completely. Anti-Diihring, as Bogdanov delighted in \nrepeating, insisted on the relativity of social knowledge. Engels \ndeemed absolute truth about society to be unattainable.s Bogdanov \nderived even greater succour from Marx's own texts; and he took the \nview that Engels's occasional 'lapses' made him a less reliable \ninterpreter of Marxism than Marx himself. Marx's Theses on Feuer-\nbach explicitly attacked the eighteenth-century treatment of cognition \nas the passive contemplation of object by subject. His own conception \nwas dynamic. It proposed that man not only was the product of \nmaterial and social circumstances but also could act upon and change \ncircumstances; and that the verisimilitude of his ideas is testable only \nby practical activity. Admittedly, Marx often referred to 'laws' \ngoverning socio-economic behaviour; and this lent some support to \nLenin's declaration that Marx felt that human perception could be \nabsolutely accurate. But Marx's work was not without its own \ncontradictions. His more directly philosophical remarks, especially in \nhis Theses on Feuerbach, jar against a great deal of Materialism and \nEmpiriocriticism. There is justice in Bogdanov's claim to be closer than \nLenin and Plekhanov to Marxian epistemological theory. \nThe dispute, of course, was not merely about 'orthodoxy' but \nequally about who was right. Discussions among philosophers in \nensuing years have not produced agreement. Views on the question of \nthe independent existence of the external world still differ; but Lenin's \nattitude undoubtedly has strong current backing. He would secure \nfewer sympathisers on other points. It is now more or less generally \naccepted that what knowledge we have is conditioned by the proces-\nsing effects of our sense organs. And it is a rare philosopher who \naffirms the attainability of absolute truth. \n Doubts and Certainties \n \nLenin's epistemological optimism was extreme. Plekhanov, while \ncharacterising our mental impressions as 'signifying exactly' what \nexisted in the external world, avoided the concept of absolute truth. \nMoreover, he called these impressions 'hieroglyphs'. Lenin thought \nPlekhanov to have introduced an unnecessarily indeterminate factor. \nHe rejected all talk of intermediary hieroglyphic signs. Instead he \nconceived of the mind as a sort of camera; he thought that it could copy \nreality and produce photographically accurate pictures. Lenin's more \ndefiant opposition to Bogdanov was buttressed by points that were not \nstrictly epistemological. He offered a sociological survey. Most \ncontemporary natural scientists, he \ndeclared, were \navowed \n'materialists' like himself. Thus the viewpoint of Engels and Plekhanov \ncould be represented as progressive and scientific. This brought him \nto a second contention. Lenin, following Engels, asserted that there \nwere essentially only two possible positions in epistemology: \nmaterialism and idealism. But rather than positions Lenin spoke of \n'parties' . His language had a political nuance. His 'party', he \naffirmed, was that of the materialists. On the other side stood the party \nof the idealists, and Bogdanov was to be regarded as among its newly \npaid-up members. Lenin proceeded to a third point. He claimed that \nphilosophical idealism, traditionally and currently, was associated with \nreligious faith (whereas Marxism endorsed atheism). Plekhanov and \nhe noted the recent writings of Lunacharski on the subject of \n'god-building'. They were horrified. Lunacharski proposed a humanist \n'religion'; he wished to canalise society'S existing religious feelings into \na form of worship which rejected belief in a heavenly deity and \ndirected all reverence to Man himself. Bogdanov was criticised for \nhaving epistemological opinions remarkably like Lunacharski's. \nFor his part, Lenin stated that Kapital was eternally true. It was an \ninalienable basis for all future knowledge. He concurred that not \neverything about the world was yet known. But absolute truth was still \nattainable. It would be gained through a cumulative process. Partial \ntruths of an absolute nature would be piled up on one another and would \neventually constitute the comprehensive science of the universe.o \nBogdanov made a scathing, though nowadays little-known, riposte in \nhis book Faith and Science. He repeated his view on the relativity of \nknowledge; he again adduced Marx and Engels in support. In his \ngeneral offensive against Plekhanovite epistemology, he included \nparticular attacks on Lenin. He took up Lenin's camera analogy. \nWithout knowing it, Bogdanov teased, Lenin had adopted an \nEmpiriomonist viewpoint through his references to chemically-based \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nphotographic processes. He also tackled Lenin's points on the beliefs \nof scientists, on 'party-mindedness', on religion. Bogdanov suggested \nthat his opponent had displayed a wholly unscientific, authoritarian \nspirit. Allegedly, Lenin had not shown philosophical competence. \nHis brandishing oflists of authors was, according to Bogdanov, merely \na device to disguise ignorance; it did not even mean that he had \ngenuinely read his supposed sources. Lenin hoped to intimidate. His \nquotations of Engels, moreover, were so ritualistic as to testify to the \nsame religious frame of mind that he claimed to oppose. Bogdanov \npursued the point. The essence of Lenin's position was that Marx's \nwritings were un assail ably true. This was hardly science as conven-\ntionally understood. Furthermore, Lenin's description of the attain-\nment of absolute truth was not only un-Marxist: it was also absurd. \nHow, asked Bogdanov, was it logically possible to reach the infinite by \na finite series of steps? \nEvidently these mutual criticisms by Lenin and Bogdanov were not \nmerely about cognitive psychology. Lenin in a single instance dis-\ncussed political implications. Reversing his earlier contention that \nBogdanov's practical policies were uninfluenced by his epistemology, \nhe stated that Empiriomonism was a recipe for 'voluntarism' in politics; \nand that Bogdanov, by assigning no credence to absolute truth, was in a \nposition to dream up whatever mad-cap policies he liked. Bogdanov \nhad never disowned the connection between his philosophical and \npolitical opinions. He felt that the same was not true of Lenin. For \nBogdanov, Materialism and Empiriocriticism was a piece of oppor-\ntunistic posturing designed to win immediate factional advantage. \nIn fact, both of the rival works were reflections of differing political \nattitudes. Materialism and Empiriocriticism, so far from being a \nmonument of dissembling (or, as some would have it, an aberration), \nwas an autobiographical fragment. It eulogised, by implication, the \nindividual human mind's ability to understand the world. It was, \nindirectly, a paean to the intellectual. The veracity of an idea, asserted \nLenin, was not increased in proportion to the rise in the number of \npersons believing it. Materialism was a philosophical counterpart to \nthe politics of What Is To Be Done? Through the doctrines of Marx and \nEngels, according to Lenin, the party could explain reality to the \nmasses and win them over to the revolutionary cause. None of this \nwas stated explicitly in Materialism; and indeed he refrained from \ncomment on many sections of Empiriomonism regarded by Bogdanov \nas being crucial to his world-view. Bogdanov did not confine himself to \nanalysing ideologies of the past and the present. He' called for the \n Doubts and Certainties \n \ncreation of a 'proletarian ideology' . Believing that the middle class \nheld workers in thrall as much by the dissemination of capitalist \nideology as by direct political and economic pressure, he wanted the \nparty to establish working-class schools and organisations directed at \nthe extirpation of the influence of 'bourgeois culture'. The socialist \nmovement should begin by cleansing its own house. Revolutionary \nleaders were too wedded to 'bourgeois' modes of thought; they should \ncease to presume that the intelligentsia could anticipate all the answers \nto the problems of the introduction of socialism. The party's internal \nbehaviour before the revolution should prefigure the collectivist, \ndemocratic forms of organisation to be encouraged when society as a \nwhole was launched into the transition from capitalism. It was up to \nthe workers themselves to start to develop a 'proletarian' ideology, \nusing Marxism as a broad guide, to carry the revolutionary process \nonward.a \nLenin saw Bogdanov's case as an unwarranted attack upon the \nintelligentsia (even though he himself had had harsh words about it in \nthe past); he also had a higher regard for the scientific and cultural \nachievements of capitalism than Bogdanov. Yet Lenin refused to be \ndrawn further, limiting himself to the implicit argumentation of \nMaterialism. His refusal is tantalising. He talked to no one about it. We \ncan only hazard guesses as to the reasons; but one possibility must \nsurely come into the reckoning: an attack upon Bogdanov's cultural \nprogramme would only have invited accusations of hostility to the \nnotion of independently-minded workers; he would also be branded as \na devotee of authoritarianism. Such charges would have been simplis-\ntic (though not without a large area of foundation). But mud sticks. \nProbably Lenin wished to avoid the pillorying he had received when he \npublished What Is To Be Done? \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRE \nLenin's forays against groups inside the party did not signify that he yet \naimed to abandon all co-operation with those social-democrats who \nwere not his closest supporters. In fact his self-distancing from \nBogdanov was complemented by moves towards a rapprochement \nwith Plekhanov. Here Lenin was pushing his luck. Materialism \ncontained several acidic statements about Plekhanov's works, and \nPlekhanov's friends unsurprisingly replied to Lenin in kind in their \nreviews. In addition Materialism, though sincere, was not an exhaus-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ntive exposition of its author's attitudes to cognition. Exact knowledge \nand predictability were its reiterated theme. But in other writings, both \nbefore and after , Lenin had emphasised the need for \nrevolutionaries to take gambles. Already he had often strained to \nforeshorten the schedule of political change more than was warranted \nby the 'objective' socio-economic environment; and there were \naspects of his policies in  had risked horrendously adverse \nconsequences should they have been tried in action. Lenin had his \ncontradictions. This reverse side of his epistemological outlook \nimplied that 'practice' was the test of 'theory'. It carried him close to \nBogdanovist positions. \nBut he referred to his own 'experimentalism' only in later wntmgs; It \nmay even be the case that he only became conscious of its existence \nwhen he resumed his philosophical studies in the First World War. \nPlekhanov was anyway not unresponsive to his overtures in . The \ntwo leaders shared a growing concern about trends in the Bolshevik \nand Menshevik factions. Both men rejected Ultimatumism. They noted \nthat many followers of Bogdanov wanted to boycott not only the \nDuma but also legally-permitted mass organisations such as the trade \nunions. Lenin and Plekhanov had no intention of abandoning illegal \nparty activity. The clandestine party apparatus was to be preserved. \nBut they thought it naive to neglect opportunities of influencing the \nworking class through whatever legal channels might be available. On \nthe other hand, both were opposed to the trend of so-called Liquida-\ntionism in the Menshevik faction. Many Mensheviks, led by Potresov, \nargued that the underground party committees had atrophied in \n- to an extent that made it inappropriate to make them the focal \npoint of social-democratic energies. Work should be concentrated in \nthe trade unions. Potresov did not specifically urge the liquidation of \nclandestine party activity. He simply said that such activity was already \nmoribund and should not be revivified. The niceties of this policy did \nnot interest Lenin and Plekhanov. They called Potresov a Liquidator. \nTo let the illegal party expire for want of care, in their opinion, was \ntantamount to killing it. Plekhanov urged Mensheviks to ostracise the \nLiquidators. Martov and Dan, while disagreeing with Potresov's \nindifference to the underground party, ignored Plekhanov's summons. \nPlekhanov thereupon abandoned the Menshevik faction.  His action \nmeant that there were now three organised trends in Menshevism: \nMartov's Mensheviks, the Liquidators and Plekhanov's Party Men-\nsheviks. \nNeither Lenin nor Plekhanov ceased to object to each other's \n Doubts and Certainties \n \nprogrammatic intentions in other areas. Theirs would be a conditional \nalliance.o They vied even about the matter which had brought them \ntogether in the first place: legal activity. Until  it had been party \npolicy to spread revolutionary ideas in the unions without insisting that \nthe unions give formal allegiance to the party. Plekhanov continued to \nhold this view, as did Mensheviks of all types. \nLenin, however, shifted his ground. Now he called on the party to \nseek to get trade unions to affiliate themselves to it. He reportedly \neven toyed with the suggestion to accord voting rights to affiliated \nunions at Party Congresses on a parity with the normal underground \ncommittees; But he had second thoughts, perhaps recoiling from a \nplan which would infringe the principle of the party's hegemony of the \nlabour movement (or perhaps simply because he foresaw insuperable \nopposition from his own section of the Bolshevik faction). In any case \nthe episode revealed how strongly committed he remained to con-\nsolidating the party's influence in the trade unions. This necessitated a \nsettling of organisational accounts with Bogdanov. Lenin's objective \nwas clear. He aimed to win the Bolshevik Centre to his side and force \nBogdanov's exodus. His tactics were attributable to his political \nforcefulness. And they were facilitated to some extent by the financial \nindependence he at last in  enjoyed from Bogdanov and Krasin. A \nwealthy young man called N. P. Shmidt had died in . He had left \nhundreds of thousands of roubles for disbursal to organisations \nsupporting the cause of revolution in Russia; his two sisters were to \nsupervise the distribution. The Bolsheviks V. K. Taratuta and A. M. \nAndrikanis paid court to the women in a successful attempt to get \ncontrol of the monies. Taratuta handed over his fortune, or a goodly \nportion of it, to Lenin. \nAnimosity between Lenin and Bogdanov increased. On  February \n Lenin broke off personal relations, ending a friendship begun in \n. The battle was on for the Bolshevik Centre. The scene was set \nfor a final confrontation at a meeting of the editorial board of the \nBolshevik newspaper Proletari; all members of the Bolshevik Centre \nwere to be invited. \nThe board meeting, lasting from  to  June, was basically a \nconference of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin proposed a resolution \ncondemning Recallism and Ultimatumism. He grumbled that the \nMensheviks were amused that members of his faction were accusing \nhim of being a Menshevik; and that Bogdanov had refrained from \ndefending him against the charge. The conclusion was obvious: \ndifferences of principle separated the two tendencies in Bolshevism. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin declared: 'There is nothing worse than an absence of open \nstruggle'. Recallism and Ultimatum ism were denounced as being \nun-Bolshevik; it was urged that a 'decisive fight' be begun with all such \n'deviations from the path of revolutionary Marxism'. The meeting \ndenounced Lunacharski's 'god-building'. It also criticised Bogdanov \nfor planning to set up a school for party workers on the island of Capri. \nBogdanov protested that his views were being misrepresented. He \nclaimed in particular that he was not hostile to the party's participating \nin legal mass organisations. M. P. Tomski, who had just left Russia, \nrounded on him. Bogdanov's claim did not alter the fact that few \nRecallists or UItimatumists were entering trade unions. Still moving \nwith Lenin, the meeting approved Dubrovinski's motion seeking an \nalliance with Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks. The meeting's next step \nwas to confirm the anti-Recallist policy organisationally. Bogdanov \nwas to be driven out of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin had been charging \nhim with aiming at a total 'split'; but, on Tomski's suggestion, the \nmeeting reformulated the indictment: Bogdanov was said not to have \ndivided the faction but to have broken away from it. Lenin approved. \nHe liked the implication that Bogdanov's real influence over party \ncommittees in Russia had never been great enough to threaten a split. \nWith the departure of Bogdanov on  June, Lenin had won his \nvictory. The Bolshevik Centre could now quickly complete the \nremaining business. This was in fact a trying time for Lenin. In the \nmoment of his triumph he was to witness the Bolshevik Centre taking \ndecisions which made his organisational position weaker in many ways \nthan it had been before the meeting. Trouble began with I. P. \nGoldenberg's report. Goldenberg supported the request of the Duma \ndeputies to found their own newspaper in St. Petersburg. Lenin was far \nfrom keen. He hinted that such a newspaper would not necessarily \npursue a consistently Bolshevik line. But Goldenberg's proposal was \ncarried. The meeting then discussed the work of the Central \nCommittee. Arrests in  had again undermined activity. It was \nagreed that the situation would be improved if the emigre press were \nre-organised. Proletari was criticised. Delegates from Russia felt that \nLenin's editorial policy had given too much space to theoretical \ndisquisitions; they urged the creation of a popular workers' daily. A. I. \nRykov proposed Proletari's closure but in the end Goldenberg's \ncompromise was accepted: Proletari was to be turned from a weekly \ninto a monthly. This was bad enough for Lenin. But worse ensued \nwhen it was decided to undertake negotiations with Trotski, who \nalready ran a popular social-democratic newspaper called Pravda (or \n Doubts and Certainties \n \nTruth) in Vienna. The plan was to persuade Trotski to make Pravda a \njoint venture with the Bolsheviks. Lenin's reservations were ignored. \nMost delegates, while approving Bogdanov's expulsion from the \nfaction in order to exploit more fully the legal political opportunities in \nRussia, were reluctant to regard the Plekhanovite Party Mensheviks as \ntheir only allies. A more general worry was also voiced. The meeting \nconcurred that emigre factitiousness had got out of hand. A cure was \nproposed. Bolshevik Centre members operating in Russia were to be \npermitted to take decisions without constant reference to members \nabroad; the 'Russian' party was to be freed from 'foreign' entangle-\nments. \nNot only was this an implicit indication to Lenin that certain of his \nbasic tactical recommendations were unacceptable. It was also a \npractical limitation on his activity in the immediate future; he had \ndisengaged himself from Bogdanov only to find himself even more \nclosely controlled by his colleagues than before. \nLENIN'S DEFEAT \nInitially he accepted the position phlegmatically. But a great lassitude \ncame over him (as it had in his previous time of trial in ). Wanting \nfresh air, he retreated to a rented villa in the countryside outside \nParis. Thoughts about his position gnawed at him. It annoyed him to \nconsider what Rykov and Goldenberg might be getting up to in Russia. \nMatters were no better in France. The Bolshevik leadership chose A. I. \nLyubimov to act as the Centre's secretary. Lyubimov had taken a \nconstant stand against Lenin's divisive tactics. He was a leading \nBolshevik Conciliator. Lenin could have been forgiven for feeling \nnostalgic about his earlier years in Switzerland. Before  he had \nnot won every political battle inside the Bolshevik fold; but at least he \nhad been in operational control of the faction's emigre team. In \nmid- the sensation of organisational impotence bore heavily upon \nhim. He complained about his 'nerves' . He was not eating very well, \nand it was noticed how thin and pale he had become.o Not until \nmid-August did he feel recovered; and around the middle of Sep-\ntember he returned to Paris. He had formulated tactics. He aimed at \nthe overturning of all the resolutions made in June  which had \ndispleased him. He had attempted, as early as August, to keep \nLyubimov from negotiating too gently with Trotski. Apparently the \nBolshevik Centre was finding it difficult to secure parity of editorial \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority over the Viennese Pravda; Lenin urged Lyubimov to stand \nfirm. It was Lenin's hope that Trotski would be discouraged from \nfurther co-operation with the Bolsheviks. To Zinoviev, he was candid. \nTrotski was to be seen as 'the basest careerist'. \nLyubimov took no notice. Nor did Rykov and Goldenberg in Russia. \nA Duma by-election in St. Petersburg led to the setting up of an \nelectoral commission of social-democrats. Rykov joined it. The other \nmembers included a Menshevik and a Liquidator. \nLenin then exercised the little power left to him in Paris. Krupskaya \nbelonged to the Bolsheviks' Financial Commission, which was respon-\nsible for sending funds to Russia. Rykov, in Lenin's view, was in \nbreach of the anti-Liquidator decisions of June . The Financial \nCommission was therefore persuaded to cut off monetary support to \nhim. But this was but one small victory, achieved at the price of \nalienating Rykov still further. It occurred, moreover, at a moment \nwhen Lenin's own financial management was coming under scrutiny. \nThe Mensheviks raised a hue and cry about Lenin's insistence that \nBolsheviks should retain the Shmidt inheritance for their own \nexclusive use even though the deceased man had not specified a single \nfaction as the sole beneficiary. Opinion was hardening against Lenin \namong his Bolshevik colleagues. Why, they wondered, was he \npersistently calling for a 'war' upon Martov's Mensheviks when \nnobody doubted that Bolshevik influence in the unified central party \napparatus was strong? Was this not evidence of obsessive intransig-\nence? Goldenberg believed so, and went ahead with overtures to \nMartov in late . Even Zinoviev's loyalty was eroded. In the \nautumn, Lenin submitted an article to the party's central newspaper \nSocial-Democrat calling for a renewed assault upon Recallists and \nLiquidators. The editorial board discussed this at a two-day meeting \nstarting on  October. Zinoviev pointedly abstained from voting, and \nLenin's article was turned down for publication. o Lenin was furious. \nHe instantly resigned his editorial post with Social-Democrat.  \nIt is difficult not to sympathise with those of his colleagues who were \nlosing patience with him. Nobody has been able to show that Recallism \nhad more than very slight support in Russia in late ; and the \nUltimatumists had in any case never stood very distant from Lenin's \nown attitude to Duma deputies: he had always urged that the \nsocial-democratic fraction comply with Central Committee policies.  \nOutright Liquidationism too was a declining force. Few activists any \nlonger expressed disinterest in the illegal party apparatus. A meeting \nwas held, in the autumn, of leaders involved in the legal labour \n Doubts and Certainties \n \norganisations of St. Petersburg; it was attended by the prominent trade \nunionist R. V. Malinovski. The necessity of keeping clandestine party \ncells was endorsed overwhelmingly.l Apparently such views were \nheld widely across the Russian empire.l \nThe Bolshevik Centre set itself the task of pulling the entire \nsocial-democratic movement together under its leadership. Lenin had \nsustained an organisational set-back. He also had another of his \nbicycling accidents, injuring himself sufficiently badly to impel him to \nstart legal proceedings against the driver of the car that hit him. lOS But \nhis colleagues were not unduly brutal to him. Kamenev, Lyubimov and \nZinoviev persuaded him to retract his resignation from Socia/-\nDemocrat; and he acceded, probably relieved that nobody had called \nhis bluff, on  October . Lyubimov pressed on. Unlike Lenin, \nhe wished to see representatives of all Bolsheviks and all Mensheviks \nworking together in the Central Committee; his other priority was to \nre-establish the Central Committee's organisational presence in \nRussia. Bolshevik leaders in Russia supported him.l A meeting of the \nBolshevik Centre was held in Paris on  November. The decision was \ntaken to convoke a plenum of the Central Committee to be attended \nby all the party's factions. Lenin appended his signature to the \ndecision. lOB It can scarcely have been a joyful occasion for him. \nThroughout  he had behaved as if only his group inside \nBolshevism and Plekhanov's inside Menshevism were legitimate \nconstituent elements of the party. Now his own group opposed such \nbehaviour and wanted to re-combine with Martov, albeit in the hope \nthat this would not lead to a significant diminution of Bolshevik \nauthority in the Central Committee. Bogdanov would be in attendance \nas a candidate member; and Trotski too would be invited along (in his \ncapacity as editor of Pravda) . \nThe plenum lasted from  to  January . Lenin's tactics were \nakin to those of a general who, receiving reconnaissance information \nthat conditions are unfavourable for an offensive, nevertheless goes \nthrough with it on the grounds that inactivity is bad for the morale of \nthe troops. There was, however, a crucial difference. Lenin had few \ntroops. \nHe went to the sessions with a motion entitled 'The Situation in the \nParty'. It apparently repeated the summons to a struggle against the \nRecallists and the Liquidators.llo The Central Committee agreed that \nRecallism and Liquidationism were harmful. Yet Lenin's militance \nwas rejected. The plenum accepted an amendment from Trotski to the \neffect that the two 'deviations' should be dealt with by means of a \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \n'widening and deepening of social-democratic work' . Comradely \npersuasion, not administrative sanction, was to be the method used. \nThe plenum recognised that verbal formulations alone would not alter \nthe real state of affairs. Concrete measures were needed. It was even \ndecided that the various factional centres should be abolished. The \nBolshevik Centre was to dissolve itself. Factional newspapers such as \nProletari were to cease publication.ll Past disputes in the party had \nbeen exacerbated by the behaviour of the emigres. Accordingly the \nseven-person Russian Board of the Central Committee was given the \nright to act autonomously in the Central Committee's name. The \nMensheviks were determined to spare Lenin no humiliation. His \ntreatment of the Shmidt monies was discussed. And, to his mortifica-\ntion, he was obliged to agree to hand them over. Some were to pass \nimmediately to the Central Committee; the rest were to be held in \ntrusteeship by the German Social-Democratic Party leaders Karl \nKautsky, Franz Mehring and Klara Zetkin. His own Bolsheviks \nwere no less keen on the changes than were Martov, Trotski and \nBogdanov; the turnabout that had occurred in the Bolshevik Centre in \nJune  was being repeated just a few months later in the Central \nCommittee. \nREPUTATION AND STATURE \nAs we leave Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-Lenin in his fortieth year, after the \nJanuary  Central Committee plenum, we note that his impact on \nthe party had never been smaller, his prestige never lower. His \nisolation was greater even than in the first half of . \nAnd yet we must not dismiss him so casually. If he had died in , \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party would have remembered \nhim as something more than just a troublemaker. He remained a \nleader of stature. He occupied a place in the uppermost storey of the \nparty. Others did the same. It was tacitly understood that figures like \nPlekhanov, Martov, Maslov, Bogdanov, Trotski and Lenin had earned \nthemselves a position above the rest of the leadership. There was an \nimmeasurable but real 'weight' about them. They did not bar acess to \nnewcomers. With its high regard for the articulation of theory and \nstrategy, the emigre fraternity accepted several younger men with \nfresh ideas such as Nikolai Bukharin and Yuri Pyatakov.ll But there \nwas little replacement of personnel at the top; the older leaders \nremained. They knew each other well, having been together in a \n Doubts and Certainties \n \nvariety of testing conditions: in clandestine activity in Russia, in the \ncommunity of emigration, and in the semi-open politics of Russia in \n-. Each had proved his mettle in the general estimation of his \npeers. Of course, all of them were building careers before a very \nrestricted world of observers; no more than a few thousand persons in \nthe Russian empire can have heard of their names and read their \nworks. Inside that world, however, their fame was boundless. They \nwere indeed the party's luminaries. \nTo be sure, disagreements had dogged their relationships. They \nwere not a happy family. Yet they had valued the ties of kinship. \nPolemicism, even for them, had its limits. And it was largely because \nLenin in  continued to propose the dissolution of the family that \nhis fellow leaders queried whether he deserved their esteem any \nlonger. \nThe decline in Lenin's reputation by no means plumbed the lowest \npossible depths. His emigre colleagues continued to acknowledge his \ngifts as a theorist. Even Bogdanov, who treated his philosophising as \nignorant cant, saw him as an economist of importance.ll Bolshevik \nConciliators, moreover, did not disown his writings on political theory. \nMenshevik leaders were loather to pay him compliments; but they \nrarely were as contemptuous of his economic expertise as Martynov \nhad been at the Fifth CongressYs Undeniably, no Menshevik spared \ncriticism of Lenin's political ideas. His strategical statements were \nregarded by Martov's group as dangerous nonsense. Charges of \n'populism' and 'lacobinism' had been made in . Lenin, it had been \nsaid, was quintessentially a 'voluntarist' who would not recognise \nenvironmental constraints.ll By contrast, left-wing Bolsheviks in \n- accused him of the diametrical opposite: historical fatalism.  \nHis entire oeuvre was controversial. But the many critics, in all their \nvariety, conceded that a residue of substance existed in his theoretical \noutput. By , his career's wheel had therefore turned full circle. \nUntil the late s he had impressed primarily as a writer, not as an \norganiser. He had developed his practical skills gradually. He had \nshown ruthless flair in founding Iskra and co-ordinating communica-\ntion with groups in Russia.  But his organisational divisiveness \nalienated an ever-increasing number of emigre social-democrats. \nMoreover, there was no longer a shortage of leaders who could cope \nwith administrative duties. He was not indispensable. His own nearest \ncolleagues implied that his activity led to greater disorganisation than \norganisation. Ex-collaborators like Martov and Bogdanov denounced \nhis authoritarian style; Gorki came to regard him as a misanthrope. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nThus what was left of Lenin's positive reputation abroad had come to \nrest upon his ideas and his writings. \nHis standing in the party in Russia itself is less easy to assess. He had \nhis admirers. V. S. Dovgalevski offered the following description to \nprovincial colleagues: 'This is a magnificent propagandist and agitator, \na brilliant diplomat and politician, wholly intelligible to the broad \nmasses, valuable alike in the professorial chair and at the workers' \ngathering, combining in himself everything necessary for a party \nchief.' \nSuch glowing approval was far from universal, even among Bol-\nsheviks. For years there had been hostility to emigre disputatiousness. \nIt was difficult for underground activists to follow the details of the \nwranglings in Western Europe; but they were acquainted well enough \nwith the basic situation. And, when police files were seized in , the \nrecord of arrests of social-democratic groups indicated that Lenin's \nmajor works were widely known. This was tribute to his status as a \ntheorist. But it also meant that activists across Russia were aware of his \ndisruptive role. F. I. Goloshchekin, a Bolshevik who opposed Bog-\ndanov's attitude to the Duma, wrote from St. Petersburg in late  \nimploring the emigres to terminate disputes about Recallism (which, \nhe suggested, was withering on the vine in Russia without need of \nartificial poison). Negative evidence reinforces the point. It is \naltogether remarkable how little material has been produced to \ndemonstrate that elements in the Russian party continued to hold him \ncomprehensively in esteem as a practical leader. His reputation for \ncrankiness grew. Even Stalin, who was operating in the oil-town of \nBaku and who was not unknown for a penchant for vehement \npolemics, thought that Lenin had overdone his assault on Bogdanov. \nMaterialism and Empiriocriticism, he stated, was 'a storm in a glass of \nwater' . \nThis fall-off in the appreciation of his qualities irritated Lenin, but \ndid not crush him. There remained much to be pleased about. True, he \nwas accused of dishonourable conduct; he was also notorious for \nperceiving great issues of principle where others saw only practical \nminutiae. Yet few indicted him on grounds of complete insincerity. \nConsequently, however underhand and ruthless he was in action, he \nwas still widely treated as a serious man with serious ideas. The fact \nthat he obviously relished the possession of authority did not detract \nfrom this. His enormous potentiality as a party chief was commonly \nrecognised. Even in -, when his behaviour had never been \n Doubts and Certainties \n \nmore intemperate, he could often charm his adversaries. The \ncontents of his statements and policies were frequently provocative. \nBut he usually refrained from angry public outbursts; Vladimir \nMedem, a member of the Bund and no friend of the Bolsheviks, was \namazed by Lenin's capacity to remain impassive when being haran-\ngued or insulted. Lenin's passion was poured into his politics. He \nwas chary of any activity that might deflect his commitment even \nmarginally; he gave up both playing chess and listening to Beethoven \non these grounds. He explained that the beauty of the Appassionata \ndisturbed him so much as to make him forget that in order to create a \nbetter political order it was necessary to 'bang people over the head' . \nHe was, then, not devoid of candour. Little wonder that not only \nadmirers but also critics sensed that he was every inch a Leader. A \nshort sentence from a private letter of Anatoli Lunacharski to his wife \ngives a neat illustration. Relations between him and Lenin had \nworsened after . Yet Lunacharski could write, in self-\ncongratulation, about a conversation with Lenin: 'He is terribly \nsatisfied with me.' These are the words of someone who feels \nanother's dominance to be in the natural order of things. \nAnd so the vista of opportunities perceived by Vladimir Iich \nUlyanov-Lenin in early  was not uniformly sombre. At the nadir \nof his fortunes, this irrepressible optimist intended to re-scale the \nheights. He aimed to climb higher than before. He would not give up \nthe struggle for his policies, even should the entire party condemn him. \nThere was to be no relenting. He felt that his colleagues' indulgence to \nother social-democratic factions constituted peril for the entire \nrevolutionary movement; and the keenness of this feeling imparted \nurgency to his campaign. He had to win back his Bolsheviks. Without \nthem, nothing was achievable. He needed a firm organisational base. \nThe current condition of his reputation and influence did not worry \nhim unduly. It was not an accurate gauge of his significance. Works like \nWhat Is To Be Done? and Two Tactics of Russian Social-Democracy \nhad made a durable imprint upon Bolshevism. He had never, not even \nin late , held a monopoly of power in the Bolshevik faction, and \nseveral of his strategic aims had persistently been rejected by his \nco-factionalists. It is true, too, that several portions of his writing \nmerely summarised general opinion amongst Bolsheviks and were \nbereft of originality. Yet he also at times showed both practical \nbrilliance and intellectual profundity. His thought and his methods had \nleft a mark. In  he was still only forty. He was full of zeal and \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nresolve. Time alone would show whether he could re-take his faction, \ntransform it into a powerful party, and prepare that party to win the \nfavour of Russia's working class and peasantry. \n",
    "1910-1914": "   All or Nothing: \n- \nCONFLICTS IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nThe political life of Vladimir Ilich Lenin was avidly scrutinised by the \nsubjects of the former Russian empire from , and foreign \npoliticians and commentators strove to stay abreast of his career. \nFew statesmen had attracted an examination of this intensity. Not \nsince the days of Napoleon Bonaparte had an individual so deeply \nintrigued and exercised world opinion. This extraordinary fascination \nwas evoked by the nature of the new regime's projects. The first \nsocialist state had been born. The objective of pan-European \nrevolution was triumphantly proclaimed. The natural reflex of \ncontemporaries was to enquire what sort of man had led the \nBolshevik march on power. Faulty communications inside Russia \nand the disruption caused in Europe by the battles on the Western \nand Eastern fronts made it difficult to gather information on him; \nbut his articles in Pravda provided much material. Many decrees of \nthe new Soviet government were written by him; he also granted \noccasional interviews. Books which he had written before the First \nWorld War were republished with large print-runs. Diplomats \nreported back to their governments from Petrograd. Few observers \ndoubted that the main inspirer of the October Revolution was Lenin. \nHis declaration that the era of European socialist revolution was \nimminent, and that the Bolsheviks of Russia would inaugurate it, \ncaused ubiquitous frissons of excitement. \nAnd yet seven years earlier, in , none of Lenin's contempor-\naries had any presentiment of what the future ht:d in store for him. \nBefore the First World War his name had become a synonym, among \nRussian revolutionaries, for intolerance. But no one had to take him \nunduly seriously until . The consensus had been that he was a \ntroublemaker who would come to no good end; and that he was \ncausing most trouble inside his own Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party. It had crossed nobody's mind that Lenin would soon \nbe a realistic contender for supreme power in his native land. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had not expressed such a thought; he had not even given the \nimpression that a pan-European socialist revolution was an imminent \npossibility.  In the pre-war days his priority had been to exert \nauthority within the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. He \ngenuinely detested the entire political and social order of capitalism \nin his country and abroad; his will to rid society of oppression and \nexploitation gave meaning to his life. But his energies in emigration \nwere focused on the party's internal struggles, and he took an \naggressive fanaticism to the extreme. The Central Committee at its \nJanuary  plenum had tried to restrain him. A straitjacket of \nstipulations, designed with him in mind, had been applied. Lenin and \nhis Bolsheviks were not explicitly censured, but were asked to \ndismantle their separate factional centre. Their newspaper, \nProletari, had to cease publication. They were also to hand over \nthe finances acquired by them from N. P. Shmidt's legacy to three \nGerman socialist trustees. The Central Committee, based mainly in \nthe Russian empire, was to resume charge of a reunited party; and a \ngeneral party newspaper, Social-Democrat, was to be refounded. \nBolsheviks were to desist from their polemics against the Liquidators \nand the Ultimatumists. The Liquidators were Russian Marxists who \nrefused to belong to illegal party organisations on the grounds that \nthe police had broken them up and the State Duma and the legal \nlabour movement offered greater chances of political advance. The \nUltimatumists, on the other hand, were committed to the illegal \nparty organisations and wished those party members who had \nsecured electiof! to the State Duma (or parliament) to be constrained \nto speak strictly within the guidelines of party policies. Liquidators \nand Ultimatumists were detested equally by Lenin, who wanted both \na strengthening of the illegal committees and the flexible use of the \nDuma as a forum for party propaganda.  \nOther Bolsheviks at the plenum had not demurred at the plenum's \ndecisions. On the contrary, they too hoped that Lenin would mend \nhis ways. But they had not gone through the learning process of an \nall-out contest with Lenin. Yuli Martov as a Menshevik had \nendured this experience, and was less optimistic about the chances \nof the straitjacket remaining secure. He had co-operated in the \nplenum because he had always assumed that a united party was \ndesirable. No Menshevik was truly optimistic about the prospects of \nunity. But all of them recognised that the alternative was to do \nnothing at all, and allow Lenin to call them splitters and enemies of \nthe party. \n All or Nothing \n \nImmediately after the plenum, Lenin started to pick the locks. He \ndid so, but not like some political Houdini, out of sight and with a \nshowman's mystery: he relished the display. First of all he needled \nMartov, his fellow editor of Social-Democrat, by trying to include \ncritical comments on the Menshevik deputies to the State Duma. \nOnly a flurry of letters with the Polish representative on the editorial \nboard obviated total rupture. On  February , invoking his \nauthority as co-editor of Social-Democrat, he published an article \nironically entitled 'Towards Unity'. It renewed the onslaught on \nLiquidationism and Ultimatumism, and the verbal formulas were \nonly slightly less ferocious than in the previous year. In March he \nwent further, by accusing Martov of wanting to relax the party's \ncontrol over its members in the legal labour movement in Russia.  He \ntaxed Martov's associate, Fedor Dan, with exuding 'a Liquidationist \nspirit' (even though the Mensheviks heartily supported the main-\ntenance of the underground party committees). There was cunning \nin this. The January  plenum, though calling off any campaign \nagainst Liquidationism, proposed that the Liquidators ought to be \npersuaded to alter their views. Lenin contrived to imply that the \nMenshevik leaders had overturned the plenum's resolution. This, in \nhis estimation, freed him to resume his earlier themes. He announced \nthat the Bolsheviks would re-establish a factional organ, which he \nwanted to call The Workers' Newspaper.  Publication began on  \nOctober  and, under Lenin's control, an open struggle was \nresumed against all opponents of Bolshevism. \nNot even this satisfied Lenin. By December  he was requesting \nthe remittance of the Shmidt monies to his faction and to his alone.  \nHis demand was aimed at abrogating the arrangements made at the \nJanuary  Central Committee. He did not describe them as such. \nMany fellow Bolsheviks among the Marxist emigres distrusted his \nintense anti-Menshevism, and these still desired party unity. They \nwanted to keep up the fight against the Mensheviks without driving \nthem into a separate party. It was a tactical finesse that Lenin \nscorned. Only a few close supporters, such as Grigori Zinoviev \nwanted an organisational split, and even he was far from approving \nthe whole gamut of Lenin's proposals to deal with non-Bolshevik \ngroups in the party.  The Mensheviks had become accustomed to \ncalling him the chief of Bolshevism. Now, at Central Committee \nmeetings, they beheld the delicious spectacle of Bolsheviks har-\nanguing their leader.  To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of . But this was small satisfaction for him; he had \n  \nLenin: ~ Political Life \nsurged back only to where he had been in  - hardly a year he \nrecalled with pleasure.  \nIn the emigration as well as in the Russian empire, moreover, the \nfeeling persisted that greater attention should be paid to activity and \npropaganda in Russia. Lenin was regarded as one of those many \nemigres whose Alpine disputations distracted the party from its \nobjective of making revolution in St Petersburg.  The Russian \nsecret police undertook sophisticated measures to hunt down leading \nrevolutionaries. In autumn , two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches. The Central Committee \nhad created an inner subcommittee, the Russian Bureau, to direct its \naffairs from inside the empire; and two further Bolsheviks belonging \nto it were arrested at the end of the same year.  Bolsheviks remained \non the Central Committee, but none of these were enthusiasts for \nLenin's factionalism. As Lenin ruefully noted, they were Bolshevik \nConciliators.  Their insistence on keeping a united central apparatus \nwas so much to his distaste that he claimed that they constituted a \nseparate faction.  No less irritating was the support they had from \nthe Polish and Latvian representatives in the Central Committee.  \nAnd, although Lenin wished the Bolsheviks to form a separate party, \nit was as yet impolitic to articulate such a desire.  By December  \nhe had concluded that another Central Committee plenum might \nbreak the stalemate. Its membership in emigration contained more \nBolsheviks than Mensheviks, and Lenin presumably counted upon \nwinning some Conciliators to his side. The Menshevik leaders did not \ndemur, but subtly suggested that the location of the plenum should \nbe in Russia. They were playing upon the idea, which was not \npeculiar to Mensheviks, that the main aptitude of the emigres lay in \nfomenting internal party conflict. \nLenin punched back. The real intention of the Mensheviks, he \ncontended, was to facilitate the round-up of the Central Committee \nby the Okhrana (or political police).  This counter-attack was his \nmost shameful statement in these years. Mensheviks impassively \nasked him to explain what made him think that they wished to assist \nthe imperial regime. Again Lenin aimed his blows low. Menshevik \nstrategy, he asserted, neglected the illegal party organisations; and \nMensheviks allegedly confined themselves to the legal framework of \npolitics erected by the emperor, Nikolai II and his Chairman of the \nCouncil of Ministers, P. A. Stolypin, in . It was therefore no \ncoincidence that no Menshevik member of the Central Committee \nhad recently been caught and imprisoned. \n All or Nothing \n \nThe Okhrana's ability to set one faction against another in the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party by a judiciously selective \npolicy of arrests should not be underestimated; but Lenin's imputa-\ntion of deliberate connivance by the Mensheviks was scandalous. Yet \nan unexpected result of the altercations was a sudden consensus that \na Central Committee plenum should be convoked. Lenin wanted it in \norder to aggravate disputes and insulate all Bolsheviks from the rest \nof the party; the other leaders, from the Mensheviks through to the \nBolshevik Conciliators, desired it so as to eliminate factionalism once \nand for all. Lev Trotski urged that a fresh initiative should be made \nand that a full Party Conference, with properly elected delegates \nfrom local groups in Russia, should be organised. The endless \ndisputes after the Central Committee plenum of January  \ndemonstrated that a comprehensive examination of the party's \ncondition was necessary. But his proposal was considered too \nexpensive in time and finance. Trotski's emigre journalism, with \narticles excoriating the 'Leninists' for their intransigence and \nsectarianism, increased his influence. It was little relief to Lenin \nthat his opponent had no organised followers in Russia. To some \nextent this was Trotski's deliberate choice; he wanted to stand \noutside and above factional squabbles, and made no attempt to set \nup yet another faction. Trotski was a talented pamphleteer and \norganiser. His pleas for party unity were bound to have an impact on \nthe forthcoming Central Committee meeting. \nConsequently Lenin inveighed against him more than any other \nRussian Marxist, in -  accusing him of 'adventurism'. He \nalso invented a nickname for him: 'little Judas'. Trotski was Jewish; \nand, in most contexts, such nomenclature would have carried an anti-\nsemitic resonance. This was not Lenin's conscious intention.  \nRather, it was an attempt to liken Trotski to a character called \nLittle Judas, in a well-known nineteenth-century Russian novel, who, \nin a family whose members were engaged in perpetual animosities, \nindefatigably tried to create an unnatural atmosphere of sweetness \nand light. Trotski's ultra-leftism in the sphere of Marxist political \nstrategy did not prevent him from rallying to those Mensheviks in \nRussia who had hit upon the idea of collecting signatures for a \nworkers' petition for the government to grant full freedom of \nassociation.  Trotski saw that this would constitute only a 'partial' \nreform of the political system; but, unlike the Bolsheviks, he argued \nthat a 'petition campaign' would enhance the standing of socialism \namidst the working class. According to Lenin and Zinoviev, such a \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nstandpoint merely brought Trotski together with the Liquidators in \nan unholy and unprincipled alliance.  Trotski's ideas were distorted \nby his Bolshevik critics: he continued to assert that both violent and \npeaceful political methods ought to be undertaken by the party.  \nAnd yet he would have stood a better chance of inhibiting Lenin's \ndisruptiveness if the Mensheviks had not been so inept. The long-\nheralded plenum of the Central Committee met for a whole week \nstarting on  May . No Menshevik leader was willing to repeat \nwhat they regarded as the charade of January . B. Go rev, their \nrepresentative, walked out when his faction's views were ignored. \nThen Mark Liber from the Jewish Bund joined him when the meeting \nopted to maintain pressure on the so-called Liquidators. \nThe Bolsheviks, for neither the first not the last time, were being \nhelped by the voluntary exodus of their enemies. Supported by the \nrepresentatives of both the Polish and Latvian autonomous sections \nof the All-Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, they called for \nthe convocation of a Conference in the near future. A Foreign \nOrganisational Commission was chosen to co-ordinate activity \noutside Russia, and a Technical Commission was to handle the \nparty's treasury. Meanwhile a Russian Organisational Commission \nwas to direct the party in the Russian empire.  The Bolshevik \nConciliator, A. I. Lyubimov, and the Pole Leo Jogiches, had held the \nring at the meeting, and Lenin went on complaining of their \nprominence.  His influence was therefore neither unchallengeable \nnor unchallenged. But he had recovered much strength in the central \nparty apparatus and was in better shape to win his future fights than \na year before. The Mensheviks, for comprehensible reasons but with \nscant sense of tactics, had stormed out. The resistance to Lenin's \nonslaughts in the following months was bound to be weaker; and the \ncomposition of the forthcoming Party Conference was ever likelier to \nproduce a triumph for him. His grand objective was evidently to set \nup a totally separate party. The odds against achievement were \nshortening. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class. \n All or Nothing \n \nEmployers launched an offensive after the upheaval of -. Real \nwages were lowered; unemployment persisted; strikes diminished. \nPrime minister P. A. Stolypin allowed only limited freedom for trade \nunions. They were disallowed from establishing national networks, \nand non-workers were prohibited from belonging to their executive \nboards.  The police, guarding against infiltration by subversives, \nclosed down about six hundred such unions before . Initially it \nwas the Mensheviks who won most elections to trade union boards. \nThe Bolshevik ambition to use the legal labour movement as a means \nof communicating with and guiding the working class was still only \nweakly realised.  \nBut the tide was on the turn. Industrial production grew sharply \nfrom around , and the Russian recession was surmounted. \nEstimates suggest that output rose by an annual average of  per \ncent in the decade before the First World War.  Government \ncontracts for armaments, especially in the reconstruction of the \nRussian fleet annihilated by the Japanese at Tsushima in , \nstimulated the metallurgical sector. But the factories were also \nexpanding production for non-defence needs: textile enterprises \ncontinued to constitute the largest industry and, together with those \nconnected with food-processing, supplied about a half the value of \nthe empire's total industrial output. Investment poured in from \nabroad. mines and manufacturing plants acquired the most modern \ntechnology; Russia obtained some of the vastest factories, with the \nlargest labour forces in Europe. The workforce took advantage of \nthis expansion. They had been taught by the revolution <;>f - to \nhate the political system; and skilled workers in particular were less \nthreatened by unemployment. Strikes returned to the scene. Official \nrecords state that the number rose to  in . The unrest \noccurred, as had been usual, without being co-ordinated by the trade \nunions. Nor were the revolutionary parties the instigators. The Party \nof Socialist Revolutionaries had made efforts to recruit workers to its \nranks in this period. But the Okhrana found it no more difficult to \ncrush such endeavours than it had done with Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. \nBolsheviks saw that the opportunities for political advance were \nnone the less increasing; and the need to enhance involvement in the \nlabour movement, both legal and illegal, was conventional wisdom. \nLenin was no better informed about the increasing unrest than any \nother emigre leader. The reunification of the various factions in \nWestern Europe had deprived him of a separate agency of commu-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nnication. Bolshevik activists moved between Russia and the emigra-\ntion; but it was generally agreed that the Okhrana had shattered \nmany of the old links. \nLenin's objective was to use the instrumentalities available since \nthe May  meeting of the Central Committee to convoke a Party \nConference; and to ensure that the Conference should take place \nentirely under Bolshevik auspices. He was convinced that a tightly-\ncentralised party offered the best chance to take advantage of \nRussian labour unrest. Serge Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the \nRussian Organisational Commission, chose agents to accompany \nhim to Russia to make the arrangements. He was far from merely \nbeing Lenin's stooge. While being enthusiastic about the idea of a \nConference, he disliked Lenin's preoccupation with the intrigues of \nemigre politics. A Russian political focus and geographical base of \nwork was Ordzhonikidze's aim, and his opinions were shared by \ncountless Bolshevik underground activists. The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration). His critics noted how \nlittle service he had recently given to such an apparatus. Certainly he \nhad founded Workers' Newspaper; but it did not pass unnoticed that \nhe only produced eight issues in . Lenin's qualities as a \npropagandist were accepted. Yet the lack of material which was \ntruly accessible to ordinary workers or even rank-and-file party \nmembers caused exasperation. \nNot that anyone entirely denied the contribution made by Lenin. \nIn  the Central Committee allocated funds to the opening of a \n'party school' in the village of Longjumeau outside Paris. The aim \nwas to select promising undergrounders, pay their passage out from \nRussia and offer them intensive lecture-courses on Marxism and \nparty strategy before releasing them back to their underground \nduties. Not all of them were Leninists. Ordzhonikidze, I. I. Shvarts \nand Boris Breslav were among the ten Bolshevik activists who \nattended as students alongside members of the other factions. Lenin \nwas an inveterate pedagogue and spoke in the characteristic pose of a \nschoolmaster, with thumbs pressed hard into the armholes of his \nwaistcoat. He delivered fifty-six lectures at Longjumeau, his topics \nincluding general disquisitions on political economy as well as more \ndetailed offerings on his favourite theme: the agrarian question in the \nRussian empire. Some students wished that he had addressed \n All or Nothing \n \nquestions of practical revolutionary activity, but on the whole he \nreceived a positive reception.  \nFurthermore, the condition of the underground committees was so \ndire that no one could reasonably turn Lenin into the sole scapegoat. \nOrdzhonikidze and his fellow Longjumeau graduates, Breslav and \nShvarts, who were working for the Russian Organisational Commis-\nsion, found widespread 'disarray' and 'collapse'.  This was the \nsituation, according to Ordzhonikidze, in 'the majority of Russian \nprovinces'. Contacts between one town committee and another \nwere minimal; and even within towns there were few ties among the \nvarious Bolshevik groups.  So were Lenin's interfactional polemics \ncompletely irrational? Not quite, at least in his own terms. In St \nPetersburg a group of Liquidators had scorned the underground \ncommittees and founded a legal journal, Nasha Zarya ('Our Dawn') \nin IO. Its editorials stressed the gains obtainable by workers \nengaging in protests within the framework of imperial legality.  \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. Yuli Martov, Fyodor \nDan and the other Mensheviks expressed the same opinion, but only \nin private. Their refusal to denounce Nasha Zarya became grist to \nLenin's mill.  Thus Lenin saw himself as a super-optimist. The fact \nthat in I  there were only about I , organised Russian \nMarxists, including all the various factions,  did not depress him. \nHe felt that the revolution of - had demonstrated how quickly \na mass party could be formed. Even under the regime of Nikolai II, \nhe sounded an exultant note: 'The party is the conscious, progressive \nlayer of a class, its vanguard. The power of this vanguard is I , is I  \ntimes greater than its number.'  \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. Pointing out that only one in fifteen German \nworkers had become a party member, he emphasised that the party's \nimpact on the German working class was, nevertheless, enormous.  \nThe German Social-Democratic Party was the Second Socialist \nInternational's major force. And Lenin proclaimed that in Russia, \ntoo, 'a small party core' exercised 'an extraordinarily strong influence \nover the vast masses of the workers'. Already, too, the Russian \nworking class had accomplished wonders in less than two decades. It \nwas marching towards its destiny, which was 'the very great global \ntask of liberating humanity'.  \nTrotski retorted that, if it did not really matter that so few party \nmembers existed, Lenin's rancour and schismatism in the party's \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \naffairs was all the more pointless; and others, too, maintained that, \nwhile the Liquidators were misguided to rely exclusively on legal \noperations, Lenin was exhibiting a sectarian obsessiveness. Trots-\nki's explanation was that the Marxist movement was dominated by \nintellectuals. He failed to recognise that the recruits to pro-\nBolshevism since the - revolution had mainly been workers. \nBut he was right about the damage done by disputatious middle-class \nintellectuals in this period. Several Bolshevik groups in Russian drew \nthe same conclusion. Compromises with other factions were not \nunknown. Ordzhonikidze, for example, reported approvingly that \nBolshevik groups in the capital had been collaborating with \nUltimatumists. This was bad enough from Lenin's viewpoint \n(although he knew nothing about it until later, since communica-\ntions had broken down). Worse still was the situation in Samara, \nwhere Bolsheviks and Liquidators co-operated. Separate factional \ngroups were at work, but these did not belong to separate parties; \nand there were plenty of Marxists endorsing radical but differing \nstrategies who found a basis for collaboration. With so few groups in \nexistence and with a remorseless political police, it made little sense \nnot to avoid unnecessary splintering of the ranks. \nThe German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche had considerable \nvogue among many thinkers in Russia and the rest of Europe around \nthe turn of the century. His notion that an heroic individual, through \nthe power of personality and will, could pull the mass of society into \ndynamic motion out of stasis was influential. Lenin's refusal to reply \ndirectly to Trotski's argument convinced his enemies that his \npersistent schismatism had no intellectually respectable rationale; \nthey increasingly regarded him as a would-be Nietzschean 'super-\nman'. His goatee beard appeared to confirm the validity of the \ndaemonic image. \nLike almost all Russian Marxists, Lenin ridiculed this intellectual \ntradition. Not once did he mention Nietzsche in his entire published \noutput. But Lenin's adversaries claimed that, even if unknowingly, \nhe had ingested the Nietzschean drug. The legally-published St \nPetersburg Marxist newspaper Luch ('Ray') railed against 'the \ndictatorship in the party of supermen with a cynical attitude to the \nmasses'. This was exaggeration (but no worse than the exaggerated \nprosecutions that Lenin brought against his victims). A direct \nconnection with Nietzsche can neither be proved nor disproved. \nAnd yet his associate Zinoviev, while denying that Lenin was either \negocentric or dictatorial, confided the following considerations to his \n All or Nothing \n \nnotebook: 'But did he have a consciousness (a sensation) that he had \nbeen 'called'? Yes, he did. Without this he would not have become \nLenin.' Zinoviev conceded that, in the period when Lenin was \nstruggling for political 'recognition', the relationship of individuals \nwith 'him personally (i.e. not precisely personally but politically and \ntheoretically) was the criterion of the measure of things for him'. \nIndeed, according to Zinoviev's revealing memoir, Lenin felt himself \n'responsible for the whole of humanity' and saw himself as 'the leader \n(in the best sense of the word) of the working class and the party'.  \nConsequently, loyalty to this man of destiny and to his ideas was \nmore important, in his own eyes, than the quest for a united party \nwhich would include opponents as well as followers. His self-\nconfidence was accompanied by an intolerance bolstered by the \nintrospective conditions of the emigre disputes that typified the \nRussian revolutionary movement. Even so, Lenin's willingness to \nsplit his faction again and again went beyond the norm. Of course, he \ncould not speak openly about his sense of personal vocation; this was \nalien to the comradely and collectivist ethic of Marxism. Instead he \ntalked about the destiny of 'the proletariat', not about his own; and \nhe tried to submerge his identity in the cause of the Marxist \nrevolutionary movement, proclaiming that 'we, the workers' were \nmarching towards a world socialist order.  \nYet this verbal flourish did not convince the Bolshevik deputies to \nthe Third State Duma. There were only five of them even though \nseveral other social-democratic deputies sometimes voted with them \nrather than with the five Menshevik deputies. All were hostile to \norganisational divisiveness. Speaking and acting in consort with the \neleven Menshevik deputies, they did what they could to embarass the \ngovernment by using the Duma as a forum for denunciation of P. A. \nStolypin and his Cabinet. Their leading figure was N. G. Poletaev, \nwho tried to persuade Lenin to moderate his anti-Liquidator \ncampaign. Lenin was angry; but, located in the emigration and \nlacking any sanction to compel Poletaev's obedience, he could only \npersuade and cajole. Poletaev, however, knew his own mind and \nwould not budge. In vain Lenin put the following proposition to \nhim: 'One cannot sit between two stools; it's a matter of being either \nfor or against the Liquidators'. \nPoletaev, a fitter by trade and the Duma deputy for St Petersburg \nprovince, could also incommode Lenin politically. His seat in the \nDuma gave him a degree of immunity from arrest, and he was able to \ntake an active role in the editing of the Bolshevik legal journal The \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nStar. Without Poletaev's permission, Lenin's articles would remain \nunpublished.  In addition, Poletaev believed that the surest way to \noutmatch the Liquidators in the capital was to establish a Bolshevik \ndaily newspaper. The post- reforms included the disbandment of \npre-publication censorship. Newspapers continued frequently to be \nbanned; but the scope of acceptable political discourse was widened. \nOpen calls for the violent overthrow of the state were still impossible, \nbut suitably indirect language could keep a revolutionary organ in \nexistence for months before the Ministry of the Interior might \nintervene.  Poletaev's suggestion evidently did not preclude a \ncampaign in the newspaper for political objectives of Bolshevism. \nDespite his theoretical support for the exploiting of all legal as well \nas illegal opportunities, Lenin was not keen. His reasons, as \nexpressed in a letter to Maksim Gorki in May , highlighted \nsuspicions about Poletaev and his friends. Gorki was bombarded \nwith details about Poletaev's insufferable indulgence to the Liquida-\ntors and to the Mensheviks. In a rare confession of his intention to \nbreak with the Mensheviks, Lenin stated that unification 'with \nMensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless'.  Lenin also \nclaimed, mistakenly, that increased repression of the press was in \nthe offing; and not too subtly he tried to dissuade Gorki from \nsubsidising Poletaev's scheme. \nThere must have been further reasons too. The failure to support \nPoletaev was consonant with Lenin's reluctance to write articles for \npopular consumption. Lenin had written fly-sheets for workers in the \ns; and his pamphlet 'To the Village Poor' in  was a model of \nits kind. But his literary work had tended to be limited to intra-\nparty theoretical work since then. He aimed at a readership \ncomposed of party members, and indeed party members initiated \nin the current debates over Marxism. Poletaev's project surely also \nincurred his disfavour since, if successful, it would further weaken his \nexigous authority over his faction's activity in the Russian empire. \nOrdzhonikidze and his associates on the Russian Organisational \nCommission, so far from supplying directives to the underground \nparty committees, frequently could not even discover their where-\nabouts. Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. No wonder he was \nhorrified by Poletaev. A St Petersburg daily newspaper would rob \nWorkers' Newspaper, printed in Paris, of its usefulness to the illegal \nBolshevik organisations in Russia; and Lenin's influence would \ndecline. \n All or Nothing \n \nTHOUGHTS ON RUSSIA \nLenin's isolation in the West was not all his own fault; it was also the \nprice paid by all emigres for their freedom. Moreover, he endea-\nvoured to stay in touch with contemporary intellectual debates. \nRussian public discussion was effervescent in books, journals and \nnewspapers. Lenin kept up with current publications, and himself \ncontributed to them. Daily journalism did not interest him. He barely \nmentioned Stolypin's assassination in ; nor did he expatiate \nupon the notion, which was common not only to revolutionaries but \nalso to conservatives like Prince Yusupov at the Imperial Court itself, \nthat the dynasty was lapsing into decadence. There is no trace in \nLenin's writings of the gossip about the empress Aleksandra, and he \nsaid little even about the self-styled 'holy man' Grigori Rasputin.  \nHe despised all such discourse as tittle-tattle. Instead, he focused on \nthe concerns of a follower of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. He \ncontinued to study Russian economic development, and to ponder \nthe implications for the struggle between social classes. He watched \nthe agrarian sector keenly. His confidence that the Stolypin land \nreforms would fail was growing. At political gatherings he could talk \nof 'the complete dissolution of the economic position of the \npeasantry' , and he repeated that mass destitution was an unavoid-\nable consequence of the government's policy. According to Lenin, \nRussia's internal market would therefore remain needlessly restricted. \nHe added that only a minority among the peasant households leaving \ntheir commune became independent farmers. Most sold. up straight-\naway; poverty had driven them to break their communal ties.  \nScholarship in recent years has by and large confirmed this gloomy \nverdict on Stolypin's agrarian measures. It must be added that \nLenin was doing little other than expressing the conventional \ncontemporary wisdom among revolutionaries about the govern-\nment's strategy in the countryside; and that he was very far from \nthinking that Marxists had to hasten their accession to power for fear \nthat the programme of Stolypin might succeed. He still perceived the \nlanded nobility's existence as an obstacle to economic maturity. His \nidiosyncracy, at least when judged alongside the Mensheviks, was \nthat he continued to deny that rural capitalism had reached a dead \nend. \nThus he stuck to certain basic tenets of his analysis, and found \nhimself subject to a deal of Menshevik teasing. Petr Maslov had \nceased to worry himself with what Lenin wrote; he had either gained \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nhis own confidence over the years, or had decided that there was no \npoint in aiming criticisms at a Lenin who had resolved to ignore \nincommodious empirical data. But N. Cherevanin entered the \ncontroversy, claiming that Lenin had never answered those critics \nof his Development of Capitalism in Russia who had stated that his \nstatistics did not conclusively demonstrate his contention that an \ninter-generational process of differentiation of the peasantry into \nrival classes of rural bourgeoisie and rural proletariat was in \nexistence. Lenin ignored Cherevanin. It was left to another \nBolshevik, A. Y. Finn-Enotaevski, to defend him. It is an interesting \nvignette in the history of Russian intellectual thought; for Finn-\nEnotaevski declared that, in the  second edition of the book, \nLenin had acknowledged that recently-published figures on horse \nownership had caused him to retract the assertions of the first \nedition. Lenin had made no such retraction; on the contrary, he \nhad asserted that the new figures bolstered his original case. The \nepisode is yet another sign that Lenin's ideas could be understood in \nways diametrically opposite to those which he really held (and that \nthis was not a phenomenon peculiar to the years after his death); it \nalso shows that the Bolsheviks were not devoid of theorists such as \nFinn-Enotaevski who already perceived that rural life was more \ncomplex than as portrayed by the Lenin of the s. \nSuch realism among Bolsheviks came to the fore only after , \nwhen an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt pushed Lenin into introducing \na New Economic Policy granting large economic and social \nconcessions to the peasantry. All this, of course, lay in the future. \nIn the years immediately before , Lenin's main initiative in the \nfield of economic theory lay in his comparisons of the features of \nagricultural development in Russia and the USA. It irritated him \nthat, over a decade after the publication of his Development of \nCapitalism, many commentators persisted in imagining that Russia's \npre-capitalist social vestiges made her unique. \nThrough the s he had accumulated notes on German \neconomic development. Karl Kautsky's works were read assiduous-\nly; and Lenin admired his attacks on Eduard David, who argued \nagainst Marx's assumption that large-scale capitalist agricultural \nestates might not turn out to be as competitive on the world market \nas small, owner-occupied farms.  Unfortunately, as Cherevanin \ngleefully indicated, Kautsky began to moderate his stridency, \nconceding that the prognostications of the demise of small-scale \nagriculture had not been scientifically based. Lenin again opted to \n All or Nothing \n \nremain discreetly silent, filling his notebooks before and after the \n- revolution with data on German and Danish farming. In \n he was to read academic works on the USA's agriculture, and \nwas gratified to discover that even the world's most dynamic \neconomy contained, in the southern states, Negro tenant farmers \nwho would starve to death unless they combined their farming with \nlabour on nearby modern agricultural estates. The parallel with the \nRussian empire was close. Georgi Plekhanov, Petr Maslov and Lev \nTrotski in their books on Russian economic development had \nemphasised the sui generis path taken in Russia; and Trotski in \nparticular had stressed the coexistence of backward peasant villages \nand highly-advanced large-scale factories.  Lenin delighted in \narguing that such phenomena coexisted elsewhere. Not for the first \ntime, he overstated his case. For in the USA's north east, where most \nindustrial enterprises were based, a more technologically-developed \ncapitalist agriculture existed than in the south. But there was a kernel \nof truth in his argument. \nHe also wrote passionately about the empire's class structure. \nThere were, he said, two bourgeoisies in Russia. One was already \nmature: urban-based, it was headed politically by the Kadet and the \nOctobrist parties and was inclined to either liberal or moderate \nconservative aims. Lenin saw it as a ruling class. But he appended the \nqualification that it shared power with 'the Purishkeviches': his \npolemical shorthand for the wealthier among the traditional landed \nnobility. This first bourgeoisie, furthermore, was only 'a narrow \nlayer'. The second by contrast was 'broad': its members were mostly \npeasants, and Lenin stressed that it had not reached maturity. Only \nthe beginnings of an analysis were being afforded here. Assertion had \ndisplaced argument. Yet the substance of his commentary signalled a \nshift of emphasis in his interpretation of Russian economic condi-\ntions. His loudly-proclaimed estimates of the s were being \nmuted. 'In Russian capitalism,' he proclaimed before the First \nWorld War, 'the features of Asiatic primitiveness, bureaucratic \nbribery and deals by financiers sharing their monopolistic incomes \nwith leading civil servants are still boundlessly strong. '  The \nDevelopment of Capitalism was largely without such fulminations. \nLenin now scorned economists claiming too much for Russian \nindustrial progress. The Menshevik, . A. Ermanski (whose view-\npoint was thought eccentric even by most Mensheviks), was a case in \npoint. Ermanski, comparing Russian and German official statistics, \nconcluded in  that the concentration of capital in Russian \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustry was greater than in Germany. Lenin revelled in pulling \nanother economist's data to bits; he indicated that Ermanski failed to \ninclude the output of home-based workers and artisans in his \narithmetic for Russia; and that he consequently overrated the \nmodernity of her industry. The criticism was perceptive, but also \nmarked the limitations of Lenin's own economic enquiries. No longer \nwas he pioneering interpretative investigations. Rather, he reacted to \nthe books of others. His statements, even if we allow for the many \npractical demands upon his time, were often very cursory. His \ncategories for the bourgeoisie were crude. Not for him the social \nsubdivisions of capitalism in the towns described by the Austrian \nMarxist Rudolph Hilferding. At least until , Lenin portrayed \nindustrial production as falling under the control of a united class. \nHilferding's talk of rival commercial, industrial and financial \nsegments of capitalism as yet did not appeal to him. He was happier \nwhen taking the battle to the middle classes. In , newspapers in \nRussia were exercised by one of their recurrent debates about foreign \ncapitalist penetration and domination; xenophobia was rampant. \nLenin scathingly pointed out that innumerable Russian firms and \ntheir owners profited from the influx of alien capital; and he urged \nthat those Duma deputies who played the 'patriotic' card should \nhave their stocks and shares investigated to see whether they stood to \nbenefit from a change in the regime's financial policy.  \nAnd yet the very strangest gap in Lenin's pre-war writings lay \nelsewhere. Notwithstanding his economic expertise and social \nconcern, he failed to produce much material on the conditions of \nRussian industrial labourers. A few scant words on the wage rises \nwon through the struggles of  appeared; but they were the \ncommonplace of contemporary journalism.  He noted the same \nabout agricultural workers since .  Was this skimpiness \naccidental? It seems a significant lapse for a writer with the special \nbias towards the 'proletariat' that being a Marxist involves. Probably \nthe reason was political. Lenin wanted a revolution and wanted all \nworkers to take part in it; he may well have felt that the image of a \nworking class displaying a variety of skills, material conditions and \naspirations would have impeded his general objective. \nNor did Lenin do much to sharpen his recent ideas on the changing \nnature of the Russian imperial state. Since the revolution of - \nhe had noted the regime's adaptiveness, and had argued that official \npolicies constituted a series of manoeuvres which balanced the \ninterests of the bourgeoisie and the landed gentry. This, in Lenin's \n All or Nothing \n \npresentation, was a form of 'Bonapartism'. The state, by playing off \nthese two major property-owning classes against one another, was \nachieving a degree of autonomy from them.  The extent of such \nautonomy was not defined; but he emphasised that the autocracy \ncontinued to rely heavily upon the gentry and the bourgeoisie and, he \nimplied, could not afford to alienate both classes at once.  In , \nhowever, he proposed that the state's latitude for manoeuvre might \nbe so great as to permit it to move completely athwart the interests of \nthe gentry. He drew attention to the survival, despite all the reforms \nafter -, of the empire's 'colossal bureaucratic apparatus'. He \nasserted: 'This apparatus has independent interests; when these \ninterests so demand, the autocracy moves against its very best \nallies, the gentry, the star chamber and so on.'  Lenin ridiculed \nthe notion of fellow Bolshevik M.S. Olminski in his booklet, The \nState, Bureaucracy and Absolutism in Russian History, that the \nRomanov state was the plaything of the gentry's interests. \nThus Lenin's analysis was starting to entwine itself with a \nvenerable strand in Russian socialist, liberal and even some \nconservative intellectual thought from the previous century.  The \nbureaucracy, accordingly, was regarded as an entirely parasitic \nexcrescence. Mensheviks, too, had tended to accept this view. \nFeudalism in Russian was state-created and not, as it had been in \nWestern Europe, 'organic'.  Lenin's reconsiderations should there-\nfore serve as a warning against the belief that his thought before the \nFirst World War was internally wholly consistent.  Moreover, his \nremark showed an awareness of the huge and independent power \nthat a ruthless state might wield in the teeth of much public hostility; \nand his actions after the October Revolution of  exemplified his \nown willingness to deploy such power if the opportunity came his \nway.o \nTHE PRAGUE CONFERENCE \nAt any rate, Lenin said little and published less on the topic of the \nRussian imperial state; and, apart from Olminski's book, it was \nmany years before Marxists in general began to tackle the thorny \nquestions of the forms and intricacies of state power.  His single \npiece of sustained political analysis took a more limited subject: the \nDuma. He wrote to M.A. Savelev in  requesting data on the \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in . These \nresearches resulted in a pamphlet on the Fourth Duma elections of \nmid-.  At its core were Lenin's speculations on the reasons why \nthe Kadets, as the leading liberal party, acquired so few seats. The \nOctobrists, who wished to work again for an alliance between \nthemselves and the government, were the largest group, with  \nseats; and the next biggest was constituted by parties even further to \nthe political right. The newly ultra-right political complexion of the \nparliamentary chamber, according to Lenin, was the product of the \ncalculations and manipulations of the authorities.  But an illiberal \nmajority was already secured by the political system introduced by \nStolypin's counter-reforms in , and yet the prescience and fine-\ntuning required for the manufacturing of a particular electoral result \nfor the Fourth Duma was surely beyond the capacity of the Ministry \nof the Interior.  A more cogent explanation is that opinion among \nmost members of the property-owning classes, especially the gentry \nin the countryside, had spontaneously moved rightwards; and \nperhaps there was a despondency among many middle-class voters \nwhich expressed itself in abstention from the elections. The Russian \nempire bestrode a superficially modified autocracy. But it was not a \nregime of total control.  \nLenin's 'conspiracy theory' of the Fourth Duma elections divulged \nmuch about his own instincts about elections and majorities. The \nCentral Committee in May  had called for a Party Confer-\nence. The convoking organs were the new Foreign and Russian \nOrganisational Commissions. Lenin made a cobra-like attack upon \nthe Bolshevik Conciliators. His timing and tactics were brilliant. \nLenin arranged with Sergo Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the Russian \nOrganisational Commission of the Central Committee, for an \nultimatum to be delivered to the Foreign Organisational Commis-\nsion to place itself under the Russian Organisational Commission's \nsovereignty.  This was bound to cause a furore. The Polish social-\ndemocratic leader Leo Jogiches, provoked beyond endurance by the \ndisputes among the Russians, withdrew his Polish associates from the \nCentral Committee. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nwas left to its own devices. Lenin gratefully accepted the opportunity \nto call together his emigration-based supporters in Paris in December \n, and the consequence was the establishment of a Committee of \nthe Foreign Organisation which was to supplant the Foreign \nOrganisational Commission in co-ordinating all party organisations \nabroad.  \n All or Nothing \n \nSuch manipulations were blatantly factional; no non-Bolshevik \nwas given a place on the new body. But Lenin calculated that he \nneeded an appearance of procedural legitimacy even if it really was a \ncharade. His objective was the confection of a 'Party Conference' \nwhich would be not merely a predominantly Bolshevik assembly but \nan assembly consisting mainly of Bolsheviks who supported Lenin's \nstrategy. Most were also of the younger generation and were \npractical organisers rather than theorists. Prague was chosen as the \nvenue. It was close to the Russian imperial frontier, and yet it lay \nwithin the Habsburg empire and offered a safe refuge for foes of the \nRomanov autocracy; and it was distant from the major centres of \nRussian Marxist emigres in Western and Central Europe. Ordzhoni-\nkidze, a hard-working and ruthless Bolshevik, operated efficiently. \nAssisted by Bolsheviks such as L. P. Serebryakov and B. A. Breslav, \nhe 'toured' Russia arranging the election of Conference delegates.  \nDemocratic procedures were disregarded. Ordzhonikidze blatantly \naspired to the arrangement of a Bolshevik-dominated Conference; he \ninvited a few Party Mensheviks (who were close to Plekhanov and \nopposed Martov's gentleness with the so-called Liquidators), but \nonly with the purpose of giving the impression that the Conference \nwas more open to the party as a whole than it really would be.  \nTrotski was alerted to these developments. He and his friends \ndiscerned that Lenin aimed to reconstruct a Central Committee \nunder his personal control and, by means of the Conference, claim \nthat it presided over the entire party. Only Trotski was willing to \norganise the necessary counter-measures. From Paris he put out the \nword that the Conference would be illegitimate. Instead he called for \na fresh effort to be made to reunite all factions and announced that a \nConference would be held in Vienna.  \nYet the competition for delegates was scarcely intense, not least \nbecause Lenin's Bolsheviks did not want their rivals to come to \nPrague. The stage-managed Conference opened on  January . \nThere were eighteen delegates. Nearly all were Bolsheviks. Two \nrepresentatives from Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks turned up and \nstayed, and Ordzhonikidze was used by Lenin as his 'expert' in \nhandling them at the Conference. No other faction except the \nBolsheviks and the Party Mensheviks was present.  For most \npurposes, the Prague Conference, which the Bolsheviks dubbed the \nSixth Party Conference, was a Bolshevik Factional Conference.  \nThis did not mean that it was a Conference made in Lenin's image. \nOrdzhonikidze had had little contact with the emigration while \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ngathering delegates in the Russian empire; and, while admiring most \nof Lenin's general policies, he detested his schismatic excesses. Worse \nstill, from Lenin's viewpoint, was the fact that six delegates had come \nunder the assumption that other factions were being invited. These \ndelegates, including some of Lenin's professed sympathisers, sent \nlast-minute invitations to the non-Russian 'national parties' within \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party as well as to the emigre \nnewspapers of Trotski, Plekhanov and the Vperedists.  Ordzhoni-\nkidze informed fellow delegates that Lenin might walk out if the \nrecipients of these late invitations turned up.  Lenin could have \nspared himself his rage. Everyone who had been invited in this way \nrefused to lend legitimacy to the Prague proceedings.  A reassured \nLenin came to recognise that these same invitations could be used to \namplify the fictional story that he had genuinely sought to involve all \nfactions in the Prague Conference. He learnt to accept the presence of \nthe two Party Mensheviks who had arrived under the aegis of \nOrdzhonikidze and the Russian Organisational Commission, since \nthey could not outvote the Bolsheviks.  His pressing worry was that \nthe Okhrana might discover the whereabouts of the Conference. The \nparty had experience of delegates being arrested shortly after \nreturning from Congresses and Conferences. Lenin implored dele-\ngates not to send postcards from Prague in case of interceptions by \nthe Russian police.  He could not know that his precautions were \nin vain. Two Bolsheviks at the Conference, R. V. Malinovski and \nA. S. Romanov, were agents of the Okhrana and reported on all that \nwent on.  \nLuckily for Lenin, neither Malinovski nor Romanov had instruc-\ntions to impede his progress in Prague. Nevertheless he did not \nadvance smoothly with all his schemes; and his opponents in the \nemigration (as well as subsequent historians) exaggerated the ease \nand extent of his victories. He had to sustain much criticism. Firstly, \nthere was worry about his obvious disdain for the Polish, Latvian \nand Bundist organisations. The Menshevik Y. D. Zevin was tren-\nchant on this point;  and there was spirited dispute as to whether \nthe Conference's decisions should be binding upon the non-Russian \norganisations.  Yet Lenin and Zinoviev, after modifying parts of \ntheir proposed official statement, persuaded the other delegates to \ncast the blame for the non-attendance of the non-Russians on the \nnon-Russians themselves.  \nEnsuing discussions were replete with imprecations against the \nsustained 'factional conflict' in the emigration. Ordzhonikidze based \n All or Nothing \n \nhis tactics upon a Conference consisting mainly of Russia-based \nactivists, and Lenin had to listen to P. A. Zalutski's criticisms of \nemigre squabbling.  Ordzhonikidze demonstratively praised the \nanti-Lenin Vpered activists in St Petersburg who had attacked \nMenshevik Liquidators (and he later talked of the possibility of \nrapprochement between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks).  Other dele-\ngates, apparently, referred in detail to Lenin's unpleasant polemics \nagainst other Russian Marxists, including even the Bolshevik \nConciliators.  Lenin was unbowed. For him, it was 'a struggle to \nthe death'. He adjured his small audience to recognise what he saw as \nthe reality: 'We now have two parties- that is a fact!' Let there be, he \ndemanded, no more moaning, no more complaining.  E. N. \nOnufriev, F.l. Goloshchekin and .. Pyatnitski answered him \nwith further criticisms of the role of the emigration.  The least \nbarbed objection was that Lenin and his fellow editors had not been \nproducing material of sufficiently 'popular' quality; and the call for a \nswitch of line was incorporated in a resolution.  Ordzhonikidze \nagain rubbed salt in his leader's wounds by stating that co-operation \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would be easier if only there did \nnot exist \"'the damned emigration\" and the leaders who, sitting \naround in Paris or San Remo and understanding nothing, write \ndirectives and produce splits.'  He later added the following com-\nbative gloss: 'We know that the emigration has failed, all along, to \ngive us anything of value.' He added, more starkly: 'The emigration \nis nothing.'  S. S. Spandaryan went further, saying that those who \nwanted to do party work should do the work in Russia proper. The \npolemical antics of the emigres, he added, had even resulted in arrests \nof activists at home.  \nMost of the following debates were focused on the Russian labour \nmovement. Topics ranged from the worsening material plight of \nworkers (as well as peasants) to the imperial government's project for \nsocial insurance.  But periodically the resentment of the emigres \nresurfaced. Lenin tried to treat it casually: 'Why is this all so \nlaughable?' But tempers were frayed, and he tried to explain the \ntroubles abroad by reference to objective political conditions, stating \nthat the polemics were 'the result of a struggle of two currents'. He \ncontended that a fiercer fight with the Liquidators would leave the \nparty stronger.  Ordzhonikidze took offence, especially at Lenin's \ninsinuation that the anti-emigre noises were merely tearful laments. \n'And Lenin,' he declared, 'has not answered a single question of \nours.' Goloshchekin took Ordzhonikidze's side. There was even a \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposal, possibly from M.S. Gurovich, that the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation should be disbanded.  \nThis particular suggestion was rejected; but so, too, was Zinoviev's \nmotion on 'party organisation abroad', which embodied an attempt \nto provide the Committee of the Foreign Organisation with complete \napprova.  Delegates, while allowing the body to survive, would \nagree only to describing it as 'one of the party organisations abroad'; \nthey also specified that all foreign organisations should communicate \nwith Russia exclusively through the Central Committee and should \nsubmit entirely to its authority. The Central Committee was to be \nbased mostly in Russia: the final resolution defined it pointedly as \n'the Russian centre of social-democratic work'.  Everyone, includ-\ning Lenin, agreed that an emphasis on work in the legal channels of \nthe labour movement was required. Trade unions, sickness insurance \nschemes and even lecture clubs should be given a priority.  Lenin \nstressed that such organisations need not be tightly-structured. The \nformalist of What Is To Be Done? criticised those who were devoted \nto formalism in the party underground, and even Zinoviev himself \nthought this new position to be exaggerated.  Zevin, a non-\nBolshevik, was more blunt. He asked how Lenin's recommendation \nfor a party founded mainly upon work in 'legal societies' was \nreconcilable with his demand for intensified struggle with the \nLiquidators; and he charged Lenin with underestimating the real \ndifficulties of even legal activity in the Russian labour movement.  \nGoloshchekin concurred with the Menshevik speaker, adding that \nLenin had painted an 'idealistic picture'. And he resented what he \ntook to be Lenin's criticisms of the Bolshevik party activists in \nRussia.  Only Onufriev supported Lenin.  \nAnd Lenin, perhaps recognising that his advocacy of legal work \nmight continue to be misunderstood, suggested that a clause on the \nneed to strengthen the illegal party apparatus be included in the \nConference resolution on party organisation.  A tiny episode; but it \nshowed that he perceived that his own enthusiastic but one-sided \npresentation could lead to his being misunderstood. He also regretted \ncertain phrasings of the motion proposed by his assistant Zinoviev. \nLenin advised the replacement of a clause which embodied outright \nopposition to the elective principle in party work; his grounds were \nnot philosophical but those of political tact.  In any case, there was \nuniversal agreement that legal organisational opportunities ought to \nbe explored more energetically. The Conference was united on that \npoint.  \n All or Nothing \n \nZinoviev introduced debate on the other vital question, namely \nhow to organise the party for the forthcoming electoral campaign for \nthe State Duma.  Lenin could safely leave such functions to him. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. In practice this would mean that factions of the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party which did not accept the legitimacy \nof the Prague Conference ought to be shunned.  In addition, Lenin \nand Zinoviev persuaded the Conference to oppose the Menshevik-\nsupported campaign to collect signatures for a 'petitition' for the \nright of freedom of association to be granted in Russia. Such a \ncampaign, he declared, was Liquidationist claptrap; and a further \nresolution was passed asserting that the Liquidators had 'definitively \nplaced themselves outside the party' - a device already used by Lenin \nin  to 'expel' Aleksandr Bogdanov from the Bolshevik faction \nwithout using the word expulsion.  Lenin also successfully urged \nthe Conference to insist that the party's deputies in the State Duma \nshould denounce the Kadets more vigorously and should accentuate \nthe slogans of a democratic republic, the eight-hour day, and \nconfiscation of gentry-owned land.  After three weeks of discus-\nsion, the Conference constituted itself as the supreme and legitimate \nassembly of the entire Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.  \nThe only objector was the Party Menshevik Zevin - and even he \nfailed to walk out of the proceedings.  \nA collective snook was therefore cocked at other factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Lenin's victories on policy \nwere large; and the non-Bolshevik Marxist press quickly reported on \nthe proceedings in such terms. Indeed, many commentators at the \ntime, and many more since , dated the essential formation of a \nBolshevik party from the Prague affair. The formation of a self-\nstyled Central Committee, staffed mainly by pro-Lenin Bolsheviks, \nwas truly a watershed in the history of the Russian Marxist \nmovement. The designation of Workers' Newspaper as the Central \nCommittee's 'official organ' confirmed the demise of attempts to \ncompromise with Trotski and the other aspirants to a broadly-based \nparty unity.  \nYet the Conference delegates did not see themselves as mere \nauxiliaries in Lenin's war. It is usually overlooked that the \nCommittee of the Foreign Organisation, which had been the initial \nchannel for the planning of the Conference and which had been \nespecially important to Lenin in , had been confirmed not as the \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nsupreme emigre party body but simply as 'one of the party \norganisations abroad'. Hardly a fulsome recommendation. The \nresolution on the emigration also specified that foreign-based \norganisations should rally round the Central Committee.  Dele-\ngates were trying to prevent supreme operational power from falling \ninto Lenin's grasp. The Central Committee was meant to govern the \nparty, and was not to be encumbered with undesirable emigrant sub-\ncommittees. Thus foreign-based party organisations were required to \nrally round not the Committee of the Foreign Organisation but the \nCentral Committee.  The seven elected members of the Central \nCommittee, moreover, were not as solidly pro-Lenin as is usually \nthought. In the first place, D. M. Shvartsman was one of them. As a \nParty Menshevik, he was obviously welcomed by several delegates as \nproof that they were not aiming at the formation of a totally \nhomogeneous, sectarian mini-faction.  Secondly, many of the \n'Leninists' had criticised the emigres at the Conference; and they \nincluded newly-elected members of the Central Committee Ordzho-\nnikidze, Spandaryan and Goloshchekin.  \nOnly two emigres, in fact, belonged to the Central Committee: \nLenin and Zinoviev. The last of the seven members was R. V. \nMalinovski, an as yet unmasked police spy; and his posture at the \nConference is unclear from the published minutes. But the general \ntendency to fire shafts of warning at Lenin about his future \nbehaviour is transparent in the debates, the resolutions and the \nelections even though Lenin, with characteristic imperturbability, \nended the Conference with a rousing speech.  \nRUSSIANS AND POLES (AND LATVIANS, LITHUANIANS \nAND JEWS) \nLenin wasted no time in justifying the Prague Conference to his \nopponents. A brisk sentence or two expressing relief that the 'party' \nhad been hauled out of the mess that had enveloped its central \napparatus was the extent of his pleading.  He did not quite stop \nharrying the non-Bolshevik emigres; but he was no longer preoccu-\npied by them after Prague. Rather, he was a happy spectator of their \nchaos. Trotski had not given up trying to call a rival gathering of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party, properly open to all \nfactions, in Vienna. Mensheviks retained their dislike of Trotski's \nideas on revolutionary strategy, a dislike reinforced by personal \n All or Nothing \n \nanimus. But on this occasion they would co-operate with him. \nTwenty-three delegates arrived in Vienna for the start of proceedings \non  August .  Seven months had passed since the Bolshevik \nventure in Prague. It is scarcely astounding that Lenin, faced with \nsuch evidence of inefficiency and parlousness, withheld his fire. To \nhave attacked too fiercely might have rallied the opposition. The \n'August Bloc' in Vienna included a range of Russian social-\ndemocrats, from a pair of Bogdanovists through to a representative \nof the so-called Liquidators. Apart from hostility to Lenin, nothing \nunited them strongly. They also lacked the Bolshevik understanding \nof the tactical importance of nomenclature. Decently but self-\ndefeatingly, they declined to describe their new supreme party body \nas the Central Committee and opted for a less forceful name: the \nOrganisational Committee. In practice, the proclaimed unity was \nseen to be weak even by the delegates; the 'Bloc' was a complete \nmisnomer.  \nAmong their resolutions were words of condemnation of the \nPrague Conference. But everyone must have known that the missiles \naimed at Lenin would not wound him. 'I have no fear,' he had \nannounced, 'of a condemnation of factional struggle.'  He laughed \nout loud at some anti-emigre remarks by even fellow Bolsheviks in \nPrague.  Shortly after the Conference he began to behave as he \nalways _had done. He was like a St Sebastian who has burst from his \nbonds, pulled the arrows from his body and shot them in the \ndirection of his assailants. \nThe attack on him at Prague had been heavy; . but it was \nconcentrated upon his factionalism: and it certainly did not include \nany criticism of his attitude to the non-Russian constituent parts of \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.  Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since .  Disagreements \nbetween Lenin and Leo Jogiches, the Polish social-democratic leader, \nwere of long standing. At the Second Party Congress, in , Lenin \nand the Iskra group had argued that the subject nations of the \nRomanovs should be offered the right of self-determination. This \nalienated the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania. Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg, instructing their \nrepresentatives at the Congress by letter, argued that Polish \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nindependence was an irrelevance in a capitalist world which was \nmaking economic nonsense of all frontiers. Lenin's refusal to budge \ndiscouraged the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania from joining the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nat the Second Congress.  Lenin at first did not regret this situation; \nfor the Polish social-democrats objected to Bolshevik attitudes to \nparty organisation, and Luxemburg had entered the Bolshevik-\nMenshevik controversy about the party rules on the Menshevik \nside.  \nAnd yet there was much agreement about general revolutionary \nstrategy. There were also good working contacts between Lenin and \nother Polish leaders such as A. Warski and Jan Hanecki;  and \nneither Lenin nor Luxemburg allowed their disputes over party \norganisation to get in the way of personal friendship.  As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in , Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. At the Fourth Party Congress in \nApril  an agreement was reached, and the Polish social-\ndemocrats entered the larger party with rights of autonomy in the \nterritory covered by its existing organisations and with automatic \nrepresentation in the central party apparatus.  At the Fifth \nCongress in , the Polish social-democrats constituted roughly a \nsixth of the party's entire membership;  their radicalism was vital to \nthe success of Bolshevik policies at the Congress. Subsequently, in a \nCentral Committee of twelve persons, the Poles Warski and F. E. \nDzierzynski were supporters of Lenin against Menshevik strategy; \nand Jogiches on the editorial board of Social-Democrat was equally \nanti-Menshevik. At the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart \nin  Luxemburg, Martov and Lenin collaborated closely.  \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. \nNiggles about strategical distinctions never disappeared. The Bol-\nshevik preference for an alliance between 'the proletariat and the \npeasantry' struck Jogiches as being too close to Russian populist (or \nagrarian-socialist) ideas. Jogiches spoke instead of 'the proletariat \nsupported by the peasantry', arguing that an emphasis on the \nprimacy of the urban working class was more appropriate to \nMarxism.  The disagreement amused the Mensheviks. And it \nannoyed Lenin, but not to the point of rupture; indeed he came, in \n, to see the uses of deploying a programmatic slogan very similar \nto that of Jogiches.  Much more serious, for Lenin before the First \n All or Nothing \n \nWorld War, was Jogiches's devotion to the retention of Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the same party. Bolshevik organisational \nschismatism was hated by the Poles, and Jogiches would never lend \nsupport to Lenin's calls to exclude the Mensheviks from the central \nparty leadership even though Jogiches opposed Menshevik political \nstrategy.  The Polish social-democrats, moreover, deftly retained \nthe balance of power in the central party apparatus.  Lenin was \nfrustrated by this. Jogiches, on the other hand, was incensed by the \nattitude taken by Lenin to the other main socialist party in Poland: \nthe Polish Socialist Party. A former section of the Polish Socialist \nParty, the PPS-Lewica, appeared to Lenin to be moving towards a \nMarxist programme; and, unlike Jogiches and the Polish social-\ndemocrats, these socialists were sensitive to the need to embrace the \nnational aspirations of the Polish population.  Relations between \nLenin and Jogiches worsened. At the January  Central \nCommittee plenum, the Polish influence helped to prevent the \npassage of his divisive motions.  \nLenin sought pretexts for a definitive conflict with Jogiches. This \nwas not difficult. In his own organisation, Jogiches was as author-\nitarian and intolerant as Lenin and he entirely lacked the Bolshevik \nleader's more attractive personal qualities.  Jogiches resented what \nhe regarded as the unnecessarily enthusiastic co-operation between \nLenin and Warski, who was replaced on Social-Democrat on \nJogiches's orders by Z. Leder.  Not only Warski attracted \nJogiches's anger. His oppressive personality and methods offended \nmany others, and he had even threatened his former lover, Rosa \nLuxemburg, with a gun. Luxemburg somehow managed to continue \nto work with him.  But there was a growing hostility towards him \nin certain underground organisations in Poland itself. Warsaw-based \nsocial-democrats were especially discontented. The split between \nLenin and Jogiches widened in November , when Jogiches \nordered that no Polish social-democrat should any longer serve on \nthe board of Social-Democrat. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n.  \nBut the Warsaw organisation saw Lenin as a protector of their \ninterests, and Lenin received news that a complaint had been made \nby it against Jogiches's decision to boycott the Prague Conference.  \nPreviously the objections to Jogiches had been formulated mainly by \nindividuals. By the end of , Jogiches's highhandedness had \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ndriven A.M. Malecki, Hanecki and Leder to resign from the Polish \nofficial leadership. Political disputes were also involved. Jogiches, \nunlike Lenin, wanted nothing to do with the legal trade unions \nestablished after ; and, like Lenin, a growing number of Polish \nsocial-democrats wanted a rapprochement with the left wing segment \nof the Polish Socialist Party.  Other talented Poles were also hostile \nto Jogiches: F. E. Dzierzynski, J. Unszlicht and Karl Radek; and \nthese, too, hoped for closer relations with the Bolsheviks while \nretaining doubts about Lenin's divisive scheming.  Jogiches in \n had not totally despaired of dealing with the Lenin problem \nby seeking an accommodation with Bolshevik Conciliators. A.l. \nRykov was an obvious choice, and a spirited correspondence ensued \nuntil the Prague Conference broke off such possibilities.  Jogiches \nthen moved against his Polish opponents. In May  he and his \nadherents formally declared the Warsaw organisation disbanded.  \nHe also delivered Malecki and Unszlicht up to a 'party court'; and \nRadek, too, suffered this fate on the alleged grounds of stealing party \nfunds.  \nThe fissures in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania brought cheer to Lenin, relieving any lingering \ndifficulty in explaining the need for a supposedly unifying Party \nConference in Prague; they also removed a good deal of respons-\nibility for the party split from his shoulders. They were used as a \npretext for continued meddling in Polish socialist affairs. Until , \nJogiches had interfered more in Russian business than Lenin in the \naffairs of Polish organisations. In the remaining years of European \npeace the dissentient figures in the Polish section of the party drew \ncloser to Lenin; he frequently advised them on tactics for dealing \nwith Jogiches and took their side in the International Socialist \nBureau.  Meanwhile, Dzierzynski, counselling Lenin to leave \nSwitzerland, suggested that Krakow in Austrian-ruled Poland would \nafford him a better base for contact with Russia.  \nThe political friendship of Lenin and this handful of leading Polish \nsocial-democrats helped to deflect attention from the most remark-\nable consequence of the Prague Conference: namely the fact that the \nterritorial base of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party- or \nat least the part of it led by Lenin - had diminished.  The 'party' \ncould no longer properly claim to have organisations in Poland. \nSince neither the Jewish Bund nor the Social-Democracy of the \nLatvian Region had agreed to join Lenin's venture in Prague (and \nLenin had not given them an invitation in any event!), huge areas in \n All or Nothing \n \nthe western part of the Romanov lands were similarly uncovered. \nNor did the Armenian organisations, which had been affiliated to the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party since , attend.  \nGeographically, therefore, Lenin's claim to authority was more \nrestricted to Russia proper than before. Many Bolsheviks them-\nselves, of course, were not Russians. Iosif Stalin and Sergo \nOrdzhonikidze were Georgians; Y. M. Sverdlov, G. E. Zinoviev and \nL. B. Kamenev were Jews, and Lenin had allies such as the Poles \nopposed to Jogiches. It must be stressed that he broke his ties with \nthe Bund and the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania for reasons quite innocent of chauvinism. Lenin wanted \nfreedom to make his own policies, direct his own organisations, run \nhis own party, and looked on the concessions made to the various \nnational organisations in  as productive of 'federalism of the \nworst sort'.\u00b0 Clear-cut centralism in a party definitively under his \npersonal control was his objective, and he thought nothing of \nsplitting the existing party in order to achieve it. \nThe unintended consequences of his actions in Prague, however, \nwere at least as important in the longer term as those which he \nplanned. Those Poles who stayed as his allies were destined to play a \nrole alongside Lenin in the realignment of forces within the European \nsocialist left in the First World War. As it happened, Lenin kept most \nof them at arm's length before mid-. The alliance was on \nconditional terms. Many of the Poles were critics of the German \nSocial-Democratic Party, and Lenin did not abrogate his loyalty to \nKautsky until then.  But it was Hanecki who helped to secure an \nexit visa from Austria-Hungary for Lenin in ; it was Radek's \nassistance that meant much to Lenin in the struggle against the \nEuropean 'official' socialist parties in -, and, in , \nHanecki and Radek were a source of information and possibly of \nfunds channelled through to the Bolsheviks from the German \ngovernment. Failure to take account of the longstanding two-way \nlinks between Lenin and these Polish socialists for years allowed the \nmyth to endure that Hanecki and Radek were German spies. \nLEISURE AND ITS DISCONTENTS \nNo longer needing to appease Jogiches, Lenin could write more \nopenly on the 'national question'; and, since Radek and Jogiches \nagreed in their hostility to the slogan of Poland's independence, the \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin-Radek relationship was always tense. Lenin, even at his \nmost Machiavellian, was also a man of belief. There was a quasi-\nreligious quality in some of his utterances. Marx, for Lenin, was \nbeyond criticism. Lenin evidently needed a rock of certainty in his \nlife. This did not prevent him from interpreting Marx with a freedom, \neven a licentiousness, that astounded his Marxist opponents. Yet \nnobody near to him remembered him as having shown an awareness \nof the liberties he frequently took in interpreting Marxian texts; and, \nwhile Lenin was wrong to claim his analyses as being the only true \ndevelopment of Marxism, he was frequently justified in declaring that \nhis adversaries had traduced Marx's intentions. Each debate has to \nbe examined on its merits, but the main point is that Marxism had \nnever been a complete, unambiguous and coherent system of \nthought. The extraordinary feature of Lenin's treatment was its \nnear-metaphysical lack of doubt in Marx and Engels; no prominent \nMarxist gave so overtly unquestioning a commitment. Despite being \na militant atheist, he unembarrassedly composed the following \napophthegm: 'Marx's teaching is omnipotent because it is true.' \nThe words are worth dwelling upon: they are the language of a \nzealot. They have a lapidary naivete; their content and rhythm are \ncatechistic. They presume unchallengeability and bring together the \nrealm of power with the realm of ideas. They scoff at those wretches, \nthe infidels, who fail or refuse to see the light and recognise the \nverities of Marx and Marxism. \nLenin fought for Marx as his 'teacher', but chose carefully where \nto make a stand. Marxism was under a remarkable intellectual attack \nby a number of German politicians and academics. Robert Michels, \nstudying political parties, wrote of the 'iron law of oligarchy'. He \npostulated that democratic regulations in any party could not \nprevent the domination of the rank-and-file membership by its \ncentral leaders; and he asserted that even socialist leaders would \nbecome seduced by the attractions of authority and material well-\nbeing and would tacitly drop revolutionary objectives. They would \nundergo embourgeoisement. Michels and his fellow German sociolo-\ngist, Max Weber, in addition considered 'bureaucracy' to be intrinsic \nto modern industrial C'ltures. It was consequently utopian for \nMarxists to think th<ti patterns of government could be drastically \ntransformed by political revolution.  Michels and Weber were \nimpugning the practices and objectives of the German Social-\nDemocratic Party. In reply, Kautsky did not deny that hierarchical \nadministrations and established leaderships were crucial for effective \n All or Nothing \n \nlarge organisations; but he felt that processes of election and \nconsultation would curb abuses.  Rosa Luxemburg was less \ncomplacent. She stressed that Marx's optimism was realistic only if \nthe 'party masses' impeded the inclination of their leaders towards \ncompromise with the status quo in Germany. Lenin held back from \nthe fray. Perhaps this was just another pragmatic decision; his \ninstinct was always to avoid appearing embattled or apologetic. \nBut a thinker's quality is revealed as much by his silences as by his \nstatements; and Lenin's failure to address the pertinent questions \nraised by Michels and Weber damages his reputation as a political \ntheorist even for his own epoch. \nHis efforts on Marx's behalf in the last few years before the First \nWorld War were mainly in the field of economics. He stood by the \nMarxian theory of 'immiseration'. Quite what Marx meant with his \nideas on the inevitability of mass impoverishment is still disputed. \nSome have claimed he thought that, under capitalism, workers would \nbecome ever poorer in absolute terms. This was difficult to square \nwith the empirical data on wage rises in many countries. Lenin, \nfollowing Kautsky and several other Marxist.rheorisis, regarded him \nas having predicted only that the working class would become \n'relatively' impoverished. Subsequent macroeconomic statistics, \naccording to Lenin,-had confirmed the forecast: the proportion of \nGermany's wealth in the hands of workers fell as year succeeded \nyear, and an average labourer's wage did not increase as fast as an \naverage employer's profits. But the comment presumably seemed \nto Lenin, on reflection, too much like a retreat; and he added that \nGerman wages were not rising in real value and that inflation was \nsoaring more steeply? This could have constituted a return to the \nfirst version of Marx's immiseration theory; but Lenin refrained from \nproposing the trend as a general norm. He simply made his remark \nand moved on. \nMarx exhilarated him, and those studies of Lenin which entirely \ndeny his Marxist commitment are profoundly erroneous. But he was \nalso excited by the latest technological developments. (Curiously, he \nhad not paid them much heed before .) He read with enthusiasm \nthat a certain William Ramsey had invented a process for extracting \ngas from coal. Electricity, too, fascinated Lenin. Living in an age \nwhen even well-appointed factories were dirty and dangerous, and \nwhen the drudgery of housework was considerable, he sensed that \nelectrical power could do inestimable good in easing the burdens of \nday-to-day existence and in improving standards of hygiene. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nMankind, he felt, stood at the dawn of an era. Yet he assumed that \nthe popular benefits of electricity, even in advanced industrial \ncountries, would not become available until after a socialist \nrevolution. Lenin did not foresee the mass purchases of electrical \ngoods under capitalism. If he proved to be a poor prophet, however, \nwe must remember that the marketing of Hoover vacuum cleaners \nwas in its infancy at his time of writing. His attitude to electricity was \nin any case paralleled by his notions about other 'bourgeois' \ndiscoveries and trends. The time-and-motion specialist F. W. Taylor \nwas greatly in vogue before the First World War, with followers in \nRussia as well as in the more economically-developed countries. \nLenin's reaction to Taylor's 'scientific management' was negative \n(and it was only after the Bolsheviks had seized power in the October \nRevolution that he started to perceive Taylorism's advantages).  \nTaylor, he asserted, simply wished to strengthen capitalist exploita-\ntion. Ignore fashion and have faith, have socialist faith: these were \nLenin's guidelines. \nHe and Nadezhda Krupskaya, like most better-off revolutionaries \nfrom Russia, lived a life that was middle-class in style. Many \ncommentators have dealt severely with the paradox. How could a \nman who talked so fervently about the coming of a classless society \ncontinue to enjoy such an existence? In photographs, Lenin was \nalways neatly dressed. It was almost de rigueur for Marxist leaders \nfrom Russia to wear three-piece suits, and knee-length overcoats \nwere usual on cold days. Homburg hats were typical. While pursuing \nrevolutionary politics, Lenin did not aspire to what might be called a \n'counter-culture'; and in any case it made sense, if he wanted to avoid \ndeportation as a politically undesirable foreigner, to appear as \nconventional and respectable as he could. \nFurthermore, a middle-class ambience covered a range of living \nconditions. For most of his career before the February Revolution of \n, Lenin had to live in rented rooms, and fairly cheap rented \nrooms at that. Royalties from his books, his Central Committee \nstipend and emergency subsidies from his mother meant that he \nwould never starve.  He seems never to have mastered the type-\nwriter. Perhaps this was yet another sign of his social background: in \nthat epoch, typing attracted even worse pay and lower prestige than \ntoday. Lenin wrote out his articles in longhand, and he must have \nwritten very fast if the quantity of published output, notes, drafts and \nexcerpts copied from library books is any guide. But the final typing \nwas done by professionals. The young Bolshevik, V. A. Karpinski \n All or Nothing \n \nwas among these and, in later years, gratefully recalled how Lenin \nalways insisted upon paying him at the going rate. Karpinski knew \nthat Lenin, as an economist, divided the Russian peasantry into poor \npeasants, middle peasants and kulaks. Lenin, according to Karpins-\nki's only half-joking memoir, operated like a middle peasant. He \nhired the labour of others but did not exploit them.  Not being a \n'poor peasant' who had to toil away over a ramshackle Cyrillic \ntypewriter, Lenin nevertheless was not a wealthy kulak-litterateur \nlike Georgi Plekhanov. \nYet Lenin also expected value for money. Everyone from the typist \nto the print-worker learnt that he insisted on a speedy, efficient job. \nHis letters bulged with detailed instructions about textual al-\nterations. Lenin lived in an age when typesetting and copy-editing \nwas done to a much higher standard than is characteristic today; and \nsince he was dealing with small publishing firms run by fellow \nrevolutionaries he could exert some control over the process of \npublication. He justifiably thought of himself as a leading Marxist \npolitical writer. Asked to supply a list of such authors, he mentioned \nG. E. Zinoviev, L. B. Kamenev, V. V. Vorovski and a certain 'V. Ilin': \nhis own nom de plume for his legally-published books. Little things \nlike his answer say much about him. Nobody who did not already \nknow would have guessed that his list contained only Bolsheviks. \nEver the politician. \n   Storms Before the Storm: \n- \nKRAKOW \nResidence in Switzerland and France was endured stoically by \nRussian emigres. They had left their motherland involuntarily; and \nmost of them regarded Geneva, Berne and Zurich as the least hateful \nof alternative bases. At first glance it is mystifying that they did not \ngravitate towards citadels of Europe's contemporary avant-garde, \nsuch as Vienna. Why did they, in the main, avoid lengthy stays in \ncentres of economic power such as London or Berlin? The main \nreason was that Switzerland's constitution provided an unusual \ndegree of civic tolerance. Russian revolutionaries attracted little \nattention from the authorities. The snowy winters were bitter-\nsweetly reminiscent of home. The mountains were strange, certain-\nly, to inhabitants of the Russian empire unless they happened to \ncome from the Caucasus. Yet all the emigres, whatever their \ngeographical origins, adored the Alps. Hill-walking was as popular \namong them as among Swiss townsfolk - in those days it was only a \nfew aristocratic Britons who were mountaineering enthusiasts. Swiss \norderliness could grate upon the sensibilities of Russians (although \nthis was never Lenin's reaction!), but in general earned its due \nesteem. The efficiency of libraries and postal services was a godsend \nto these bibliophile rebels. Russian socialists as Second International \nmembers also found the country well situated for communications \nwith Central, Western and Southern Europe. A large Russian \ncommunity inhabited Switzerland. Before the First World War, \n, of Nikolai II's subjects lived there. They even had their own \nbookshops, restaurants and printing presses. \nThere was no joy for Lenin in deciding, in June , to move to \nAustria-Hungary. He had spent several months of the previous year \nin France, teaching at the party school at Longjumeau and editing \nWorkers' Newspaper and setting up his notorious Committee of the \nForeign Organisation in Paris.  In March  he still intended to \nremain in France for the entire summer; the plan was to leave the \n \n Storms Before the Storm \n \ncapital, where accommodation prices were high, and move to its \n'more pleasant and peaceful' environs in the small town of \nFontenay.Z By May he had changed his mind, getting Krupskaya \nto make enquiries about leaving France and about taking her mother \nwith them. But instead of moving back to Switzerland, Lenin and she \nwere planning to relocate the base of their operations in Galicia, the \nHabsburg-ruled territory of historic Poland. Enquiries were made \nabout prices and passport regulations, and about the intensity of the \nlocal police's interest in Russian revolutionaries.  \nAnd yet Lenin and Krupskaya were still considering spending \nsummer  in Geneva prior to any firm decision on their long-term \nresidence. Not even the police shooting of  striking workers in \nthe Lena goldfields in Siberia in April, and the surge of demonstra-\ntions against the government, had tempted him into moving eastward \nmore quickly. And yet by the latter half of June they were in Galicia.  \nThe decision was formally explained by Lenin as being motivated by \na desire to study the 'local agrarian conditions' and to learn the \nPolish language. This pretence was needed to satisfy the authorities \nin the Galician capital of Krakow. A more plausible explanation \ncame in a letter to the writer Maksim Gorki. Lenin affirmed that \nKrakow afforded faster communications with St Petersburg. It was \npossible to receive Russian newspapers within three days, and easier \nto contribute to and collaborate with the editors of the legal \nBolshevik press.  Krupskaya was to recall that Lenin was drawn to \nGalicia especially by his wish to influence the affairs of the factional \ndaily newspaper, Pravda, which had at last been issued in the capital \non  April  under N. G. Poletaev's aegis.  An announcement \nthat a daily would be appearing had been made by the St Petersburg \nBolsheviks on  January (while the Prague Conference was taking \nplace); and the Prague delegates had supported schemes for an \nintensification of efforts in the legal press.  Lenin's belatedness in \nmoving from Paris could well have been a further sign of his \ndisapproval of the project. Once established, however, Pravda had \nto be controlled! Perhaps, too, police agents were right that Lenin \nwas already looking forward to the working of the Fourth State \nDuma. II The Third Duma's natural time-span ran out in June , \nand elections were arranged for the Fourth's convocation by \nNovember. Again, it was easier to co-operate with Bolshevik Duma \ndeputies from Krakow than from Geneva or Paris. \nBut Lenin may have had little choice. The Prague Conference had \nordered that increased emphasis and resources be devoted to party \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nactivity in Russia. Lenin's letter to Gorki specified that the Central \nCommittee subsequently set up a Foreign Bureau in Galicia,  and \nthis could signify that he had moved under some pressure. Be that as \nit may, Lenin came to feel glad about the transfer. The opportunity \nfor mountain-walking in the Tatras; the similarities of everyday life \nto conditions in the Russian empire; the physical separation from the \natmosphere of internecine factional struggle in France and Switzer-\nland, which took its toll on Lenin despite his relish for it; and the \ngreater chances for Russia-based Bolsheviks to travel out to meet \nhim: all these factors contributed to a feeling that the Galician \nsojourn was only 'a semi-emigration'.  \nHe also developed a casualness about the emigre central press, \nwhich was remarkable for a politician who had been perpetually \ninvolved in campaigns to dominate it. Workers' Newspaper was \nissued only twice in ; publication of Social Democrat conti-\nnued, but less frequently than before. Only three issues appeared in \n. Lenin continued to contribute; but the main work was \nentrusted to L. B. Kamenev in Paris.  In the year before moving \nto Galicia Lenin was contributing fewer articles to the Workers' \nNewspaper and Social-Democrat than to the Russia-based newspaper \nThe Star and the new periodical Enlightenment.  Nor were he and \nother emigre Bolsheviks alone in re-orientating their literary en-\ndeavours. The Mensheviks took more drastic action when Fyodor \nDan risked returning not merely to a cross-border zone like Galicia, \nbut to Russia proper. On  December  he arrived in St \nPetersburg, amazed that the informal assurances from the author-\nities about his safety had been honoured.  Dan assumed the \neditorial direction of Luch. Martov joined him ten months later, \nafter a semi-amnesty for political offenders had been announced as \npart of the official celebrations of the Romanov dynasty's tercente-\nnary. The motivations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are \nuncertain; but perhaps the fact that no Bolshevik had up to then \nbeen similarly treated indicates that the Okhrana wanted to boost the \nmore moderate forces of Marxism in an attempt to check the growing \nradicalism of the workers' movement. Lenin, astounded that Dan \nhad even managed to visit Menshevik deputies in the State Duma, \nconfessed his bafflement about the 'game' being played by the \nauthorities.  \nThe Zinovievs accompanied Lenin and Krupskaya to Krakow, and \nboth couples quickly found apartments in the city. Finance and \npredilection drew them quickly to the countryside. In March , \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nLenin opted for a house near the summer resort village of Zakopane, \nwhich lay close by the town railway station of Poronin and a hundred \nkilometres from Krakow.  To maintain contact with Krakow and \nthe outside world, Lenin walked twice daily to the post office in \nnearby Bialy Dunajec. In October , after a delightful summer \nwhich allowed him to travel abroad with Krupskaya as well as to \nenjoy the peace of the Polish countryside, he moved back to \nKrakow. \nThe Bolsheviks were not the only anti-Romanov revolutionaries in \nthe area. Polish socialists too appreciated the convenience of the \nKrakow region for the preparation of subversive activities across the \nfrontier. Not only the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania but also the Polish Socialist Party had representatives \nthere, and they made a lively contribution to open political debates in \nKrakow. The Polish Socialist Party was as internally divided as the \nSocial-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania. Josef \nPilsudski, the future vanquisher of the Red Army in the Soviet-\nPolish war in  and dominant Polish politician in the inter-war \nperiod, led a faction which controlled the party's Combat Organisa-\ntion. He had taken a group of activists into the Russian empire in \n and robbed a train carrying , roubles.  Pilsudski was \nalready more nationalist than socialist, and Lenin preferred to talk \nmainly to the left-wing elements who had left the Polish Socialist \nParty to form the PPS-Lewica. Yet the two men knew about each \nother in Galicia: they often drank coffee in the same cafe. \nNevertheless they scrupulously avoided conversing even when their \nelbows brushed against each other. That their private contacts were \ncloser is probable, since Zinoviev subsequently suggested that \nPilsudski's men helped the Bolsheviks with their security precau-\ntions. In addition, Pilsudski had been sentenced to exile in \nconnection with the  conspiracy of Lenin's elder brother \nAleksandr to assassinate the Russian emperor. The past, as well as \nthe present, linked them together.  \nThus the emigre Bolshevik leadership was not the exclusive source \nof concern for the Romanovs in Galicia. Indeed, it was Pilsudski, not \nLenin, whose extradition was requested by the St Petersburg \nauthorities.Z It was Pilsudski's military units which exercised in \nthe streets and fields around Zakopane; and Lenin, always being \nalert to the practical requirements of armed revolution, cannot have \nfailed to have been impressed by Pilsudski's project to twin \nrevolutionism with nationalism. It is not too fanciful to suppose \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nthat the Galician sojourn greatly reinforced Lenin's feeling that \nRussian social-democrats should take the 'national question' in the \nRomanov empire more seriously. \nLenin, however, did not confine himself to Galicia. Trips were also \nmade to countries to the West. He accepted an invitation to Leipzig \nto give a lecture in April ; and in June he accompanied \nKrupskaya on a longer trip to Berne in Switzerland in search of \nmedical treatment for her worsening thyroid problem. Doctor \nKocher had been recommended by the Krakow social-democrat \nand physician S. . Bagocki. Lenin took a dislike to Kocher, \ncalling him capricious in his arrangements.  After Krupskaya's \noperation, which was only a temporary success, the couple returned \nto Galicia in late July. Life was hectic but pleasurable. The elections \nto the Fourth State Duma had resulted in victory for six Bolsheviks \nand were marred, in Lenin's view, only by the fact that seven \nMensheviks also were elected. Visits to Galicia by Bolshevik Duma \ndeputies occurred sporadically through , and on two occasions \nthese coincided with Central Committee meetings in Krakow and \nPoronin.  Lenin offered plenty of advice to the deputies.  As for the \nCentral Committee, meetings took place more often than in the past: \nseven took place between November  and the end of . All \noccurred in Galicia, and Lenin, naturally, played a prominent role. \nLetters to and from Galicia rose in number.  Pravda and the Duma \ndeputies were the addressees most frequently contacted, but commu-\nnication was kept up also with many other Bolshevik supporters in \nthe Romanov lands. Krupskaya's address-book was being rapidly \nfilled and by mid- it contained  names of contacts in the \nRussian empire, and included Bolsheviks for nearly every province of \nthe Romanov empire.  \nAnd yet, for all its advantages over Switzerland, Galicia was not \nwholly favourable for international political organisation. Krups-\nkaya soon complained that the postal service to Russia was \n'inconvenient'; and she sometimes resorted to sending bundles of \nmail to Bolsheviks in Berlin for further dispatch. She intimated that \nVladimir Ilich, who expected to travel to Berlin in January , \nwould refund the expenditure.  The flow of news, moreover, \nbetween non-metropolitan towns in Russia and Galicia was inter-\nmittent. Lenin railed at those who would not write regularly.  \nRevolutionaries in the Russian political underground, harassed by \na life on the run from the Okhrana, responded frostily to his \nimprecations. The Central Committee distributed its members \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nbetween a Russian Bureau and a Foreign Bureau. The Foreign \nBureau, since only Lenin and Zinoviev were based in the emigra-\ntion, sounded grander than it really was; and the joint sessions of the \nemigres and the Russian undergrounders prevented Lenin from \nclaiming to speak in the name of all Bolsheviks without consulta-\ntion. Russia-based correspondents felt that he had a cheek to \naccuse them of failing to write and his own assiduity was called into \nquestion.  He was also deemed to be insufficiently energetic in \nsupplying the drafts of official party statements (for example, about \nthe trade unions) which were requested from St Petersburg by the \nDuma deputies and others. His factitiousness, not surprisingly, still \nirked the undergrounders. With the exception of Malinovski, the \nBolshevik Duma deputies rejected his calls for a clean split from the \nMenshevik deputies; they were willing to sit in the Duma under the \nchairmanship of Menshevik N. S. Chkheidze (and Malinovski \nwanted a split only because the Okhrana wanted it). Most of the \nBolshevik Duma deputies even wanted a merger of Bolshevik Pravda \nand Menshevik Luch. The editors of Pravda too proved capable of \nstanding up to Lenin. References to 'Liquidators' were sometimes cut \nfrom his articles, and M.S. Olminski directly reproved him for \npolemical excesses. Lenin muttered that Pravda was a 'sleepy old \nspinster'. The editors were undeterred;  out of  submitted \narticles were turned down before the First World War. \nWithout ever becoming dominant, on the other hand, Lenin's \ninfluence grew stronger. The numbers can be turned upside down: \nPravda accepted as many as  submitted articles out of . In \naddition, the Pravda-Luch merger did not take place; and, if Pravda's \neditors were irritated when he did not supply them with commis-\nsioned articles, he cannot have been entirely a persona non grata in \nthe first instance. Even his refusal to follow the precedent of Dan and \nMartov by returning to Russia had its advantages. Central Commit-\ntee meetings might be held in his Galician house; and, in his domestic \nsurroundings and in face-to-face meetings, he was a match for most \nopponents. As the host, he had a psychological edge. Unsophisti-\ncated undergrounders, some of them never having been abroad \nbefore, were not in the best position to resist being browbeaten. \nAnd Lenin made the most of his advantages. The Prague \nConference had empowered the Central Committee to co-opt new \nmembers; and among those who first gained membership in this way \nwas Iosif Stalin, who was regarded by Lenin as 'the marvellous \nGeorgian' and who allied himself with Lenin in the debate on the \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \n'national question'. In autumn , Stalin was chosen by a Central \nCommittee meeting to go to St Petersburg and take charge of \nPravda. Pravda's rising readership figures made the Central \nCommittee, and especially Lenin, keen to guide its editorial \npolicies. Workers' Newspaper, accordingly, was closed down in \nAugust . Yet Stalin declined to be as aggressive towards the \nMensheviks as Lenin desired. Not for the last time, Lenin acted to \ncorrect Stalin's line. A Central Committee meeting delivered an \nimplicit rebuke to Stalin and sent yet another of its co-opted \nmembers, Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov, to join Stalin as co-editor. \nUnfortunately for them as well as for Lenin, both Sverdlov and \nStalin were arrested in February , but their replacement as \neditor, Miron Chernomazov, was greatly to Lenin's liking. Taking \nover in May , Chernomazov took exactly the polemical posture \ntraditionally demanded by Lenin; and fifty articles by Lenin \nappeared in the initial two months of his editorship. \u00b0 Chernoma-\nzov, however, was a police agent, his instructions being not only to \nstir up inter-factional enmity but also to publish overtly anti-regime \nmaterial which would give a pretext for the authorities to shut down \nthe newspaper. Pravda's circulation dropped; the stress on factional-\nism proved to be unpopular among workers who had never accepted \nthe need for two separate Marxist parties and who had always \nwanted a less theoretical and more popular style and format for the \nnewspaper;  and the shut-downs of production were hardly designed \nto retain such readers as the newspaper had already attracted. \nIn the Duma fraction, Bolsheviks such as M. K. Muranov and G.l. \nPetrovski held out for months against the demand by Lenin and their \nfellow deputy (and Okhrana agent) Malinovski for a split with the \nMensheviks. At Poronin in September , ten months after taking \ntheir seats in the Duma, they finally acceded to his arguments:  in \nOctober, Bolshevik and Menshevik deputies sat apart. Petrovski and \nMuranov possibly looked at the growing turbulence in the form of \nworkers' strikes and demonstrations, and judged that the Mensheviks \nwere displaying insufficient revolutionary zeal. The Menshevik daily, \nLuch, staffed by Liquidators among others, was Pravda's chief \nMarxist rival newspaper and tended to discourage strikes.  The \npolice had crushed an attempt to establish a daily which would \nfollow a more orthodox Menshevik line. But the persuasiveness of \nLenin, and indeed of Malinovski who worked alongside them, must \nalso have contributed to the Bolshevik deputies' eventual decision to \nbreak with their Menshevik counterparts. \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nThe year  had done much to compensate for the difficulties of \n. Lenin had exerted considerable authority in Central Commit-\ntee, in the Bolshevik Duma fraction and in Pravda. Yet his impact \nwas small outside these central party bodies. Strikes increased. The \nLena shootings had engendered a lasting bitterness. Trade union \nboards lost an ever greater number of Mensheviks; and Luch's \nallegations about 'playing at strikes' evoked an effusion of sarcasm \nfrom Lenin.  He boasted in public about the election of Bolsheviks \nto the union boards. But he coupled this with a private acknowledge-\nment that the unions exerted scant influence on the labour move-\nment.  No evidence has emerged, to this day, that the strikes were \nmainly union-led; outbreaks of industrial conflict were sporadic and \nlocalised. Furthermore, the illegal party apparatus was in no better \nshape than before . The Russian Bureau, as chosen after the \nPrague Conference, was in prison or exile except for Malinovski.  \nLocal Bolshevik bodies experienced no general renaissance. Acting as \nCentral Committee secretary, Krupskaya received doleful messages \nfrom the Russian empire.  And, even though Pravda's print-run on \nthe occasion of its second anniversary momentarily reached , \ncopies, the largest-selling popular paper for the working man and \nwoman remained the somewhat scurrilous and largely unpolitical \nGazeta-Kopeika. The working class's antagonism towards the mon-\narchy, the police and the employers was intense; but the Okhrana was \nefficient. The Bolsheviks had no answer to the police's interventions. \nTHE 'NATIONAL QUESTION' \nLenin, despite frequent invitations from Pravda, wrote next to \nnothing about the trade unions; there was to be no equivalent of \nWhat Is To be Done? for the legal labour movement. His energies in \nthe realm of theory, between the Prague Conference and mid-, \nwere spent on the so-called national question. In the first half of  \nhe drafted 'theses' which were incorporated in a resolution of a \nCentral Committee meeting in Poronin in September. His most \ncontroversial recommendation related to the future of the Russian \nempire. He went further than any Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty leader in taking account of the national aspirations of non-\nRussians, and demanded that 'the nations oppressed by the tsarist \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nmonarchy' should be granted 'the right of self-determination, i.e. of \nsecession'.  \nSocialists in the Romanov lands had typically hoped to maintain a \nmulti-national state once the monarchy had been removed. Lenin the \ncentralist and internationalist par excellence agreed, but argued that \ntactical subtlety was required. He condemned 'Great Russian' \nchauvinism and castigated Romanov absolutism as 'the most \nreactionary and barbaric state system in Europe and in Asia'. The \nmonarchy's overthrow should be followed by a declaration of \neducational and cultural equality for all nationalities; and 'broad \nregional autonomy and completely democratic local self-government' \nshould be realised. These concessions, he hoped, would dispel \ndistrust of the Russians among the non-Russian nationalities and \nwould actually diminish the likelihood of secessionist movements. \nLenin, moreover, did not want the 'right of secession' to be confused \nwith the 'wisdom of secession'. As a socialist internationalist, he \naimed to keep workers together in mass organisations regardless of \nnational origin. He raged against the bourgeoisie for using national-\nism as a means of deflecting the working class from an appreciation \nof its best interests; and he suggested that any particular decision on \nsecession should be assessed 'from the viewpoint of the interests of \nsocietal development as a whole and the interests of the class struggle \nof the proletariat for socialism'. He did not promise to grant \nnational independence even if a native popular movement called for \nit. The Central Committee resolution, despite broaching the topic of \nsecession, was therefore not a little vague and gave few political \nhostages to fortune.  \nIn the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, it had been the \nJewish Bund which had most persistently highlighted the national \nquestion; but, since Jews did not inhabit a territory where they were \nthe demographic majority and where they could form a nation state, \nthe Bundists did not aspire to secession for Jewish people. Instead \nthey called for 'national-cultural autonomy' within a multi-national \nstate. The August  gathering of non-Bolshevik factions con-\nvoked by Trotski had approved this very slogan.  \nThe concept of national-cultural autonomy had been deeply \ninfluenced by Austrian Marxists, who lived in the other great empire \non the European continent: Austria-Hungary. The pioneering work, \nThe National Question and Social-Democracy, had been written by \nOtto Bauer and published in Vienna in . Other Marxists, \nincluding Lenin, had stated their preferences in policy without much \n Storms Before the Storm \n \ntheoretical investigation of the definition and conditions of nation-\nhood. Bauer filled the lacuna. His book attacked the almost universal \nconventional notion that modern nations had been centuries-old \nphenomena embracing whole peoples. He stressed that a number of \ncontingent factors could make and unmake nations: wars and \nconquest; geographical dispersal; alien cultural penetration. He \nargued, too, that until recently it had only been the upper echelons \nof any society which had a sense of their nationality; and that the \npeasantry in particular was characteristically without true national \nfeeling. For Bauer (as for some later non-Marxist theorists), it was \nindustrialisation and the establishment of a national educational \nsystem which drew a people into a common basic sense of \nnationhood. As a Marxist, he anticipated a time when national \ndifferences counted for nothing in human relationships. But his \ncontention was that, for years ahead, social-democrats would have \nto take account of nationalism as an important political factor. The \ndevelopment of a capitalist economy and culture was bound to \nstrengthen national feelings.  \nLenin read Bauer's book immediately after its appearance, but \nmade no open comment on it for six years. He came back to the \nnational question in -, and vehemently attacked the Austrian \nMarxists. This should not be allowed to disguise how much had been \nlearned by Lenin from Bauer, especially on the contingent nature of \nnationhood. Lenin also started to emphasise, as he had not done \nbefore reading the work of Bauer (as well as of Karl Kautsky), that \nnationalism would neither disappear for a lengthy epoch nor rule out \nthe possibility of economic and cultural advance for newly-indepen-\ndent nations. \nYet Lenin, as was his wont, concentrated on the points of \ndisagreement between himself and Bauer. The National Question \nand Social-Democracy, while allowing for national independence as a \ngoal for several peoples, emphasised the practical impediments in \nareas such as the Habsburg empire where the national groups were \nterritorially intermingled in bewildering complexity. No independent \nterritory for an individual nation was feasible without including \nunwilling minorities from other nations on the same territory. Bauer \nrecommended that the old empire, instead of being broken up into \nseparate chunks, should be transformed into a socialist federation; \nand he wanted each national group in the federation to have elective, \nrepresentative institutions to protect its 'extra-territorial national \nautonomy'. The Jewish Bund in the Russian Social-Democratic \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLabour Party had always Ieant in this direction and successfully \nadvocated it in Vienna in August . The Polish social-democrats \nunder Jogiches and Luxemburg added an economic dimension to the \nfeeling that multinational states should be maintained. Luxemburg \nasserted that Poland's industrial development was tied into relations \nof production and commerce which would be disrupted without \naccess to foreign capital and foreign markets; and that national \nindependence would be industrially retrogressive and damage the \ninterests of the Polish working class. Bauer did not have Jogiches's \nabsolute hostility to national independence movements in Europe; \nbut that did not stop Lenin from banding them together in his \npolemics against them.  \nLenin's main criticism was that the respective proposals of both \nBauer and the non-Bolshevik factions at Trotski's Vienna gathering \nin August  were inherently bureaucratic, inefficient and anti-\ncentralist. They would, he argued, increase rather than diminish the \ndivisions in the international proletariat. The counter-scheme \nsketched in Lenin's theses of  rejected extra-territorial proposals \nfor the national question and insisted that nationally-discrete \nterritories at local level were the best assurance that multinational \nstates would not break up into fragments.  \nThe replies of Lenin's opponents have fallen into undeserved \nneglect. Nor was it only the Bundists and the Polish social-\ndemocrats who prolonged the dispute. Both the outstanding \nGeorgian Menshevik leader and theorist Noi Zhordania and \nTrotski's sympathiser S. Semkovski declared that Lenin had under-\nestimated the complexity of the problems highlighted by Bauer. \nEthnic intermingling was as intense in the Romanov as in the \nHabsburg empire, and Lenin was unjustified in portraying Bauer as \nhaving been overly influenced by the' peculiar demographic features \nof the Habsburg lands. Zhordania confined his comments mainly to \nthe Transcaucasus: Georgians, Azeris and Armenians lived through-\nout its regions; and Armenians were supposedly not even a majority \nin historic Armenia.  In the Ukraine, as Semkovski added, there \nwere Jews, Kalmyks, Tartars, Greeks and Russians as well as \nUkrainians.  The various national groups had their rivalries, even \nhatreds. Lenin had written breezily about protection of the minor-\nities; but, apart from equality of language rights, he had been \nextremely unspecific. Lenin treated Semkovski and Zhordania with \nvituperation concerning their extra-territorial ideas; but he presented \nno defence against their objections to his own theses. His noncha-\n Storms Before the Storm \n \nlance is all the more remarkable in view of his residence in Galicia, \nwhere there was a striking demographic mixture of Poles, Jews, \nUkrainians and Germans. His silence was perhaps a pragmatic \ndevice; a response to Zhordania and Semkovski would only have \ndrawn further attention to his argument's weak spots. But it was \nhardly an adequate intellectual approach. \nLenin in power was to appreciate the need to go beyond dealing \nwith the national question through autonomous nationally-based \nterritorial units. For example, Jews in the Ukraine and Armenians in \nGeorgia had never lived a life so free from tension as in the s. \nThe Soviet central government took steps to ensure that Ukrainian \nand Georgian national dominance in the Ukraine and Georgia did \nnot impinge on the cultural freedoms of other nationalities. \nNevertheless, even when we recognise that Stalin in the s \nexacerbated all the country's problems over the national question, \nthe Nagorno-Karabakh dispute which erupted in  indicates that \nfailure to protect the interests of minority groups can have explosive \nconsequences.  \nAt all events Zhordania, rightly impugned Lenin in  for trying \nto terminate debate before discussions had run their course. Lenin \nwas, in fact, more forthcoming in the other half of the dispute: in his \npolemic against Luxemburg and Jogiches. Possibly he found these \nPoles hard to dismiss so abruptly because they were not Mensheviks \nor Trotskyists. Moreover, he knew that most leading Bolshevik \ntheorists sympathised with Luxemburg's analysis.  Some were \nRussian neophytes like Nikolai Bukharin and Georgi Pyatakov; \nothers were non-Russians such as the Georgian Filip Makharadze \nand the Jewish Evgeniya Bosh.  Lenin could not afford not to \nengage them in an exchange of opinions. He continued to assert that \nthere might be occasions when secession would have to be refused on \nthe grounds of harming the working class of a given nation.  He still \nrefused to advocate national independence as a general rule.  A \nletter to Kamenev in  included the following sentence: 'It is \nnecessary to wage a struggle for truth against the separatists and \nopportunists from the Bund and from the Liquidators.' Publicly he \nwas less intemperate; but his theses contained the notion that the \nbourgeoisies of Finland and Poland were pro-tsarist and that \nliberation would come to the Finnish and Polish proletariats only \nthrough alliance with the Russian proletariat. He made a similar \nargument about the Ukraine in the November-December  issue \nof Enlightenment.  He avoided repeatedly both outright support for \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nand outright opposition to Finnish, Polish and Ukrainian indepen-\ndence. A myriad of unpredictable factors, he affirmed, would have to \nbe taken into account.  \nEven so, he never ceased to feel that retention of all the Romanov \nnations within a multinational political unit might be impossible. He \nasserted, against Luxemburg, that Poland and Finland were notably \nsuitable cases for independence since they were the 'most cultured \nand most separate' entities in the Russian empire. Alone of leading \nBolshevik theorists, Stalin came to Lenin's assistance before the \n- war. Indeed, Stalin provided easily the most compre-\nhensive Bolshevik analysis of the national question. Lenin supplied \nmainly fragmented materials, whereas Stalin leaned heavily on \nKautsky and produced definitions, bibliographical surveys and \narguments aplenty. And yet even Stalin, writing in Enlightenment \nfrom March  onwards, was more eager to excoriate the Bund \nthan to argue the positive case for Lenin's policy. The right of \nsecession as a right appeared in Stalin's article, but only fitfully.  \nBut it was close enough to Lenin's views for Lenin to be \nenormously grateful.  Stalin had given useful theoretical assis-\ntance, and his lengthy pieces in Enlightenment relieved Lenin of the \nnecessity to work up his own fragments into a sustained piece of \nwork. Not that these fragments are without interest. He suggested, \nfor example (and here he, too, followed Kautsky), that the nation \nstate was the normal vehicle for capitalist economic development.  \nThis was hard to reconcile with the industrial success of the United \nStates of America with its multi-ethnic immigrant population. But \nLenin glossed over the difficulty.  Secondly, Lenin firmly rejected \nfederalism in all its guises. This should be noted in contrast with his \nlater practice, after coming to power, when he felt compelled to \nconclude that the country was ungovernable without federal admin-\nistrative arrangements. And, thirdly, he proposed that the ultimate \nobjective for Marxists was not merely a rapprochement of the \nnationalities, but a 'fusion' which would permanently eradicate \nnational differences and consciousness. Under Stalin in the s \nthis objective became, as Lenin had never intended, a pretext for a \nprogramme of 'Russification'; nor did the tendency entirely vanish \nafter Stalin's death. A fourth point, though, is much more to Lenin's \ncredit: after the October Revolution of , Lenin's government \nconfirmed the independence of Poland (which was in any case under \nGerman occupation) but also gave it to Finland (which was not). On \nthe other hand, independence was summarily refused to the Ukraine. \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nThe Red forces sent out from Russia had no orders to conduct a \nUkrainian plebiscite. \nSCANDALS \nLenin none the less continued to exude exceptional self-confidence. \nNor did he worry at all about his own motives and comportment. He \nacquired his reputation as a polemicist in the s and, upon \nemigrating, became notorious for unfairly bending the party's rules \nin his favour. He always complained when his opponents trespassed \nthe slightest regulation of procedure; but this never prevented him \nfrom believing that his own acts of trespass were necessitated by a \nhigher revolutionary duty. \nOutside politics he observed contemporary public propriety; but \nhe did not insist on these personal standards among his associates. \nAn early example was the so-called Bauman affair. N. E. Bauman \nwas a social-democratic activist exiled to Vyatka province in , \nwhere he had an affair with the wife of a fellow revolutionary. The \nunfortunate woman became pregnant. So far from showing sym-\npathy or even common tactfulness, Bauman openly mocked her; and \na cartoon ridiculing her plight was circulated among comr;.des. In \ndespair she hanged herself. Her suicide note drew attention to the \nneed to insist on high standards of behaviour, on a social level, \namong revolutionaries whose party wished to transform the life of \nsociety. The Bauman affair was adjudicated by the Iskra board at \nthe instigation of the cuckolded comrade in early . To his \ncolleague's disgust, Lenin refused to countenance the party's right to \ninterfere and certainly not to discipline Bauman for bringing \ndisfavour upon Russian Marxists. He argued that the party's task \nwas to make revolution against the Romanov monarchy and to vet \nthe morality of comr-ades only when and in so far as their actions \naffected the implementation of the task. He welcomed Bauman \nenthusiastically as a future Bolshevik, using his services as a \ntroublemaker from the floor at the Second Party Congress. \nBauman's death in  inspired Lenin to write a fulsome obituary \ndedicated to 'the eternal memory of a fighter in the ranks of Russian \nsocial-democracy'.  \nThe choice of an undesirable personage such as Bauman as not \nonly an acceptable but even a respected associate boded ill for the \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nbehaviour of Bolsheviks when (as, admittedly, hardly seemed very \nlikely before the First World War) they took power in Russia. \nDoubts continued to arise about Lenin's judgement of individuals; \nand his mode of behaviour tacitly encouraged others to act in a \nsimilar manner. The disputative tricks of Grigori Zinoviev and P. A. \nKrasikov were sharpened, even if not originally learned, at the feet of \na master polemicist. Stalin, too, elaborated such a skill. \nLenin did not have our retrospective vantage point and could not \nanticipate the full range of horrors breeding in the mind of Stalin. \nYet he can surely be faulted for a persistent blindness to the \nunpleasant characteristics of his associates. It was only as he lay \ndying, in -, that he acquired a recognition of Stalin's 'crudity'. \nFor years, Lenin had in any case spoken warmly of the efficiency of \nthe guillotine in the French Revolution.  He perceived in his \nboisterous comrades the incarnation of the 'proletarian' ruthlessness \nvital to the making of a revolution. This was part and parcel of his \nsupport for the armed robberies conducted by Bolsheviks in the \nRussian empire in - as well as his condoning of the marriage of \nBolsheviks A.M. Andrikanis and V. K. Taratuta to rich heiresses, in \nquest of their heirlooms.  Practical activists and practical results \nwere Lenin's objectives: the criteria for assessing the means to these \nends were prudential, not moral for him. In , furthermore, it \nbecame abundantly clear that Lenin's prudence could not be taken \nfor granted; and it was not Stalin but a more pressing evil, R. V. \nMalinovski, who demonstrated this. Malinovski, Central Committee \nmember and Bolshevik spokesman in the State Duma, vanished from \nSt Petersburg in mid-May. The intensifying rumours that he was an \nOkhrana informer were confirmed for everyone but Lenin. \nLenin had spurned them as a slur on Malinovski and an attempt \nto sow dissension among Bolsheviks loyal to him. This was \npsychologically easier to do when it was the Mensheviks who cast-\nigated the Duma deputy. But in  the young Bolshevik theorist \nNikolai Bukharin arrived in Krakow.  Bukharin plainly meant \nLenin well, and Lenin was pleased to welcome a comrade who \nregarded himself as a 'pupil'; but Bukharin was convinced that the \nstories about Malinovski and his undercover role for the Okhrana \nwere accurate. \nThe business of unmasking a police spy was never a matter of \narithmetical precision. It proceeded by calculations of logarithmic \nprobability. Miron Chernomazov was eventually fired from Pravda \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nin February  on evidence which was far from being conclu-\nsive.  He had not been caught talking to police contacts or \nreceiving police money or instructions; he was rumbled because his \noutrageous behaviour had repeatedly given the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs an excuse to close down Pravda. The Okhrana, which advised \nhim on tactics, had overplayed its hand. Malinovski, however, was \nmore cautious and the police were more circumspect in their handling \nof him; he was not asked to fulfil the role of a cantankerous hothead. \nYet the circumstantial data against him was pretty strong. He was \nbetter off than his Duma stipend permitted; he enthusiastically \nbacked Lenin's schismatic schemes among Bolsheviks even in that \nfirst year after the Prague Conference when other pro-Lenin \nBolshevik leaders, such as Stalin, were loathe to endorse them \nwithout qualification; and arrests of comrades were made which \nwere only explicable either by boundless ill-luck or by the existence of \na highly-placed police agent: nobody seriously suspected Lenin, \nZinoviev or Kamenev. Malinovski was one of the very few others \nwho was in a position to know the secrets of the faction's inner \nsanctum.  Bukharin gamely went over the details with Lenin in \nKrakow; and he sent letters corroborating the accusations. But Lenin \nintransigently refused to accept the case.  \nEven when Malinovski absconded in , Lenin refused to \nacknowledge reality. It would have been an unpleasant undertak-\ning. Lenin, at the Prague Conference, had prided himself on his anti-\npolice precautions. When two candidates tied for the last place in the \nelections to the Central Committee, he had suggested that the voters \nin the second ballot should whisper their choice in his ear; and he had \nalso insisted that the list of the Central Committee's members should \nnot be announced at the Conference.  All in vain. Malinovski, as a \nCentral Committee member, conveyed the list without further ado to \nhis secret employers. Again, in , Lenin had written to Kamenev: \n'We have suffered some heavy arrests. Koba [Stalin's other main \npseudonym] has been taken. I've discussed the measures now \nrequired with Malinovski.'  To have recognised Malinovski for \nwhat he was would have led to a bout of self-reproach which was not \ncongenial to Lenin. Scarcely a major factional decision had been \ntaken without the two of them conferring. Malinovski had been the \nBolshevik chiefs eyes, ears and even mouth in Russia. Lenin was \nreluctant to acknowledge that his surrogate had exerted these same \norgans in the service of the head of the Okhrana. \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nThis blunder of Lenin's was not his worst error. His incorrect \nprediction of European socialist revolutions in - was a \nmisjudgement of epochal significance, compelling him to sign the \ntreaty of Brest-Litovsk. By comparison, the Malinovski affair was \npetty and ephemeral.  Nevertheless a party boss ought to be \ncapable of sounder assessment of character. The problem was not \nthat Malinovski had flattered him but that he had fooled him. Such \nwas Lenin's naivete that, even after Malinovski had disappeared and \nleft political activity (and therefore left the party in the lurch), he \nclaimed that Malinovski had been the victim of slander. Lenin \nbelieved what he wanted to believe. Firing off telegrams to Paris, \nhe tried to challenge the emergent consensus that comrade Mal-\ninovski was a police agent. Duma deputy G. I. Petrovski had initially \ninformed Lenin that the 'Liquidators' were sowing the rumours,  \nbut Lenin sensed that Petrovski would not long stand by Malinovski. \nA telegram was sent from Krakow adjuring the Bolshevik Duma \nfraction not 'to get nervous'; its members were asked to refrain from \nexpelling Malinovski from the fraction. Why? Lenin's reasoning was \nstrictly pragmatic: 'Everything is over with Malinovski, everything's \nfinished. He's finished. Suicide.'  By this he meant that Malinovski \nhad killed off his own career and that the party's task was to forget \nhim and get on with other business at hand. \nYet Malinovski had retained credence in his ability to delude \nLenin. He craftily fled directly to Galicia and requested a party trial \nto clear his name. A commission was formed, with Lenin and \nZinoviev as members and Jan Hanecki as chairman. There was still \nno watertight case against Malinovski, who threatened to commit \nsuicide unless acquitted. The commission sat for weeks and had not \ncompleted its work when the First World War began. Lenin avoided \nstern words of censure; he could not bring himself to disbelieve \nMalinovski even while conceding that, after several exposures of \npolice provocateurs, 'everything was possible'.  Krupskaya was \nwilling, by  June, to condemn Malinovski's 'scoundrelish esca-\npade';  but she, too, contended that the Liquidators could 'not \nadduce a single fact or even anything like a fact' against the Duma \ndelinquent.  Lenin, judging by his dismissive remarks about \nBukharin's being 'credulous about gossip' in ,  continued to \nfeel that the entire affair was a provocation concocted by as yet \nunidentified enemies of Bolshevism; he even wrote to Malinovski, \nafter he fell into German captivity in the war, in pursuit of further \ncollaboration.  \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nDEBATES ON WAR AND IMPERIALISM \nIf Lenin's choice of associates was widely thought to be faulty, his \nattitude to imperialism and militarism caused small resentment in his \nparty. There was debate about both subjects in European social-\ndemocracy in the two decades before the First World War. Lenin \nread the literature, but did not essay a major contribution of his own. \nWe can surely sympathise: the demands on his time as leader and \ntheorist were already enormous. Yet the abstention is also signif-\nicant. Lenin made choices about his priorities in apportioning his \ntime; by writing much about the national question in the Russian \nempire and little about the inter-imperial questions of colonies and \nwar, he signalled an ordering of importance.  \nThe Bolshevik I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov produced a lengthy two-\npart essay on imperialism for the journal Enlightenment; but he \nelaborated few new ideas and, as with other Russian Marxists, drew \nhis inspiration on this issue mostly from theorists elsewhere in \nEurope.  Among these the most prominent were Karl Kautsky, \nEduard Bernstein, Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl \nRadek. All had been impressed by the scramble for colonies in the \nlate nineteenth century. They noted the support for imperialism from \nliberals as well as conservatives. Ideologies of 'racial superiority', \nthey observed, were proliferating. They also perceived that the major \nindustrial powers of Europe and North America had reduced \nvirtually the entire remainder of the world to the condition of \ncolonies, or at least semi-colonies, and were locked into rivalries \nabout the existing division of 'the spoils'. Armaments industries were \nfostered to enhance the national interests of the imperial powers, and \nmilitaristic attitudes were widely encouraged. The prospect of war \nbetween contending coalitions of the world's imperial powers thrust \nitself forward. \nOnly Bernstein, of the above-mentioned writers, felt that that \ncolonial expansion might have a generally progressive effect. The \nothers found his opinion unpalatable. Luxemburg and Radek \nwelcomed the fact that the conquests of colonies created larger \neconomic units (and they opposed socialists like Lenin who were \nwilling to contemplate their break-up in the future under the aegis of \nEuropean socialist governments). Yet both Luxemburg and Radek \ncondemned Bernstein's perception of capitalist imperialism as any-\nthing other than a brutal and brutalising process.  \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe first to undertake a serious analysis of the causes of \nimperialism was Karl Kautsky, who summarised his arguments in \nhis book Socialism and C o/onialism, in . Karl Marx and \nFriedrich Engels had described capitalism's propensity to produce \na greater quantity of industrial goods than the market for such goods \ncould sustain, and they identified this as a reason for recurrent \neconomic crises. Their contention was that the potential for \n'consumption' was likely to be insufficient in each capitalist \nsociety. Marxologists continue to debate whether Marx and Engels \nbelieved that such underconsumptionist factors would be the crucial \ncause of capitalism's ultimate demise. A neat summary of their \nthought is impossible since, as on other questions, they appear not to \nhave attempted a definitive answer for themselves. Be that as it may, \nKautsky took up the theme of underconsumption with alacrity. \nAlready in , he was writing that contemporary large-scale \ncapitalists experienced a need to find overseas markets for their \nsurplus goods. According to Kautsky, the acquisition of colonies \nprovided a nation's industry and finance with a secure base for such \ntrade, and the underlying cause of modern imperialism and modern \nmilitarism was capitalism itself.  Thus he attacked the gentler \ninterpretation of the overt 'revisionists' such as Bernstein and the \nvarious German right-wing social-democrats who found talk of \nrevolution disturbing. \nKautsky wrote in a period of growing nationalism at home. After \nthe Franco-Prussian war of , there had been no major \ncontinental military conflict involving Germany; and Chancellor \nBismarck had usually contented himself with diplomatic pressure \nto achieve his international ends. German political influence in \ncentral Europe increased as the position of the Habsburg monarchy \nin Austria-Hungary became unstable, and the industrial might of \nGermany grew. There were also moves towards the establishment of \na German empire in Africa. Togoland and parts of south-west Africa \nwere conquered in -. Germany's lateness in becoming an \nimperial power meant that few countries remained for easy annexa-\ntion, and Britain's imperial ambition had not faded, as wars against \nthe Boers showed. This stimulated the Prussian-staffed high com-\nmand and the Rhenish 'iron barons' to build up a navy capable of \ntaking on the British; and Kautsky denounced the encouragement \ngiven to militarist values in Germany.  \nLenin read Kautsky's articles in Die Neue Zeit, but barely added to \nthe literature. A few desultory remarks appeared in the s.  The \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nnotable exception was his statement in The Development of \nCapitalism that the absence of an overseas empire would not prevent \ncapitalist economic development. Russian capitalists, he suggested, \ncould continue in business even without colonies across the oceans \nbecause they already possessed conquests which offered a ready-\nmade market for their industrial products.  But in Iskra, in , he \nadded that domestic industrial expansion could be enhanced by \nguaranteed access to trade with China; and that this was the reason \nfor the imperial government's entanglement in the Russo-Chinese \ncrisis in . Lenin was equally in line with Kautsky's argument \nwhen he added that Russian armaments manufacturers had an \ninterest in promoting an expansionist foreign policy.  A few \nsimilar statements came from Lenin before , when Russia \nwent to war against Japan. He attributed the Russian military \nadventure especially to pressures from industrialists and merchants \nwho, knowing that the Russian working class and peasantry had \nbeen impoverished under the impact of industrial growth, needed to \nseek other outlets for their goods.  It was, to that date, his least \nqualified promotion of underconsumptionist economic theory. \nEvidently Lenin was no less ambiguous about it than was Marx. \nAbout one thing, he was distinct: victory for Japan was desirable; \nand a large number of Russian socialists held the same opinion. In \nLenin's view, the Russo-Japanese war was a struggle 'between a \ndespotic and backward government and politically free and culturally \nfast progressing people'.  Lenin's judgement on the extent of \nfreedom in Japan may be challenged; but, in the tradition of Marx \nand Engels, he took sides in a given war by the criterion of the \nrespective political and economic 'progressiveness' of the two \nbelligerent states.  Yet he largely overlooked such subjects, until \nin  he attended the Stuttgart Congress of the Second Socialist \nInternational. Kautsky, for the German Social-Democratic Party, \nwrote passionately about the rise of militarism in Europe; and Lenin, \nMartov and Rosa Luxemburg wanted to shape a framework for \naction in the event of a general European \\\\ar.  \nLuxemburg, with Lenin's consent, took on the main task of \nsharpening the draft resolution of August Bebel, the German \nsocial-democratic leader.  Bebel's formulations were airily va-\ngue. Luxemburg's successful amendments described militarism as \nthe chief instrument of 'class oppression' in Europe and demanded \nthat, if war were to break out, the crisis should be used 'to accelerate \nthe fall of the bourgeoisie' . Lenin was content. Both he and \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLuxemburg would have preferred an even firmer resolution; but he, \nunlike Luxemburg, accepted that a more strongly-worded formula-\ntion would gravely damage Europe's greatest mass socialist party, the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party, in its dealings with the German \ngovernment.  He still took Kautsky's professions of revolutionary \ncommitment at their face value, and ignored the warnings of Rosa \nLuxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and other far-left commentators on \nGerman socialism. In any case, neither Luxemburg nor Lenin was the \nfieriest participant at Stuttgart. Gustave Herve, a French leftist, had \ndemanded that the outbreak of a European war should be met with a \n'military strike' and a 'popular insurrection'. Lenin argued that \nHerve's proposal would bind the Second International to an \ninflexible policy and would in any case disclose tactics to the forces \nof capitalism. Herve also seemed to adhere to pacifist ideas. Lenin \n(and here he left Luxemburg behind) emphasised that 'revolutionary \nwars' might be necessary.  \nAfter Stuttgart, Lenin returned to questions on imperialism only \nfitfully. The emergence of nationalist movements in Persia, Turkey, \nIndia and China attracted his attention, and in  he asserted that \nEuropean socialism was obtaining 'an international ally' in Asia.  \nIn addition, he affirmed that wars could arise from economic \ncompetition and that militarism was the child of capitalism.  \nOccasional remarks on international crises were forthcoming; like \nall political commentators, he wrote about the Balkans. In  he \nstill thought that the crowned heads of the houses of Habsburg, \nHohenzollern and Romanov would effect a peaceful, anti-democratic \nsettlement.  In , when war broke out between Bulgaria and the \nOttoman empire, he mentioned the dangers of a geographical \nextension of the conflict. A Congress of the Second International \nwas held in Basle while the war raged; but he did not attend, \npreferring to dispatch Kamenev to represent the Bolshevik stand-\npoint. In general, Lenin welcomed the Basle Congress's adherence to \nthe Stuttgart Congress's anti-war policies, and left the matter at \nthat.  \nOn imperialism, it was the Austrian social-democrat Rudolf \nHilferding who broke fresh ground. His Finance Capital, published \nin ,  focussed on the growth of industrial cartels and \nmonopolies in each national economy and the increasing depen-\ndence of industrialists on the financial support of the banks as the \nneed to expand fixed-capital investment grew. Increasingly, accord-\ning to Hilferding, the nation's industrial sectors jointly pursued their \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nrespective interests since a small number of banks controlled the \nwhole process. Moreover, the difficulties of maintaining profits on \nthe domestic market stimulated a quest for foreign outlets and for \nforeign sites for factories where both labour and land were cheap. \nThe most dependable receptacle for such 'capital exports' was the \ncolony. Thus contemporary capitalism was linked to the rise of the \npower of the banks and in turn to imperialism, racialism and anti-\ndemocratism. Hilferding's book was recognised to be not only a \nmassive contribution to Marxist theory but also a contemporary \neconomic classic. It is not known when Lenin read it; but he \nprobably knew its contents soon after publication. He had always \nkept abreast of continental socialist debates, and was in any case a \nvoracious reader. And yet, even if he had read the book, he refrained \nfrom comment. \nThis contrasted with two other 'East Europeans', Karl Radek and \nRosa Luxemburg. Hilferding had suggested that each imperialist \nnation's economy would undergo periodic crises and that the only \npractical alternative was socialism; and he maintained that this \nwould be not an unduly difficult transition since, with the concentra-\ntion of banking capital, a socialist government would merely need to \nnationalise the handful of central banks in order to inaugurate \nsocialism.  This emphasis on economic measures with little \nreference to politics was to call forth criticism from Lenin in the \nFirst World War.  But it was left to Radek and Luxemburg to \ntackle Hilferding at the time. \nIn , Radek published a lengthy pamphlet, German Imperialism \nand the Working Class, in Bremen. He described imperialism as \n'capitalism in its latest stage of development' - a phrase picked up by \nLenin after . His pamphlet was a call to revolution and was \nless scholarly in tone than Hilferding's book. It also discussed \nGerman imperialism in darker terms. Radek noted that German \nworkers were gaining material benefit from German colonial \nexploitation,  and was not complacent about the working class as \nthe unchallengeable constituency of socialists. He also emphasised \nthe massive investment in the development and production of \narmaments in Germany in recent years; his prognosis of the \nprospects of peace were pessimistic.  Radek stressed the increasing \ninadequacies of parliaments in restraining governments. Lenin read \nRadek's pamphlet and took notes, but again he did not reveal his \nopinion; nor did he comment on the possibility, mooted by \nKautsky from , that the imperial nations might mitigate their \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nrivalry and avoid war by reaching a concordat for the peaceful \ncollective exploitation of all colonial peoples.  This idea, which \nbecame known as the theory of 'ultra-imperialism', caused Lenin to \nput pen to paper only after . Luxemburg was quicker to react. \nHer Accumulation of Capital, which appeared in , surveyed the \nevolution of capitalism and examined Hilferding's arguments. She \nhad also noted the shifts in Kautsky's thinking, which indeed led him \nby  to deny that capitalism was inherently militarist.  \nLuxemburg denounced such views. She also felt that Marx's \nCapital, with its claim that capitalism in any given country brought \npoverty to the mass of its population, had never explained \ncapitalism's longevity and continued growth.  How, in fact, did \ncapitalism reproduce itself? Luxemburg's answer, supported by \nreproduction-cycle diagrams, was that industrial capitalism must \ndiscover and hold on to foreign agrarian societies as its major \nmarket and as a location for cheap production. Lenin, having failed \nto be disconcerted by Hilferding and Radek, was annoyed with \nLuxemburg. Firstly, he objected to her temerity (as he saw it) in \ncorrecting Marx. This, as a true believer, he could forgive in nobody; \nand he jotted down diagrams which, he thought, were more closely in \nline with Marx's.  The second irritation for him was that \nLuxemburg referred to the Russian socialist debates of the s, \ncontending that 'V. Ilin' (which was Lenin's main legal pseudonym) \nhad been wrong to criticise populists such as V. P. Vorontsov and \nN. F. Danielson who maintained that the absence of foreign markets \nhobbles the growth of a nation's capitalism. She also asserted that \nthe populist emphasis on the importance of the growth of industrial \nconsumer goods in the initial phase of capitalist development was \nwholly justified.  \nLenin was enraged, standing by his old positions and taking \noffence at her few complimentary remarks about his Development \nof Capitalism. These were, he opined, 'oracle-like' condescension.  \nLuxemburg's book would probably have pulled him at last into the \ntheoretical battle over imperialism, albeit within the narrow field of \ncapital-reproduction cycles. He drafted a plan for an article in March \n.  He congratulated Anton Pannekoek and Otto Bauer (whom, \non the national question, he so despised) for attacking Luxemburg in \ntheir reviews.  But his campaign against Luxemburg was limited to \nbrief sallies as other worries intervened. He pointed out that even \nlarge imperial states such as Russia could be net importers of finance \ncapital. This was in order to prove that Luxemburg's neat contrast \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nbetween the industrial imperial powers and the rest of the world did \nnot entirely fit reality.  He also continued to write pieces \nintermittently on international developments in -; and his \njournalism included remarks on militarism, on banking capital, \nimmigration to Europe, and on the corrupting effects of national-\nism. But his thinking required the jolt of the First World War to \nshake him into a full-blooded consideration of the issues. And, while \ndeploring nationalism, he continued to believe that the European \nworking class would respond positively to the revolutionary move-\nment; and that even the 'English proletariat' was awakening from its \nalleged political quiescence. Radek's stress on the spread of \nimperialist ideas among workers was ignored.  \nTHE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU \nEurope's leading Marxist writers were familiar with the theories of \nLenin. But the level of acquaintance was low outside that group; only \na few eccentrics with a highly-developed interest in Marxian theory \nor with an idiosyncrasy for staying in touch with the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party's affairs could have filled an area bigger \nthan a postage stamp with their knowledge about Bolshevism. Lenin \nand Krupskaya rented a succession of apartments in central and \neastern Europe in streets where the neighbours had no idea of \nBolshevik politics and, as likely as not, would not have cared to \nacquire one either. \nNonetheless there was one political forum on the Continent where \nLenin was not only famous but also a major and obtrusive figure: the \nInternational Socialist Bureau. He became the bane of the Bureau's \ndeliberations, and he reciprocated in his thoughts about the Bureau. \nThe International Socialist Bureau was drawn from the various \nnational parties belonging to the Socialist International. This was \nnot the First Socialist International of Karl Marx and Mikhail \nBakunin, but the Second, which had existed since . Lenin had \nbriefly been one of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party's \nrepresentatives on the International Socialist Bureau (ISB) in \nOctober ; but his departure for Russia forced him to resign \nthe post.  The Central Committee elected him again as an ISB \nrepresentative in June ; and he held this office after the \nSocialist International Congress in Stuttgart in August. His work was \nmostly confined to correspondence, since the ISB's members did not \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nhave to reside in Brussels, its base. Lenin attended Bureau sessions in \nthe autumns of  and .  Up to that time, despite annoying \nits members on account of his schismatic antics inside Russian \nsocialism, he had not disturbed the Second Socialist International \nas a whole. This tranquillity started to come to an end with the \nJanuary  Central Committee plenum, which reunited the \nfactional leaderships of Russian social-democracy and turned over \nthe disputed funds from the legacy of N. P. Shmidt to an arbitra-\ntional 'court' of Karl Kautsky, Franz Mehring and Clara Zetkin. All \nthree were prominent figures in the Socialist International, and their \ndeliberations about Russian social-democratic finances dragged the \nISB into the morass of Bolshevik-Menshevik disputes.  \nNot approving of the outbreak of peace with the Mensheviks at the \nJanuary  plenum, Lenin felt uneasy about what the arbitrators \nmight do with the money. By November  he was claiming that it \nrightfully belonged only to the Bolsheviks.  He journeyed to Berlin \nto lobby Kautsky in person,  and he called for a Central \nCommittee plenum to discuss the delay in the arbitrators' decision, \nbut he could not yet get a sufficient number of Central Committee \nmembers to back him.  \nLenin refused to relent, visiting Berlin in March  with N. G. \nPoletaev, the Bolshevik editor of The Star, to negotiate with Kautsky \nand his two colleagues.  He badgered Kautsky by letter in May and \nmet Zetkin in Stuttgart in June.  In fact, it was only in July  \nthat, finally, he transferred the money into Zetkin's keeping. Neither \nZetkin nor the other two arbitrators could forget that Lenin wished \nto split the Bolsheviks from the Mensheviks, and that a definitive \nrelease of the money to two separate factions would hasten such a \ndivision. Abstention from a definitive ruling, coupled with piecemeal \ngrants in response to requests from each faction, was considered \npreferable; but it was a thankless task nevertheless, especially with a \nLenin who had a record of nagging away interminably and had a \nlawyer's training into the bargain. The arbitrators had to tread \ncircumspectly, and they knew it. Lenin looked into the German laws \non private financial arbitration and planned to hire professional \nlawyers.  Arbitrators Kautsky and Franz Mehring had already had \nenough of the entanglement in Russian socialism. By October , \nboth had pleaded ill-health and resigned their position.  Lenin \nwrote officially to Clara Zetkin that the original arbitrational \nagreement had therefore lapsed and that, unless she immediately \nreturned the money to him, legal proceedings would be initiated. He \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nappended a more informal letter, excusing the formal tone of his \nrequest but asking her what else he could do in the given situation.  \nZetkin tried to temporise. She was unwilling to act unaccompanied \nas an arbitrator and, as Lenin could see, was not averse to supposing \nthat the Bolsheviks had better legal title to the money than the \nMensheviks;  but still she declined to take a decision. In \nannoyance, Lenin carried out his threat to turn to the lawyers. He \ntook advice from the Swiss socialist and advocate Karl Zraggen;  \nand in May  he resorted to Georges Ducos de la Haille, a French \nsocialist as well as a barrister, offering him payment of  francs \non condition that the case against Zetkin was successfully completed \nby August .  \nHis insistence on haste was caused not only by the perennial \nshortage of cash suffered by all Russian revolutionary groups, but \nalso by his dread that further delay would increase the possibility of \nthe ISB's becoming involved.  Bolsheviks G. L. Shklovski and L. B. \nKamenev ran errands in the judicial business over following months \nsince Lenin had meanwhile decamped to Galicia; but the telegrams, \nletters and official statements by Lenin on the Shmidt money did not \nabate. The bemused Ducos de la Haille predictably got nowhere in \nthe time appointed - not that this was condoned by Lenin, who wrote \nto complain in September .  Lenin sought another lawyer. The \nsnag was that Lenin had entrusted all the original documents to \nDucos's safekeeping, and he perceived that Ducos might refuse to \ngive them up without receiving some compensation for his work. In \nMarch , admitting to his own 'hyper-suspiciousness', Lenin \nrequested Kamenev not to pay out any cheque until he had received \nthe necessary documents.  Then the Stuttgart advocate A. Kahn \nwas drawn into the case, and Ducos de la Haille was informed that he \nwould have to share his fees with him; Zraggen, too, was pulled back \nin for assistance.  In December , Lenin's trepidations were \nrealised: the Socialist International started to take an interest in the \nBolshevik-Menshevik dispute. Karl Kautsky, the ex-arbitrator and \nlong-time commentator on Russian socialist affairs, spoke at an ISB \nsession in London. Declaring that the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party had ceased to exist, he felt justified in calling for a \nmeeting of 'all factions of the Russian labour movement' in the \nRomanov empire which accepted the social-democratic party pro-\ngramme. \nThe ISB accordingly urged the calling of a gathering which might \neffect 'a mutual exchange of opinions' . Lenin foresaw that this \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ncould lead not only to a financial settlement quite unsatisfactory to \nhim but also to moves towards the party's organisational reunifica-\ntion. He was alarmed by the noises made recently by Rosa \nLuxemburg in this direction in Vorwiirts. Luxemburg's attitude had \nalways been the same as Zetkin's.  Now it was Lenin's turn to \ntemporise. The ISB's invitation to Bolsheviks and Mensheviks to \nexchange opinions could not be resisted unless he was willing to \nappear to be the party splitter he really was; and, in any case, \nsocialist lawyers such as Zraggen (who was now regarded as 'very \nweak and cowardly' by Lenin)  did not wish to obstruct the ISB's \nplan. \nLenin's ploy was to accept the invitation to 'a mutual exchange of \nopinions' of the Russian factions while expressing objection to \nKautsky's characterisation of the Russian Social-Democratic La-\nbour Party.  Meanwhile 'all kinds of reconnaissance' should be \nundertaken to find out the political line-up and agenda.  What \nabout the Shmidt money? Lenin's room for manoeuvre had shrunk, \nand he strove for general recognition that the financial question and \nthe question of party reunification should be kept separate; he \nremarked that Kautsky, too, had once conceded that directly \n'political' considerations were not at stake in the controversy over \nShmidt's legacy.  He also repudiated any offer from the German \nSocial-Democratic Party to mediate further in the matter.  \nSimultaneously, he endeavoured to seem as well-intentioned as \npossible. He beavered away at the statistics of the votes for \nBolsheviks and Mensheviks at the  State Duma elections and \nat the respective print-run of Bolshevik and Menshevik newspapers. \nHis motivations were only barely disguised: Lenin wanted to seize \nand retain the mantle of legitimacy for the Bolshevik-controlled \n'party' he had inaugurated at the Party Conference in Prague in ; \nand he had no intention of going to the ISB's proposed 'exchange of \nopinions' meeting in order to give up his grasp on a Bolshevik-\ndominated Central Committee. But this would require a barrage of \npreparatory propaganda to convince the ISB that the Bolsheviks \nwere indeed the sole representatives of organised Marxism in the \nRussian empire and that the Mensheviks comprised only a gaggle of \nunattached emigres and anti-party, Russia-based 'Liquidators'.  \nHe discerned that the wrangling had dragged the party's name in \nthe mud across Europe; and he frequently emphasised that he had no \npersonal financial interest in the judicial to-and-fro. But the patience \nof the ISB was wearing thin. With so many issues to be resolved in \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nthe Socialist International, it was irritating for so much time and \neffort to be put into Russian affairs. But no concession was \nforthcoming from him. To have yielded over the money would have \nincreased the hated possibility of party reunification. Lenin had not \nattended the ISB meeting in December , and he made clear that \nhe would absent himself from international gatherings in the months \nto come.  \nRUSSIA IN  \nAnd so, in the first half of , Lenin faced organisational problems \nboth international and Russian. One complicating factor was of his \nown making. Since July  he and the Central Committee had been \ntalking about holding a Party Congress.  This was another device \nto arrogate legitimacy for the Bolsheviks as the principal constituent \nmembers of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Although \nConferences could and did take major decisions on behalf of the \nparty, Congresses were considered more authoritative. Lenin wanted \nto follow up the Prague Conference with a Krakow Congress.  His \ncalculations were not publicly revealed, but can easily be guessed: he \nwas 'going for broke'. In order to win his forthcoming struggles in \nthe Socialist International, he had to call a Congress which would \n'demonstrate' that the Mensheviks had no significant following in \nRussia; and he had the confidence, or rather the gall, to plan to \nmanipulate the Congress rules to produce the desired political \ncomposition of delegates. The ISB had to be presented with a \nplausible performance if he was to get away with his scheme. The \nCentral Committee reconvened in Krakow from  April  and \napproved a proposal to convoke the Sixth Party Congress in Krakow \nin August, just before the time when the Socialist International was \nscheduled to hold a Congress in Vienna. The Krakow delegates \nwould be able to travel on to Vienna to lobby for the Bolshevik \ncause.  \nThis was characteristic bluff and skulduggery from Lenin. As with \nthe Prague Conference arrangements, various commissions were \nappointed to ensure that Bolsheviks commanded the selection and \nvetting of delegates.  Lenin had either learned from Prague or \nbowed to advice from colleagues: a genuine invitation would be \nissued in a timely fashion to the Poles, Latvians and Lithuanians so \nas to avoid the criticisms of his neglect of the non-Russian segments \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nof the party in . But they still would not receive a fair proportion \nof available seats at the Congress. There would be between sixty and \nninety seats. The Poles would receive only five, the Latvians two or \neven one, and the Lithuanians one. The Jewish Bund would be \ninvited, but the letter would deliberately be dispatched so as to arrive \ntoo late. It was not even clear that the 'national' parties would be \nallowed to vote at this Sixth Congress in Galicia.  \nLenin knew full well that his Congress's self-proclamation as the \nparty's supreme assembly would be challenged by all non-Bolsheviks. \nAmong his tasks in  was the continued gathering of quantitative \ndata on the support for Bolshevism in Russia. As regards news-\npapers, he noted that Pravda's print-run had ascended to a fairly \nregular , whereas the Menshevik-edited Luch had attained less \nthan half of this figure.  He highlighted the activity of the \nBolshevik deputies to the Fourth State Duma, and emphasised that \nthe Bolsheviks had swept the board in the workers' constituencies in \nSt Petersburg and Moscow, whereas the Mensheviks had scored \nvictories in more peripheral areas and often through electoral pacts \nwith liberals. Much was also made about the election of Bolshevik \nactivists to trade union boards. His claim, which may have been \nsomewhat exaggerated, was that at least sixteen out of the capital's \ntwenty boards had moved towards the Bolsheviks. In the absence \nof a freely-conducted survey of popular opinion, Lenin fell back on \narithmetical extrapolations. He asserted that four-fifths of the \nRussian imperial urban working class were consciously pro-Bol-\nshevik. This was trumpery even by Lenin's standards. The \nextrapolations came from the limited sample of Pravda's circulation \nalongside the elections to the capital's trade unions. The data, in \nother words, were in effect confined largely to St Petersburg's skilled \nworkers, which was far from being typical of the Russian empire's \nurban society and economy. Someone who had been born in the \nVolga town of Simbirsk and had, in his Development of Capitalism in \nRussia, castigated others for their sloppy statistics must have been \naware of the mathematical sleight of hand here. \nWorking-class unrest, however, certainly increased in . Strikes \nin enterprises surveyed by the official factory inspectorate rose to \n from  in the previous year (and the number of strikers to \n, from ,).  The Ministry of Internal Affairs was \nseriously concerned. Workers were enraged with both employers \nand government, and anti-Romanov street demonstrations were \norganised in St Petersburg. It was claimed that the slogans carried \n Storms Before the Storm \n \non several banners mentioned demands for a democratic republic, \nconfiscation of gentry-owned land and an eight-hour day. These were \nBolshevik slogans,  but it is a moot point whether acquaintance \nwith Bolshevism went beyond this or indeed whether most workers \non demonstrations acquired their ideas directly from Bolsheviks. \nPravda editorials; speeches by the Bolshevik Duma deputies; public \nstatements of Bolshevik trade unionists: all these had to be cautiously \nformulated so as not to attract punitive actions by police and censor. \nUnconstrained discussion of Bolshevik ideas occurred only in the \nRussian political underground, in Siberian exile and in the emigra-\ntion. Lenin and Krupskaya had no illusions about the weakness and \nlow morale in the illegal party apparatus. In February , \nKrupskaya wrote bluntly: 'The illegal organisation is pulverised.'  \nRegional centres had vanished; local urban organisations were cut \noff from each other. Almost all experienced activists had been 'taken \nout of circulation'.  Reports from Russia, such as we know them \nfrom published documents, confirm her judgement. The Moscow \ncomrades talked of 'a complete break-up' of party groups.  Lenin \nput the problem in a nutshell (but did so in a private letter, \npresumably to avoid further demoralisation among his followers in \nRussia): 'The revolutionary mood arising in recent times in Russia \nhas the tendency to keep growing but, being insufficiently guided in \nthe absence of well-established underground organisations, can \nbecome powerless and aimless.'  The Bolshevik leader was not \nthe only politician to wring his hands. Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries had still less to cheer about; and the Kadets, while \nsuffering less from the Okhrana's attentions, had little serious hope \nof attracting workers to their cause. The trade unions seem to have \nhad as many difficulties as before. The labour movement, illegal and \nlegal, was severely harassed.  \nAnd yet this did not expunge working-class discontent. The \nruthless suppression of strikes, sometimes with Cossack cavalrymen \nriding into pickets, caused lasting embitterment; and conditions in \nthe factories worsened for the labour force as employers in St \nPetersburg and elsewhere imposed new working practices to raise \nproductivity.  The industrial scene was a tinder-box awaiting \nignition. The authorities persisted with their policy of restricting \nthe freedom of trade unions. As always, the huge size of many \nfactories and accompanying feelings of 'alienation' among workers \ncreated difficulties; and the appalling environment, with its under-\nprovision of housing and poor sewage and recreational facilities, \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nincreased the probability of political crisis. Workers, denied easy \nopportunities to join trade unions or political parties, found other \nplaces to discuss their grievances: groups of men gathering in taverns, \nmany of them coming from the same towns or villages and feeling \nable to trust each other, talked about their misfortunes. There were \nalso heated debates between shifts at the factories.  \nSuch circumstances made it likely that strikes would erupt without \nwarning and take both revolutionaries and government by surprise. \nLenin recognised this; and, when he was not busy explaining to the \nInternational Socialist Bureau that the Bolsheviks were in better \nshape and had greater support than the Mensheviks, urged his \ncomrades to do their utmost to re-establish the illegal party \napparatus. Krupskaya's notebook continued to acquire names/ \nbut it was of limited practical use since the police were so skilful in \ncapturing revolutionaries. Signs of vigorous communication between \nthe Central Committee and the Russian political underground are \nfew. In three out of the first six months of , apparently, Lenin \ndid not even write to the Bolshevik Duma deputies; and these \ndeputies, overburdened with Duma activities and other speaking \nand writing engagements, seldom visited him. Petrovski seems to \nhave done so twice.  There was also the usual pressure on Lenin to \ncool his polemical ardour. At the turn of the year a Central \nCommittee session in Galicia had passed a resolution that Pravda \nshould avoid abusing so-called Liquidators: a veiled censure of Lenin \nand his friends.  Dissatisfaction with Lenin was also expressed in \nhis discharge of technical duties. Despite the stress laid by the Prague \nConference upon the legal labour movement, Lenin failed, as before, \nto supply the requested articles and advice on the subject. Even the \nsecond anniversary of the Lena goldfields massacre did not inspire \nhim to compose a suitable piece. E. F. Rozmirovich wrote from St \nPetersburg, by then more in sorrow than in anger: 'My closest friends \nare grumbling that you're doing nothing for them. They're upset.' \nBy  Lenin, too, had come to see that his protege Chernoma-\nzov's zest for polemics was causing more harm than good; and that \nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs was being provided with regular \nexcuses to shut down Pravda. Lenin acceded to Chernomazov's \nremoval and was able, because of the shortage of competent \njournalistic talent in the capital, to secure agreement for his \nassociate Kamenev (who no longer had Workers' Newspaper to edit \nin Paris) to take over Pravda's direction in February . Kamenev \nwas also expected to liaise with the Bolshevik Duma deputies as \n Storms Before the Storm \n \nFyodor Dan did for the Menshevik deputies.  Kamenev's appoint-\nment soothed Lenin; and, for the first time since its foundation, \nPravda ceased to give him worry.  \nNor was the Central Committee as troublesome to Lenin as it once \nhad been. The Bolshevik underground members who had been \nelected at Prague and had objected to his methods - Ordzhoni-\nkidze, Goloshchekin, Spandaryan - had been arrested; and the sole \nCentral Committee member from the Party Mensheviks, D. M. \nShvartsman, dropped out entirely from Central Committee work: \nand he too was put in prison in . Meanwhile Zinoviev and, \nuntil his abscondment, Malinovski supported Lenin on most \nquestions. Several activists were co-opted to fill the gaps: I. V. \nStalin, I. S. Belostotski, Y. M. Sverdlov, G.l. Petrovski, A. E. \nBadaev and A. S. Kiselev. None of them, with the exception of \nStalin,  stood up to Lenin as Ordzhonikidze and his friends had \ndone. At any rate Lenin was accorded much scope for initiative, at \nleast in regard to the politics of the emigration. The International \nSocialist Bureau's December  decision to invite all factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party to an 'exchange of views' \nmeeting in Brussels lay on the table. For some months, Lenin was \nunruffled. His constantly-updated collection of data purporting to \ndemonstrate the conscious support of most workers in Russia for \nBolshevism was periodically issued; and, since the International \nSocialist Bureau had called for the meeting, he left it to the Bureau to \nconvoke it. The delay seemed to guarantee that his own 'Sixth \nCongress' would occur in advance of the Brussels meeting and that a \nnew Central Committee, formed under Lenin's guidance, would be \ncreated. \nBut this fait accompli was pre-empted by the Bureau's sudden \nscheduling of the inter-factional 'exchange of views' meeting for \nJuly. Things became stickier for Lenin when the Malinovski \nscandal erupted and, as might easily have been predicted, non-\nLeninists in the party were raising a hue and cry about Lenin's \nconvoking his own Party Congress. The --.ongress plan was \nshunted quietly to the side; all efforts were ce..tred on the ISB's \nBrussels gathering. Lenin felt he was not the faction's ideal spokes-\nman: he would lose his temper and his opponents would have a \nchance to interrogate him. He implored Inessa Armand to fulfil the \nrole, offering to supply a report and a speech if she would deliver \nthem. He had been outmanoeuvred. The Brussels meeting opted to \nhold a Party Congress to reunify the party; and the Executive \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nCommittee of the International Socialist Bureau, whose representa-\ntives attended, concluded that no irreconcilable basic disagreements \ndivided the various Russian factions.  Armand, having been told by \nLenin that 'the essential thing is to prove that only we are the party', \nabstained in the vote on a unifying Congress. \nLenin worked to extricate himself from the mess. He went on \ncollating information on the respective strengths of the Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the legal labour movement in Russia.  From  \nJune to  July he held a meeting in Poronin of his closest supporters. \nZinoviev, Petrovski and Kiselev attended as Central Committee \nmembers, and N. P. Glebov-Avilov and A. N. Nikiforova took part \nas leading Bolshevik activists in Russia. Kiselev later wrote that \nthe talk was mainly about the Brussels meeting, the forthcoming \nCongress of the Second International in Vienna and the Russian \nState Duma. Lenin's subsequent letter to Bolshevik Duma deputy, \nF. N. Samoilov, who was convalescing in Switzerland, referred only \nto the trouble engendered by the decisions of the International \nSocialist Bureau. He predicted that the 'workers of Russia' would \ntake no notice of the Brussels meeting. \nThe absorption in intra-party concerns was extreme. Summer  \nwitnessed renewed labour unrest in the Romanov empire: a general \nstrike was organised by workers in Baku in June; and, from  July, \nstrikes and demonstrations began in St Petersburg. Barricades went \nup in some suburbs. The employers hit back and were actively \nsupported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  It is impressive that \nthe Bolshevik supreme leadership, which had insisted that the \nMensheviks underrated the revolutionary potential of the working \nclass, sat around on Lenin's veranda in Poronin oblivious of the \ndisorder in St Petersburg. Even more noteworthy is that, with war \nabout to break out in central Europe and to envelope all the major \npowers on the Continent, the chieftains of Bolshevism assumed that \nthe major international issue for them was how to comport \nthemselves at the Vienna Congress of the Second International. \n   Ad Extirpanda: \n- \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer , sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Probably there would eventually have been a \nrevolution. Having survived his ordeals of -, the emperor had \ntried to restore his autocratic powers and had been suspicious of his \npremier Petr Stolypin's co-operation with the State Duma. Yet the \nimperial state had lost its ability to repress all opposition at will. The \nmonarch's truculence narrowed the ground for political compromise \nand evolution; it also made more likely the ultimate success of the \nmore radical among his opponents. The nature of an anti-Romanov \nrevolution would very probably have been different if Russia had not \ngone to war. In mid-, before the war, there was no economic \ncrisis. Agricultural production and the trade in farm products had \nnever been greater, and industrial output was expanding. Social \nconflicts were fierce but not uncontrollable. Thus the major catalysts \nfor the Bolshevik party to advance to power, as it did in , were \nweak. No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government. It is worth \nrecalling that in  they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Perhaps he would have \nchanged his mind; the ease with which he did so in  indicates his \nchangeability, and the Bolshevik strategy of  for a bourgeois \nrevolution had always carried strong traces of a zeal for socialist \nreforms.  \nBut this is all hypothetical. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in ; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. The \nscale of casualties was unprecedented. Millions of people perished in \n \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ncombat or behind the lines; and the epidemic of Spanish influenza, \nwhich killed further millions after , was all the more deadly in \nconsequence of the material and social hardships induced by the \nfighting. Political structures crumbled; the crowned rulers of Russia, \nGermany and Austria-Hungary lost their thrones. Economic deva-\nstation prevailed throughout Europe. \nLenin, like every other leader of the Second International, had \nsometimes predicted a continental war; indeed this was the common \nprognosis of most politicians and commentators regardless of \npolitical orientation. But such predictions were frequently offered \nsomewhat casually. Zinoviev was to recall that Lenin had no idea \nthat the European war really was fast approaching.  Moreover, even \nthose commentators who thought war to be near at hand were \nastounded by the actual timing of the outbreak and by the longevity \nand intensity of the subsequent fighting. German Chancellor \nBethmann Hollweg sensed 'a doom greater than any human power \nhanging over Europe'. But in the fateful summer of  few actors \nin the international drama, whether ministers or diplomats, had a \nsense of the cataclysm awaiting their nations. The revolutionaries \nwere no less caught off their guard. Lenin in his articles in July  \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. \nHis bemusement by the declaration of war was a typical condition \n(even though it must be added that he was extraordinary in taking so \nlittle notice even of the July diplomatic crisis). Were it not for the \negregious claims about his perspicacity made by official historians in \nthe USSR, the matter would not need to be belaboured. The speed of \nthe transformation of a regional diplomatic crisis into continental \nwar was staggering; and mobilisation of whole societies and \neconomies, and not merely the combatant armies, in pursuit of \nvictory was unprecedented in wars among great powers. \nThe event that produced the crisis was the Austrian Archduke \nFranz Ferdinand's assassination by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo \non  June. On  July, Austria-Hungary delivered her ultimatum to \nneighbouring Serbia. Unless the Serbs agreed to humiliating political \nconditions, war would ensue between Serbia and the Austro-\nHungarian empire. The Russian government declared support for \nthe Serbs. On  July, the German government announced that, \nunless Russia agreed to demobilise her forces, Germany would take \nmilitary action on Austria-Hungary's side. Russia, encouraged by \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nintimations of support from Britain and France, held firm. Germany \ndeclared war on Russia. Britain and France entered the hostilities \nagainst Germany and Austria-Hungary. By the second week of \nAugust the mightiest states of Europe were lined up against each \nother. The Allies, including Russia, confronted the Central Powers. \nRussia's relations with Austria-Hungary had deteriorated over the \nprevious decade; and Germany's pretensions in both Eastern Europe \nand the Near East had intermittently heightened tension between St \nPetersburg and Berlin. Accommodation was reached about the plan \nfor a German-built railway from the Turkish seaboard to Baghdad. \nBut the economic competition to be expected from Germany in \ntraditional Russian trading areas such as Persia remained a source of \nworry. Russian business in several key industrial sectors was also \nsuffering at the hands of German firms in the Russian domestic \nmarket. In addition, Russian foreign policy from the s moved \ncloser towards the embrace of the French. The Paris-raised loan of \n had been crucial to the survival of the Romanov dynasty. Both \nRussian and French politicians opposed the expansion of German \npower in Europe. Germany, at the same time, resented the lack of a \nlarge overseas empire and felt baulked by the British in her quest to \nwield a worldwide power commensurate with her industrial and \nmilitary strength. Ideas about the nation's honour and vital interests \naffected not only governing and proprietorial groups but also broad \nsocial classes. Russian fears about Germany were complemented by \nGerman fears about Russia. German army leaders advised that the \nachievements of Russian industrial development were such that, if \nGermany's security was to be guaranteed, Russian power had to be \ndestroyed by a pre-emptive war. \nBy , the Russian emperor judged that his country's prestige \nand geopolitical interest in the Balkans were at stake. Russia had \npublicly given way to Austrian threats in the recent past. Austria-\nHungary's annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in  had \nevoked protests from Serbia; but Russia had stepped back from \narmed conflict on the Serbian side. Relations with both Austria-\nHungary and Germany never fully recovered. And Britain too, which \nsince the mid-nineteenth century had avoided being ensnared in \nEurope's rivalries, was alarmed by Germany: the build-up of the \nGerman fleet agitated the British government, and in  an entente \nwas formed between Britain and France. \nA mystery endures about Lenin's attitude in the pre-war years. To \nbe sure, he predicted a continental war. And yet he was little \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nbothered by the vicissitudes of European diplomacy or even regional \nwars in Europe. Only the barest comments were elicited from him \non the Balkan wars of  and , which were fought by Turkey \nand the successor states to the Ottoman empire in south-eastern \nEurope. Unlike Trotski, who worked as a war correspondent in the \nBalkans in - and covered the fighting, he did not recognise-\nexcept in the most cursory fashion - that a military conflict in the \nBalkans might light a holocaust of mutual destruction among the \nGreat Powers.  It is only halfway towards an explanation to suggest \nthat he was absorbed in party-political thoughts and activity; it \nremains to be explained why he allowed such an absorption to take \nplace. Obsessive as he was about controlling Bolshevik affairs, he \nseldom let them expunge everything else from his mind. Perhaps, \nlike many other Marxists, his belief in the probability of European \nwar inhabited a rarified, intellectual plane; he showed little vital \nconcern. Before  he had written several anti-militarist articles \nand had lobbied in the Second International at the Stuttgart \nCongress. But the articles were brief. And he had left it to L. B. \nKamenev to put the anti-militarist case at the Basle Congress of the \nSecond International in , when the first Balkan war was \nraging.  \nConsequently, his intellectuality about the prospect of a general \ncontinental war was shattered only by the outbreak of the First \nWorld War itself. The armies of the two sides mobilised according to \nlong-laid national plans, and Europe's railways were loaded with \nmen, weapons, horses and fodder. The German authorities, enter-\ntaining low expectations of Austria-Hungary as their ally, encour-\naged Turkey to join the Central Powers. This added to Russia's \ndifficulties, compelling her to fight simultaneously on two fronts. Yet \nGermany, facing Russia to the east and France and Britain to the \nwest, had the same problem to a greater degree. Speedy conquests \nwere essential to German strategy: Belgium and Holland were \ninvaded, and troops poured into northern France before British \nregiments could cross the English Channel. But the line on the \nWestern front steadied and then held firm. Masses of men, rapidly \ntrained and equipped, dug themselves into trenches. The no-man's \nland between the two sides was turned into a lunar landscape of \ndestruction. To the east, it was the Russians who temporarily held \nthe initiative. The armies of the Romanovs swept out from 'Russian' \nPoland through to eastern Prussia. Galicia, where Lenin was living, \nwas overrun in autumn . \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nARREST AND RELEASE \nLenin and Zinoviev unknowingly had chosen to live in what was to \nbe the path of the Russian advance. The additional danger for the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders was that, as Russian subjects, they and their \nwives might come under suspicion in Austrian-ruled Poland as being \nspies. Imprisonment by either Russians or Austrians could happen at \nany time, so they planned to leave Habsburg territory as fast as was \nlegally possible: war hysteria afflicted all combatant countries; it was \nnot unknown for aliens to be lynched. Anti-Russian sentiment was \nrife among local Poles. All Russian emigrants could expect to be \ncontacted by the police authorities in Krakow sooner or later and \nLenin was an obvious object of mistrust. His daily habits were far \nfrom reassuring to policemen; he owned a Browning pistol. Why did \nsomeone claiming to have come to Galicia to study agricultural \nconditions have need of such a weapon? He also went climbing \nregularly in the hills near the border: could he be keeping a \nrendezvous with his St Petersburg spy-masters? Lenin, Krupskaya \nand the Zinovievs none the less refused to panic. They saw it was too \nlate to make a dash across the vast domains of the Austro-Hungarian \nempire to seek sanctuary in any neutral country: they were a \nthousand kilometres by rail from the Swiss border and almost as \nfar from the nearest ferry port to Scandinavia. Lenin conferred with \nZinoviev, and both of them relied heavily on their acquaintances. \nBagocki for advice on how to avoid trouble. \nThey bore up well. Bagocki was to recall that Lenin was agitated \nless by his personal situation than by the Second International \nleadership's reaction to the war. His worst moment came when he \nread the Krakow newspapers on  August.  Reports from the \nGerman Reichstag told that the social-democrats had voted war \ncredits to their government. Lenin rightly stated that this implicitly \nbreached the assumptions of the Second International's anti-war \npolicy. To be fair, a minority of the Reichstag social-democratic \nfraction under Hugo Haase had privately objected to the fraction's \nattitude to war credits; and Kautsky, who did not belong to the \nReichstag, sided with Haase. Both Haase and Kautsky continued to \nseek an end to the fighting without themselves being arrested. But \nsuch behaviour was not the outright opposition that Lenin deman-\nded. \nAccording to S. Bagocki, Lenin stated bluntly: 'This is the end of \nthe Second International ... From today I shall cease being a social-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. ' There would have been \nructions in the International even if war had not broken out; and \nLenin might have been willing to disaffiliate his Bolsheviks from \nmembership. He now planned something much more grandiose: the \nconstruction of an entirely separate 'Third' International.  His \ninclination hardened as it became evident that not only the German \nsocial-democrats but nearly all other socialist parties in Europe \ndeclined to oppose their respective country's entry into the war. \nMost French and British socialists saw the war as a tragic national \nnecessity. Only few brave spirits denounced it. Karl Liebknecht, \nsocial-democratic deputy in the German Reichstag, took this course \nin  and was arrested; and Pierre Brizon in France had to tread \nwarily to escape the same fate. Not all socialist groups were swept up \nby the pro-war and patriotic frenzy. Minority factions in Britain, \nFrance and Germany took an openly anti-war stand; opposition was \nstronger in Italy and among the Czechs. But generally the French \nSocialist Party and the British Labour Party supported the Allied war \neffort even while retaining objections to their governments and \nspeaking up for better treatment of the workers. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism.  \nIt was among the socialists of the Romanov empire that hostility \nto the war was strongest and most pervasive. The antagonism to the \nmonarchy was profound in Russia, and the chasm between socialists \nand the rest of political society was vast. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. In the Romanov lands, however, not many \nsocialists aspired at a 'civil peace', a 'Burgfrieden' or 'une union \nsacree'. Lenin's instinctive refusal to condone the Russian imperial \ngovernment's engagement in war was paralleled by the reactions of \nmany others. \nMost Bolshevik leaders, including those hostile to Lenin, fulmi-\nnated against the dynasty and its military objectives; only a few, such \nas G. A. Aleksinski called for a patriotic defence against the \nGermans who were accused of imperialist aggression. And yet the \nwill to volunteer to fight for the Allies was not absent even from the \nParis-based Committee of the Foreign Organisation, which lost \nseveral members to the French armed forces. Among these it was \nthe wish to protect democratic France rather than to defend Russia \nwhich was the motivation. The Committee of the Foreign Organisa-\ntion collapsed in disarray.  Among the Mensheviks, there were \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nsimilar divisions. Martov, Dan, and Pavel Akselrod were as \nantagonistic as Lenin to the waging of the war.  Even A. N. \nPotresov and Maslov, who called for a war of national defence \nagainst German militarism, declined to lend overt support to Nikolai \nII; they would defend the country but would lend no succour to the \ngovernment. This appeared to be Georgi Plekhanov's standpoint, \nbut in practice he suspended his tirades against the monarchy for fear \nof destabilising the war effort.  The Mensheviks who took an \nunashamedly 'patriotic' position were a minority of their faction. \nThe Socialist Revolutionaries, too, were riven by disputes; but Viktor \nChernov and most leaders opposed support for the Russian war \neffort. The general desire to hold to an 'internationalist' perspective \nprevailed among most socialist activists regardless of party alle-\ngiance. \nAnd yet the anti-war Russian revolutionaries were initially out of \nstep with popular sentiment in the Russian empire. Not only the \nmiddle and upper classes but, so far as can be judged, all sections of \nthe population believed that Germany and Austria-Hungary had to \nbe resisted. Workers who had been striking or demonstrating in St \nPetersburg in July were voluntarily back at work in August. Leading \nsocialist opponents of the war, if they were in the emigration, chose \nSwitzerland, Sweden or the United States of America as their haven \nfor the duration of hostilities, but few emigres faced quite the \ndilemmas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin and his colleagues, caught as they \nwere on the territory of Russia's military foe. \nOn  August  Lenin received his first visit from the \nauthorities. After a superficial search, his statistical notes on the \nagrarian question were confiscated on suspicion that they might be a \nspy's coded messages. Lenin remarked ruefully that his party \ncorrespondence was left untouched. He was ordered to present \nhimself next day at the railway station and to travel to Nowy Targ \nfor the completion of further enquiries. Lenin contacted his Polish \nfriends. Jan Hanecki sent a telegram to S. Marek, a social-democratic \nparliamentarian in Austria-Hungary, to seek his intercession on \nLenin's behalf. Lenin himself telegraphed the Krakow police, asking \nthem to confirm to the police in Poronin and Nowy Targ that he was \nan emigre revolutionary who had entered the country legally.  Off \nhe set for Nowy Targ on  August. On the same day Marek \ntelegrammed to Nowy Targ police station that 'Lenin-Ulyanov' \nwas known to him personally and was 'blameless and trustwor-\nthy'. This did not prevent Lenin's arrest on arrival in Nowy Targ \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nat eleven o'clock that morning, and he remained in custody until  \nAugust. The interrogations, which were facilitated by material sent \nby the police in Krakow,  bore out Lenin's testimony. The sole \nuntoward aspect of his case, in the eyes of the Nowy Targ invest-\nigators, was Lenin's illegal possession of the Browning pistol (which \nwas removed from him). Visits by Hanecki and Krupskaya were \nallowed; but the Nowy Targ police, despite being convinced that \nLenin's story was genuine, were unwilling to take responsibility for \nhis release. Bureaucratic red-tape was not peculiar to the Romanov \nlands. \nKrupskaya took the initiative. On II August she wrote to the \nAustrian social-democratic leader and parliamentarian Viktor Adler \nin Vienna to request his intervention?' She made the same plea to \nparliamentary deputy G. Diamand on I August.  Adler and \nDiamand responded helpfully, declaring to the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs in Vienna that the suspected Russian spy Lenin was well-\nknown throughout Europe for his dedication to the 'struggle against \nRussian tsarism'.  Lenin's referees exaggerated his fame, but their \nwords had the desired effect. On  August the case against Lenin \nwas abandoned and the Krakow authorities instructed the Nowy \nTarg police to release him. \nLenin returned to Bialy Dunajec. On  August, after sending his \nthanks to Adler and Diamand, he made arrangements to leave for \nSwitzerland. According to Hanecki, Lenin retained the fear that his \nlife might be in danger from the villagers. In any case, he desired a \nfreedom for his politics that was unavailable to a Russian emigrant in \nAustria-Hungary. The journey required official permission in war-\ntime, and while waiting, Lenin studied the German socialist press \nwith increasing exasperation? Herman Greulich, the Swiss social-\ndemocratic leader, contacted Adler to enquire how he could help \nLenin financially with his travel plans. This was ironical; within a few \nyears Greulich would be regarded by Lenin as a deadly betrayer of \nsocialism. On  August, Lenin and Krupskaya received the \nnecessary documentation from Krakow to travel to Vienna, and \nthey set off in company with Krupskaya's mother, but further \nexternal assistance was needed. Not having a passport, Lenin could \nnot take a train across the Swiss frontier, but he invoked the name of \nGreulich and left for Switzerland on I August.  The Ulyanovs \ntravelled in the company of Zinoviev and his wife Lilina. They \narrived in Zurich on  August. Behind them they left a region of \nEastern Europe which was to be marched over by the armies of \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nRussia, Germany and Austria-Hungary. They also had to abandon \nthe largest part of the Bolshevik faction's archive of books, \npamphlets, manuscripts and letters.  \nLater, when the Bolsheviks had consolidated their power in \nRussia, a search was made in Nowy Targ for them. Ten hundred-\nweights of these materials were discovered.  But the temporary loss, \nwhile hardly being insignificant for a politician and a bibliophile, was \ncompensated in Lenin's mind by the knowledge that he could resume \nhis struggle against the Romanov dynasty without let or hindrance. \nLenin wrote to Adler to thank him warmly for his assistance.  \nANNOUNCING A POLICY \nSettling again in Switzerland, Lenin was a leader with an even \nsmaller following than in the pre-war period. The struggle for \ninfluence would have to be resumed virtually from scratch. Contact \nwith Russia had disappeared and the central emigre apparatus had \nceased to exist; and the Central Committee was a fiction; Lenin and \nZinoviev were its only members at liberty; and the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation was a shambles. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in  and \nSocial-Democrat in . Krupskaya's address book could not be \nused after the Malinovski affair since the assumption had to be that \nthe Okhrana had had access to its contents. Lenin and Zinoviev, \nwhile still rejecting the case against Malinovski (and even proceeding \nto correspond with him when, as a Russian soldier, he was captured \nand placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp), could not take risks \nwith the lives of Bolsheviks in Russia.  The restoration of \ncommunications with the underground party committees had to be \nundertaken with care. The postal services were in any case impeded \nby the Western and Eastern military fronts which stretched from \nnorth to south across Europe; and even correspondence with \nsympathetic emigres in Britain and France had to be handled \ncautiously in view of the alertness of governments in London and \nParis to anti-war propaganda. Political conditions had grown more \ndifficult even in Switzerland, where the authorities would not allow \nforms of activity likely to compromise its neutrality in wartime.  \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's early need was to rally support in the Swiss emigration, \nbeginning with the Geneva 'section' of the Bolshevik Foreign \nOrganisation. The section, which had fewer than a dozen members, \nwelcomed him and Zinoviev warmly.  They had contacts with \nBolsheviks elsewhere in Switzerland, and the news spread that the \ntwo most eminent Bolsheviks had arrived safely. All wanted to end \nthe uncertainty about party policy. The time had passed when it \nwould have been possible to implement the Stuttgart recommenda-\ntion that potentially belligerent governments should be held back \nfrom war by the threat of counter-actions by the massed labour \nmovement; the war already raged at full spate. But the question arose \nas to what to do about it now that it had started. Lenin fell back on \nhis experience in the underground movement in Samara and St \nPetersburg in the s. He wrote out his ideas and then had them \ntyped and circulated as carbon copies to fellow Bolsheviks in \nSwitzerland. \nApparently he had written an -word draft of 'Tasks of \nRevolutionary Social-Democracy in the European War', before \nreaching Switzerland, in the last days of August . The themes \nwere fundamental to all his wartime work. Lenin's readers amounted \nto a few hundred at most, and the overwhelming majority of those \nwere emigres. But the contents had an historic significance; they \nwere pillars in the formation of Lenin's Bolshevism and of the official \nideology of the early Soviet state. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. Socialism and the revolution, \nhe declared, had been betrayed. The German government had \ndeluded its country's social-democrats by assuring them that its \nwar aims were entirely defensive and non-expansionist; and even \nKautsky was giving Bethmann Hollweg the benefit of the doubt until \nit could be proved otherwise. But Lenin maintained that neither the \nCentral Powers nor the Allies should be analysed so generously. The \nwar was not a struggle between the just and the unjust; on both sides \nit was 'a bourgeois, imperialist, dynastic' conflict.  Its origins, \naccording to Lenin, lay in the international struggle for markets; it \nwas also an attempt to divide the international working-class \nmovement and to prevent revolution. Socialists ought to respond \nby preparing for a 'revolutionary war'. Workers of each nation \nshould be adjured to rise up against their national middle class. \n'Centrists' such as Kautsky who tried to bridge the rift between \nleftists and rightists in European socialist parties would fail; but \ncentrism itself was so damaging that its proponents should be refused \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nmembership of the Socialist International. The working classes of \nEurope had been misled; they had long been 'hostile to opportunism \nand chauvinism', but had been gulled into acquiescing in govern-\nmental policies through the connivance of social-democratic party \nleaderships. \nAmong anti-war Bolsheviks such words caused little dissension. To \nthem it was self-evident that the Second International's pre-war \ncommitments had been abrogated by its most prestigious leaders, and \nthat further collaboration, even with Kautskyite centrists, was \nintolerable. What caused controversy was Lenin's attitude to \nRussia. He summed up his position: 'From the viewpoint of the \nworking class and the toiling masses of all the peoples of Russia, the \nlesser evil would be the defeat of the tsarist monarchy.' The \nexceptional character of this sentence cannot be savoured unless we \nmomentarily suppress our hindsight about his later career. Here was \nan emigre revolutionary, lacking finances, organisation and person-\nnel, declaring to his colleagues that propaganda should be directed at \ntelling the largely patriotic population in Russia to welcome the \ncountry's conquest. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either. \nLike many socialists of the Russian empire, Lenin had advocated \n'defeatism' in the Russo-Japanese war of -. His prediction \nthat defeats would induce revolutionary crisis had been correct. He \nrepeated it in , but there was a significant difference in the \ncircumstances: nobody in  expected the Japanese, if victorious, \nto occupy Russia. German war aims in  were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. \nSecret treaties were, in fact, signed in . The Central Powers \ndecided that Austria-Hungary would obtain a sphere of influence in \nsouth-eastern Europe while Germany would acquire one in Russia; \nTurkey would be rewarded by annexations in Romanov lands \nadjacent to the Ottoman empire. The Allies made agreements which \nwere also rapacious. Russia signed a treaty to take over the Straits of \nDardanelles and the British and French conspired to break up the \nHabsburg empire and to rob Germany of her colonies. Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov. And yet Lenin remained willing to \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \ncall for Russia's defeat even though he repeatedly asserted, with the \nmechanical reliability of a gramophone, that all belligerent states \nwere bent upon territorial expansion and political and economic \ndominion. No wonder Lenin's differential attitude to the Russian \nand German war effort policy was regarded as illogical by Bolshevik \nactivists who read his writings or listened to him in Switzerland. \nLenin's chance to argue for his eccentric notions came on  \nSeptember when the Bern section's members had arranged a meet-\ning. There were so few of them that they could easily have met in \nsomeone's flat; but such was their edginess that, in contrast with their \npre-war practice in Switzerland, they convened secretly in some \nwoods outside the city. It was as if they were in autocratic Russia, \nnot democratic and tolerant Switzerland. No advertisement of the \nmeeting was made. The presence of Bolshevik Duma deputy F. M. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character. \nNo definitive decision on policy, of course, could be taken by the \nBolsheviks of Bern alone; but Samoilov's attendance gave Lenin a \nchance to relay his policies back to Russia. In fact, the other five \nBolshevik Duma deputies, quite without Lenin's intervention, had \nbehaved with commendable adherence to the spirit of Stuttgart and \nBasle by demonstratively walking out of the State Duma session \nwhich voted war credits to the Russian government on  July \n. Menshevik deputies also had opposed the Russian declara-\ntion of war and left the chamber. A joint criticism by Menshevik and \nBolshevik deputies was read out by the Menshevik, V.I. Khaustov. \nLike the revolutionary emigres, however, the Bolsheviks in Russia \nhad to elaborate policy for the duration of the war. Samoilov's return \nto St Petersburg with Lenin's recommendations inevitably caused \ncontroversy. It was decided that a survey of Bolshevik opinion \nthrough the enipire was needed. Leading Bolsheviks in the capital \nwere known to take an anti-war line. But Lenin's defeatist demands \nwere contentious. A meeting of the Duma deputies and other \nBolshevik leaders, including Kamenev, was held at Ozerki outside \nSt Peterburg. But the Okhrana broke up the discussions on  \nNovember, found incriminating material (which included Lenin's \nrecommendations) and arrested all participants. At the subsequent \ntrial, in February , Kamenev disowned Lenin's defeatism. \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nBolshevik Duma deputies such as G.l. Petrovski and M. K. \nMuranov refused to break ranks; and Lenin's regret at their exile \nto Siberia was alleviated at least somewhat by the evidence that \nBolsheviks in Russia were ready to take a stand on their anti-war \nprinciples.  \nIn October , Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks.  Plans were made, with the assistance of \nV. A. Karpinski, to revive Social-Democrat. Finances were still tight, \nand only around  copies could be printed: each issue amounted \nto only two sides of a single sheet of paper. Most copies, moreover, \nwere sent to addresses in western and central Europe.  Communica-\ntion with Russia remained hazardous. Even so, a few copies reached \nPetrograd. The first wartime issue of Social-Democrat, no. , was \nmade on  November. The front page included a manifesto on the \nparty's attitude to the war. The Bolshevik central emigre apparatus \nhad rapidly begun to re-emerge. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia? Karpinski \nalso queried Lenin's rhetoric. Was it fair, he asked, to describe the \nRussian armies as 'Black Hundred bands'. Did Lenin really contend \nthat all Russian soldiers, conscripted from the peasantry and the \nworking class, were like the reactionary antisemitic thugs of the pre-\nwar Black Hundreds? Lenin excised the slur from his statements. \nMore importantly, he ceased to advocate 'defeatism' exclusively for \nRussia. He still suggested in Social-Democrat that the Russian regime \nwas the worst of Europe's regimes and that Russia's defeat was more \ndesirable than that of any other nation.  But he also declared that \nsocialists of every country should call for their respective govern-\nment's military defeat.  Thus Lenin urged multilateral defeatism. \nThis exculpated him of the charge that his internationalism was \nbelied by anti-Russianism, but it exposed him to the accusation of \nmisunderstanding how wars are waged. How could all governments \nbe simultaneously defeated? Lenin brushed the question aside. \nInstead he insisted that defeat for any nation was likely to engender \nrevolution. The objective, then, was not military defeat for its own \nsake but the creation of conditions for a political upheaval. Socialist \nseizures of power would become possible.  \nLenin added that the politics of each belligerent state had become \ninextricably linked to the politics of all the others. Socialism could \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'.  The introduction of socialism had to be conceived in \nterms of Europe as a whole. The struggle would ultimately be fought \nbetween the Continent's working classes and its middle classes, and \nnational borders would mean nothing in such conflicts: class war \nwould envelop Europe. Before , Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. He \nhad not specified what this would involve. In  his meaning \nbecame clearer as he proposed a new slogan: European civil war! \nPlekhanov treated such proposals as the product of a deranged \nmind. He did not deign to examine the practical details, or rather the \nlack of them. For Plekhanov, Lenin had become an insane sloganeer \ninstead of a serious politician. But if Plekhanov would not argue with \nLenin, Lenin relished the chance to debate with Plekhanov, who \ntravelled from France on  October  to address a Russian \nemigre gathering in Lausanne. Lenin attended, and not wanting \nPlekhanov to withdraw because of his presence, he buried his face in \nsome papers at the back of the hall until the proceedings began. \nPlekhanov's speech lasted an hour and a half. At its end, Lenin stood \nup to denounce what he regarded as mere chauvinism and to claim \nthat Plekhanov had parted company forever with Marxism. The \nsignificance of the confrontation was considerable. This was the first \ntime that Lenin had shown unconditional disrespect to Plekhanov to \nhis face and at a public meeting. His aggressiveness was not \nconfined to Russians. He no longer had the slightest respect for \nany leading Marxist in Europe. He lashed out at the German \nSocial-Democratic Party, and named names. Kautsky's refusal to \ncondemn Kaiser Wilhelm, according to Lenin, was as heinous as \nPlekhanov's argument in favour of Russian national self-defence. \nAnother precedent had been set. For the first time, apart from small \ngatherings of Bolsheviks, Lenin had publicly castigated Karl \nKautsky. A psychological Rubicon had been crossed. \nIt was Lenin's extremism that resulted in his Bolshevik friends \nremaining isolated from other Russian Marxists in emigration who \nequally abhorred Plekhanov's 'defencism'. Martov and Trotski in \nParis were among these. Lenin declared his opinion frankly: 'It \nwould not be a bad thing if the Germans took Riga, Tiflis and \nHelsingfors!' They too expected the war to induce Europe's long-\nawaited socialist revolution. Lenin did not initially oppose a \nrapprochement. He remarked of Martov: 'This writer is now doing \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nwhat a social-democrat should do.' Praise indeed, by Lenin's stand-\nards. Martov must have pinched himself to check that he was not \nhallucinating. Lenin also dubbed Golos ('The Voice') as the best in \nEurope. Again, Martov must have blinked in astonishment. \nBut there was a snag. Martov and Trotski rejected any call upon \nworkers in Russia and elsewhere to work for the military defeat of \ntheir respective countries as unrealistic. They urged a more flexible \npolicy. Both men saw that the popular desire for peace in Europe \nwould strengthen as the rigours of war worsened; and they wanted \nsocial-democrats to join all movements, socialist or not, that \nexpressed this desire. Martov in particular had a profounder \nunderstanding of the barbarism unleashed by the war. Lenin's \nalmost puerile stridency about 'European civil war' had no echo in \ntheir statements. More particularly, Martov and Trotski did not \ndespair of winning over other socialists who did not yet directly \noppose their governments. Kautsky, for them, was not yet a lost \nsoul. N. S. Chkheidze, leader of the Menshevik Duma fraction, was \nequally keen to avoid a premature split in the ranks of European \nsocialism. The Menshevik Duma deputies, unlike their Bolshevik \ncounterparts, were not arrested; and it irritated Lenin that Chkheidze \nretained opportunities for legal propaganda. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. The fact that neither Chkheidze nor \nMartov would break organisational ties with straightforward \n'defencists' such as P. P. Maslov confirmed Lenin's inclination to \nreject all thought of negotiating with the Mensheviks.  \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats. Social-Democrat was designated as the organ of the Central \nCommittee. Lenin turned the paucity of surviving Central Committee \nmembers to his advantage. He tacitly reasoned that he and Zinoviev, \nif only they remained at liberty, were perfectly entitled to set up a \nnew central newspaper howsoever they wanted. For the same reason, \nno doubt, he was in no hurry to co-opt new Central Committee \nmembers. He and Zinoviev could cheerfully continue to call \nthemselves the Foreign Bureau of the Central Committee and take \ndecisions in the Central Committee's name. Lenin also aimed to \nhave tight control over the Committee of the Foreign Organisation. \nIts fund-raising and co-ordinating functions would be useful: and \npresumably Lenin did not want it to emerge as a rival Bolshevik \nbody. Its collapsed condition made this easier. He therefore planned \nto call a conference of all Bolshevik foreign sections in Bern in \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nFebruary  and secure the re-election of the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation.  \n'THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL' \nLenin was signalling, for the first time in his career, that the \nestablishment of socialism in Europe's advanced industrial countries \nhad become an immediate possibility and objective. He did not say \nwhy he came to this attitude, and he may well have made up his mind \nbefore defining what objective circumstances encouraged this optim-\nism. It was to his notebooks, as late as -, that he confided \nsuch thoughts.  In the meantime, he worked to found a Third \nInternational and to win socialist allies in Europe. Two major \npamphlets were written. The first was The Collapse of the Second \nInternational. Published in early June , it attacked the positions \nof Martov, Trotski and Kautsky. Lenin kept track of Kautsky's \narticles, and incorporated further criticisms as he composed both \npamphlets. Kautsky had allegedly brought about 'an unheard-of \nprostitution' of Marxism and was a Miidchen fiir alle. The second \npamphlet, Socialism and the War, was co-authored in August  \nwith Zinoviev. Again, the imagery was florid with sexual innuendo; \nLenin was not so prim in print as in his outward behaviour. Collapse \nof the Second International stated the formal case that the parties of \nthe Second International at Stuttgart in  and at Baste in  \nhad undertaken to oppose their countries' entry into a continental \nwar, and to use any such military conflict for 'the acceleration of the \nfall of capitalism'. This commitment, according to Lenin, had been \ninfringed. He indicated that the Basle Manifesto had been composed \nwith precisely the kind of war which broke out in  in mind. The \nwar was not a traditional struggle for national independence or for a \nlimited redrawing of territorial boundaries. It was 'imperialist'; it was \na fight to the death between two armed coalitions of powers bent \nupon global domination.  The talk of the Allies about the need to \nliberate Belgium was rhetoric. Germany's communiques about her \ndesire to assist Austria-Hungary in her legitimate wish to fend off \nSerbian aggression was eyewash: the war was about worldwide \npolitical and economic hegemony.  \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nby events in July-August . Supposedly, revolution in Europe \nhad been possible. There had been a 'crisis' in governing circles; there \nhad been a sharp worsening of material conditions; there had been a \n'raising of the activism of the masses'.  This analysis suffered from \ncertain defects. Neither at Stuttgart nor even at Basle had the Second \nInternational stipulated unconditionally that a declaration of war \nshould be met by the immediate organisation of a revolution.  \nConsequently, Lenin could not nail down his specific charges. But he \nwas correct in Jess formal terms: the Basle Manifesto had certainly \ngiven the impression that the parties belonging to the Second \nInternational would oppose all governments daring to plunge the \nContinent into war. The voting of war credits was an unmistakable \ninfraction of the International's decision. A minority of Europe's \nsocialists had sustained the line of International; the majority, as \nLenin increasingly pointed out, had broken it. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed. Undoubtedly there was political \ntrouble for the Russian imperial authorities, especially in St \nPetersburg, in the month before the declaration of war. But the \nunrest faded rapidly after the emperor declared war on Germany and \nAustria-Hungary. Still less was a revolutionary situation discernible \nin other countries. Neither the Allies nor the Central Powers \nexhibited serious tensions within their ruling elites. Nor was there \nmuch opposition to the national war effort among the various social \nclasses. On the contrary, it was a moment of near-universal \npatriotism in Britain, France and Germany; even Austria-Hungary \nexperienced little disturbance apart from among the Czechs and a \nfew other national minorities. The labour movement across Europe \nhad been active before  in strikes and protests; but calls and \nsupport for revolutionary action were remarkable for their scarcity. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before ; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. In fairness to Lenin, it \nmust be acknowledged that other groups were worse off and that \nstandards of living differed from country to country. But lower \nwages and poorer conditions do not demonstrate the existence of a \nrevolutionary situation. Lenin's assertions were based on inadequate \nsociology and shaky argumentation. \nHis commentary on the German Social-Democratic Party, too, was \nunreliable. He did not bother with the ascendant party leaders who \nvoted in favour of war credits in the Reichstag; for him, they were \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nbeneath contempt. Lenin was instead infuriated with Kautsky, Haase \nand their 'centrist' colleagues who refused to break unequivocally \nwith the rest of their party. Kautsky felt that a summons to the \nGerman workers to take to the streets would fall on deaf ears; he saw \nno point in inviting arrest for an obviously doomed adventure. He, \nunlike Lenin, recognised the patriotic mood of the German working \nclass. \nIn addition, The Collapse of the Second International maintained \nthat Kautsky was merely trying to cast the blame on 'the masses'. \nOnly the party leaders, according to Lenin, were in a position to act \nwith sufficient knowledge and decisiveness in the swiftly-changing \nconditions of pre-war crisis. The masses could not act if firm \nguidance failed to be supplied. The difficulties for the workers \nbecame greater once war had been declared: censorship was \nimposed; conscription was introduced, and the penalty for disobe-\ndience was death. Other Russian Marxists, however, believed that \nLenin and Zinoviev idealised German working-class attitudes. \nAccording to the right-wing Menshevik, P. P. Maslov, the German \ngovernment could count on most German social-democrats to \napprove of expansionist war policies; and his left-wing Menshevik \ncolleague A. S. Martynov added that the notion that German \nworkers were infused with revolutionary zeal was the result of \nlooking at Germany with spectacles tinted with 'Jacobinism' and \n'oriental messianism'.  Plekhanov highlighted how isolated the \nGerman far-left socialists under Karl Liebknecht were in the Ger-\nman Social-Democratic Party, and he suggested that German \nsocialism's doctrines would quickly be 'revised' in favour of a more \nexplicit nationalism in the event of a German victory in the war. \nOther leaders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, such \nas Trotski and Bukharin, were less scathing about the German \nworkers and maintained faith in the imminence of a German \nsocialist revolution.  Yet they also perceived that patriotic support \nfor the war effort was a serious impediment to the achievement of \nthat objective. Lenin referred to the problem only glancingly; the \ngreater problem, in his view, was constituted by the sins of the party \nleadership. \nConsequently Lenin's demand for the abandonment of the Second \nInternational and the establishment of a Third had few supporters \noutside Bolshevik circles. Martynov declared that only political \n'sectarians' would delight in the Second International's permanent \ndemise.  Plekhanov was nearer to Lenin in washing his hands of the \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nSecond International; but Lenin could not found a Third Interna-\ntional with a Plekhanov, who stoutly defended the necessity for \nGermany to be defeated. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final. Here he borrowed \nseveral arguments from Robert Michels, whom he had mocked for \nyears.  Command over German socialism, according to Lenin, had \nbeen taken by the party's permanent paid officials; and he claimed \nthat these tacitly rejected revolutionary policies and had undergone a \nprocess of embourgeoisement. He refused to accept Michels's analysis \nin its entirety, and continued to scorn him in public utterances. \nLenin denied that all organisations, regardless of political orienta-\ntion, eventually give rise to bureaucratic practices in response to the \ntechnical requirements of fast, informed and co-ordinated decision-\nmaking. It was only the economic side of Michels's work that he \nincorporated; and he did this mainly by borrowing from the \nresearches of Grigori Zinoviev (who was less reluctant to acknow-\nledge his intellectual debt to Michels). Zinoviev alleged that the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party's officials were supported mainly \nby the skilled and better-paid workers, who outnumbered the \nunskilled in the party's ranks. Following Michels, Zinoviev added \nthat 'petit-bourgeois' recruits to the party, such as innkeepers and \nclerks, were a rising proportion of the membership. This whole \n'labour aristocracy' benefited from the German economy's expansion \nand objectively had a stake in the expansionist foreign policy \nespoused by Bismarck and his successors in Berlin. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in . \nReproducing the outline of Zinoviev's detailed sketch, Lenin \nsuggested that such socioeconomic factors explained the party's \nabandonment of revolutionary commitments and the implicit adop-\ntion of a strategy of peaceful and piecemeal reforms. The ascendant \nparty leadership called itself social-democratic. It was actually, in \nLenin's abusive caricature, a congeries of 'social-chauvinists'. It had \nbecome a 'political detachment of the bourgeoisie'. \nWhere Zinoviev and Lenin marched intellectually, not only \nMichels but also European social-democratic leftists such as Rosa \nLuxemburg and Anton Pannekoek had gone before. The rightward \nshift of the German Social-Democratic party was not imaginary. The \nquestion for sociologists today is whether a mainly economic \nexplanation is sufficient, and the answer must surely be no. At last \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done?. In organisa-\ntional questions he remained predominantly a practical political \nleader in search of practical solutions; the broader issues of \ncontemporary political sociology passed him by. His naivete pre-\nvailed for several further years, and in many ways never left him. \nNor, as regards the particular circumstances of the war, was he ever \nto admit that political constraints bore down heavily upon Kautsky \nand his colleagues in the conditions of state power and popular \nopinion of Wilhelminian Germany. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in . He wanted to \nstake out a political ridge to be won. He wanted to construct a \nbeacon for guidance to others. He exaggerated and distorted, and his \nzeal led him into simplistic intellectualising. In Socialism and the War \nhe made his objective explicit. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' . Under such a slogan, no \nnon-Marxist would belong. Not even Marx had required a self-\nprofessedly Marxist International, and only Lenin and friends \nsuggested the formation of an International which would exclude \nMarxists deemed to have incorrect opinions. \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS:  \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-, was \npleased. The first full year of war was nearly catastrophic for Nikolai \nII's government. The Russian armies advancing into East Prussia \nwere rebuffed. Catastrophe ensued at the battle of Tannen berg and a \nretreat deep into Romanov territory was undertaken. 'Russian' \nPoland was overrun by German forces; and Galicia, too, was \nreturned to the Austrians in summer . Disasters in the field \nwere compounded by difficulties in the factories. A shortage of \nmunitions was growing. And, after the initial rallying around the \ngovernment after the declaration of war, industrial conflict returned. \nThe emperor agreed to permit the establishment of 'war-industry \ncommittees', which would include representatives of both employers \nand workers. The intention was to surmount the technical impedi-\nments to factory production for the army's requirements, and to \nlessen the tensions which produced strikes. Not only liberal but also \nsocialist politicians exploited the committees for their own ends. \nEven so, the government's administratative problems compelled its \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nconsent to the establishment of a central organ uniting zemstva and \nmunicipal councils. Hospitals at the front line were set up from \nprivate charitable funds. Gossip about the empress Aleksandra's \nGermanophile leanings and unfounded rumours about her liaison \nwith the 'holy man' Grigori Rasputin spread everywhere. The Kadets \nand other liberals sensed their opportunity and demanded 'a \ngovernment of public confidence'; they especially sought the dis-\nmissal of the aged and reactionary premier I. L. Goremykin and his \nCabinet in favour of liberally-inclined ministers. \nThe emperor would not yield so much. He appointed himself \ncommander-in-chief in summer , taking full responsibility for \nthe war effort. The Eastern front steadied and became almost as \nstatic as the Western front; trench warfare techniques were employed \nwith efficiency. The factories increased production. The Kadets \ntalked subversively in private but acted loyally. The war-industry \ncommittees were shunned by the Bolsheviks; it was mainly the right-\nwing exponents of Menshevism, under Kuzma Gvozdev who joined, \nand these were committed to national defence. Industrial conflict \noccurred frequently in the last months of . But the Okhrana \ncoped adequately, strike leaders were arrested and Bolshevik party \ngroups were hunted down with notable zeal. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. The problem for them was to \ncommunicate with their fellow factionalists from abroad. In mid-\nOctober  Lenin had initiated a scheme whereby Aleksandr \nShlyapnikov, a Petersburg Bolshevik leader, would move to Stock-\nholm to operate as courier between Switzerland and Russia. \nShlyapnikov was an able underground organiser. He also had \nvaluable experience of working abroad, having been employed as a \ncraftsman in the Hendon aircraft works in north London. Towards \nthe end of the year, Shlyapnikov had written to Lenin revealing that \nsupport for his attitude to the war was growing among Bolsheviks in \nRussia. He made arrangements for the regular dispatch of Social-\nDemocrat to Petrograd (as St Petersburg was renamed, to avoid its \nGermanic linguistic connotations). Shlyapnikov also spoke at the \nCongress of Swedish social--democrats in November. Yet Lenin's \nhopes about Shlyapnikov were soon dashed. Shlyapnikov and his \ncolleague and lover, Aleksandra Kollontai, also asked Lenin to move \nto Scandinavia to facilitate better contact with St Petersburg. They \nthemselves went to Oslo and left the Bolshevik transport arrange-\nments in ruins. Communication with Russia ceased for weeks. At \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch a distance it was hard for Lenin to dissuade them from being so \nunco-operative (and he was subsequently, when it was too late, to \nrecognise the cogency of their request). \nThere were also troubles in the Swiss emigration. The conference \nof all the emigre Bolshevik sections, scheduled for the beginning of \n, was delayed by the 'uncooperative' attitude taken by a small \nsection living near the village of Baugy outside Lausanne. These \nincluded young theorists such as Yuri Pyatakov and Nikolai \nBukharin. While accepting many strategical notions put forward by \nLenin, they objected to his pre-war writings on national self-\ndetermination and disliked his neglect of the peace movement.  \nThey refused to attend unless Lenin guaranteed to give them the \nfloor at the conference to put their case. At last, on  February \n, the proceedings commenced.  \nIn general, the conference was a victory for Lenin. The war was \ndefined as imperialistic; all socialists were called upon to oppose their \ngovernments; multilateral defeatism was accepted as policy; and the \nidea that a democratic peace was achievable without revolution \nacross Europe was rejected.  These ideas were, in fact, acceptable \nto the Baugy group; and Lenin agreed to trim his proposals of the \nbits that offended them. Definitive resolution of the disputes between \nthem was postponed.  Bukharin and Pyatakov continued to argue \nagainst the right of national self-determination on grounds made \nfamiliar by Rosa Luxemburg. To their mind, in the age of \nimperialism, there was no possibility of a sealed-off national \neconomy; and, in the political sphere, the creation of new nation \nstates would only impede the spread of internationalist sentiments \namong Europe's workers. The Baugy Bolsheviks added an inflection \nto Luxemburg's argument which would have annoyed her. If national \neconomies were becoming inextricably enmeshed with each other, \nthen revolution in any single country would have immediate and \nprofound repercussions elsewhere. There was therefore no longer \nmuch point in Russian social-democrats emphasising the reforms to \nbe demanded when the Romanov autocracy should fall. Instead they \nshould take a European perspective and stress socialist objectives.  \nBukharin came perilously close to repudiating the old Russian \nMarxist premise that Russia's next revolution would be a 'bour-\ngeois' one. This, as yet, was heresy for Lenin.  \nYet Bukharin and Pyatakov did not carry the conference with \nthem; and Lenin had pragmatic reasons for not exacerbating or \nadvertising his conflict with the Baugy group. Bukharin and \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nPyatakov had independent financial means, and agreed at the \nconference to place them at the Central Committee's disposal. This \nwas a powerful incentive to Lenin to dispel fractiousness. In addition, \nBukharin disowned any aim to drop the demands for reforms \nembodied in the party programme since .  Bukharin, in his \nown view, simply desired a switch of the party's focus of work from a \nRussian bourgeois revolution towards a European socialist revolu-\ntion; he did not deny that the forthcoming revolution in Russia \nwould be bourgeois. Lenin was the sort of theorist who, in the \nMiddle Ages, would have become cantankerous about the number of \nangels who could stand on the point of a needle, but for once he saw \nthe sense in amicably talking matters over with Bukharin at \nleisure.  \nSocial-Democrat's future was secured. In  it appeared roughly \nonce a month. Fourteen issues appeared in , carrying twenty \nfour pieces by Lenin; he oversaw all stages of its production.  He \nhad none of the problems which had plagued him about Pravda. \nThere was even sufficient money to found a journal, Kommunist, with \nthe assistance of Bukharin and Pyatakov. Indeed it was more their \nproject than Lenin's.  Kommunist was intended to provide a forum \nof Marxist intellectual discussion and to attract participation from \nleft-wing, anti-war socialists from other countries. Articles were \ncommissioned from Karl Radek and the Dutchman Anton Panne-\nkoek. Such collaboration was crucial if Lenin's Bolsheviks were to \nappear as something greater than a tiny Russian sect. Bukharin was \nalso willing to help repair the damage done by Shlyapnikov's self-\nremoval. After the Bern conference of Bolshevik emigres, Bukharin \nmoved to Scandinavia.  In fact, Shlyapnikov quickly returned to \nhis transport duties. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. Yet a \nprice had to be paid. Scandinavia was bound to remain the main \nclandestine transit point for Bolshevik newspapers and correspon-\ndence en route to Russia; the linkmen and couriers for the Bolshevik \nCommittee had a marvellous opportunity to manipulate the Bol-\nshevik faction's activity. Perhaps Lenin trusted in Bukharin's \nmanifest good nature and continuing high regard for him. \nFurthermore, Lenin had other things to preoccupy him. He was \nnot alone in seeing the need for a European anti-war initiative; and, \nwhile he called for action, others acted. The International Socialist \nBureau was virtually inoperative. Based in Brussels until , it had \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. The dissensions besetting its \nmembers discouraged its secretary Camille Huysmans from holding \nmeetings.  The obvious tactic for Lenin and Pannekoek was to \ncreate their own international co-ordinating body. But the actual call \nfor this came from the Swiss socialist Robert Grimm and the Italian \nOdino Morgari. Martov had similar thoughts. In spring , \nGrimm announced the convoking of an anti-war socialist gather-\ning.  The location was to be the Swiss Alpine village of \nZimmerwald. A march had been stolen on Lenin. It was evident \nthat several non-Bolshevik Russian Marxists such as Martov and \nTrotski would also be invited. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. Lenin's joy at the news \nwas not undiluted.  \n'THE NOTEBOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY' \nLenin's expressions of pleasure in  were directed at matters more \narcane. He returned, after a break of half a decade, to his \nphilosophical studies. Day after day was spent in the Bern Public \nLibrary. He had been shocked that several theorists previously \nenjoying his approval had adopted policies on the war which he \ndeemed to be inimical to the traditions, commitments and interests of \nthe international socialist movement. Foremost among these was \nPlekhanov. When writing Materialism and Empiriocriticism in -\n, Lenin had been intellectually close to Plekhanov. His aim had been \nnot only to denigrate Aleksandr Bogdanov as a politician but also to \nindicate the kind of philosophy acceptable to Marxists: and \nPlekhanov's influence on Lenin's chapters had been strong.  Now \nPlekhanov represented everything Lenin found politically distasteful. \nLenin believed that 'correct' policy should stand upon 'correct' \npremises in philosophy, and he was moved to re-examine the \nphilosophical issues at stake. His present objective was to discover \nwhat misinterpretations of Marxian epistemology and ontology had \nprovoked the alleged political betrayal made by Kautsky, Plekhanov \nand other leaders of the Second International in . It was in \ncharacter for Lenin to jot this down, even in his private notes, in \nterms of the mistakes of others; at no point did he directly criticise \nhis own statements in Materialism and Empiriocriticism. And yet, \nimplicitly, the endeavour was also an attempt to see where he himself \nhad been mistaken. \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nShortly before the outbreak of war he had signed a contract to \nwrite a short biographical piece on Karl Marx and already planned \nto include a summary of Marxian philosophy. He began the work, in \npeacetime, in July .  The biography was completed by \nNovember; but Lenin had by then started to fill many new note-\nbooks on philosophy. He continued with this into . The main \ntexts he studied were works by Aristotle, G.W.F. Hegel and L.A. \nFeuerbach: all to trace Marxism to its theoretical underpinnings. \nThis, obviously, was not casual toil. He was serious enough about \nhis labours to read Aristotle's Metaphysics in a German-Greek \nparallel-text edition, checking the original Greek where the German \ntranslation seemed unconvincing.  Lengthy excerpts from Hegel's \nHistory of Philosophy and The Philosophy of History were also made \nby him. Altogether he filled twenty-three notebooks. Lenin, like most \nleading Russian revolutionary intellectuals, found such tasks of self-\neducation congenial (although few equalled his multilinguistic \ncompetence). Both Plekhanov and Martov re-engaged their minds \nwith philosophical issues after .  The fact that Lenin over-\nlooked the wartime writings of his adversaries indicates how deeply \nsubmerged he had become in his own theoretical quest. He was \nbehaving like a typical Russian revolutionary intellectual in setting \nhimself the objective of achieving a comprehensive 'world-view'; \npolitics alone was not enough. But his private delight in reading these \nphilosophers was paralleled by a commitment to publish his resultant \nthoughts. Contrary to a widely-held opinion, it is the merest accident \nthat the considerations in The Notebooks were published only \nposthumously. In  he had started to draft a forbiddingly \nsubstantial item, 'Towards the Question of the Dialectic.'  Had it \nnot been for his other concerns in  and the occurrence of the \nFebruary Revolution in , he would have tried to see it into the \npress. \nLenin impugned Plekhanov for attacking Kant's epistemology \n'more from the vulgar-materialist than from the dialectical-material-\nist viewpoint'.  Plekhanov had done a service, in Lenin's view, by \nattacking Kantianism. In fact, Plekhanov after  came to discern \nhealthy sides in Kantianism; he even praised the call for moral \nimperatives in politics, and claimed that Marx's deployment of terms \nsuch as 'duty' and 'right' had displayed the same attitude.  Lenin \noverlooked Plekhanov's startling change of heart. It fell to Martov to \nattack Plekhanov in the press for undermining the 'scientific' \nprinciples of socialism with its amoral notions of historical inevit-\n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nability and impersonal socioeconomic forces.  What Lenin held \nagainst Plekhanov was a mistake of longer standing: namely his \nneglect of the importance of Hegel. Lenin pointed out that Marxists \nin general had attended more to the writings of Feuerbach and G. \nBuchner than to the Hegelian dialectical method espoused by Marx \nhimself.  \nLenin chuckled at this discovery, making the following remark in \nhis notebooks: It is impossible to achieve a complete understanding \nof Marx's Kapita/ and especially its first chapter without first \nthoroughly studying and understanding all of Hegel's Logic. \nConsequently not one Marxist has completely understood Marx in \nthe past half-century.  These words have often been treated as a \nstupendously arrogant dismissal of other Marxists.  Such an \ninterpretation is not entirely accurate; for Lenin claimed not that \neveryone had no understanding whatsoever of Marx, but that no one \nhad 'complete' understanding. He did not despise previous \nMarxology in its entirety. Nevertheless he certainly hinted that only \nhe had the capacity to gain the necessary 'complete' understanding. \nArrogance enough, perhaps. Even so, he must also be given credit for \nperceiving that leading Marxist theoreticians after Marx and Engels \nhad not examined, nor even properly recognised, Hegel's influence \nupon Marx. According to Lenin, their philosophical outlook \nconsequently lacked dynamism, supplying a rationale not for \nauthentic Marxists but for those who were politically passive. The \nwritings of both Plekhanov and Kautsky could therefore be seen as \navoiding essential questions about how to transform the world. \nSupposedly they merely 'reflected' the world. \nHe omitted to specify that these objections could be levelled with \neven greater cogency at Materialism and Empiriocriticism. He was \nseldom lavish in purveying self-criticism, and his Notebooks contain \nno explicit explanation as to how his own views had changed. What, \nthen, did he find in Hegel? Very important was Lenin's examination \nof Hegel's ideas about cognition. Lenin altered his reflection theory \nof knowledge. In a striking rupture with Materialism and \nEmpiriocriticism, he declared that the mind was not akin to a \ncamera: 'Cognition is the reflection of nature by man. But it is not \na simple, not a direct, complete reflection, but a process of a series of \nabstractions, of the formation, of the construction of concepts, laws, \netc.; and these concepts, laws, etc. (thinking, science = 'the logical \nidea') also comprehend conditionally, approximately the universal \npattern of an eternally moving and developing nature.'  \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nThis inelegant declaration was an off-the-cuff note not yet refined \nfor publication; its galloping style gives a good impression of the \nexcitement experienced by Lenin at the time. He wanted to emphasise \nthat knowledge cannot be total, but only partial. Our concepts \ntherefore have to be 'hewn, chopped, supple, mobile, relative, \nreciprocally-linked, united in opposites in order to embrace the \nworld'.  This led Lenin to a further modification. In Materialism \nand Empiriocriticism he had written about the brain as an unme-\ndiated register of external phenomena. In his wartime notebooks, \nhowever, he accorded a more or less autonomous significance to \nconcepts and laws and categories, and dropped his previous analysis \nof human thought as a mere physiological reflex.  He stressed that \ncognition should be understood in terms not only of mind and matter \nbut also of concepts. Plekhanov had said this all along, and had been \nridiculed by Lenin's Materialism and Empiriocriticism for doing so.  \nNone the less, Lenin also went beyond Plekhanov in  by \nasserting that the validity of concepts and categories was testable \nonly by their usefulness when applied to real situations. \u00b7Practice' \nwas the sole litmus-paper test. This, according to Lenin, was Hegel's \nview; and a rereading of Marx's Theses on Feuerbach convinced him \nthat Marx himself had held the same opinion.  \nAn emphasis on practical experimentation was hardly new among \nRussian Marxists; it had been characteristic of Lenin's old philo-\nsophical adversary, Aleksandr Bogdanov, in Empiriomonism.  The \ncloseness of standpoint is still more remarkable when Lenin's \nreconsiderations about ontology are taken into account. Lenin now \nfocused on the universe's infinite complexity. Causality was not \nsimple: no phenomenon results exclusively from the action of any \nother single phenomenon. Instead the world encompasses innumer-\nable interactions in space and time, and the attribution of causal \ninfluences must therefore be exceedingly intricate.  \nBogdanov had elaborated his ideas from a dialogue between \nMarx's Theses on Feuerbach and the neo-Kantianism fashionable \namong many Austrian and Russian Marxists around the turn of the \ncentury. Lenin's philosophical development had taken a different \ntrack: through a rereading of Marx alongside a study of the works of \nHegel which had influenced Marx himself. Nevertheless the resultant \noutlooks are remarkably similar. A further contention of Lenin's \nreinforces this impression. Throughout his notes on Hegel, he \nenthused about what he took to be proof that 'leaps' take place in \nnature. At \u00b0 C, for example, water changes its quality and becomes \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nice.  The idea of 'contradictions' and 'breaks' and 'interruptions of \ngradualness' were brought to the forefront of Lenin's philosophical \nwork.  They had previously been evident mainly in his political \npractice and his political ideas; but they had been banished from his \nepistemological work. In the war, he brought his philosophy abreast \nof his politics. Bogdanov would no doubt have relished the spectacle \nof his opponent being drawn into a refutation of the very arguments \naimed at Bogdanov in . But Lenin's work was committed to the \npages of his notebooks. The rethinking of his epistemology and \nontology remained unpublished and was unknown to others. \nYet the shift in Lenin's thought did not occur on all fronts. Those \naccounts postulating a complete revolution in his philosophy after \n are misleading. For Lenin still detested Kant, and still used \n'Kantian' as a term of abuse.  He sustained his hatred quite \nwithout feeling obliged to re-examine Kant's works. Lenin at his \nbest was never more than a gifted reader of other philosophers' \nworks. He made no contributions of his own; and, as his continued \ncasual contempt for Kant indicates, his competence was patchy. \nImportant differences between the respective standpoints of Lenin \nand Bogdanov anyway remained. Lenin's publication of a second \nedition of Materialism and Empiriocriticism in  was not \nfortuitous.  Several tenets of his earlier book stayed intact in the \nNotebooks on Philosophy. Lenin's jottings reaffirmed the independent \nexistence of the external world. They also stated that man's abstract \nconceptions derive from 'a knowledge of the pattern of the objective \nlink of the world'.  (Let us remember that this infelicitous phrasing \noccurs in work-in-progress notes.) In addition, Lenin repeated that \nphilosophy was divided into two principal camps, materialism and \nidealism;  Bogdanov thought such affirmations to be neither \nprovable nor worthy of discussion. Lenin, moreover, continued to \ncategorise Hegel as a philosophical idealist while recognising his \nintuitive 'genius' and stating that Hegel had produced the 'embryos \nof dialectical materialism'.  Indeed Lenin declared, albeit to \nhimself: 'Intelligent idealism is nearer to intelligent materialism than \nis stupid materialism.'  But this was still far from being a \nwholehearted endorsement of Bogdanov's ideas. The old Lenin \nreappeared in his draft philosophical article of , when he \ntriumphantly proclaimed the attainability of 'living, fruitful, true, \npowerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge'.  \nWhen all is said and done, Lenin failed to achieve internal \ncoherence in his newer philosophical views. Accretion, rather than \n Ad Extirpanda \n \nbasic reconstruction, had taken place. The lately-added layers of \nthought display a greater awareness of epistemological subtleties. But \nthey are like a new wing built on to a house without thought for the \narchitectural strains imposed. \nThis matters for the fate of Soviet philosophy in ensuing decades. \nIn seeking to maintain the appearance of Marxist 'orthodoxy', \nwriters in the USSR through to the mid-s had to trace the \nlineage of their notions from Lenin. The fact that his ideas were left \nin such a hotch-potch makes them less restrictive for later Soviet \nphilosophers. Lenin's self-contradictions and explorations allow an \nastute scholar to select a wide range of ideas as sources of professed \ninfluence.  This is one principal reason why Soviet philosophical \ndiscourse has not been devoid of interesting and inventive qualities. \nThe Notebooks on Philosophy do not constitute even a minor intrinsic \ncontribution to twentieth-century epistemology and ontology. Nor \ndo they contain an accurate account of the history of European \nphilosophy.  In particular, the relationship between Hegel and \nKant is misrepresented. The two German philosophers, who were \ncrucial to Lenin's understanding of the continental tradition, were \nnever as distant from each other as he claimed. Nor did he pick up \nthe theme of 'alienation', developed by Marx on the basis of Hegel's \nideas. This brings us back to our point of entry. While exploring, \nLenin was bent on discovering what would be congenial for him. He \nsought and found a rationale for adaptability in politics. Lenin's \nphilosophical cerebrations did not precede and predetermine his \npolitics. No doubt there was some mutual influence between the \npolitics and the philosophy; but, in the main, it was the politics which \nproduced the philosophy, and not vice versa. \nFor Lenin, the toil in the Bern Public Library was well worthwhile; \nthe abundance of exclamation marks, whether in approval or \nexasperation, are sure signs that he was invigorated by the \nexperience. He also gained reassurance. His reading convinced him \nthat it was not sensible to expect to make no mistakes as a leader. \nThis opinion is offered towards the end of the Notebooks, coming as \na tangential remark in his commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics: \n'The approach of mind (man) to a particular thing is ... complex, \ndivided, zigzaggish, including within itself the possibility of a flight of \nfantasy from life ... It is stupid to deny the role of fantasy even in \nthe strictest science.'  This is reminiscent of Lenin's invocation in \nWhat Is To Be Done?: 'It is necessary to dream.'  But he went \nfurther in . He referred to a statement by the Russian democrat \n  \nLenin: A Political Life \nD. A. Pisarev of the mid-nineteenth century that even 'a bad dream \ncan have its uses' . Pisarev's meaning was that a man's vision, even \nif proved wrong by experience, may have brought about practical \nhuman benefit before its incorrectness is demonstrated. Here was \nconfirmation of the need to take risks, to take a gamble. Here was a \nframe of mind which sustained a lonely politician, far from home and \ndistant from power; and which, in , left him uninhibited in \npromoting his party's seizure of the reins of government. \n"
